to help assess the overall effectiveness of ftc's funeral rule enforcement strategy , we recommend that the chairman of ftc ( 1 ) review possible approaches to determine the most cost - effective means for ftc to conduct sweeps that would result in both a more convincing sample of funeral providers and a broader analysis of the various requirements of the funeral rule and ( 2 ) develop and implement a plan for carrying out such an approach in a systematic manner .
