international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) safeguards are a cornerstone of u.s. and international efforts to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation .
as you requested , this report ( 1 ) describes the changes iaea is undertaking to strengthen its safeguards program , ( 2 ) assesses the reasonableness of iaea's assumptions regarding the impact of these changes on program costs and efficiency , and ( 3 ) comments on the extent of iaea's reliance on the united states to finance the agency's safeguards activities .
since the early 1970s , the international community has relied on iaea safeguards to independently verify that non - nuclear weapon states are complying with their obligations under the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons ( npt ) not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .
while iaea has conducted some preliminary planning for implementing certain aspects of the new system , iaea does not know whether in the long run it can implement the new system with existing resources because it has not developed a long - term plan that ( 1 ) identifies the total resource requirements for implementing the new measures , ( 2 ) provides an implementation schedule with milestones for equipment and estimated projections for adoption of the additional protocol , or ( 3 ) establishes criteria for assessing the effectiveness of the new measures and whether they could be used to reduce inspection efforts .
