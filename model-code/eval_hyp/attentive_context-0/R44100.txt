congress is deeply divided over implementation of the affordable care act ( aca ) , which president obama signed into law in march 2010 .
in addition to their attempts to repeal or amend the aca through authorizing legislation , lawmakers have used the annual appropriations process in an effort to eliminate funding for the aca's implementation and address other concerns they have with the law .
since the aca's enactment , lawmakers opposed to specific provisions in the aca or the entire law have repeatedly debated its implementation and considered bills to repeal , defund , delay , or otherwise amend the law .
in october 2013 , disagreement between the house and senate over the inclusion of aca language in a temporary spending bill for the new fiscal year ( i.e. , fy2014 ) resulted in a partial shutdown of government operations that lasted 16 days .
over the past six years , the republican - led house has passed numerous aca - related bills , including legislation that would repeal the entire law .
however , a few bills to amend specific elements of the aca that attracted sufficiently broad and bipartisan support were approved by both the house and the senate and signed into law .
