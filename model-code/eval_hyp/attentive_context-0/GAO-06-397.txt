servicemembers returning from the military conflicts in afghanistan and iraq — operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) , respectively — have engaged in intense and prolonged combat , which research has shown to be strongly associated with the risk for developing ptsd .
in this report , we ( 1 ) describe dod's extended health care benefit for oef / oif veterans and va's health care services for oef / oif veterans ; ( 2 ) analyze dod data to determine the number of oef / oif servicemembers who may be at risk for developing ptsd and the number of these servicemembers who were referred for further mental health evaluations ; and ( 3 ) examine whether dod can provide reasonable assurance that oef / oif servicemembers who need further mental health evaluations receive referrals for these evaluations .
to describe the mental health benefits available to veterans who served in military conflicts in afghanistan and iraq — operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) , we reviewed the department of defense ( dod ) health care benefits and department of veterans affairs ( va ) mental health services available for these veterans .
