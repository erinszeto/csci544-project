to better enable dod to manage its real property inventory effectively and efficiently , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment to establish a strategic plan as part of a results - oriented management framework that includes , among other things , long - term goals , strategies to achieve the goals , and use of metrics to gauge progress to manage dod's real property and to facilitate dod's ability to identify all unutilized or underutilized facilities for potential consolidation opportunities .
this report addresses the extent to which ( 1 ) osd has improved the completeness and accuracy of facility utilization data in its real property assets database , and the military departments use the data contained in their respective real property inventory databases to identify potential consolidation opportunities ; and ( 2 ) osd has a strategic plan to manage dod's real property efficiently and to facilitate the identification of unutilized and underutilized facilities .
since 1997 , we have designated the department of defense's ( dod ) support infrastructure management as a high - risk area , in part due to the challenges dod faces in reducing excess and obsolete infrastructure .
