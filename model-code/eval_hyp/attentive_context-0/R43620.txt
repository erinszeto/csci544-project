a central american nation with a population of about 3.8 million , panama has made notable political and economic progress since the december 1989 u.s. military intervention that ousted the military regime of general manuel antonio noriega from power .
panama's largely services - based economy has been booming in recent years , spurred on by the panama canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is expected to be completed in early 2016 .
the intervention was the culmination of two and a half years of strong u.s. pressure against the de facto political rule of noriega , commander of the panama defense forces .
since that time , the country has had five successive elected civilian governments , and a sixth is scheduled to assume power on july 1 , 2014 with the inauguration of current vice president juan carlos varela as president .
the endurance of elected civilian democracy in panama for almost 25 years is a significant departure from the country's previous 21-year history of military rule .
current president ricardo martinelli , elected in 2009 , remained generally popular during his presidency despite criticism at various junctures for his combative style of governing .
