in order to enhance medicare's program integrity , congress may wish to amend the social security act to ( 1 ) permit the reassignment of benefits to staffing companies that retain contractor physicians to treat medicare beneficiaries so that cms may enroll these companies if they meet appropriate criteria and ( 2 ) require these staffing companies to seek enrollment in medicare .
in 2000 , medicare — the federal health insurance program that serves the nation's elderly and disabled — paid for about 16 million visits to hospital emergency departments .
to facilitate improvements in program integrity , the cms administrator should propose legislation permitting the reassignment of benefits to staffing companies that retain contractor physicians to treat medicare beneficiaries and requiring that these companies seek enrollment in medicare .
these staffing companies submit claims to medicare on behalf of their contractor physicians , who are entitled to direct payment for their services to medicare beneficiaries .
as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , we examined emergency department billings and focused this report on ( 1 ) whether staffing companies' contractor physicians bill medicare similarly to emergency department physicians with other affiliations , such as those practicing in partnerships , medical groups , or employee - based staffing companies , and ( 2 ) how cms's ability to monitor medicare billings has been affected by the lack of information linking contractor physicians to their staffing companies .
