this report addresses ( 1 ) the relationship between medicare snf payments and the costs of treating medicare patients in freestanding snfs , as well as the effect of medicare snf payments on the financial condition of these facilities , and ( 2 ) the relationship between medicare snf payments and the costs of treating patients in hospital - based snfs , as well as the factors that may account for cost differences between hospital - based and freestanding snfs .
the medicare , medicaid , and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 ( bipa ) directed us to examine the adequacy of medicare payments for snfs and the extent to which medicare revenues contribute to snfs' financial viability .
concerns about the financial conditions of some nursing homes have led to interest in using medicare payment policy to offset current or anticipated financial difficulties .
from the mid - 1980s through 1997 , medicare's spending for skilled nursing facility ( snf ) care rose at an average annual rate of 30 percent , making it one of the fastest growing components of the medicare program .
some of their high costs may also be due to differences in patients that lead to higher resource use and that are not captured by the payment system .
