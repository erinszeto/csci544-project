111-148 , as amended ) establishes a transitional reinsurance program that is designed to provide payment to non - grandfathered , non - group market health plans ( also known as individual market health plans ) that enrolled high - risk enrollees for 2014 through 2016 .
the third section discusses questions , including those raised by a 2016 government accountability office ( gao ) report , regarding the scope of hhs's authority to administer the transitional reinsurance program .
the transitional reinsurance program's aim is to protect against the potential incentive to increase premiums by offsetting the expenditures associated with high - risk individuals .
under the program , the secretary of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) collected reinsurance contributions from health insurers and from third - party administrators on behalf of group health plans .
