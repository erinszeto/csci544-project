although the department of defense ( dod ) produces the best weapons in the world , it has not been able to deliver planned systems on time and within budget .
while recent changes to dod's acquisition policy held the potential to improve such outcomes , programs have continued to experience significant cost and schedule overruns and performance shortfalls .
it is not unusual to see cost increases that add up to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars , schedule delays that add up to years , and large and expensive programs being scrapped after years of failing to achieve promised capabilities .
this report ( 1 ) identifies best practices of successful commercial companies for ensuring that they pursue the right mix of programs to meet the needs of their customers within resource constraints and ( 2 ) compares dod's enterprise - level processes for investing in weapon systems to these practices .
in fiscal year 2006 , the senate armed services committee raised concerns that dod's poor track record with acquisition programs was linked not only to the department's defense acquisition system ( das ) for managing product development , but also to the department's joint capabilities integration and development system ( jcids ) for identifying the warfighters' needs and the planning , programming , budgeting and execution ( ppbe ) process for allocating resources .
