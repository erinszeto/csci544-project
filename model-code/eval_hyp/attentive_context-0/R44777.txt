the trade facilitation agreement ( tfa ) , finalized in december 2013 , is the newest international trade agreement to enter into force at the world trade organization ( wto ) , after two - thirds of wto member countries ratified the multilateral agreement as of february 22 , 2017 .
this report discusses the tfa , its background and current status , potential impact on u.s. trade agreement provisions , plans for implementation , and relevant policy options for congress to consider .
the tfa is important to congress because it may affect u.s. trade flows , the u.s. economy , and international capacity building efforts .
part of the u.s. international trade commission's ( itc's ) statutory function is to examine the potential impact of trade deals on the u.s. economy for congress and the white house .
the united states is already in compliance with most measures represented in the tfa , and thus does not have to change its current practices to comply with the tfa provisions .
the tfa aims to reduce trade costs by streamlining , modernizing , and speeding up the customs processes for cross border trade .
eliminating or reducing inefficiencies at the border may facilitate trade by lowering costs for importers ( and possibly consumers ) , as well as exporters .
