for example , it established the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a semi - autonomous component of the department of energy ( doe ) that manages the nuclear weapons program ; established the nuclear weapons council , a joint nnsa - department of defense ( dod ) agency that coordinates nuclear weapons programs ; rejected a major facility to manufacture a key nuclear weapon component ; initiated and later rejected the reliable replacement warhead ; and directed nnsa , the government accountability office , and others to conduct studies on nuclear weapon issues .
congress has been deeply involved for decades in setting policy , providing funding , and supporting or rejecting programs for the nuclear weapons enterprise .
while u.s. policy is not to build new - design nuclear weapons for new missions , some argue that the capacity to manufacture new pits may be needed to extend the service life of certain existing weapons , to replace pits in deployed weapons that develop pit problems unexpectedly , and to hedge against possible geopolitical surprises .
specifically , regardless of what capacity is needed , and when , congress and the administration will need to decide among options .
