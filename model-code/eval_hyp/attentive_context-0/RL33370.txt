in 2006 and early 2007 , congress considered a number of issues relating to the andean counterdrug initiative , the u.s. assistance program to help colombia and its neighbors address drug trafficking and economic development issues .
these issues included ongoing concerns with the effectiveness of the program , funding levels , human rights , and the future of the program .
the bill authorized a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorist activities ; maintains the existing cap on military and civilian personnel allowed to be stationed in colombia ; prohibits u.s. military and civilian personnel from participating in combat operations ; and maintains reporting requirements relating to human rights and the conduct of u.s. operations .
both house and senate versions included conditions on assistance , similar to current law , regarding human rights , expanded authority for a unified campaign , a prohibition on combat , and the use of u.s. - provided helicopters .
the andean counterdrug initiative is the primary u.s. program that supports plan colombia , a six year plan developed in 1999 by president andres pastrana ( 1998-2002 ) of colombia , and continued by current president alvaro uribe .
since first approving expanded assistance to colombia for counternarcotics programs in 2000 , congress has included a number of conditions on u.s. assistance in both authorization and appropriations legislation .
