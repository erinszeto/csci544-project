this was a result of concerns that lower pork demand and production could reduce demand for other commodities , including u.s. feed grains and protein meals ( like soybeans ) , as well as other farm inputs .
initially , as domestic pork sales fell in response to the spread of the h1n1 flu , futures prices for corn , soybeans , and wheat declined sharply .
in its may 2009 outlook report , usda revised its second - quarter hog prices downward to reflect lower prices in april due to the negative effects of h1n1 flu virus .
in part because of the surplus situation , in may 2008 and march 2009 , usda announced that it would purchase $50 million and $25 million , respectively , in pork products for federal food and nutrition assistance programs .
in june 2009 , ustr reported updated estimates by the university of missouri , indicating that the u.s. pork industry could face losses of about $270 million in income in the second quarter of 2009 alone , based on market conditions in the first few days since the virus was identified .
specifically , nppc asked usda to implement a purchase program for $50 million of pork products to help boost cash hog prices ; to work with u.s. trading partners to remove all restrictions on exports of u.s. pork and pork products ; to develop a comprehensive surveillance program for early detection of swine diseases ; and to work to keep open the border between the united states and canada to allow for movement of hogs .
