on december 8 , 2011 , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) issued a draft report on its investigation of groundwater contamination near the town of pavillion , wyoming .
the scope of the investigation by the state would seek to address water quality concerns by evaluating the water quality of certain domestic water wells , the integrity of certain oil and gas wells , and the historic use of waste disposal pits in the pavillion area .
epa indicated that it would defer to the state of wyoming to assume the lead role in investigating drinking water quality in the area , and that the continuing role of epa would focus on providing technical support and input to the state .
although the epa draft report focused on one specific region where hydraulic fracturing was employed to enhance the production of natural gas , it has raised concerns about hydraulic fracturing practices in general , and whether epa's findings at pavillion are more broadly applicable to other regions of the country .
this crs report provides a synopsis of the statutory authority for epa's investigation under the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) , a summary of the primary findings in the epa draft report , and a brief discussion of issues raised subsequent to the release of the draft report by proponents and opponents of the use of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas development .
