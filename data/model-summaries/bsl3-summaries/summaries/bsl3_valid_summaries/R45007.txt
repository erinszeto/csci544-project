subsequently , on december 1 , 2016 , the department of justice ( doj ) , on behalf of dol , filed a notice to appeal the injunction to the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit .
the u.s. department of labor ( dol ) published an updated rulemaking for the overtime exemptions for executive , administrative , and professional ( eap ) employees on may 23 , 2016 , with an effective date of december 1 , 2016 .
on june 30 , 2017 , doj filed its reply brief in the case and requested that the court of appeals reverse the judgment of the district court ( related to the legal authority of dol to use salary level as part of the eap exemption ) but not rule on the validity of the salary level set in the 2016 rule .
in its ruling , the district court concluded , in part , that dol does not have the legal authority to use a salary level test as part of defining the eap exemptions .
however , on november 22 , 2016 , the u.s. district court for the eastern district of texas issued a preliminary injunction blocking the implementation of the rule .
