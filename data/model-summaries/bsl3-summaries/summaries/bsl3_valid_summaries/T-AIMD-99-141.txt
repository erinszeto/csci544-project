to address ace management weaknesses , we recommended that customs analyze alternative approaches to satisfying its import automation needs , including addressing the itds / ace relationship ; invest in its defined ace solution incrementally , meaning for each system increment ( 1 ) rigorously estimate and analyze costs and benefits , ( 2 ) require a favorable return - on - investment and compliance with customs' enterprise systems architecture , and ( 3 ) validate actual costs and benefits once an increment is piloted , compare actuals to estimates , use the results in deciding on future increments , and report the results to congressional authorizers and appropriators ; establish an effective software process improvement program and correct the software process weaknesses in our report , thereby bringing ace software process maturity to a least an sei level 2 ; and require at least sei level 2 processes of all ace software contractors .
through ace , customs intends to implement much needed improvements in the way it currently enforces import trade laws and regulations and assesses and collects import duties , taxes , and fees , which total $22 billion annually .
in light of ace's enormous mission importance and price tag , customs' approach to investing in and engineering ace demands disciplined and rigorous management practices .
