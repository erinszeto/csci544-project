specifically , this report provides federal officials' and stakeholders' views on ( 1 ) whether the privatization steps required by the orbit act have been implemented and whether there were potential inconsistencies between orbit act requirements and u.s. obligations made in international trade agreements ; ( 2 ) whether access by global satellite companies to non - u.s. markets has improved since the enactment of the orbit act and , if so , to what is this generally attributed ; and ( 3 ) if any market access problems remain , what role does the federal communications commission ( fcc ) have in addressing those problems under the orbit act .
because intelsat has not yet completed the ipo , some competing satellite companies have stated that the privatization is not fully complete .
in 2000 , the congress passed the open - market reorganization for the betterment of international telecommunications act ( orbit act ) to help promote a more competitive global satellite communication services market .
the orbit act called for the full privatization of intelsat and imposed certain criteria on the nature of intelsat's privatization .
in addition , you asked us to provide information related to the tax status of intelsat prior to privatization as well as the current tax treatment of multinational corporations .
