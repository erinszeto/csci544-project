concerned about the responsiveness of sec to these recommendations , you asked us to ( 1 ) describe how the on - line trading market has changed in terms of market volume and the level and nature of complaints ; ( 2 ) describe the actions industry regulators — sec , national association of securities dealers regulation inc. , ( nasdr ) ( a national association of securities dealers , inc. ( nasd ) subsidiary ) , and the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) — have taken to develop rules or guidance consistent with our recommendations ; and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which regulators can enforce these rules or guidance and the likelihood that regulators will be able to identify instances in which broker - dealers do not follow these rules or guidance .
we also made recommendations concerning operational capability , including that sec require broker - dealers with on - line trading systems to maintain consistent records on system delays and outages and their related causes , disclose the potential for service disruptions on their sites , and have adequate capacity to serve their customers .
individual investors made about one million on - line trades of equity securities per day during much of 2000 , yet the risks of on - line trading were not always disclosed on broker - dealer web sites .
