in relation to those responsibilities , i will also discuss the recent competition for c - 5 aircraft workload and our assessment of it ; the adequacy of dod's support for its determination that competing combined , rather than individual workloads of each maintenance depot is more logical and economical ; and concerns participants have raised about the upcoming competitions for the workloads at the air logistics centers in sacramento , california , and san antonio , texas .
first , within 60 days of its enactment , the defense authorization act requires us to review the c - 5 aircraft workload competition and subsequent award to the warner robins air logistics center and report to congress on whether ( 1 ) the procedures used provided an equal opportunity for offerors without regard to performance location ; ( 2 ) are in compliance with applicable law and the far ; and ( 3 ) whether the award results in the lowest total cost to dod .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss issues related to the public - private competitions for workloads at two maintenance depots identified for closure during the 1995 base realignment and closure process .
