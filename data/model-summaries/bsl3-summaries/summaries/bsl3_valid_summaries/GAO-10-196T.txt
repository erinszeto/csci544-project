our testimony , which is based on our prior work and updated with data from epa , provides observations on ( 1 ) epa's electronic product stewardship initiatives , ( 2 ) the extent of federal agency participation in them , and ( 3 ) opportunities for strengthening participation .
the purchase price of electronic products primarily reflects their technological capabilities ; it does not include all of the substantial costs that are incurred throughout the equipment's life .
agencies generally can donate their reusable equipment to schools or other nonprofit educational institutions ; give them to a recycler ; exchange them with other federal , state , or local agencies ; sometimes trade them with vendors to offset the costs of new products ; or sell them through the general services administration's ( gsa ) surplus property program , which sells surplus federal government equipment at public auctions .
this executive order , signed by the president on january 24 , 2007 , generally requires that each agency ( 1 ) meets at least 95 percent of its requirements with epeat - registered products ; ( 2 ) enables the energy saving features on agency computers and monitors ; ( 3 ) establishes and implements policies to extend the useful life of agency electronic equipment ; and ( 4 ) uses environmentally sound practices with respect to disposition of agency electronic equipment that has reached the end of its useful life .
