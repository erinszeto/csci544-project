the objectives of this review were to ( 1 ) describe the roles of the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) and others in developing and updating the pavement design guide and ( 2 ) examine the use and potential of a computer analysis method known as the nonlinear 3 dimensional - finite element method ( 3d - fem ) for improving the design and analysis of highway pavements .
dot's federal highway administration ( fhwa ) neither adopts the guide nor requires its use by states .
billions of dollars have been spent to construct these roads and highways , and preserving and maintaining them is estimated to cost billions of dollars more each year .
the national highway system encompasses about 155,000 miles of the nation's most important interstate , arterial , and major highways and freeways , which represents about 4 percent of the nation's approximately 4 million miles of public roads .
in 1995 , the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) estimated that the average annual cost to maintain overall highway conditions and performance for this system through the year 2013 to be $44.8 billion .
the current design guide and its predecessors were largely based on design equations empirically derived from the observations aashto's predecessor made during road performance tests completed in 1959-60 .
