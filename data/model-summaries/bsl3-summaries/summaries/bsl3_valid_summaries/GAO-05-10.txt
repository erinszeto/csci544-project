recognizing the navy's need to explore ways for improving the use of its surface ships and its plan for employing rotational crews on several types of surface ships in the current and planned force ( appendix i provides a description of all ships included in our evaluation ) , this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) has the navy systematically evaluated the feasibility , including the cost - effectiveness , of rotational crewing concepts for existing and future classes of surface ships ? .
to ensure that the nation's multibillion - dollar investment in navy ships yields the greatest possible benefits at the lowest possible total cost , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy to take the following four actions: systematically evaluate the feasibility and cost - effectiveness for current and potential application of several rotational crewing alternatives for its surface forces by establishing formal measurable goals , objectives , and metrics for assessing feasibility , costs , and other factors , including crew quality of life , and systematically collecting and developing complete and accurate cost data , including ship total ownership costs , in order to perform accurate cost - effectiveness analyses .
