since 2007 , the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) has amended certain national standards for traffic signs .
among the new standards were a measurable standard for the minimum level of nighttime visibility of traffic signs and a change in the lettering of street signs .
some agencies also confused the new nighttime visibility maintenance standard , which originally included deadlines by which agencies had to comply with the new standard , with the new sign - lettering standard , which did not have compliance deadlines .
dot extended the deadline for highway agencies to implement an assessment or management method for ensuring that their signs comply with the retroreflectivity standard to may 2014 , and limited the scope of that required assessment to regulatory and warning signs , rather than all street signs .
this report provides background for the nighttime visibility maintenance standard and addresses some of the issues that have been raised about this standard .
the 2007 amendment set a minimum level of retroreflectivity for signs and required state agencies to adopt a method to ensure that signs met that minimum .
some state and local agencies complained that the new standards would be relatively costly to comply with during a period when state and local finances are strained .
