since that time , the nrf has been the nation's core response document , providing a structure for the response to such disasters as the 2008 midwest floods and california wildfires , as well as hurricanes gustav and ike .
the revision of the nrp was also due to mandates in the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( p.l .
events such as the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and hurricane katrina of august 2005 , prompted congress and president bush to require the development of a plan for how government at all levels , and also the nongovernmental sector , should respond to all types of emergencies and disasters .
others might argue the nrf has yet to be tested by a large - scale disaster to form a clear picture of its effectiveness ; the only way to find out whether the nrf is an improvement over the nrp may be to subject it to a major catastrophe comparable to hurricanes andrew or katrina .
in january 2008 , dhs issued the nrf , which took effect in march 2008 .
pursuant to statutory requirements and presidential directives , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , an agency located within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , issued such a plan in march 2008 with publication of the national response framework ( nrf ) .
