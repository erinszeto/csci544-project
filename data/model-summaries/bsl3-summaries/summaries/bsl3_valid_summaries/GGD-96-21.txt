you specifically asked us for information on ( 1 ) how irs addressed the problems discussed in our december 1994 report on the status of the program and , if the problems persist , how they would affect final tcmp results ; ( 2 ) informational sources other than tcmp that irs could use to target its audits more effectively ; and ( 3 ) the relevancy of tcmp data for alternative tax system proposals .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine how irs addressed the problems discussed in our 1994 tcmp status report and , if the problems persist , how they will affect final tcmp results ; ( 2 ) identify informational resources other than tcmp that irs could use to target its audits more effectively ; and ( 3 ) assess the value of tcmp data for alternative tax system proposals .
this report responds to your september 12 , 1995 , request to provide information on the internal revenue service's ( irs ) taxpayer compliance measurement program ( tcmp ) for tax year 1994 .
irs still does not have a research plan .
for about 30 years , tcmp has been irs' primary program for gathering comprehensive and reliable taxpayer compliance data .
