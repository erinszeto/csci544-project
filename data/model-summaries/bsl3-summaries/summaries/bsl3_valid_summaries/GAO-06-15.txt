options for doing this could involve expanding the pma initiatives and standards to include either an additional governmentwide initiative focused on improving collaboration across federal agencies or additional agency initiatives focused on specific areas in need of improved collaboration ; expanding the standards for the pma's strategic management of human capital initiative to reflect the need for agencies to hold individuals accountable , through their performance management systems , for coordinating and collaborating within and across organizational boundaries in order to help the agencies achieve their mission , goals , and outcomes ; and supplementing the part guidance on interagency coordination with information about the collaboration practices in this report .
no overall strategy integrates the threat - reduction and nonproliferation programs of the department of defense ( dod ) , department of energy ( doe ) , and others , and the agencies' implementation of very similar programs has not always been well coordinated .
we also considered our prior work on how the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) can be used to identify opportunities for improved collaboration among federal agencies and on the role played by the office of management and budget ( omb ) — as the focal point for overall management in the executive branch agencies — in providing leadership and direction to federal agencies' collaborative efforts .
