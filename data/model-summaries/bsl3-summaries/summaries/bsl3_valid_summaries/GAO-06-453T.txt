finally , i will discuss the significance of reducing the tax gap and various means to achieve that goal , including measuring the extent of , and reasons for , noncompliance ; simplifying the tax code ; improving taxpayer service ; enhancing irs enforcement through the use of tools such as withholding , information reporting , and penalties ; leveraging technology ; and optimizing resource allocation .
the internal revenue service ( irs ) most recently estimated a gross tax gap that reached $345 billion for tax year 2001 .
irs estimated that it would recover around $55 billion through late payments and irs enforcement actions , resulting in a net tax gap of around $290 billion .
i appreciate this opportunity to discuss the annual tax gap — the difference between what taxpayers timely and accurately pay in taxes and what they should pay under the law — and how reducing that gap can help the nation cope with its large and growing long - term fiscal challenges .
the tax gap arises when taxpayers intentionally or unintentionally fail to comply with the tax laws .
underreporting of income by businesses and individuals accounted for most of the estimated $345 billion tax gap for 2001 , with individual income tax underreporting alone accounting for $197 billion , or over half of the total gap .
