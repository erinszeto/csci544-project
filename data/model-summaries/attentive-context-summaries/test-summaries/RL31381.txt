in the united states , data are collected on visa issuance and alien admission , both of which have strengths and shortcomings .
while the number of visas issued shows the potential number of foreign nationals who may seek admission to the united states , admissions depict the actual entries of foreign nationals into the united states .
thus , the level of net migration of nonimmigrants ( or the exact number of nonimmigrants in the united states at a given time ) is unknown .
the lack of an exit registration system in the united states makes an actual count of out - migration impossible .
the law and regulations set terms for nonimmigrant lengths of stay in the united states , typically have foreign residency requirements , and often limit what the aliens are permitted to do in the united states ( e.g. , gain employment or enroll in school ) .
the latest estimates of the number of nonimmigrants who have established a residence in the united states are also presented .
table 1 indicates whether the ina or regulations set any limits or requirements on how long nonimmigrants may stay in the united states and whether they must maintain a residence in their home country for each of the 87 visa classifications .
the following sections present both admissions and issuance data for analysis of nonimmigrants by category and by geographic region .
table 2 details whether there are any labor market tests or any limits on the numbers of aliens who can enter the united states according to each of the 87 visa classifications .
the two tables that follow , among other things , illustrate the complexity and diversity of policy on temporary admissions and the challenge for policy makers who may seek to revise it .
when a cell in the table is blank , it means the law and regulations are silent on the subject .
the admissions data , however , simply enumerate port of entry inspections , thus counting frequent travelers multiple times .
table 2 also presents dos data on the number of nonimmigrant visas issued in fy2009 .
