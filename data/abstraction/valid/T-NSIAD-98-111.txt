gao discussed the public - private competitions for workloads at two maintenance depots identified for closure , focusing on : the problems gao is having in obtaining access to department of defense ( dod ) information ; the recent competition for c - 5 aircraft workload and gao 's assessment of it ; the adequacy of dod 's support for its determination that competing combined , rather than individual workloads of each maintenance depot is more logical and economical ; and concerns participants have raised about the upcoming competitions for the workloads at the air logistics centers in sacramento , california , and san antonio , texas . gao noted that : its lack of access to information within dod is seriously impairing its ability to carry out its reporting requirements ; gao completed , with difficulty , its required report to congress concerning dod 's determination to combine individual workloads at two closing logistics centers into a single solicitation at each location ; if dod continues to delay and restrict gao 's access to information it needs to do its work , gao will be unable to provide congress timely and thorough responses regarding the competitions for the sacramento and san antonio depot maintenance workloads ; in assessing the competition for the c - 5 aircraft workloads , gao found that : the air force provided public and private sources an equal opportunity to compete for the workloads without regard to where the work could be done ; the air force 's procedures for competing the workloads did not appear to deviate materially from applicable laws or the federal acquisition regulation ; and the award resulted in the lowest total cost to the government , based on air force assumptions at the time ; for the remaining workloads at sacramento and san antonio , dod reports and other data do not support the defense secretary 's determination that using a single contract with combined workloads is more cost - effective than using separate contracts for individual workloads ; much remains uncertain about the upcoming competitions for the sacramento and san antonio depot maintenance workloads ; potential participants have raised several concerns that they believe may affect the conduct of the competitions ; one concern is the impact of the statutory limit on the amount of depot maintenance work that can be done by non - dod personnel ; the air force has not yet determined the current and projected public - private sector workload mix using criteria provided in the 1998 defense authorization act , but is working on it ; nonetheless , preliminary data indicates there is little opportunity to contract out additional depot maintenance workloads to the private sector ; another concern is the air force 's proposed change in the overhead savings the department may factor into the cost evaluations ; for the c - 5 workload competition , overhead savings were considered for the duration of the performance period ; and however , for the sacramento and san antonio competitions , the air force is considering limiting overhead savings to the first year and possibly reducing the savings for the second year .
