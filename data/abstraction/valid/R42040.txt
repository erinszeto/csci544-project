in advance of the expiration of the 2008 farm bill ( p.l . 110-246 ) , numerous proposals have been offered to revise the `` farm safety net '' for producers of crops covered by farm commodity support programs . farm safety net proposals by members of congress , the administration , and a number of farm and interest groups surfaced mostly during fall 2011 , when budget deliberations by the joint select committee on deficit reduction generated concerns that a new farm bill might be `` written '' or severely constrained from a budgetary perspective by budget negotiators , rather than by the house and senate agriculture committees . ultimately , the joint committee failed to reach a bipartisan consensus on deficit reduction . nevertheless , the joint committee process generated substantial movement toward reshaping the policy framework underlying the farm safety net and other major farm bill issue areas , such as conservation and nutrition . since early 2012 , legislation for the next farm bill has followed a more traditional process , starting with committee hearings prior to expiration of the 2008 farm bill ( generally september 2012 , but for commodity program crops , prior to the 2013 harvest ) . many proposals with policy changes and proposed cuts have been directed at commodity programs and crop insurance , because these programs account for the bulk of agricultural funding ( excluding conservation and nutrition programs , which are also considered part of the agricultural budget ) . commodity programs , crop insurance , and the recently expired farm disaster programs comprise the so - called `` farm safety net '' — the federal government 's suite of programs designed to support farm income and help farmers manage risks associated with variability in crop yields and prices . to generate budget savings and provide funding for proposed changes to the farm safety net , many of the proposals either reduce or eliminate direct and counter - cyclical payments . most proposals either leave the marketing loan program unchanged or retain it with modest modifications . several proposals would make changes in crop insurance , including cuts in producer subsidies . three major issues are embedded in nearly all farm safety net proposals : ( 1 ) how price ( or revenue ) protection is established ( i.e . , within - year versus averaging across multiple years or fixed in statute ) ; ( 2 ) at what geographic level — the farm level or a more aggregated regional level — program benefits are triggered ; and ( 3 ) whether the proposal addresses `` shallow losses , '' those not covered by federally subsidized crop insurance but paid by the producer via the policy deductible . additional issues include whether program benefits should be based on current plantings ( `` re - coupled '' ) rather than tied to historical plantings ( as done since 1996 under direct payments ) , and to what extent a revised farm safety net program is applicable to crops outside of the traditional farm program mix . the senate agriculture committee approved its version of the 2012 omnibus farm bill on april 26 , 2012 ( agriculture reform , food , and jobs act of 2012 ) , and officially filed the measure , s. 3240 , on may 24 , 2012. it overhauls the farm safety net by eliminating direct and counter - cyclical payments and establishing a new shallow loss revenue program . for the revenue guarantee , farmers are offered a choice of basing the guarantee on either historical farm or county yields . a separate insurance program is made available for cotton , and other changes are made to the crop insurance program that are designed to provide additional options to all crop producers , not just traditional farm program crops .
