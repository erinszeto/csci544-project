policymakers and defense acquisition experts have asserted that improved recruitment for the defense acquisition workforce is a necessary component for comprehensive acquisition reform . to help rebuild the workforce and enhance recruitment , dod has used several hiring flexibilities authorized by congress , the president , and opm in recent years . hiring flexibilities are a suite of tools that are intended to simplify , and sometimes accelerate , the hiring process . the impact of hiring flexibilities on recruitment and workforce quality , however , remains unclear . congress may consider three high - level questions regarding hiring flexibilities for the workforce : are flexibilities effectively improving the workforce ? . are the current number and type of flexibilities appropriate ? . what factors may impact effective use of flexibilities to improve the workforce ? . congress could consider several oversight options to help gauge and improve the effectiveness of flexibilities in improving the civilian defense acquisition workforce . such options might help congress determine whether flexibilities should be expanded or newly created , consolidated or removed , or otherwise restructured . congress could direct dod to provide data on the use of all available flexibilities to fill the full range of civilian defense acquisition positions , including any barriers to producing such data ; establish proxy measures for effectiveness related to employee quality ( such as employee timeliness in earning required certifications and retention and career progression rates ) and recruitment ( such as time to hire from the perspective of the candidate and job acceptance rates ) ; conduct a study that evaluates the effectiveness of flexibilities ; and improve the quality , clarity , and use of implementing guidance for flexibilities . at least 38 hiring flexibilities are currently available for the civilian defense acquisition workforce . according to dod , the following six flexibilities were used most frequently to fill external civilian acquisition positions between fy2008 and fy2014 : 1. direct - hire authority ( dha ) 2. expedited hiring authority ( eha ) for certain civilian acquisition positions 3. pathways recent graduates program 4. pathways internship program 5. federal career intern program 6. delegated examining authority the six flexibilities accounted for roughly 66 % of total external civilian acquisition hires between fy2008 and fy2014 ( i.e . , hires from outside the government ) . some of the flexibilities were available throughout the six - year period , while others were discontinued or established during that period . potential factors affecting the use of flexibilities include their structure , clarity of implementing guidance , establishment of new flexibilities , staff knowledge of appropriate use , budgetary constraints , and efforts to balance hiring speed with equity .
