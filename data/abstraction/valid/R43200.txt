water and energy are resources that are reciprocally and mutually linked , because meeting energy needs requires water , often in large quantities , for mining , fuel production , hydropower , and power plant cooling , and energy is needed for pumping , treatment , and distribution of water and for collection , treatment , and discharge of wastewater . this interrelationship is often referred to as the energy - water nexus , or the water - energy nexus . there is growing recognition that `` saving water saves energy . . energy efficiency initiatives offer opportunities for delivering significant water savings , and likewise , water efficiency initiatives offer opportunities for delivering significant energy savings . in addition , saving water also reduces carbon emissions by saving energy otherwise generated to move and treat water . this report provides background on energy for facilities that treat and deliver water to end users and also dispose of and discharge wastewater . energy use for water is a function of many variables , including water source ( surface water pumping typically requires less energy than groundwater pumping ) , treatment ( high ambient quality raw water requires less treatment than brackish or seawater ) , intended end - use , distribution ( water pumped long distances requires more energy ) , amount of water loss in the system through leakage and evaporation , and level of wastewater treatment ( stringency of water quality regulations to meet discharge standards ) . likewise , the intensity of energy use of water , which is the relative amount of energy needed for a task such as pumping water , varies depending on characteristics such as topography ( affecting groundwater recharge ) , climate , seasonal temperature , and rainfall . most of the energy used for water - related purposes is in the form of electricity . water - related energy is estimated to account for about 4 % of the nation 's electricity generation , but many data gaps exist . also , regional differences can be significant . in california , for example , as much as 19 % of the state 's electricity consumption is for pumping , treating , collecting , and discharging water and wastewater . energy consumption by public drinking water and wastewater utilities , which are primarily owned and operated by local governments , can represent 30 % - 40 % of a municipality 's energy bill . at drinking water plants , the largest energy use ( about 80 % ) is to operate motors for pumping . at wastewater treatment plants , aeration , pumping , and solids processing account for most of the electricity that is used . energy is the second - highest budget item for these utilities , after labor costs , so energy conservation and efficiency are issues of increasing importance to many of them . opportunities for efficiency exist in several categories , such as upgrading to more efficient equipment , improving energy management , and generating energy on - site to offset purchased electricity . however , barriers to improved energy efficiency by water and wastewater utilities exist , including capital costs and reluctance by utility officials to change practices or implement new technologies . topics for research to better understand water - related energy use include studies of energy demands for water at local , regional , and national scales ; development of consistent data collection methodology to track water and energy data across all sectors ; development and implementation of advanced technologies that save energy and water ; and analysis of incentives , disincentives , and lack of incentives to investing in cost - effective energy or water efficiency measures .
