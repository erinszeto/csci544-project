the role of natural gas in the u.s. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in the 114th congress . this report briefly explains key aspects of global natural gas markets , including supply and demand , and major u.s. developments . natural gas is considered by some as a potential bridge fuel to a lower - carbon economy , because it is cleaner burning than its hydrocarbon alternatives coal and oil . natural gas combustion emits about one - half less carbon dioxide than coal and one - quarter less than oil when consumed in a typical electric power plant , although fugitive gas emissions offset some of the advantages . natural gas combustion also emits less particulate matter , sulfur dioxide , and nitrogen oxides than coal or oil . additionally , improved methods to extract natural gas from shale formations have significantly increased the resource profile of the united states , which has spurred other countries to try to develop shale gas . if the united states and other countries can bring large new volumes of natural gas to market , particularly unconventional natural gas , then natural gas could play a larger role in the world 's economy . several key factors will determine whether this happens , including price , technical capability , environmental concerns , and political considerations . many countries , both producing and consuming , are watching how the development of u.s. unconventional natural gas resources evolves . key points natural gas is likely to play a greater role in the world energy mix given its growing resource base and its relatively low carbon emissions compared to other fossil fuels . the world used 122,442 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of natural gas in 2015 , of which the united states consumed 27,463 bcf ( the most of any country ) . world natural gas consumption in 2015 grew by 1.7 % , which was below the 10-year average of 2.3 % but above the 0.6 % increase in 2014 ; u.s. consumption grew by 3 % . u.s. unconventional natural gas reserves and production , particularly shale gas , have grown rapidly in recent years . the united states accounts for 89 % of global shale gas production . the new shale gas resources have changed the united states ' natural gas position from a net importer to a potential net exporter . other countries are now exploring their own shale gas resources . global trade in natural gas is increasing and new players are entering on both the supply side and the import side , making the global gas market more integrated .
