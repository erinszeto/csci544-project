federal complaint - handling , ombudsman , and advocacy offices have different forms , capacities , and designations . this report , which reviews the state of research in this field and the heritage of such offices , examines and compares them , along with recent legislative developments and past proposals to establish a government - wide ombudsman . in so doing , the report identifies the basic characteristics of these offices , recognizing differences among them with regard to their powers , duties , jurisdictions , locations , and resources , as well as control over them . this study covers only ombudsman - like offices at the federal level that deal with the public , sometimes known as `` external ombudsmen . . it does not cover `` internal ombudsmen , '' that is , offices created to handle complaints from employees and resolve disputes between them and management ; ombudsman - like offices in the private sector ; or similar entities at other levels of government in the united states or abroad , except to note differences among them . legislative interest , albeit sporadic , in establishing a government - wide ombudsman or standardizing individual offices across - the - board dates to the early 1960s . these efforts extended in the 1970s to proposals to establish an independent office of consumer representation or consumer affairs , a plan that president jimmy carter later endorsed . another initiative emerged in 1993 , when president william clinton — through an executive order `` setting customer service standards '' — directed executive departments and agencies to make information , service , and complaint - systems easily accessible and provide means to address such complaints . the order also called for agencies to set customer service standards , survey customers , report to the president on those surveys , and publish customer service plans . a subsequent government - wide customer satisfaction survey , incidentally , found a similar range of satisfaction between the private and public sectors . notwithstanding these efforts over the past five decades , no comprehensive , across - the - board transformations have occurred . nonetheless , numerous individual offices have been established , modified , and proposed by administrative directives , public laws , and congressional bills . this piecemeal approach — reflecting different demands in both the government and society over time and across policy areas — has resulted in a variety of ombudsman - like offices . although a complete , authoritative identification and description of current offices does not exist , a number of studies — from past and contemporary eras , along with the examples here — provide a wide sampling of complaint - handling and advocacy offices for examination and consideration as models . this report consists of three parts : ( 1 ) an analysis of the ombudsman concept and a brief look at which countries around the world have used ombudsmen ; ( 2 ) a breakdown of the various ways in which federal complaint - handling offices differ ; and ( 3 ) an identification and description of selected ombudsman - like offices , including specifics on their origins and operations . this report will be updated as events warrant .
