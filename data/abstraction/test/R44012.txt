tax expenditures — revenue losses associated with targeted provisions that move the income tax away from a `` theoretical normal '' tax system — are a long - standing feature of the u.s. tax code . in some ways , tax expenditures resemble direct spending programs . they both have similar budgetary effects and provide incentives that alter the allocation of resources . hence , tax expenditures , like direct spending , are one of the ways that the federal government plays a role in shaping the economy . tax expenditures , however , do not regularly receive the same level of scrutiny as direct spending programs . also , unlike direct spending programs , the revenue loss associated with most tax expenditures is only limited by eligibility — much like mandatory spending programs . a consequence of the limited oversight placed on tax expenditures is that activities may be supported by tax expenditures that have insufficient political support for funding through a direct spending program . during the last 40 years , the level of tax expenditures has varied both as a function of taxes collected and as a share of the economy . one possible explanation for this variability is that tax reform historically reduces the scope of tax expenditures , which otherwise grow . growth in tax expenditures has exceeded that of discretionary spending , but not mandatory spending , over the same time period . the revenue loss from tax expenditures is concentrated among a limited number of provisions , with 66 % of the revenue loss attributed to the top 10 tax expenditures against the individual income tax . in addition , the benefits of tax expenditures against the individual income tax are concentrated among upper - income taxpayers . a recent congressional budget office ( cbo ) analysis of selected tax expenditures found that 51 % of the benefits went to the top 20 % of taxpayers . tax expenditures are a common target when base - broadening tax reform is pursued — like with the tax reform act of 1986 ( p.l . 99-514 ) . this may be the result of tax expenditures being defined as being outside the normal tax code — making them a clear source for base - broadening . however , there are impediments to base broadening by eliminating or reducing tax expenditures , as some may serve important purposes , others are important for distributional reasons , and many are technically difficult to change or are broadly used by the public and quite popular .
