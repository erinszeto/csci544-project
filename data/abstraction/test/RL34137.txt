in the united states , the term `` big oil companies '' is likely to be taken to mean the major private international oil companies , largely based in europe or america . however , while some of those companies are indeed among the largest in the world , by many important measures , a majority of the largest oil companies are state - owned , national oil companies . by conventional definitions , national oil companies hold the majority of petroleum reserves and produce the majority of the world 's supply of crude oil . since national oil companies generally hold exclusive rights to exploration and development of petroleum resources within the home country , they also can decide on the degree to which they require participation by private companies in those activities . the national oil companies typically do not operate strictly on the basis of market principles . because of their close ties to the national government , in many cases their objectives might include wealth re - distribution , jobs creation , general economic development , economic and energy security , and vertical integration . although these objectives might be desirable from the point of view of the nation 's government , they are unlikely to be equivalent to the maximization of shareholder value , the stated objective of the private international oil companies . differing objectives might be considered to be important only if they lead to different characteristics and outcomes , which is the case for the national oil companies . many of these companies have been found to be inefficient , with relatively low investment rates . they tend to exploit oil reserves for short - term gain , possibly damaging oil fields , reducing the longer term production potential . some also have limited access to international capital markets because of poor business practices and a lack of transparency in their business deals . high oil prices since late 2003 have masked the effect of some of these characteristics in the flow of oil revenues . however , if the price of oil moderates , the potential supply constraint related to the inefficient operations of the national oil companies may be a destabilizing factor in the world oil market . a wide variety of policy directions can be taken to mitigate the potential challenge posed by the dominance of national oil companies . demand management policy can reduce the u.s. dependence on imports . the u.s. government can use its political influence to try to encourage nations not to use national oil companies to forward the aims of the government , but to follow commercial practices to maximize revenue flows . an expanded supply of oil could be encouraged as a condition for trade and aid agreements in some cases . finally , promoting international trade and recognized commercial practices could be encouraged .
