potential oversight questions for congress include the following: why did the estimated cost of a four - boat conversion program increase by more than 60% since 1999-2000 ? .

is the navy adequately funding programs for unmanned underwater vehicles ( uuvs ) and other advanced payloads so as to take full advantage of the ssgns' large payload capacity ? .

if a decision is made to reduce the trident ssbn force from 14 boats to 12 , what would be the potential costs and merits of expanding the ssgn conversion program to include two additional trident boats ? .

since the navy's plan for maintaining a fleet in coming years of 313 ships includes 4 ssgns , why does the navy's 30-year shipbuilding include no replacements for the 4 ssgns , resulting in the disappearance of ssgns from the fleet by 2028 ? .

how would a continuing shortage of advanced seal delivery systems ( asdss ) affect the operational utility of the ssgns ? .

the fy2009 defense appropriations act ( division c of h.r .

2638 / p.l .

110-329 of september 30 , 2008 ) approved the navy's fy2009 request for $3 million in other procurement , navy ( opn ) funding for the ssgn program .
