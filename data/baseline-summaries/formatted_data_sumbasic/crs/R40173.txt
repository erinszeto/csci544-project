the financial crisis that began in 2007 spread and gathered intensity in 2008 , despite the efforts of central banks and regulators to restore calm .

by early 2009 , the financial system and the global economy appeared to be locked in a descending spiral , and the primary focus of policy became the prevention of a prolonged downturn on the order of the great depression .

the volume and variety of negative financial news , and the seeming impotence of policy responses , has raised new questions about the origins of financial crises and the market mechanisms by which they are contained or propagated .

just as the economic impact of financial market failures in the 1930s remains an active academic subject , it is likely that the causes of the current crisis will be debated for decades to come .

this report sets out in tabular form a number of the factors that have been identified as causes of the crisis .

the left column of table 1 below summarizes the causal role of each such factor .

the next column presents a brief rejoinder to that argument .

the right - hand column contains a reference for further reading .

where text is given in quotation marks , the reference in the right column is the source , unless otherwise specified .
