this report provides background information and issues for congress on the lpd - 17 flight ii amphibious ship program .

the navy's fy2020 budget submission defers the planned procurement of the second lpd - 17 flight ii ship , lpd - 31 , by one year , to fy2021 , and requests $247.1 million in advance procurement ( ap ) funding for the ship .

this report also discusses lha - 9 , a different kind of amphibious ship that the navy wants to procure in fy2024 .

the navy's proposed fy2020 budget does not request any procurement or ap funding for this ship .

issues for congress include whether to procure lpd - 31 in fy2020 or fy2021 ; whether to procure lpd - 31 ( if it is procured in fy2020 ) with full funding or incremental funding ; the amount of procurement or ap funding to provide for lpd - 31 and lha - 9 in fy2020 ; and more generally whether the navy is placing too much , too little , or about the right amount of emphasis on amphibious ships in its fy2020 budget submission , particularly compared to other navy shipbuilding programs .

congress's decisions on these issues could affect navy capabilities and funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base .

for an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the lpd - 17 flight ii program and other navy shipbuilding programs may be considered , see crs report rl32665 , navy force structure and shipbuilding plans: background and issues for congress , by ronald o'rourke .

 table 4 summarizes congressional action on the navy's fy2020 funding request for the lpd - 17 flight ii and lha - 9 programs .
