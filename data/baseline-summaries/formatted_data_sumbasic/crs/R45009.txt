the national science foundation ( nsf ) supports basic research and education in the non - medical sciences and engineering .

congress established the foundation through the national science foundation act of 1950 to "promote the progress of science ; to advance the national health , prosperity , and welfare ; to secure the national defense ; and for other purposes. .

the nsf is a major source of federal support for u.s. university research , especially in certain fields such as computer science .

it is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) education program portfolio and federal stem student aid and support .

this report describes selected items from the trump administration's fy2018 budget request for nsf and tracks legislative action on fy2018 appropriations to the agency .

it also details selected measures proposed in the 115 th congress to authorize increases in nsf appropriations limits and presents information on historical funding for the agency .

nsf has six appropriations accounts: research and related activities ( rra ) , education and human resources ( ehr ) , major research equipment and facilities construction ( mrefc ) , agency operations and award management ( aoam ) , national science board ( nsb ) , and the office of the inspector general ( oig ) .

appropriations are generally provided at the account level ; program - specific direction may be included in appropriations acts or in accompanying conference reports or explanatory statements .

at times , authorizations and appropriations have been specified at the rra subaccount level , and nsf's budget justifications detail activities and obligations at that level .

the majority of nsf's primary mission activities are funded through rra , ehr , and mrefc .

nsf adopted its current appropriations account structure in fy2003 .

in general , nsf's accounts have been comparable since then .

for fy2017 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ) , signed by the president on may 5 , 2017 , provided appropriations at the account level .

congress also directed funding for a subset of programs within the rra , ehr , and mrefc accounts in the accompanying explanatory statement .

in this report , because nsf states that fy2017 amounts were not available when the fy2018 budget request was prepared , requested funding at the account level ( and program - specific funding , where directed by congress ) is compared to fy2017 enacted funding .

in contrast , requested funding at the subaccount level is generally compared to fy2016 actual levels .

the trump administration is seeking $6.653 billion for nsf in fy2018 , an $819 million decrease ( - 11% ) from the fy2017 enacted level of $7.472 billion ( see table 1 ) .the request would decrease budget authority primarily in three accounts relative to the fy2017 enacted levels: rra by $672 million ( - 11.1% ) , ehr by $119 million ( - 13.6% ) , and mrefc by $26.2 million ( - 12.5% ) .

the request would provide slight decreases to the aoam ( $1.5 million decrease , - 0.5% ) and oig ( $200,000 decrease , - 1.3% ) accounts .

the nsb account would receive $4.4 million , the same amount as in fy2017 .

as reported by the house committee on appropriations on july 17 , 2107 , h.r .

3267 , the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2018 , would provide a total of $7.340 billion to nsf for fy2018 .

this would be a decrease of $133 million ( - 1.8% ) from the fy2017 enacted funding level and an increase of $687 million ( 10.3% ) over president trump's fy2018 request .

the bill would keep funding for the rra , ehr , nsb , and oig accounts the same as the fy2017 enacted amounts , and decrease the mrefc and aoam accounts by $131 million ( - 62.8% ) and $1.5 million ( - 0.5% ) , respectively .

the text of h.r .

3267 was incorporated as division c into the omnibus appropriations bill , the make america secure and prosperous appropriations act , 2018 ( h.r .

3354 ) , and passed , as amended , by the house on september 14 , 2017 .

h.r .

3354 would provide the same total funding amounts for nsf accounts as provided in h.r .

3267 .

as reported by the senate committee on appropriations on july 27 , 2017 , s. 1662 , the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2018 , would provide a total of $7.311 billion to nsf for fy2018 .

this would be a decrease of $161 million ( - 2.2% ) from the fy2017 enacted funding level and $658 million ( 9.9% ) over president trump's fy2018 funding request .

compared to the fy2017 enacted level , this bill would keep funding for the nsb and oig accounts the same and decrease funding for four accounts: rra by $116 million ( - 1.9% ) , mrefc by $26.2 million ( - 12.5% ) , ehr by $17.6 million ( - 2% ) , and aoam by $1.5 million ( - 0.5% ) .

the continuing appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-56 , division d ) , signed by the president on september 8 , 2017 , provided funding for nsf at the fy2017 level through december 8 , 2017 , subject to a 0.6791% across - the - board decrease .

the further continuing appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-90 , division a ) amends p.l .

115-56 to extend funding through december 22 , 2017 .

the fy2018 nsf budget justification highlights many of the same programs as in fy2016 and fy2017 .

specifically , nsf identifies seven ongoing agency - wide investments that aim to bring researchers from different fields of science and engineering together to address cross - disciplinary questions .

compared to the fy2016 actual amounts , a slight increase in funding is requested for one of these initiatives — the inclusion across the nation of communities of learners of underrepresented discoverers in engineering and science ( includes , $15 million requested , +6.5% ) .

decreases of between 12% and 70% from fy2016 actual amounts are requested for the remaining six investments .

these include: cyber - enabled materials , manufacturing , and smart systems ( cemmss , $222 million requested , - 18% ) ; innovations at the nexus of food , energy , and water systems ( infews , $24 million requested , - 70% ) ; innovation corps ( i - corps , $26 million requested , - 12% ) ; risk and resilience ( $31 million requested , - 27% ) ; secure and trustworthy cyberspace ( satc , $114 million requested , - 12% ) ; and understanding the brain ( utb ) , $134 million requested , - 22% ) .

the committee reports to accompany h.r .

3267 ( h.rept .

115-231 ) and s. 1662 ( s.rept .

115-139 ) provide direction for one of these programs , recommending no less than the fy2017 level ( $30 million ) for i - corps .

nsf's budget request reports that three additional multi - directorate programs highlighted in prior years are ending in fy2017 .

the cyberinfrastructure framework for 21 st century science , engineering , and education ( cif21 ) program is sunsetting , though some of the program's activities will be incorporated into nsf's work on the national strategic computing initiative ( nsci ) and the harnessing the data revolution big idea .

the research at the interface of biological , mathematical , and physical sciences ( biomaps ) program is ending "as it has achieved its goal , leading to a cultural change within nsf cross - directorate collaboration [among the participating directorates] having become standard practice. .

though funding is concluding for the science , engineering , and education for sustainability ( sees ) program , nsf plans to continue investing in "research necessary for a sustainable human future" through other programs , such as the risk and resilience and infews programs .

the budget request also highlights nsf's 10 "big ideas," introduced by the agency in 2016 as long - term research and process ideas that identify areas for future investment .

the budget request includes various activities related to these ideas , though specific funding is requested only for the includes program ( $14.9 million ) .

research ideas include: harnessing the data revolution ; work at the human technology frontier: shaping the future ; windows on the universe: the era of multi - messenger astrophysics ; the quantum leap: leading the next quantum revolution ; understanding the rules of life: predicting phenotype ; and navigating the new arctic .

process ideas include: mid - scale research infrastructure ; nsf 2026: seeding innovation ; nsf includes ; and growing convergent research at nsf .

the committee reports do not specify funding for the big ideas .

broadly , both reports express support for such topics as scientific infrastructure investments , astronomy facilities , cybersecurity research , and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in stem .

the reports also encourage nsf to explore partnerships with the private sector in supporting various facilities , equipment , and programs .

authorizations of appropriations for nsf , which were last enacted in the america competes reauthorization act of 2010 ( p.l .

111-358 ) , expired in fy2013 .

various reauthorization measures were introduced in the 114 th congress that included proposed funding levels , but no authorizations of appropriations were enacted .

members of the 115 th congress have introduced measures that would address authorizations of appropriations to nsf .

the american innovation act ( h.r .

1569 and s. 641 ) , introduced as companion bills in march 2017 , would adjust annual discretionary spending limits for federal science agencies conducting basic research , including nsf , in fy2017-fy2021 to allow for specified increases in appropriations and would authorize appropriations at these increased levels .

the bills also specify that annual appropriations for nsf through fy2021 be at least the amount appropriated in fy2016 .

table 3 shows the fy2013 authorization levels , appropriations to nsf in fy2016 and fy2017 , fy2018 requested amounts , and proposed authorized maximum funding levels for nsf in fy2018 under selected measures from the 115 th congress .

the following sections provide information on authorizations of appropriations , as well as funding data and trends , since the foundation was established in 1950 .

to guide decisionmaking for funding reductions in the fy2018 budget request , nsf leadership applied an overarching set of principles , including continuing to fund all science and engineering disciplines , supporting early career scientists , protecting "core" research , and reducing some of the program budgets that have slowly scaled up over the past decade ( aka , accretions ) .

directorates then proposed strategic , prioritized reductions within their program portfolios .

broadly , the request reflects nsf's attempts to maintain an emphasis on cross - disciplinary programs and prioritize programs that will lead to longer - term progress on the big ideas .

as in recent years , policymakers are considering congressional funding directives for specific scientific fields within nsf's rra account .

h.amdt .

382 to division c of the fy2018 omnibus appropriations bill ( h.r .

3354 ) , as well as language in the house committee report accompanying h.r .

3267 , emphasize funding support for research in the physical and biological sciences over other scientific fields , such as the social , behavioral , and economic sciences .

supporters of such directives assert that federal dollars should be spent on disciplines they perceive to be more closely tied to research in the national interest ( eg , national security or health ) and that such direction falls within congress's oversight role .

opponents argue that scientists managing nsf programs ought to determine the distribution of funding by scientific field based on their deep knowledge of research merits and needs in each field , and how these needs are best balanced across nsf's research portfolio .

in recent years , a substantial portion of nsf ( and other agency ) funding has come through continuing appropriations .

continuing appropriations acts — often known as continuing resolutions or crs — that provide short - term funding until appropriations decisions are finalized can lead to uncertainty for agencies .

on one hand , crs allow for ongoing appropriations discussions without a funding gap .

on the other hand , they may lead to reductions or delays in agency operations , such as hiring staff , granting awards and contracts , and beginning new projects , as crs typically prohibit new activities not funded in the previous fiscal year .

since fy1997 , crs have been enacted on average almost six times per year and provided an average of almost five months of funding annually .

the continuing appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l .

115-56 , division d ) , provides funding for nsf through december 8 , 2017 , at the fy2017 level , subject to a 0.6791% across - the - board decrease .

further , when funding for an agency and its programs remains at prior year levels , overall purchasing power of appropriated monies is effectively reduced due to the impacts of annual inflation , which has been targeted at 2% by the federal reserve in recent years .

both the house and senate committee reports direct "not less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level" for multiple programs .

as shown in figure 1 and figure 2 , though current dollar appropriations for nsf have generally increased since fy2010 , inflation - adjusted appropriations have remained flat on average .

some analysts argue that even small sustained losses in federal science funding may lead to long - term negative impacts to scientific research and innovation .

this may be particularly true for basic research , which often has more uncertainty and longer timelines for generating returns on investment than applied research .

others argue that appropriations levels have remained strong for nsf given the budget constraints of recent years and that funding from other public and private sources should be sought to support scientific research broadly .
