in their ccdf state plans , states are required to describe their treatment oftanf families , transitioning families , and families at risk of welfare dependencewith respect to ccdf subsidy receipt .

state responses to this ccdf plan provisionvaried in detail and structure .

appendix a reflects the language used by states intheir ccdf plans , with minor editing for consistency and clarity .

although all statesprovide responses to this provision , it is unclear for some states whether these threegroups receive priority relative to other families eligible for subsidies , or in whatorder these families will be served .

for example , in new hampshire , tanffamilies , transitioning families , and at - risk families are described as having priorityover other families ( with the exception of families that already have a child receivinga subsidy and need care for an additional child ) ; however , there is no indication ofhow these three groups of families receive priority relative to each other .

in addition,the information provided by a few states did not specifically address how thesegroups of families are treated by the state .

in these cases , the table entry reads "noinformation. .
