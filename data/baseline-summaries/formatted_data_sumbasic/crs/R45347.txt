t wenty - eight temporary tax provisions expired at the end of 2017 .

collectively , temporary tax provisions that are regularly extended as a group by congress , rather than being allowed to expire as scheduled , are often referred to as "tax extenders. .

there are several options for congress to consider regarding temporary provisions .

provisions that expired at the end of 2017 could be extended .

the extension could be retroactive .

the extension could be short term , long term , or permanent .

another option would be to allow expired provisions to remain expired .

congress may also choose to evaluate the extension of selected expiring provisions in lieu of considering an extenders package that addresses most or all of the expired provisions .

in recent years , some provisions that had been long - standing "tax extenders" have been either made permanent or given longer - term extensions .

provisions that expired at the end of 2017 might be examined on a case - by - case basis to determine whether each provision is likely to achieve its desired outcome under the tax code as revised in the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) .

congress has often chosen to extend most , if not all , recently expired or expiring provisions as part of "tax extender" legislation .

the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba18 ; p.l .

115-123 ) extended through the end of 2017 nearly all of the provisions that had expired at the end of 2016 .

this extension was purely retroactive .

since the bba18 was enacted in february 2018 , the extensions were not made available for the tax year in which the legislation was enacted .

the previous "tax extender" package , the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 ( path act ) , enacted as division q of the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , broke what had been the typical practice of temporarily extending expiring provisions by making many expiring provisions permanent .

as a result , there were fewer "tax extender" provisions that expired in 2016 and 2017 than had been the case in previous years .

some contended that by making many temporary provisions permanent , the path act negated the need to address extenders every year or two .

others suggested that "tax extenders" might be addressed as part of tax reform .

however , most "tax extender" provisions were not explicitly addressed in the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) .

this report provides a broad overview of "tax extenders. .

more information on specific tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017 can be found in crs report r44925 , recently expired individual tax provisions ( "tax extenders" ) : in brief , coordinated by molly f. sherlock ; crs report r44930 , business tax provisions that expired in 2017 ( "tax extenders" ) , coordinated by molly f. sherlock ; and crs report r44990 , energy tax provisions that expired in 2017 ( "tax extenders" ) , by molly f. sherlock , donald j. marples , and margot l. crandall - hollick .

the tax code presently contains dozens of temporary tax provisions .

in the past , legislation to extend some of these expiring provisions has often been referred to as the "tax extender" package .

while there is no formal definition of a "tax extender," the term has regularly been used to refer to the package of expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by congress .

often , these expiring provisions are temporarily extended for a short period of time ( eg , one or two years ) .

over time , as new temporary provisions were routinely extended and hence added to this package , the number of provisions that might be considered "tax extenders" grew .

this trend was broken with the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , which made permanent a number of provisions that had been part of previous "tax extender" packages .

as a result , there were fewer "tax extender" provisions that expired in 2016 than in previous years .

all of the provisions that expired at the end of 2017 had previously expired at the end of 2016 .

twenty - eight temporary tax provisions expired at the end of 2017 .

these provisions can be categorized as primarily affecting individuals or businesses , or being energy - related .

as lawmakers consider whether to extend expired tax provisions beyond 2017 , cost is one factor .

as the number of "tax extenders" has decreased over time , so has the cost of a "tax extender" package .

many provisions were made permanent in the path act , which reduced the number of temporary provisions included in the "tax extenders" portion of bba18 .

the number of temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017 was further reduced following a longer - term extension of certain energy provisions and changes made in the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) .

the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) extended most provisions that had expired at the end of 2016 for one year , through 2017 .

as discussed above , several energy - related provisions were extended for a longer period of time , through 2021 .

additionally , the act extended the oil spill liability trust fund financing rate and modified the tax credit for production from advanced nuclear power facilities .

taken together , these changes were estimated to reduce federal revenue by $15.1 billion between fy2018 and fy2027 ( see table 2 ) .

not all of the provisions extended in bba18 are likely to be considered for extension beyond 2017 .

bba18 extended some provisions beyond 2017 .

other provisions are not likely to be extended beyond 2017 following changes made in the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) .

looking only at provisions that are likely to be considered for extension beyond 2017 , the one - year cost of extending those provisions enacted in bba18 had an estimated cost of $9.7 billion over the 10-year budget window ( see table 2 ) .

the cost of extending these provisions beyond 2017 may not necessarily be the same as the cost of past extensions , particularly given the substantial changes to the baseline following the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) .

permanently extending tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $92.5 billion over the fy2018 to fy2027 budget window ( see table 2 ) .

more than one - third of this cost ( $35.2 billion ) is associated with a single provision , the tax incentives for biodiesel and renewable diesel .

federal revenues between fy2019 and fy2028 are projected to be $44.2 trillion under current law .

thus , making permanent "tax extenders" would reduce federal revenues by about 0.2% .

as discussed above , "tax extenders" were most recently extended as part of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba18 ; p.l .

115-123 ) .

this legislation , enacted in february 2018 , extended tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2016 through the end of 2017 .

before bba18 , "tax extenders" were addressed in the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 ( path act ) , enacted as division q of the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) .

the path act either extended or made permanent all of the 52 temporary tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014 .

the path act , unlike other recent "tax extender" legislation , provided long - term extensions ( through 2019 ) for a number of provisions , while making many other temporary tax provisions permanent .

in total , the extensions of expiring provisions or "tax extenders" in p.l .

114-113 were estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between fy2016 and fy2025 .

of that cost , nearly one - third ( $202.1 billion ) was attributable to extensions of provisions that were scheduled to expire in 2017 ( the reduced earnings threshold for the refundable portion of the child tax credit ; the american opportunity tax credit ; and modifications to the earned income tax credit ) and the two - year moratorium on the medical device excise tax .

thus , the cost of extending the "tax extender" provisions was an estimated $426.8 billion between fy2016 and fy2025 .

of the total cost of the "tax extenders" in p.l .

114-113 , $559.5 billion , or 89% of the total cost , was associated with permanent extensions .

the estimated cost of permanent extension of "tax extender" provisions ( provisions that had expired in 2014 and were made permanent in p.l .

114-113 ) was $361.4 billion .

of the total cost of "tax extenders" in p.l .

114-113 , $17.7 billion ( or less than 3% ) was for the two - year extension of provisions that had expired in 2014 through 2016 .

the tax increase prevention act of 2014 ( p.l .

113-295 ) , passed late in the 113 th congress , made tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2013 available to taxpayers in the 2014 tax year .

the act extended most ( but not all ) expiring tax provisions , and most of the provisions extended in p.l .

114-113 had been included in past "tax extenders" legislation .

the cost of the "tax extenders" package enacted as p.l .

113-295 was estimated to be $41.6 billion over the 10-year budget window .

earlier in the 113 th congress , the senate finance committee had reported a two - year extenders package .

the house had also passed legislation that would have made permanent certain expiring provisions .

ultimately , the one - year retroactive extenders legislation is what was passed by the 113 th congress .

the american taxpayer relief act ( atra ; p.l .

112-240 ) extended dozens of temporary provisions that had either expired at the end of 2011 or were set to expire at the end of 2012 .

the provisions that had expired at the end of 2011 were extended retroactively .

the cost of the "tax extenders" package enacted as part of atra was estimated to be $73.6 billion over the 10-year budget window .

several provisions that were considered "traditional extenders" — that is , they had been extended multiple times in the past — were not extended under atra .

additional tax provisions are scheduled to expire at the end of 2018 .

first , the increased amount of the excise tax on coal used to finance the black lung disability trust fund is set to expire at the end of 2018 .

for 2018 , the tax rates on coal are $1.10 per ton of underground - mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface - mined coal , limited to 4.4% of the sales price .

these rates were established in 1986 .

starting in 2019 , under current law , these tax rates are scheduled to be $0.50 per ton of underground - mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface - mined coal , limited to 2% of the sales price .

these are the rates that were set when the trust fund was established in 1977 .

a second tax provision scheduled to expire at the end of 2018 allows taxpayers to deduct medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income ( agi ) .

starting in 2019 , under current law , an itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses will be allowed to the extent that such expenses exceed 10% of agi .

the threshold for the unreimbursed medical expense deduction was increased from 7.5% to 10% , effective in 2013 for most taxpayers , as part of the patient protection and affordable care act ( p.l .

111-148 ) .

however , an exception from the increase for tax years 2013 through 2016 provided that , if either the taxpayer or their spouse was age 65 or older , the 7.5% threshold would apply during this four - year period .

the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) reduced the agi threshold from 10% to 7.5% for individual taxpayers claiming an itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses in 2017 and 2018 .

making this provision permanent would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $24.8 billion between fy2019 and fy2028 .

a third provision , the $0.09 per barrel excise tax on crude oil received at refineries and petroleum products entering the united states , is also scheduled to expire at the end of 2018 .

the tax had expired at the end of 2017 , but was reinstated on march 1 , 2018 , as part of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-123 ) .

the tax first took effect at 5 cents per barrel on january 1 , 1990 .

since that time , at various points , the tax has expired , been reinstated , and the rate adjusted .

in the past , some "tax extenders" legislation has included extensions of disaster - related tax benefits .

the 2017 tax revision ( p.l .

115-97 ) included special provisions related to casualty losses arising from presidentially declared disasters occurring in 2016 or 2017 .

the enhanced deduction provided that disaster - related losses were deductible to the extent they exceeded $500 per casualty .

further , losses were allowed to be claimed in addition to the standard deduction .

before the change , losses were deductible if they exceeded $100 per casualty , and were deductible to the extent aggregate net casualty losses exceeded 10% of agi .

further , before the temporary changes in p.l .

115-97 , disaster - related casualty losses were part of itemized deductions .

disaster relief for hurricanes harvey , maria , and irma was included in the disaster tax relief and airport and airway extension act of 2017 ( p.l .

115-63 ) .

specifically , for these disaster areas , the law waived the 10% tax on early disaster - related distributions from retirement plans for up to $100,000 in distributions made between august 23 , 2017 , and december 31 , 2018 ; provided an employee retention tax credit for disaster - affected employers equal to 40% of wages paid between august 23 , 2017 , and december 31 , 2017 , up to $6,000 per employee , paid to employees of inoperable businesses , who lived in a qualified hurricane disaster zone when the disaster occurred ; suspended income limits on charitable contributions made for hurricane - related disaster relief before december 31 , 2017 ; modified casualty loss deductions for hurricane - related disaster losses , eliminating the requirement that losses must exceed 10% of agi to qualify and the requirement to itemize deductions , but increasing the threshold amount that per - disaster losses must exceed from $100 to $500 ; allowed taxpayers in hurricane disaster areas to use prior - year income to determine earned income and child tax credits ; and applied disaster - related tax relief to possessions of the united states .

the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba18 ) expanded the scope of the hurricane - related disaster provisions , providing similar relief for the california wildfires of 2017 .

the tax relief provided for hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria was estimated to reduce federal revenue by $5.6 billion between fy2018 and fy2027 .

of this total , $4.0 billion was associated with the enhanced casualty loss deduction .

the disaster tax relief expansions included in bba18 were estimated to reduce federal revenue by an additional $0.5 billion between fy2018 and fy2027 .

there is no formal definition of "tax extenders" legislation .

over time , "tax extenders" legislation has come to be considered legislation that temporarily extends a group of expired or expiring provisions .

using this characterization , below is a list of what could be considered "tax extenders" legislation .

using this list , "tax extenders" have been addressed 18 times .

the package of provisions that are included in the "tax extenders" has changed over time , as congress has added new temporary provisions to the code , and as certain provisions are either permanently extended or given temporary extension in other tax legislation .
