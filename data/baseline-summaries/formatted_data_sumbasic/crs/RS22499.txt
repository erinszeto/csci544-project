the u.s. census bureau periodically collects national survey information on child support .

by interviewing a random sample of single - parent families , the census bureau is able to generate an array of data that is useful in assessing the performance of noncustodial parents in paying their child support .

although the ce nsus bureau has been collecting child support information in a special child support supplement to the april current population survey ( cps ) biennially since 1978 , the supplement survey has changed significantly over the years .

according to the census bureau , the most recent data , from 2013 , are comparable only back to 1993 .

during the early years of the survey , information was collected only from custodial mothers .

beginning with the 1991 data , information was also collected from custodial fathers .

this report presents unsegmented data with respect to custodial mothers and fathers ( i.e. , custodial parents' data ) .

the survey population includes all persons who have their own children under the age of 21 living with them , while the other parent lives outside the household .

the child support enforcement ( cse ) program was enacted in 1975 as part of p.l .

93-647 ( title iv - d of the social security act ) .

it is a federal - state program whose purpose is to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on a consistent and continuing basis , and by helping some families to remain self - sufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services .

the cse program is administered by the office of child support enforcement ( ocse ) in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and funded by general revenues .

all 50 states , the district of columbia , guam , puerto rico , and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds .

the cse program provides seven major services on behalf of children: ( 1 ) parent location , ( 2 ) paternity establishment , ( 3 ) establishment of child support orders , ( 4 ) review and modification of child support orders , ( 5 ) collection of child support payments , ( 6 ) distribution of child support payments , and ( 7 ) establishment and enforcement of medical child support .

the cse program is estimated to handle at least 50% of all child support cases ; the remaining cases are handled by private attorneys , collection agencies , or through mutual agreements between the parents .

in fy2013 , the cse program collected $28.0 billion in child support payments ( from noncustodial parents ) and served 15.6 million child support cases .

the national census bureau data show that the aggregate amount of child support received in 2013 was $22.5 billion , and that 13.4 million parents had custody of children under the age of 21 while the other parent lived elsewhere .

in 2013 , almost 83% of custodial parents were mothers .

of all custodial parents , 48% were white ( non - hispanic ) , 25% were black , 23% were hispanic , 16% were married , 33% were divorced , 38% were never married , 13% did not have a high school diploma , almost 20% had at least a bachelor's degree , 50% worked full - time year - round , 29% had family income below poverty , and nearly 43% received some type of public assistance ( i.e. , medicaid , food stamps , public housing or rent subsidy , tanf , or general assistance ) .

 table 1 summarizes several child support indicators from biennial survey data for selected years from 1993 through 2013 .

the table shows that the likelihood of having a child support award , being legally entitled to a child support payment , and actually receiving at least one child support payment decreased over the 21-year period from 1993 through 2013 .

in contrast , the percentage of custodial parents ( owed child support ) who received the full amount of the child support that they were owed increased by almost 24% , from 37% in 1993 to 46% in 2013 .

in 2013 , about 49% of the 13.4 million custodial parents ( with children under the age of 21 ) were awarded child support .

of those who were actually due child support payments ( 5.7 million ) , about 74% of them received at least one payment and almost 46% received all that they were owed .

in 2013 , only 2.6 million ( 19% ) of the 13.4 million custodial parents eligible for child support actually received the full amount of child support that was owed to them .

in 2013 , the average child support payment received by custodial parents amounted to $3,953 , 6.5% higher than the average child support payment in 1993 ( $3,712 ) .

in 2013 , 68% of the $32.9 billion in aggregate child support due was actually paid .

in 1993 , 65% of the $38 billion ( adjusted for inflation , in 2013 dollars ) in child support due was paid .

during the 21-year period 1993 through 2013 , after adjusting for inflation , aggregate child support due started at $38.0 billion in 1993 , fluctuated to a high of $46.9 billion in 2003 , and dropped to a low of $32.9 billion in 2013 .

over the entire period , aggregate child support due decreased by 13% , total child support received decreased 9% , and the amount left unpaid decreased 21% ( see table 1 ) .

while sex , race , marital status , and education are significant factors in predicting whether a custodial parent will be issued a child support order , award rates tend to be significantly lower than receipt rates .

for example , although female custodial parents were almost 1.7 times more likely to be awarded child support in 2013 as their male counterparts , among parents who were owed / due child support , both had at least a 73% chance of actually receiving child support payments .

 ( see table 2 . ) .

moreover , in 2013 , 37% of black custodial parents were awarded child support compared to 56% of white custodial parents .

even so , nearly 65% of black custodial parents who were owed / due child support actually received child support payments and 79% of white custodial parents who were owed child support actually received child support payments in 2013 .

similarly , while 42% of never - married parents were awarded child support in 2013 , almost 68% of never - married parents who were owed child support actually received child support payments in 2013 .

also , 38% of custodial parents without a high school diploma were awarded child support , while almost 62% of custodial parents without a high school diploma who were owed child support actually received child support .

the pattern of receipt rates being higher than award rates also held for the economic factors listed in table 2 — in that once a child support obligation was awarded , the probability of actually receiving payments rose significantly for all categories of custodial parents .

in 2013 , 45% of custodial parents with incomes below the poverty level were awarded child support , and nearly 66% of those owed / due payments actually received child support payments .

table 2 also shows that 49% of custodial parents who worked full - time year - round were awarded child support , while almost 77% of those owed received child support payments .

similarly , 47% of custodial parents who received public assistance were awarded child support , while nearly 67% of those who were owed child support payments actually received child support payments .

of the categories of custodial parents presented in table 2 , custodial parents who were divorced followed by custodial parents who were white ( non - hispanic ) were the categories of parents most likely to be awarded child support .

in 2013 , 57.7% of custodial parents who were divorced and 56.4% of white ( non - hispanic ) custodial parents were awarded child support .

the table also shows that custodial parents with an associate's degree who were owed / due child support was the category of parents most likely to receive child support payments in 2013 .

in 2013 , 83.1% of custodial parents with an associate's degree who were owed payments actually received child support payments .

in 2013 , the average yearly child support payment received by custodial parents with payments was $5,333 ; $5,181 for mothers and $6,526 for fathers .

these full or partial payments represented ( on average ) 14% of the custodial parent's yearly income , 16% of the custodial mothers' total yearly income , and 9% of the custodial fathers' .

in 2013 , for custodial parents with income below the poverty level , child support payments for those who received them made up , on average , 49% of their yearly income .

in 2013 , child support payments made up 13% of the yearly income of custodial parents without a high school diploma who were owed child support and who actually received full or partial payments .

in 2013 , child support represented about 18% of the income of the 2.6 million custodial parents who received all of the child support that they were owed .

the census bureau data also include information on health insurance .

in 2013 , 54% of the 6.5 million custodial parents with child support awards had awards that included health insurance .

the noncustodial parent provided the health insurance coverage in 51.1% of the awards with health insurance provisos and in 10.4% of the awards without health insurance stipulations .

moreover , the noncustodial parent provided health insurance coverage for 19.4% of the nearly 6.9 million custodial parents who did not have a child support award .

overall , 3.5 million noncustodial parents provided health care for their children in 2013 .

this represented 26.1% of the 13.4 million children under the age of 21 who were living with a custodial parent while their other parent lived elsewhere .
