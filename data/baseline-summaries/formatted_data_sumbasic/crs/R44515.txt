the fy2013 house - reported bill would have provided $1.0 million , a decrease of $9.0 million ( - 90.0% ) , from the $10.0 million provided in fy2012 and requested for fy2013 .

the house report stated that this funding level would "cover the cost associated with the shutdown" and directed that "the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the legislative branch fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill. .
