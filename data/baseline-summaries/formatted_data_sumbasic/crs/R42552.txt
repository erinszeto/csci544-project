the 112 th congress is in the midst of considering an omnibus farm bill that will establish the direction of agricultural policy for the next several years .

many provisions of the current farm bill ( the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , p.l .

110-246 ) expire this year .

the senate agriculture committee approved its version of the 2012 omnibus farm bill on april 26 , 2012 ( agriculture reform , food and jobs act of 2012 ) , and officially filed the measure , s. 3240 , on may 24 , 2012 .

after the bill was filed , more than 300 amendments were proposed for consideration on the senate floor .

by mid - june , an agreement was reached to limit the debate to 77 of the proposed amendments , of which 45 were adopted between june 19 and june 21 .

the full senate approved s. 3240 , as amended , by a vote of 64-35 on june 21 .

the house agriculture committee completed markup of its version of the farm bill ( h.r .

6083 , the federal agriculture reform and risk management act of 2012 ) on july 11 , 2012 , and approved the amended measure by a 35-11 vote .

nearly 100 amendments were offered for committee consideration , of which nearly half were adopted by the committee .

the house bill was officially filed and reported by the committee on september 13 , 2012 .

within their 12 titles , the five - year house and senate farm bills would reshape the structure of farm commodity support , expand crop insurance coverage , consolidate conservation programs , revise the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( formerly food stamps ) , and extend authority to appropriate funds for many u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) discretionary programs through fy2017 .

following are summaries of the major similarities and differences within each of the 12 titles of the respective versions of the house agriculture committee - approved and senate - passed 2012 farm bills .

the summaries are followed by a comprehensive title - by - title comparison of all of the house and senate provisions with each other and with current law or policy .

the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projects that the programs of the 2008 farm bill , if they were to continue , would cost nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years .

compared to this "baseline," the senate - passed farm bill , s. 3240 , would reduce spending by $23.1 billion ( 2.3% ) ; and the house agriculture committee - reported bill , h.r .

6083 , would reduce it by $35.1 billion ( - 3.5% ) .

the $23 billion 10-year reduction ( or "score" ) in the senate bill is consistent with a joint house - senate agriculture committee proposal to the joint select committee on deficit reduction in fall 2011 .

the $35 billion 10-year reduction in the house bill is consistent with reconciliation instructions in the house budget resolution for fy2013 .

the net reduction in each bill is composed of some titles receiving more funding than in the past , while other titles provide offsets for deficit reduction .

figure 1 illustrates the budgetary impacts of changes to each title in each bill , and the following table contains the data in tabular form .

more background and detail on the budget available to write the farm bill , the cbo scores of each bill , and other budgetary issues is available in crs report r42484 , budget issues shaping a 2012 farm bill .
