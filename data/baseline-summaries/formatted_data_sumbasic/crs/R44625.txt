because appropriations legislation generally originates in the house , and because the house had not yet taken up a fy2017 thud appropriations bill as of may , the senate used the fy2016 thud appropriations bill ( h.r .

114-223 ) provides $65.27 billion without collections .

beginning with fy2017 , va programs that provide care in the community ( non - va care ) will be funded through a separate medical community care account .

114-41 ) "to consolidate all the va programs that provide care for veterans in the community from non - va providers. .

for fy2017 , the medical community care account is funded at $7.25 billion and for fy2018 ( advance appropriations ) it is funded at $9.41 billion ( table 2 ) .

the fy2017 milcon - va appropriations act provided $4.28 billion for information technology programs ( table 2 ) .

due to issues surrounding interoperability and seamless exchange of medical information among dod , va , and private sector health care providers , the fy2017 milcon - va appropriations act — similar to previous milcon - va appropriations acts ( fy2013-fy2016 ) — prohibits an obligation or expenditure of more than 25% of fy2017 funds provided for vista evolution , or any successor electronic medical records program until va meets reporting requirements stipulated in the act .

section 247 of the fy2017 milcon - va appropriations act would establish another process for va employees to file whistleblower complaints .

101-12 , 103 stat .

16 ; p.l .

103-424 , 108 stat .

4361 ; codified , as amended , in various sections of title 5 , u.s. code ) would remain available , such employees could also seek relief pursuant to the provisions added by section 247 .

unlike the whistleblower protection act ( wpa ) , the new process allows va employees to file whistleblower complaints with their immediate supervisors , with the ability to file a complaint with a next - level supervisor if an immediate supervisor does not make a timely determination or a complaint is not adequately addressed .

the new process provides for a central whistleblower office to investigate all of the va's whistleblower complaints , including those brought pursuant to the wpa .

if it is determined that a supervisor has engaged in retaliation against a va whistleblower , for a first offense , the supervisor will be subject to punishment that is not less than a 12-day suspension , but not more than removal .

a supervisor will be subject to removal for a second offense .

under the new provisions added by section 247 , a va supervisor's treatment of whistleblower complaints will be considered as part of the individual's performance evaluation .

section 260 of the fy2017 milcon - va appropriations act ( division a of p.l .

114-223 ) also allows va to use current fy2017 and fy2018 ( advance appropriations ) funds in the medical services account to provide fertility treatment using assisted reproductive technology ( art ) , such as in - vitro fertilization ( ivf ) , and "adoption reimbursement for veterans and their spouses if the veteran has a service - connected disability that results in being unable to procreate without such fertility treatment. .

according to the explanatory statement accompanying the act , the va must "develop and publish implementing guidance within 120 days of enactment of this act [that is by january 27 , 2017]. .

the va published interim - final regulations on january 19 , 2017 .

under this authority as codified in 38 c.f.r .

§17.380 and 38 c.f.r .

§17.412 , va may provide ivf treatment to eligible veterans and fertility counseling and ivf treatments to spouses of eligible veterans .

authority to provide these fertility counseling and treatment services using assisted reproductive technology ( art ) would end on september 30 , 2018 .

division c of p.l .

114-223 included section 116 ( c ) that would require the va to use fy2017 advance appropriations provided in the medical services account of the military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) , to implement the numerous provisions contained in the jason simcakoski memorial and promise act ( title ix of p.l .

114-198 ) .

the purpose of the act , among other things , is to improve opioid safety and reduce the use of opioids among veterans with chronic pain .

furthermore , the jason simcakoski memorial and promise act would establish an office of patient advocacy within the office of the under secretary for health .

the office would be required to carry out patient advocacy programs within the va health care system .

no new additional funding was provided by this provision for implementation purposes .

on may 5 , 2017 , president trump signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( h.r .

244 ; p.l .

115-31 ) .

among other things , division l of p.l .

the act provides $50 million for the medical services account for opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment , and for implementation expenses related to the jason simcakoski memorial and promise act ( p.l .
