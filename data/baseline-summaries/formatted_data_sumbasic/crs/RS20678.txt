rs20678 - - hate crimes: sketch of selected proposals and congressional authority updated may 17 , 200 .

s. 625 , the local law enforcement enhancement act of 2001 , introduced by senator kennedy on march 27 , 2001 , has 50 cosponsors ; its companionin the house , h.r .

1343 , the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention act of 2001 , introduced byrepresentative conyers , has over 180cosponsors .

they are virtually identical to the kennedy hate crime amendment ( amend .

3473 ) to the nationaldefense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 ( h.r .

4205 ) which passed the senate during the 106th congress but was dropped from the billprior to final enactment .

representative jackson - leehas offered an alternative proposal ( h.r .

74 , the hate crimes prevention act of 2001 ) , which closelyresembles her offering in the 106th congress ( h.r .

77 ) .

a second alternative from the 106th congress , senator hatch's s. 1406 , has,as yet , not been proposed in this congress .

new crimes : s. 625 / h.r .

1343 creates two federal crimes .

both outlaw willfully causing physical injuries ; using fire , firearms , orbombs ; or attempting to do so - - motivated by certain victim characteristics ( whether real or perceived ) .

offendersare subject to imprisonment for not more than10 years , or for any term of years or life if the crime involves attempted murder , kidnapping , attempted kidnapping,rape or attempted rape .

the two offensesdiffer in that the first applies to crimes motivated by the victim's race , color , religion , or national origin and containsno other explicit federal jurisdictionalelement .

the second applies to crimes motivated by the victim's gender , sexual orientation , disability , race , color,religion , or national origin and contains a seriesof alternative jurisdictional elements of a commerce clause stripe .

federal prosecution of either offense wouldrequire certification of a senior department ofjustice official that state or local officials are unable or unwilling to prosecute , favor federal prosecution , or haveprosecuted to a result that leaves federal interestin eradicating bias - motivated violence unvindicated .

h.r .

74 would establish the same two offenses , but hasno certification requirement .

hate statistics : the companion bills and h.r .

74 add gender to the list of predicate characteristics for hate crime statistical collection purposes,section 280003 ( a ) of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 .

assistance to local law enforcement : unlike h.r .

74 , the companion bills each call for the justice department to assist state and tribal lawenforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute violent , felonious hate crimes , motivated by animosity towardsthose of the victim's race , color , religion , nationalorigin , gender , sexual orientation , disability or other characteristic found in the state's or tribe's hate crime law .

theyinsist that priority be given to cases infiscally strapped rural jurisdictions and to cases involving multistate offenders .

grants : each of the proposals features a grant program to help the states combat hate crimes committed by juveniles , authorizing such appropriations as arenecessary .

s. 625 / h.r .

1343 calls for an additional extraordinary grant program available to the statesand tribes to addressinvestigative and prosecutorial needs that cannot otherwise be met .

the bills authorize appropriations of $5 millionfor each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 , but noindividual grant may not exceed $100,000 per year .

sentencing guidelines : each proposal instructs the sentencing commission to study and make any appropriate adjustments in the federal sentencing guidelinesconcerning adult recruitment of juveniles to commit hate crimes , consistent with the other federal sentencingguidelines and being sure to avoid duplication .

commerce clause : congress enjoys only those legislative powers that flow from the constitution .

u.s.const .

ix , x .

the commerce clause , section 5of the fourteenth amendment and section 2 of the thirteenth amendment and fifteenth amendment , are the grantsof power most often mentioned whendiscussing congress' authority to proscribe hate crimes , and to enact other forms of civil rights legislation .

under the commerce clause , congress is empowered "to regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the indian tribes."u.s.const .

art.i , �8 , cl.3 .

the supreme court in lopez and morrison identified the threeways in which congress may exercise its prerogatives under the clause:"first , congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce .

second , congress is empowered toregulate and protect the instrumentalities ofinterstate commerce , or persons or things in interstate commerce , even though the threat may come only fromintrastate activities .

finally , congress' commerceauthority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce , .

 .

 .

i.e.,those activities that substantially affectinterstate commerce." ) .

this last category , the "affects interstate commerce" category , can sometimes be the most difficult to define for it may embrace what appears to be purelyintrastate activity .

morrison cited with approval the signposts of this aspect of the commerce powerthat lopez sought in vain when examining the gun - freeschools act ( 18 u.s.c .

922 ( q ) ( 1 ) ( a ) ) .

first , the statute had "nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economicenterprise , however broadly one might definethose terms. .

second , "the statute contained no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to adiscrete set of firearm possessions that additionallyhave an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce. .

third , neither the statute "nor its legislativehistory contains express congressional findingsregarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone. .

finally , the link between gunpossession in a school zone and commerceinterest urged by the government ( the cost of violent crime and damage to national productivity caused by violentcrime ) was too attenuated without more tosupport a claim to commerce clause authority .

in this last regard , morrison observed , "[w]e accordingly reject the argument that congress may regulate noneconomic , violent criminal conduct based solely onthat conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce .

the constitution requires a distinction between what is trulynational and what is truly local .

 .

 .

theregulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities , channels , or goodsinvolved in interstate commerce has always beenthe province of the states. .

the hate crime proposals present two , somewhat different , claims to commerce clause power .

first , they create a federal crime for which an aspect of interstatecommerce is an element , i.e. , in the case of h.r .

74 : either that ( a ) "in connection with theoffense , the defendant or the victim travels in interstatecommerce or foreign commerce , uses a facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce , or engages inany activity affecting interstate or foreigncommerce ; or ( b ) the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce ; " and in the case of s. 625 / h.r .

1343 : either that ( 1 ) theoffense "occurs during the course of , or as a result of , the travel of the defendant or the victim " either ( a ) "acrossa state line or national border" or ( b ) "using achannel , facility , or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce ; " or ( 2 ) the defendant uses a channel , facility,or instrumentality of interstate or foreigncommerce" in the commission of the offense ; or ( 3 ) in connection with the offense "the defendant employs afirearm , explosive or incendiary device , or otherweapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce ; or ( 4 ) the offense either ( a ) interferes with commercialor other economic activity in which the victimis engaged at the time of the conduct ; or ( b ) otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce. .

then they create a second federal crime whose claim to a commerce clause nexus must be more inferential , tied to the findings and the general nature andconsequences of hate crimes .

morrison suggests that the findings and general nature of the offenses involved are likely to be insufficient to support an assertion that the commerce clauseempowers congress to enact the provisions .

morrison rejected virtually the same argument with respectto a statute creating a civil remedy for the victims ofgender - motivated violence .

its success here would seem to depend on convincing the court that race - motivated,or color - motivated , or religion - motivated , ornational origin - motivated violence are somehow more commercially influential than gender - motivated violence .

brighter seem the prospects for a judicial conclusion that the offenses that come with commerce - explicit elements come within congress' commerce clausepowers .

they have the distinct advantage of precluding conviction unless the prosecution can convince the courtsof the statutory nexus between the defendant'sconduct and the commerce impacting element of the offense .

moreover , several of the elements involve preventingthe channels of commerce from becoming theavenues of destructive misconduct or protecting the flow of commerce from destructive ingredients - - the mark ofcircumstances that indisputably fall withincongress' authority under the commerce clause .

section 5 of the fourteenth amendment : where the proposals seem beyond congress' reach under the commerce clause they may be within the scope of otherlegislative powers such as the legislative clauses of the thirteenth , fourteenth , and fifteenth amendments .

morrison addresses the breadth of congress'legislative power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment .

the amendment guarantees certain civil rightsoften by forbidding state or federal interference .

under section 5 the congress is vested with "power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the [amendment's]provisions. .

morrison pointed out that unitedstates v. harris held that section 5 did not vest congress with the power to enact a statute "directedexclusively against the action of private persons , withoutreference to the laws of the state , or their administration by her officers. .

and in civil rights cases ,"we held that the public accommodation provisions of thecivil rights act of 1875 , which applied to purely private conduct , were beyond the scope of the �5 enforcementpower .

 .

 .

 .

the force of the doctrine of staredecisis behind these decisions stems not only from the length of time they have been on the books , but also fromthe insight attributable to the members of thecourt at that time .

 .

 .

[who] obviously had intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding theadoption of the fourteenth amendment. .

the statute in morrison created a cause of action against private individuals who perpetrated gender - motivated violence enacted in the face of evidence that thestates often failed to adequately investigate and prosecute such crimes .

the authority under section 5 , however,extends only to state action including theenactment of a "remedy corrective in its character , adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibitedstate laws or proceedings of state officers. .

the morrison statute rested on the wrong side of the divide , for its remedy fell not upon wayward stateofficials , but upon private individuals .

the hate crimeproposals seem perilously comparable at best .

they address private misconduct , not the deficiencies of state action .

section 2 of the thirteen amendment : the companion bills and h.r .

74 each stake a claim to the legislative authority in section 2 of the thirteenamendment within their findings .

the civil rights cases , considered so instructive with respect tocongressional powers under the fourteenth amendment , alsoafforded the court its first opportunity to construe section 2 of the thirteenth amendment .

unlike , the fourteenth,it speaks not of state action , but declares"neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been dulyconvicted , shall exist within the united states,or any place subject to their jurisdiction. .

u.s.const .

it finishes with the stipulation that "congressshall have power to enforce this article byappropriate legislation. .

u.s.const .

xiii , �2 .

the civil rights cases observed that section 2 "clothes congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents ofslavery in the united states. .

this power it concluded , however , reached "those fundamental rights whichappertain to the essence of citizenship" and but not the"social rights" ( access lodging , transportation , and entertainment ) that congress had by statute endeavored to protectfrom racial discrimination .

the court said little of section 2 for nearly a century thereafter until jones v. alfred h. mayer co. , which found that congress might ban racial discriminationfrom real estate transactions under the section .

almost in passing , jones dismissed without repudiatingthe social rights distinction: "whatever the presentvalidity of the position taken by the majority on that issue - - a question rendered largely academic by title ii of thecivil rights act of 1964 , 78 stat .

243 ( seeheart of atlanta motel v. united states , 379 u.s. 241 ; katzenbach v. mcclung , 379u.s .

294 [confirming the title's validity as an exercise ofcommerce clause power] ) - - we note that the entire court agreed upon at least one proposition: the thirteenamendment authorizes congress not only to outlawall forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society halfslave and half free , by securing to all citizens , ofevery race and color , the same right to make and enforce contracts , to sue , be parties , give evidence , and to inherit,purchase , lease , sell and convey property , as isenjoyed by white citizens. .

three years later in griffin the court confirmed that 42 u.s.c .

1985 ( 3 ) ( relating to conspiracies in deprivation of the rights of citizenship ) was within the scope ofsection 2 authority .

griffin opined that "not only may congress impose such liability , but the varietiesof private conduct that it may make criminally punishableor civilly remediable extend far beyond the actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude .

by the thirteenthamendment , we commit ourselves as a nationto the proposition that the former slaves and their descendants should be forever free .

to keep that promise,congress has the power under the thirteenthamendment rationally to determine what are the badges and incidents of slavery , and the authority to translate thatdetermination into effective legislation .

wecan only conclude that congress as wholly within its powers under �2 of the thirteen amendment in creating astatutory cause of action for negro citizens whohave been the victims of conspiratorial , racially discriminatory private action aimed at depriving them of the basisrights that the law secures to all free men. .

403u.s .

at 105 .

section 2 envisions legislation for the benefit of those who bore the burdens slavery and their descendants ( race , color ) , but does it contemplate a wider range ofbeneficiaries ( e.g .

 , religion , national origin ) .

the hate crime proposals would have encloaked groupssubject to classification by "race , color , religion , or nationalorigin. .

in construing the civil rights statutes enacted contemporaneously with the thirteenth , fourteenth andfifteenth amendment , the supreme court held thatarabs and jews would have been considered distinct "races" at the time the statutes were passed and theamendments drafted , debated and ratified .

whether thiswould be considered sufficient to embrace all religious discrimination is another question .

would roman catholicsor methodists , for example , have beenconsidered distinct "races" even in the nineteenth century ? .

of course , even this expansion of beneficiaries does not ensure that the court would consider violence a badge or incident of slavery .

although commenting onits irrelevancy in light of congress' use of commerce clause , even jones did not go so far as to rejectthe fundamental versus the social rights distinction of the civil rights cases .

perhaps more to the point , the anxiety of morrison and lopez lest an overly generous commerce clause construction swallow all state criminaljurisdiction over violence might argue against the prospect of the court embracing violence as a badge or incidentof slavery for purposes of congress' legislativeauthority under section 2 of the thirteenth amendment .
