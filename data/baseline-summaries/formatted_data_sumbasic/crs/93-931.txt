politics in haiti have been generally violent and authoritarian , ever since haiti became anindependent republic in 1804 , when african - descended slaves revolted against their french colonialmasters .

between the end of the rule of toussaint louverture ( leader of the slave rebellion ) in 1803,and francois duvalier , founder of the 30-year dictatorship that fell in 1986 - - both of whom declaredthemselves president for life - - were some 30 other despotic rulers .

this legacy would appeardifficult to overcome .

in addition , most of the traditional centers of power in haiti , such as themilitary , the catholic and protestant churches , the business sector , and the traditional elite , finddemocratic reformist ideas threatening in the haitian context .

the government apparatus is stillstaffed principally by duvalierist appointees , many of whom have resisted change during thenumerous post - duvalier governments and will most likely continue to do so .
