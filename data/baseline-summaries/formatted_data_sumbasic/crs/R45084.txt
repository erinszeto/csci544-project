the series of supplemental appropriations requested and provided in the wake of 2017's hurricanes and wildfires are the latest exercise of the congressional role of exercising "the power of the purse" to provide relief to state and local governments overwhelmed by disaster response and recovery needs , fund certain relief for individuals and small businesses , and repair damage to federal facilities .

in the process of exercising this power , a number of issues frequently reemerge in congressional debate .

one is the use of exemptions from discretionary budget limits to enable investments in disaster relief , and whether such exemptions are properly structured .

although these exemptions are in law , and precedents for not directly reducing spending to offset many types of disaster costs exist , congress periodically debates amendments to offset some or all of the cost of emergency and disaster relief appropriations measures .

congress also often asks questions about how quickly relief and recovery funding is made available , and how it can ensure that the funding provided is not spent in wasteful or fraudulent endeavors .

the following list provides a point of contact for questions regarding the particular appropriations provided in the various supplemental bills considered or enacted in the wake of the 2017 hurricane season .

appropriations or legislative provisions are listed by the appropriations subcommittee to which cbo attributes their scoring .
