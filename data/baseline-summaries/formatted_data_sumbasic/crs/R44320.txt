tables 3 through 13 present current official data on arms transfer agreements with developing nations by major suppliers from 2007 to 2014 .

these data show the most recent trends in arms contract activity by major suppliers .

delivery data , which reflect implementation of sales previously concluded , are provided in tables 14 through 24 .

table 30 , table 31 , table 32 , table 33 , and table 34 provide data on worldwide arms transfer agreements from 2007-2014 , while table 35 , table 36 , table 37 , table 38 , and table 39 provide data on worldwide arms deliveries during this period .

to use these data regarding agreements for purposes other than assessing general trends in seller / buyer activity is to risk drawing conclusions that can be readily invalidated by future events — precise values and comparisons , for example , may change due to cancellations or modifications of major arms transfer agreements previously concluded .

these data sets reflect the comparative magnitude of arms transactions by arms suppliers with recipient nations expressed in constant dollar terms , unless otherwise noted .

illustrative pie and bar charts are provided in this section to give the relative market share of individual arms suppliers globally , to the developing world and to specific regions .

other useful data for assessing arms transfers are those that indicate who has actually delivered specific numbers of specific classes of military items to a region .

these data are relatively "hard" in that they reflect actual transfers of military equipment .

they have the limitation of not giving detailed information regarding either the sophistication or the specific name of the equipment delivered .

however , these data show relative trends in the delivery of important classes of military equipment and indicate who the leading suppliers are from region to region over time .

data in the following tables set out actual deliveries of fourteen categories of weaponry to developing nations from 2007 to 2014 by the united states , russia , china , the four major west european suppliers as a group , all other european suppliers as a group , and all other suppliers as a group .

the tables show these deliveries data for all of the developing nations collectively , for asia , for the near east , for latin america , and for africa .

care should be taken in using the quantitative data within these specific tables .

aggregate data on weapons categories delivered by suppliers do not provide precise indices of the quality and / or quantity of the weaponry delivered .

the history of recent conventional conflicts suggests that quality and / or sophistication of weapons can offset quantitative advantage .

further , these data do not provide an indication of the relative capabilities of the recipient nations to use effectively the weapons delivered to them .

superior training — coupled with good equipment , tactical and operational proficiency , and sound logistics — may , in the last analysis , be a more important factor in a nation's ability to engage successfully in conventional warfare than the size of its weapons inventory .
