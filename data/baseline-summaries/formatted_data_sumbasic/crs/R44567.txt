this report discusses the fy2017 budget request , related congressional actions , and appropriations ( discretionary budget authority ) for the bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) and bureau of the census ( census bureau ) .

these entities make up the economics and statistics administration ( esa ) in the u.s. department of commerce , which is funded under annual appropriations for the departments of commerce and justice , and science and related agencies ( cjs ) .

the report focuses primarily on the census bureau , whose budget justification is published separately from esa's and whose budget is far larger .

table 1 , below , shows the fy2016-enacted and fy2017-requested amounts for esa , bea , and the census bureau , with its two major accounts .

also shown are the amounts recommended by the house and senate committees on appropriations for esa ( with no separate breakouts provided for bea ) and the census bureau , as well as the fy2017-enacted amounts .

fy2017 cjs appropriations legislation was not enacted by the end of fy2016 .

the census bureau , bea , and rest of esa were funded through december 9 , 2016 , at the fy2016 level , with a 0.496% reduction , under the continuing appropriations act , 2017 .

the act was division c of the continuing appropriations and military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , and zika response and preparedness act , h.r .

5325 , p.l .

114-223 , which was signed into law on september 29 , 2016 .

division a of the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 , h.r .

2028 , p.l .

114-254 , enacted on december 10 , 2016 , provided funding at the fy2016 level , minus a 0.1901% reduction , through april 28 , 2017 .

under section 152 of the legislation , however , the census bureau could draw on money from periodic censuses and programs — an account that includes the decennial census and other major programs discussed in this report , such as the economic census , the census of governments , and intercensal demographic estimates , together with geographic and data - processing support — at the rate necessary for conducting operations to maintain the 2020 census schedule .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 , h.r .

244 , p.l .

115-31 , became law on may 5 , 2017 .

division b of the legislation funded esa at $107.3 million ( with no separate amount shown for bea ) , $1.7 million ( 1.6% ) less than enacted for fy2016 and recommended by the senate appropriations committee , $7.3 million ( 6.4% ) below the fy2017 request , and $300,000 ( 0.3% ) more than the house appropriations committee approved .

the $1,470.0 million provided for the census bureau in the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 , included $270.0 million for current surveys and programs and $1,200.0 million for periodic censuses and programs .

these amounts matched the house committee's recommendations .

the act , like s. 2837 and h.r .

5393 , stipulated that $2.6 million of the appropriation for periodic censuses and programs would be transferred to the commerce department's oig for census bureau oversight .
