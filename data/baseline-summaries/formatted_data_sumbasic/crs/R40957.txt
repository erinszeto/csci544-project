one of the first issues congress faced when considering unfunded federal mandate legislation was how to define the concept .

for example , during a november 3 , 1993 , congressional hearing on unfunded mandate legislation , senator judd gregg argued , any bill reported out this committee [governmental affairs] should precisely define what constitutes an unfunded federal mandate.... an appropriate definition is crucial because it will drive almost everything else that occurs .

without a precise definition , endless litigation would likely ensue over what is and what is not an unfunded federal mandate .

a true solution to the problem cannot allow it to become more cost - effective to pay the bills than to seek payment .

furthermore , the definition cannot be too restrictive .

it would solve nothing to cut off one particular type of unfunded mandate , only to prompt congressional use of another to accelerate .

the difficulty congress faced in defining the concept was that there were strong disagreements , among academics , practitioners , and elected officials , over how to define it .

these disagreements appear motivated by concerns about which classes of costs incurred by state and local governments ( or the private sector ) should be identified and controlled for in the legislative or regulatory process .

they have typically been conducted , however , as disputes about which classes of such costs are properly considered as obligatory requirements on the affected entities .

the resulting focus on whether or not particular kinds of costs are "mandatory" has tended to obscure consideration of the core policy question concerning what kinds of costs should be subjected to informational requirements or procedural restrictions such as those that umra establishes .

umra's title ii , which became effective on march 22 , 1995 , generally requires federal agencies , unless otherwise prohibited by law , to prepare written statements that identify costs and benefits of a federal mandate to be imposed through the rulemaking process that may result in the expenditure by state , local , and tribal governments , in the aggregate , or by the private sector , of $100 million or more ( adjusted annually for inflation ) in any one year , before "promulgating any general notice of proposed rulemaking. .

in 2019 , the threshold for preparing a written statement is $164 million .

these informational requirements for regulations , like the title i cost estimate requirements for legislation , apply to both intergovernmental and private - sector mandates .

title ii establishes no equivalent to the point of order mechanism in title i through which either house can decline to consider legislation proposing covered unfunded intergovernmental mandates above the applicable threshold level .

the written assessments that federal agencies are to prepare for their regulations must identify the law authorizing the rule and include a qualitative and quantitative assessment of anticipated costs and benefits , the share of costs to be borne by the federal government , and the disproportionate budgetary effects upon particular regions , state , local , or tribal governments , or particular segments of the private sector .

assessments must also include estimates of the effect on the national economy , descriptions of consultations with nonfederal government officials , and a summary of the evaluation of comments and concerns obtained throughout the promulgation process .

impacts of "any regulatory requirements" on small governments must be identified , notice must be given to those governments , and technical assistance must be provided .

also , federal agencies are required , to the extent permitted in law , to develop an "effective process to permit elected officers of state , local , and tribal governments ( or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf ) to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory proposals containing significant federal intergovernmental mandates. .

umra also requires federal agencies to consider "a reasonable number" of regulatory alternatives and select the "least costly , most cost - effective or least burdensome alternative" that achieves the objectives of the rule .

umra requires the office of management and budget's ( omb's ) director to collect the executive branch agencies' written cost estimate statements and periodically forward copies to cbo's director .

it also directs omb to establish pilot programs in at least two federal agencies to test innovative regulatory approaches to reduce regulatory burdens on small governments , and provide congress a written annual report detailing compliance with the act by each agency for the preceding reporting period .

omb's director has delegated these responsibilities to its office of information and regulatory affairs ( oira ) .

most of these provisions were already in place when umra was adopted .

for example , executive order 12866 , issued in september 1993 , required agencies to provide oira with assessments of the costs and benefits of all economically significant proposed rules ( defined as having an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more ) , including some rules that were not mandates ; identify regulatory alternatives and explain why the planned regulatory action is preferable to other alternatives ; issue regulations that were cost - effective and impose the least burden on society ; and seek the views of state , local , and tribal officials before imposing regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect them .

in 1995 , umra's enactment was considered an historic , milestone event in the history of american intergovernmental relations .

for example , when signing umra , president bill clinton said , today , we are making history .

we are working to find the right balance for the 21 st century .

we are recognizing that the pendulum had swung too far , and that we have to rely on the initiative , the creativity , the determination , and the decisionmaking of people at the state and local level to carry much of the load for america as we move into the 21 st century .

since umra's enactment , parties participating in its implementation and researchers in the academic community , policy research institutes , and nonpartisan government agencies have reached different conclusions concerning the extent of umra's impact on intergovernmental relations and whether umra should be amended .

state and local government officials and federalism scholars generally view umra as having a limited , though positive , impact on intergovernmental relations .

in their view , the federal government has continued to expand its authority through the "carrots" of increased federal assistance and the "sticks" of grant conditions , preemptions , mandates , and administrative rulemaking .

facing what they view as a seemingly ever growing federal influence in american governance , they generally advocate a broadening of umra's coverage to enhance its impact , emphasizing the need to include conditions of grant assistance and a broader range of federal agency rulemaking , including rules issued by independent regulatory agencies .

other organizations , representing various environmental and social groups , argue that umra's coverage does not need to be broadened .

in their view , umra has accomplished its goals of fostering improved intergovernmental relations and ensuring that when congress votes on major federal mandates it is aware of the costs imposed by the legislation .

they assert that umra's current limits on coverage should be maintained or reinforced by adding exclusions for mandates regarding public health , safety , workers' rights , environmental protection , and the disabled .

during the 111 th congress , umra received increased attention as congress considered various proposals to reform health care .

governors , for example , expressed opposition to proposals that would have required states to contribute toward the cost of expanding medicaid eligibility , asserting that the expansion could inflate state deficits and impose on states what tennessee governor philip bredesen reportedly described as the "mother of all unfunded mandates. .

as mentioned previously , at that time , cbo had determined that umra provisions did not apply to medicaid's conditions of federal assistance because , in its view , states had "significant flexibility to make programmatic adjustments in their medicaid programs to accommodate" new federal requirements .

following the supreme court's ruling in national federation of independent business ( nfib ) v. sebelius ( june 28 , 2012 ) , cbo indicated that umra's provisions may apply to changes in "the stringency of conditions" or reductions in funding for "certain large mandatory programs … if the affected governments lack the flexibility to alter the programs. .

as discussed previously , h.r .

300 , the unfunded mandates information and transparency act of 2019 , would require cbo to assess the prospective costs of changes in conditions of federal financial assistance when requested by the chair or ranking member of a committee ; broaden umra's coverage to include assessments of indirect as well as direct costs by amending the definition of direct costs to include forgone profits , costs passed onto consumers or other entities , and , to the extent practicable , behavioral changes ; expand the scope of reporting requirements to include regulations imposed by most independent regulatory agencies ; make private - sector mandates subject to a substantive point of order ; establish principles for federal agencies to follow when assessing the effects of regulations on state and local governments and the private sector , including requiring the agency to identify the problem it seeks to address , determining whether existing laws or regulations could be modified to address the problem , identifying alternatives , and designing regulations in the most cost - effective manner available ; expand the scope of cost statements accompanying significant regulatory actions to include , among other requirements , a reasonably detailed description of the need for the proposed rulemaking or final rule and an explanation of how the proposed rulemaking or final rule will meet that need ; an assessment of the potential costs and benefits of the proposed rulemaking or final rule ; estimates of the mandate's future compliance costs and any disproportionate budgetary effects upon any particular regions of the nation or state , local , or tribal governments ; a detailed description of the agency's consultation with the private sector or elected representatives of the affected state , local , or tribal governments ; and a detailed summary of how the agency complied with each of the regulatory principles included in the bill ; no longer allow a federal agency to forgo umra analysis because the agency published a rule without first issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking ; require federal agencies to meet enhanced levels of consultation with state , local , and tribal governments and the private sector before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking or a final rule ; and require federal agencies to conduct a retrospective analysis of the costs and benefits of an existing regulation when requested by the chair or ranking member of a committee .

advocates argue that these reforms will "improve the quality of congressional deliberations and ... enhance the ability of congress , federal agencies , and the public to identify federal mandates that may impose undue harm on state , local , and tribal governments and the private sector. .

opponents argue that these reforms are "an assault on the nation's health , safety , and environmental protections , would erect new barriers to unnecessarily slow down the regulatory process , and would give regulated industries an unfair advantage to water down consumer protections. .

underlying disagreements over umra's future are fundamentally different values concerning american federalism .

one view emphasizes the importance of freeing state and local government officials from the constraints brought about by the directives and costs associated with federal mandates so they can experiment with innovative ways to achieve results with greater efficiency and cost effectiveness .

this view focuses on the positive effect active state and local governments can have in promoting a sense of state and community responsibility and self - reliance , encouraging participation and civic responsibility by allowing more people to become involved in public questions , adapting public programs to state and local needs and conditions , and reducing the political turmoil that sometimes results from single policies that govern the entire nation .

another view emphasizes the federal government's responsibility to ensure that all citizens are afforded minimum levels of essential government services .

this view focuses on the propensity of states to restrict governmental services because they compete with one another for businesses and taxpaying residents ; the variation in state fiscal capacities that makes it difficult for some states to provide certain governmental services even though they might have the political will to do so ; and the propensity of states to have different views concerning what services are essential and what constitutes a sufficient level of essential government services .

given these disagreements over fundamental values , it is perhaps not surprising that there are differences of opinion concerning umra's future .

using president clinton's words , debates over umra's future are more than just arguments over who will pay for what ; they are also about finding "the right balance" for american federalism in the 21 st century .

appendix a .

the rise of unfunded mandates as a national issue and umra's legislative history unfunded mandates became a national issue during the 1980s as state and local government officials and their affiliated public interest groups , led by the national league of cities ( nlc ) , u.s. conference of mayors ( uscm ) , and national association of counties ( naco ) , began an intensive lobbying effort to limit unfunded intergovernmental mandates .

their efforts were supported by various business organizations , led by the u.s. chamber of commerce , which opposed the imposition of unfunded mandates on both state and local governments and the private sector , particularly mandates issued through federal rules .

increased number and cost of unfunded mandates state and local government officials became involved in the issue of unfunded federal mandates during the 1980s primarily because the number and costs of unfunded intergovernmental mandates were increasing and , by then , nearly every community in the nation had become subject to their effects .

for example , acir reported that during the 1980s the costs of unfunded intergovernmental mandates were increasing at a rate faster than federal assistance .

acir also identified 63 federal statutes as of 1990 that , in its view , imposed "major" restrictions or costs on state and local governments .

many of the statutes involved civil rights , consumer protection , improved health and safety , and environmental protection .

only 2 of the 63 statutes it identified , the davis - bacon act of 1931 and hatch act of 1940 , were enacted prior to 1964 , 9 were enacted during the 1960s , 25 during the 1970s , 21 during the 1980s , and 6 in 1990 .

a study completed by the clinton administration's national performance review identified 172 laws in force that imposed requirements ( regardless of the magnitude of their impact ) on state and local governments as of december 1992 .

some of the major federal statutes adopted during the 1970s that imposed relatively costly federal mandates on state and local governments were the equal employment opportunity act of 1972 , which extended the prohibitions against discrimination in employment contained in the civil rights act of 1964 to state and local government employment ; the fair labor standards act amendments of 1974 , which extended the prohibitions against age discrimination in the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 to state and local government employment ; and the public utilities regulatory policy act of 1978 , which established federal requirements concerning the pricing of electricity and natural gas .

one of the more costly federal mandates enacted during the 1970s was section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 .

it prohibited discrimination against handicapped persons in federally assisted programs .

cbo estimated that it would require states and localities to spend $6.8 billion over 30 years to equip buses with wheelchair lifts , to install elevators in subway systems , and to expand access to public transit systems for the physically disabled .

three of the more costly unfunded federal mandates adopted during the 1980s were the safe drinking water act amendments of 1986 ( which was estimated to impose an additional cost of between $2 billion and $3 billion on state and local governments to improve public water systems ) ; the asbestos hazard emergency response act of 1986 ( which required schools to remove hazardous asbestos at an estimated cost of $3.15 billion over 30 years ) ; and the water quality act of 1987 ( which was estimated to cost states and localities about $12 billion in capital costs for wastewater treatment ) .

acir estimated that new federal mandates adopted between 1983 and 1990 cost state and local governments between $8.9 billion and $12.7 billion , depending on the definition of mandate used ; in fy1991 , federal mandates imposed estimated costs of between $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion on state and local governments ; and additional mandates , not included in these estimates , were scheduled to take effect in the years ahead .

acir suggested that the expansion of federal intergovernmental mandates during the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s fundamentally changed the nature of intergovernmental relations in the united states: during the 1960s and 1970s , state and local governments for the first time were brought under extensive federal regulatory controls.... over this period , national controls have been adopted affecting public functions and services ranging from automobile inspection , animal preservation and college athletics to waste treatment and waste disposal .

in field after field the power to set standards and determine methods of compliance has shifted from the states and localities to washington .

state and local governments seek relief from unfunded mandates edward i. koch , then mayor of new york city and a former member of congress , was one of the first public officials to highlight the mandate issue .

in 1980 , he authored an article criticizing what he called "the mandate millstone. .

he noted that as a member of congress he voted for many federal mandates "with every confidence that we were enacting sensible permanent solutions to critical problems" but now that he was a mayor he had come to realize that "over the past decade , a maze of complex statutory and administrative directives has come to threaten both the initiative and the financial health of local governments throughout the country. .

the continued growth in the number and cost of federal mandates during the 1980s and early 1990s generated renewed and heightened opposition from state and local government officials and their affiliated public interest groups .

this opposition culminated in the national unfunded mandates ( num ) day initiative , sponsored by the nlc , uscm , naco , and international city / county management association .

held on october 27 , 1993 , local government officials across the nation held press conferences and public forums criticizing unfunded mandates , and released a study of the costs imposed by federal mandates on local governments .

over 300 cities and 128 counties participated in the study , which , when extrapolated nationally , estimated that federal mandates imposed additional costs of $6.5 billion annually for cities and $4.8 billion annually for counties .

the num day methodology used to estimate the costs of unfunded federal mandates was later challenged because of the absence of independent validation of local government submissions and the nonrandom nature of the participating jurisdictions .

however , politically , num day was considered a success by its organizers for two reasons .

first , it attracted unprecedented media attention to the issue of unfunded federal mandates .

for example , the number of newspaper articles discussing unfunded federal mandates increased from 22 in 1992 , to 179 in 1993 , and to 836 in 1994 .

second , it increased congressional awareness of state and local government concerns about unfunded mandates .

for example , on january 5 , 1995 , senator john glenn mentioned num day as having an impact on congressional awareness of unfunded mandates at a senate congressional hearing on s. 1 — the unfunded mandate reform act: on october 27 , 1993 , state and local elected officials from all over the nation came to washington and declared that day — "national unfunded mandates day. .

these officials conveyed a powerful message to congress and the clinton administration on the need for federal mandate reform and relief .

they raised four major objections to unfunded federal mandates .

first , unfunded federal mandates impose unreasonable fiscal burdens on their budgets ; second , they limit state and local government flexibility to address more pressing local problems like crime and education ; third , federal mandates too often come in a "one - size - fits - all" box that stifles the development of more innovative local efforts — efforts that ultimately may be more effective in solving the problem the federal mandate is meant to address ; and fourth , they allow congress to get credit for passing some worthy mandate or program , while leaving state and local governments with the difficult tasks of cutting services or raising taxes in order to pay for it .

state and local government officials continued to lobby congress for mandate relief legislation and coordinated their efforts to increase public awareness of their concerns .

for example , on march 21 , 1994 , state and local government officials across the nation held town hall meetings and their affiliated public interest groups sponsored a rally on the capitol steps to draw media attention to their concerns about unfunded federal mandates .

the nlc and state municipal leagues across the country also declared october 24-30 , 1994 , unfunded mandates week , which also generated considerable media coverage .

the initial congressional response the efforts of state and local government officials appeared to have an effect on congressional legislative activity concerning unfunded federal mandates .

during the 102 nd congress ( 1991-1992 ) , 12 federal mandate relief bills were introduced in the house and 10 were introduced in the senate .

all of these bills failed to be reported out of committee , and only one had a congressional hearing .

during the first session of the 103 rd congress ( 1993 ) , 32 federal mandate relief bills were introduced and one of them , s. 993 , the federal mandate accountability and reform act of 1994 cosponsored by senators john glenn and dirk kempthorne , was reported by the senate governmental affairs committee on june 16 , 1994 .

it contained several provisions that were later in umra , and included an amendment offered by senator byron dorgan "to include the private sector under the cbo and committee mandate cost analysis requirements of title i of s. 993 , and a glenn amendment to allow cbo to waive the private - sector cost analysis if cbo cannot make a "reasonable estimate" of the bills cost. .

the bill was considered by the senate on october 6 , 1994 , without a time agreement .

after the introduction of several amendments and some debate , the senate proceeded to other issues and adjourned without voting on the measure .

the house government operations committee also reported a bill , h.r .

5128 , the federal mandates relief for state and local government act of 1994 , sponsored by representative john conyers jr. , on october 5 , 1994 .

it was similar to s. 993 , but its approval was delayed , reportedly due to concerns raised by several senior democratic members worried that mandate legislation might make it more difficult to adopt laws to protect the environment and address social issues .

congress adjourned before the bill could move to the floor for consideration .

core federalism principles debated during umra's consideration the republican party gained control of the house of representatives for the first time in 40 years following the congressional elections held on november 8 , 1994 .

they also achieved a slim majority in the senate as well .

mandate reform was a key provision in the republican party's "contract with america. .

perhaps reflecting its importance to the republican leadership , the prospective senate majority leader , senator robert dole , designated a revised unfunded mandate relief bill , cosponsored by senators kempthorne and glenn and introduced on january 4 , 1995 , the opening day of the new congress , as s. 1 , the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 .

the senate governmental affairs committee and senate budget committee held a joint hearing on the bill the following day and it was reported out of the senate governmental affairs committee with three amendments ( 9 to 4 ) on january 9 , 1995 , and out of the senate budget committee with four amendments ( 21-0 ) also on january 9 , 1995 .

to expedite senate floor consideration , neither committee filed a committee report .

instead , the committee chairs , senator william roth jr. on behalf of the senate governmental affairs committee and senator pete domenici on behalf of the senate budget committee , each submitted a chairman's statement for insertion into the congressional record .

when senate floor consideration commenced on january 12 , 1995 , senator robert byrd objected to several features of the way the legislation was being handled , including the absence of a committee report and the pace of consideration .

in addition , senators introduced 228 amendments to the bill .

floor debate lasted for more than two weeks .

during floor debate , senator kempthorne argued that the bill should be adopted out of a sense of fairness to state and local governments and as a commitment to federalism principles: under this legislation , we are acknowledging for the first time , in a meaningful way , that there must be limits on the federal government's propensity to impose costly mandates on other levels of government .

as the representatives of those governments have very effectively demonstrated , this is a real problem .

cities , for example , generally are fortunate if they have adequate resources just to meet their own local responsibilities .

unfunded federal mandates have put a real strain on those resources .

this has been the practice of the federal government for the past several decades , but in recent years it has mushroomed into an intolerable burden .

this has been due , at least in part , to the federal government's own budget crisis .

in the past , if congress felt that a particular problem warranted a national solution , it would often fund that solution with federal dollars .

mandates imposed on state and local governments could frequently be offset with generous federal grants .

but the federal government no longer has the money to fund the governmental actions it wishes to see accomplished throughout the country .

in fact , it hasn't had the money to do this for many years .

instead , it borrowed for a long time , to cover those costs .

but now the federal deficit is so large , that the only alternative left for imposing so - called national solutions is to impose unfunded mandates... .

the state legislators and governors know this .

this is why they feel so strongly that legislation regarding this practice must first be in place , before they are asked to ratify a balanced budget amendment .

otherwise , in the drive to achieve a balance federal budget , congress might be tempted to mandate that state and local governments shall pick up many of the costs that were formerly federal .

this is why any effort to add a sunset provision to this bill ought to be opposed .

our commitment to protect federalism ought to be permanent .

s. 1 is designed to put in place just such a mechanism .

in this regard , it may truly be called balanced legislation .

first of all , it helps bring our system of federalism back into balance , by serving as a check against the easy imposition of unfunded mandates .

and , second , it does so in a way that strikes a balance between restraining the growth of mandates and recognizing that there may be legitimate exceptions .

senator frank lautenberg was among those opposing umra .

he argued that the bill should be defeated because , among other things , the federal government has an obligation to set national standards to protect the environment and ensure the quality of life for all americans: halting interstate pollution is an important responsibility of the federal government .

and i am concerned that this act may have a chilling effect on future federal environmental legislation .

another issue that may get loss in this debate is the benefit that states and their citizens derive from federal mandates — even those not fully funded .

states may say , we know how best to care for our citizens ; a program that may be good for new jersey , may not be good for idaho or ohio .

but , i would argue that there is a broader national interest in some very fundamental issues which transcend that premise .

i would argue that historically , not all states have provided a floor of satisfactory minimum decency standards for their citizens and that , as a democratic and fair society , we should worry about that .

further , as a practical matter , i would argue that the policies of one state in a society such as ours will certainly affect citizens and taxpayers of another state just as certainly as unfunded mandates can .

let us look at our welfare system .

there has been a lot of discussion about turning welfare over to the states , with few or virtually no federal guidelines or requirements .

what would happen if we do that ? .

would we see a movement of the disadvantaged between states , putting a heavier burden on the citizens of a state that provides more generous benefits ? .

let us look at occupational safety , or environmental regulation .

with a patchwork of differing standards across the states , would we see a migration of factories and jobs to states with lower standards ? .

i think so .

but by mandating floors in environmental and workplace conditions , the federal government ensures that states will comply with minimal standards befitting a complex , interrelated , and decent society .

or let us look at gun control .

my state of new jersey generally has strong controls on guns .

but new jerseyans still suffer from an epidemic of gun violence – in no small measure because firearms come into new jersey from other states .

without strong national controls , this will remain a problem .

that is why we passed a ban on all assault weapons and why we passed the brady bill .

currently the federal government discourages a scenario whereby a given state decides not to enforce some worker health and safety laws as a way of lowering costs and attracting industry .

a state right next door might feel compelled to lower its standards in order to remain competitive .

in the absence of a federal standard , we would likely see a bidding war that lowers the quality of life for all americans .

these are some of a host of very fundamental , very basic , and even profound questions raised by the notion that we should never have unfunded mandates .

these are questions each member of the senate should consider long and hard , before moving to drastically curtail — or make impossible — any unfunded mandates .

after voting on 44 amendments and several cloture motions , the senate approved s. 1 on january 27 , 1995 , 86-10 .

one of the amendments approved by the senate was the "byrd look - back amendment," which is the only provision in umra that allows for the regulation of any mandates based on actual rather than estimated costs .

it provided that legislation containing intergovernmental mandates would be considered funded , and hence not subject to a point of order , if it authorized appropriations to cover the estimated direct costs of the intergovernmental mandate and incorporated a prescribed mechanism requiring further review if , in any fiscal year , congress did not appropriate funds sufficient to cover those costs .

under this mechanism , if the responsible federal agency determines that the appropriation provided was insufficient to cover the estimated direct costs of the mandate it shall notify the appropriate authorizing committees not later than 30 days after the start of the fiscal year and submit recommendations for either implementing a less costly mandate or making the mandate ineffective for the fiscal year .

the statutory mechanism must also include expedited procedures for the consideration of legislative recommendations to achieve these outcomes not later than 30 days after the recommendations are submitted to congress .

finally , the mechanism must provide that the mandate "shall be ineffective until such time as congress has completed action on the recommendations of the responsible federal agency. .

after senator robert byrd offered this amendment , the senate adopted it on january 26 , 1995 , 100-0 .

the house companion bill to s. 1 was h.r .

5 , the unfunded mandate reform act of 1995 , which was cosponsored by representatives william f. clinger jr. , rob portman , gary a. condit , and thomas m. davis .

it was reported by the house government reform and oversight committee , on january 13 , 1995 , by voice vote and without hearings .

floor consideration began on january 20 , 1995 .

numerous amendments were introduced by democratic members to add various exemptions to the bill , such as the health of children and the disabled , the disposal of nuclear waste , and child support enforcement .

these amendments were rejected on party - line votes .

on february 1 , 1995 , h.r .

5 was adopted , 360-74 , inserted into s. 1 as a house substitute , and sent to conference .

there were two major differences between the house and senate versions of s. 1 .

the house version did not include the byrd look - back amendment , and it permitted judicial review of federal agency compliance with the bill's provisions .

initially , house conferees refused to accept the byrd look - back amendment and senate conferees ; worried that outside parties could delay regulations for years by filing lawsuits , refused to accept judicial review of federal agency compliance with the bill's provisions .

negotiations continued for six weeks .

the deadlock over judicial review was ended by allowing judicial review of whether an appropriate analysis of mandate costs was done , but restricting the court's ability to second - guess the quality of the cost estimates .

the deadlock over the byrd look - back amendment ended when house conferees accepted its inclusion after being assured that its intent was to make certain that congress , rather than an executive agency , retained responsibility for setting policy .

the senate adopted the conference report , which renamed the bill the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 , on march 15 , 1995 , 91-9 , and the house adopted it the next day , 394-28 .

president bill clinton signed it on march 22 , 1995 .
