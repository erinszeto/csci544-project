administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) , the impact aid program is one of the oldest federal education programs , dating from 1950 .

impact aid , authorized under title viii of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea , p.l .

89-10 , as amended ) , compensates local educational agencies ( leas ) for "substantial and continuing financial burden" resulting from federal activities .

these activities include federal ownership of certain lands , as well as the enrollments in leas of children of parents who work or live on federal land ( eg , children of parents in the military and children living on indian lands ) .

the federal government provides compensation because these activities deprive leas of the ability to collect property or other taxes from these individuals ( eg , members of the armed forces living on military bases ) or their employers , even though the leas are obligated to provide free public education to their children .

thus impact aid is intended to compensate leas for the resulting loss of tax revenue .

the largest impact aid payment , section 8003 ( b ) payments ( also known as basic support payments or bsps ) , compensates leas for enrolling "federally connected" children .

these are children who reside with a parent who is a member of the armed forces living on or off federal property ; reside with a parent who is an accredited foreign military officer living on federal property ; reside on indian lands ; reside in low - rent public housing ; or reside with a parent who is a civilian working or living on federal land .

for fy2014 , section 8003 ( b ) payments accounted for $1.151 billion , approximately 89.3% of all funds appropriated for the impact aid program .

as section 8003 ( b ) payments account for the majority of all impact aid funding , this report primarily focuses on them .

the appendix provides a brief description of other payments made under the impact aid program .

the purpose of this report is to describe options for adjusting the timing of when impact aid appropriations become available for obligation to carry out section 8003 ( b ) .

at present , appropriations are often not available at the beginning of the school year .

this report begins by explaining how section 8003 ( b ) activities are currently funded through "budget year appropriations" and the effect that period of availability has on those activities .

it then discusses alternatives to providing funding through budget year appropriations , including forward funding and advance appropriations .

the final section analyzes the way in which adopting an alternative period of availability such as forward funding , advance appropriations , or a combination approach ( forward funding / advance appropriations ) would affect the appropriations process once it was fully implemented .

it also discusses the appropriations actions required to make these changes and the ways in which this would affect the annual appropriations process , both once the alternative period of availability was fully implemented , and also during the transition fiscal year .

in contrast to regular budget year appropriations for impact aid that fund a school year that is already underway , funding could be provided in the appropriations act for the fiscal year that precedes the school year for which they will be used .

in general , this alternative approach would provide appropriations a number of months in advance of when they would become available with budget year appropriations .

such a process would presumably allow leas to incorporate funding with more certainty in their planning process for the upcoming school year .

in addition , because of the lag in availability , if appropriations acts were delayed in any given year , leas presumably would not be adversely affected for the purposes of the upcoming school year .

while appropriations could be made available at any time , as specified in the appropriations act in which they are enacted , two such conventions have been used for certain other ed programs to accommodate the disconnect between the federal fiscal year and the school year — "advance appropriations" and "forward funding. .

the impact aid section 8003 ( b ) payment is the only k - 12 program administered by ed that receives $1 billion or more through the annual appropriations process that is not provided advance appropriations , forward funding , or a combination of the two .

although t he impact aid programs have generally been authorized to receive funding in appropriations acts on either of these bas es since 1968 , through ti tle iv , s ection 420 ( a ) , of the general education provisions act ( see below ) , no such appropriations are currently being provided with such timing: to the end of affording the responsible federal , state , and local officers adequate notice of available federal financial assistance for carrying out ongoing education activities and projects , appropriations for grants , contracts , or other payments under any applicable program are authorized to be included in the appropriations act for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year during which such activities and projects shall be carried out .

while any or all of the impact aid payments could be provided through forward funding or advance appropriations ( as discussed below ) , for the purposes of this report it is assumed that any change in appropriations would affect only the section 8003 ( b ) payments .

this section considers three different appropriations scenarios for impact aid section 8003 ( b ) payments that are an alternative to regular budget year appropriations: ( 1 ) providing forward funding for section 8003 ( b ) payments , ( 2 ) providing advance appropriations for section 8003 ( b ) payments , or ( 3 ) using both forward funding and advance appropriations to provide section 8003 ( b ) funding , as is done for other federal education programs such as title i - a grants to local educational agencies authorized by the esea or grants to states authorized under part b of the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) .

this section con siders each of these scenarios in terms of how each might affect the annual appropriations process once it were fully implemented , the appropriations actions required in the transition fiscal year , and various potential budget process issues that might arise during that transition .

please note that for discussion purposes , it is assumed that budget year appropriations would be provided on october 1 of the fiscal year corresponding to the appropriations bill , forward funding would be provided on july 1 of the year corresponding to the appropriations bill , and advance appropriations would be provided on the first day of the succeeding fiscal year .

as previously discussed , the esea would not have to be amended to permit the section 8003 ( b ) payments to receive forward funding or advance appropriations , as both funding mechanisms are already authorized for the impact aid account .

as was previously stated , impact aid is currently funded using regular budget year appropriations that first become available about one month after the start of the school year .

if section 8003 ( b ) payments were to be forward funded , however , funds would shift from being available in october to support the current school year to being available in july to support the upcoming school year .

for example , if section 8003 ( b ) continued to be funded through budget year appropriations for fy2015 , the funds would become available on october 1 , 2014 , and be used to support activities during the 2014-2015 school year .

if appropriations for section 8003 ( b ) were forwarded funded in fy2015 , funds would become available on july 1 , 2015 , and be used to support school activities during the 2015-2016 school year .

more specifically , such funds would typically be made available for the next 15 months , through september 30 , 2016 .

likewise , the following fiscal year , if all section 8003 ( b ) appropriations were forward funded , funds to support activities during the 2016-2017 school year would be provided through the fy2016 appropriations act to become available on july 1 , 2016 .

to change the impact aid program to be solely forward funded starting in fy2015 would essentially require double - funding the program in the transition year through the following appropriations actions .

first , the fy2015 appropriations would need to include the regular budget year appropriation that the program has historically received to fund activities in the 2014-2015 school year .

these would be available for obligation as of october 1 , 2014 .

otherwise , under the switch to forward funding , the program would be without an appropriation until july 1 , 2015 , leaving little to no funding for the 2014-2015 school year .

second , funds for the 2015-2016 school year would need to be forward funded to become available in the final months of fy2015 .

if the intent is to completely forward fund the section 8003 ( b ) payment , then the full amount required to level fund the payment would need to be appropriated using a forward funding period of availability .

that is , for the fy2015 appropriations process , the section 8003 ( b ) payment would need to be funded through both regular budget year appropriations and forward funding appropriations , a scenario that was arguably contemplated in title iv , section 420 ( b ) of the general education provisions act : in order to effect a transition to the timing of appropriation action authorized by subsection ( a ) of this section , the application of this section may result in the enactment , in a fiscal year , of separate appropriations for an applicable program ( whether in the same appropriations act or otherwise ) for two consecutive fiscal years .

the following scenario illustrates this potential transition .

for fy2014 , the section 8003 ( b ) payments were funded at $1.151 billion , so $2.302 billion would need to be provided for the program in fy2015 under this funding scenario ( $1.151 for regular budget year appropriations and $1.151 billion for forward funding ) .

in subsequent fiscal years , however , assuming the program remained forward funded ( and level - funded ) , the annual appropriation provided solely through forward funding would be $1.151 billion .

the increase in discretionary appropriations required to forward fund the section 8003 ( b ) payments in fy2015 would be counted against any statutory or procedural limits on discretionary spending applicable to that fiscal year .

in effect , this might require that the additional appropriations to forward fund the section 8003 ( b ) payments during this transition period be offset by reductions to another discretionary program .

alternatively , this transition period could be addressed by enacting a provision specifying that a certain amount , such as the double funding needed to switch to forward funding , is not to be counted for the purposes of budget enforcement .

in contrast to the regular budget year appropriations that are enacted to fund education activities for a school year that is already underway , advance appropriations are enacted prior to when that school year starts .

for example , budget year appropriations to fund the 2015-2016 school year would be enacted in the fy2016 appropriations act and become available as of october 1 , 2015 .

advance appropriations to fund the 2015-2016 school year , however , would be enacted one year in advance — in the appropriations act for the fiscal year starting october 1 , 2014 ( fy2015 ) — but not become available until october 1 , 2015 , one full fiscal year after the budget year .

the following fiscal year , advance appropriations for the 2016-2017 school year would be enacted in the fy2016 appropriations act but not become available until october 1 , 2016 .

changing appropriations for payments for federally connected children from regular budget year appropriations to advance appropriations requires a different set of actions , with a different set of costs , for a given fiscal year .

first , to change the section 8003 ( b ) payment to receive advance appropriations during the fy2015 appropriations process , the fy2015 l - hhs - ed appropriations bill would need to include the budget year appropriation that the program has historically received to cover program needs for the 2014-2015 school year .

that is , funds for the 2014-2015 school year would be available for obligation as of october 1 , 2014 , once enacted .

a switch to advance appropriations without also providing these budget year appropriations would leave the program without an appropriation until october 1 , 2015 , resulting in little to no funding for that school year .

second , advance appropriations for the 2015-2016 school year would also need to be provided in the fy2015 l - hhs - ed appropriations act , to become available on october 1 , 2015 .

if the intent is to completely fund needs for the 2015-2016 school year through advance appropriations , then the full appropriation for that program year would need to be provided in this way .

the budget process implications for a switch to advance appropriations also differ from those for forward funding .

the funding for advance appropriations for fy2016 included in the fy2015 appropriations bill would not count against any limits on fy2015 discretionary spending and would not require any double funding of section 8003 ( b ) payments in a single fiscal year .

such spending would count against the fy2016 limits , however , if provided on the schedule considered in this scenario .

it would also require that any procedural limit on advance appropriations , which is generally determined each year during the consideration of the congressional budget resolution , allows such appropriations for the impact aid account and be set at a level sufficient to accommodate appropriations for the section 8003 ( b ) payments .

appropriations for section 8003 ( b ) payments could also be made using a combination of forward funding and advance appropriations , as has been the practice for other federal education programs such as esea , title i - a and idea , part b .

under this approach , only the portion of funding needed during the summer months would be forward funded , while the rest would be advance appropriated to become available after the start of the following fiscal year .

for example , for the 2015-2016 school year , in the fy2015 appropriations act , a portion ( eg , 25% ) of the section 8003 ( b ) payments would be forward funded and become available on july 1 , 2015 , while the rest ( eg , 75% ) would be advance appropriated and become available three months later , on october 1 , 2015 .

this combination of advance appropriations and forward funding would be appropriated each fiscal year to fund payments for the upcoming school year .

if this change were made during the fy2015 appropriations process , appropriations subject to the applicable fy2015 limits would be needed to fund both the 2014-2015 school year through budget year appropriations , as well as whatever percentage of the 2015-2016 school year was determined to be necessary through forward funding .

the amount provided through forward funding could be set at any appropriate percentage of the total payment ( eg , 25% , 50% , 75% ) , with the remainder for the 2015-2016 school year being provided through advance appropriations .

for example , if 25% of the funds were provided through forward funding and 75% were provided through advance appropriations , for fy2015 $1.439 billion would need to be provided in discretionary appropriations — $1.151 billion in budget year appropriations to support activities during the 2014-2015 school year and $288 million ( 25% of the budget year appropriations amount ) for forward funding — and $863 million would need to be included in advance appropriations for fy2016 .

this combination approach involves , to a lesser degree , the same budget process implications that apply to forward funding and advance appropriations .

while a combination approach would avoid the need for double funding in that transition year , a lesser one - time increase over the typical amount appropriated subject to the applicable limits would still occur .

because the portion that is forward funded would be counted against any statutory or procedural limits on discretionary spending , the additional appropriations to forward fund the section 8003 ( b ) payments during this transition period might need to be effectively offset by reductions in another discretionary program .

in subsequent fiscal years , only the forward funding amount would need to be appropriated in the budget year , and the remainder could be advance appropriated .

at the same time , any limits on advance appropriations established through the budget resolution would need to be altered to accommodate advance appropriations for the portion of section 8003 ( b ) payments funded in this way .

as was previously mentioned , this transition period could also be addressed by enacting a provision specifying that a certain amount , such as the double funding , is not to be counted for the purposes of budget enforcement .

 table 1 summarizes the key elements of current law and transitions to each of the three approaches discussed above .

it is assumed that the alternative funding approaches would be applied in the fy2015 appropriations act .

the table details how much discretionary funding would be needed in fy2015 and the level of advance appropriations for fy2016 that would need to be included in the fy2015 appropriations act , assuming the section 8003 ( b ) payment remains level funded .

it is also assumed that regardless of the approach taken , the fy2015 appropriations act would provide level funding for section 8003 ( b ) payments for the 2014-2015 school year , as well as the 2015-2016 school year .

for the combination approach , it assumes a distribution of 25% forward funding and 75% advance appropriations .

title viii of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea , p.l .

89-10 , as amended ) authorizes several types of impact aid payments .

these include payments made under section 8002 , section 8003 , section 8007 , and section 8008 .

each of these types of payments is discussed briefly below .

section 8002 section 8002 compensates leas for the federal ownership of certain property .

to qualify for compensation , the federal government must have acquired the property , in general , after 1938 , and the assessed value of the land at the time it was acquired must have represented at least 10% of the assessed value of all an lea's real property .

about 216 leas receive section 8002 payments annually .

payments are usually used by leas for general operating expenses ( eg , teacher salaries , books , supplies , and utilities ) .

for fy2014 , $66.8 million was appropriated for section 8002 , and payments to leas are expected to range from $150 to $5.0 million .

section 8003 section 8003 compensates leas for enrolling "federally connected" children .

these are children who reside with a parent who is a member of the armed forces living on or off federal property ; reside with a parent who is an accredited foreign military officer living on federal property ; reside on indian lands ; reside in low - rent public housing ; or reside with a parent who is a civilian working or living on federal land .

two payments are made under section 8003 .

section 8003 ( b ) authorizes "basic support payments" for federally connected children .

in fy2014 , 1,151 leas are eligible to receive payments under section 8003 ( b ) .

these leas serve about 930,000 federally connected students .

in fy2014 , $1.151 billion was appropriated for section 8003 ( b ) payments , and lea payments are expected to range from $66 to $53.9 million .

section 8003 ( d ) authorizes additional payments to leas based on the number of certain federally connected children with disabilities who are eligible to receive services under the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) .

more specifically , payments are limited to certain idea - eligible children , most notably those whose parents are members of the armed forces ( residing on or off military bases ) and those residing on indian lands .

in fy2014 , $48.3 million was appropriated for section 8003 ( d ) payments from which about 888 leas are expected to receive payments , ranging from $512 to $1.2 million .

section 8007 section 8007 provides funds for construction and facilities upgrading to certain leas serving high percentages of children living on indian lands or children of military parents .

these funds are used to make formula and competitive grants .

in fy2014 , per provisions included in the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l .

113-76 ) , section 8007 grants will be awarded only by formula .

in fy2014 , $17.4 million was provided for section 8007 payments .

it is estimated that 174 leas will receive formula grants , ranging from $480 to $1.8 million .

section 8008 section 8008 provides funds for emergency repairs and comprehensive capital improvements to 12 schools that ed currently owns but leas operate and use to serve federally connected military dependent children .

statutory language requires ed to transfer ownership of these facilities to leas or other entities .

in fy2014 , $4.8 million was provided for section 8008 .
