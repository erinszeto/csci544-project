rs21787 - - foreign trade effects of an alaskan natural gas pipeline march 30 , 200 .

this report examines the policy implications for the u.s. current account balance of the construction of natural gas pipeline from alaska to the lower 48 states .

the 108th congress hasincluded in h.r .

6 , the omnibus energy bill , provisions which provide incentives for the construction of analaska natural gas pipeline .

a pipeline would link currentlyunavailable alaskan gas supplies to the consuming market .

this report analyzes the possible expansion orcontraction of natural gas imports as a result of constructing , or notconstructing , an alaskan pipeline , within the framework of the national energy modeling system ( nems ) .

 ( 1 ) nems is used by the eia as a tool to forecast futureenergy trends asincluded in the aeo .

 ( 2 ) recently , the eia haspublished analyses of a variety of restricted natural gas supply scenarios including the non - availability of an alaskanatural gas pipeline .

 ( 3 ) .

the aeo reference case forecast is the eia's baseline estimate of the state of energy markets in the out years to 2025 .

 ( 4 ) the reference case forecast projects naturalgas prices to be highenough after 2009 to begin construction of an alaska natural gas pipeline .

 ( 5 ) in the forecast , natural gas deliveries come on stream from a pipeline in 2018with full capacity deliveriesbecoming available near the end of the forecast period , in 2024 .

if policy based incentives to construct a pipelinebecome available , it is possible that a pipeline might be constructedsooner than in the aeo reference case altering the results presented in this report .

as a result of the constructionand delivery time line assumed in the reference case , the forecasts withand without the construction of a pipeline are virtually identical until 2018 .

this report will examine differencesin the forecasts for the years 2020 and 2025 .

 ( 6 ) to focus on the international trade effects of the pipeline , likely variations in the current account balance in 2020 and 2025 will be calculated .

the current account balance is a basicmeasure of a nation's foreign trade position and is defined as the nation's exports of goods and services minus thenation's imports of goods and services .

when a nation's exportsexceed its imports , the country has a current account surplus .

when a nation's imports exceed its exports , the nationhas a current account deficit .

the eia forecasts do not includeestimates of the cost of constructing the pipeline , or any trade effects that might come about as a result of sourcingdecisions for the steel and other goods and services used in theconstruction process .

the current account balance effects described in this report are limited to the natural gas thata pipeline would deliver to the market .

in the aeo reference case , an alaska natural gas pipeline is expected to deliver approximately 2 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , about 7% of yearly consumption , of gas per year by the time itreaches full capacity operation in 2024 .

although deliveries are forecast to begin in 2018 , they are expected to beginat approximately 0.8 tcf per year and grow to full capacity .

by 2020 the reference case forecast projects a gap between total domestic production , 23.89 tcf , and total demand , 30.36 tcf , requiring imports of 6.47 tcf .

the forecast projects that by2020 pipeline natural gas imports from canada will be in decline compared to 2003 level .

the u.s. imported 3.4tcf of natural gas from canada in 2003 , about 97% of importrequirements .

by 2020 canadian imports are expected to decline to 2.5 tcf , even though total u.s. importrequirement will have nearly doubled over 2003 levels .

the reference forecastprojects that essentially all of the additional u.s. import requirements will come from liquefied natural gas ( lng ) .

the values cited in the forecast are determined in conjunction withthe forecast wellhead price of natural gas in 2020 which is expected to reach $4.28 per thousand cubic feet in realterms , which would be over $8.00 per thousand cubic feet in nominalterms .

 ( 7 ) by 2025 , the reference case projects total domestic production to reach 24.09 tcf and total demand to reach 31.33 tcf with a gap of 7.24 tcf to be filled by imports .

in 2025 , canadianpipeline imports are projected to be 2.56 tcf with lng again filling most of the remaining import gap .

the referencecase forecast projects lng demand growing from 2.16 tcf in 2010to 4.14 tcf in 2020 and 4.8 tcf in 2025 .

by 2025 , the reference case projects a wellhead natural gas price of $4.40per thousand cubic feet in real terms , translating to a nominal price ofabout $8.40 .

 ( 8 ) in contrast to the reference case forecast , the no pipeline case assumes that a natural gas pipeline from alaska is not constructed .

as a result , alaskan natural gas production , whichtotaled about 0.51 tcf in 2003 , is projected to rise to 0.72 tcf in 2020 and 0.51 tcf in 2025 , less than the 2.29 tcf and2.71 tcf for the same years in the reference case .

 ( 9 ) since imports areexpected to fill the gap between u.s. domestic production and total demand , a simple analysis might suggest thatthe no pipeline case would show an approximate 2 tcf increase inimports to compensate for no delivery of alaskan gas .

this is not the case , however .

the unavailability of alaskannatural gas through the pipeline leads to price increases in the naturalgas market .

these price increases reduce the total demand for natural gas , as well as providing an incentive forproducers both in the u.s. and canada to increase production .

as aresult of these adjustments , the gas not available because of a lack of a pipeline from alaska is not replaced byimports on a one to one basis in the eia analysis .

the increases in imports attributable to the lack of a natural gas pipeline from alaska are 0.72 tcf in 2020 , and 0.63 tcf in 2025 as projected in the eia no pipeline case .

to determinethe effect of these projected increases in natural gas imports , these quantities must be multiplied by appropriateprices .

the eia publishes import prices as part of the aeo referencecase , but not for the no pipeline case .

as an approximation of the import price in the no pipeline case , crs hascomputed prices based on the eia reference case prices .

 ( 10 ) for 2020 , theestimated import price is $4.81 per thousand cubic feet , and for 2025 it is $4.90 per thousand cubic feet .

based onthese values for price and quantity of imported natural gas , estimatedincreases in the value of natural gas imports as a result of lack of construction of a pipeline would be approximately$3.46 billion in 2020 and $3.09 billion in 2025 .

 ( 11 ) to put theseprojected increases in imports in perspective , they are less than 1% of the current account deficit in 2002 , the yearto which the price of natural gas is set in the eia forecasts .

although these values represent potential increases in the current account deficits in 2020 and 2025 ( or reductions in the surpluses ) , they might well be either increased or decreased byother related effects in the economy that might result from higher projected natural gas prices .

for example,industrial demand for natural gas is projected to decrease .

this could meanthat the u.s. production of chemicals , especially those that have natural gas as a large cost component , might bereduced .

this might mean greater imports of fertilizers and otherchemicals bringing additional pressure on the current account balance .

on the other hand , if the higher natural gasprices resulted in general reductions in income and employment in theunited states , that might imply lower imports of consumer goods and services , improving the current accountbalance .

the eia analysis , which focuses on energy issues , does notprovide a detailed picture of all the secondary economic effects of higher natural gas prices as they alter relationshipsin the economy as a whole .

an alaska natural gas pipeline is projected to account for about 2 tcf of delivered gas in 2025 when operating at full capacity , but imports increase by only 0.63 tcf in that year as a resultof the lack of pipeline construction .

in 2020 , a pipeline is projected to deliver about 1.6 tcf , reflecting the build - upof delivered gas as operation begins in 2018 , but imports increase byonly 0.72 tcf in the forecasts if no pipeline is constructed .

it might appear that 1.37 tcf of gas in 2025 , and almost1 tcf in 2020 , has disappeared .

the lost volumes can be accounted forby examining the effects of the higher projected prices of natural gas in 2025 and 2020 on aggregate demand andsupply .

as a likely result of higher prices , projected natural gas demand is lower in the no pipeline case , both in 2025 and in 2020 .

aggregate demand is 0.71 tcf lower in 2025 and 0.62 tcflower in 2020 compared to the reference case .

in a 2025 comparison of demand patterns in the reference case andthe no alaska pipeline case , all sectors reduce their consumption , butthe largest declines are in the industrial and electric generators at 0.11 tcf ( 1% ) and 0.31 tcf ( 3.7% ) , respectively .

in comparison , the residential and commercial sectors reduced theirconsumption by only 0.06 tcf ( 0.5% ) in total .

fuel switching and reduced demand due to curtailed production arelikely explanations for the relatively larger reductions in the industrialand electric generator sectors .

the pattern of reduced consumption is similar in 2020 .

residential and commercial consumption each decline about 1% , while industrial demand declines by about 2% and demandfrom electric generators falls by 2.7% .

on the production side of the market , because of the incentive of higher prices , domestic onshore and offshore production of natural gas in the lower 48 states increases , by 0.23 tcf in2020 and 0.67 tcf in 2025 .

for 2025 , if the reduced demand of 0.71 tcf is added to the increased lower 48 statesproduction of 0.67 tcf the total is 1.38 tcf .

if 1.38 tcf is added to theextra imports of 0.63 tcf the total is approximately equal to the 2 tcf that is not delivered through an alaskanpipeline .

for 2020 , the reduction in demand is 0.72 tcf and the addedproduction projected from onshore and offshore production in the lower 48 states is 0.28 tcf which , when added,equals 1 tcf .

imports are projected to increase by 0.72 tcf in 2020 whichwhen added to the 1 tcf demand reduction and lower 48 state increased production equals 1.72 tcf which again isapproximately equal to the amount of gas not delivered as a result of noconstruction of an alaska pipeline .

 ( 12 ) .

in the aeo reference case , an alaska natural gas pipeline is projected to begin deliveries in 2018 and achieve full capacity delivery of about 2 tcf of gas per year to market when itachieves full capacity operation in 2025 .

this quantity of natural gas , subtracted from the market in the no pipelinecase , is sufficient to alter projected market prices .

in the no pipelinecase , increases in the price of natural gas cause changes in consumption and production of gas , as well as thecomposition of gas sources .

these price changes and resultant changessuggest that , in the forecast , energy markets compensate for the lack of alaskan gas supplies in a variety of ways .

as a result , the forecast increase in gas imports is not as great as theloss in deliveries from the pipeline if it is not constructed .
