the balanced budget act of 1997 ( p.l .

105-33 , bba - 97 ) established the state children's health insurance program ( schip ) under a new title xxi of the social security act .

schip builds on medicaid by providing health care coverage to low - income , uninsured children in families with incomes above applicable medicaid income standards .

the latest official numbers show that schip enrollment reached a total of nearly 7.4 million children and nearly 335,000 adults in fy2008 .

in fy2008 , federal schip spending totaled $7.0 billion , with states' projected spending expected to equal $7.9 billion in fy2009 .

in bba 97 , congress authorized and appropriated funds for fy1998-fy2007 , with no federal appropriations slated for fy2008 and beyond .

the absence of future federal appropriations triggered schip legislative attention during the 110 th congress , as reviewed in the next section .

after this brief summary of past legislative action , the report provides a description of the children's health insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 ( chipra 2009 , h.r .

2 ) as passed in the house on january 14 , 2009 , and in the senate on january 29 , 2009 .

the overall structure of chipra 2009 is similar to its two predecessors , h.r .

976 and h.r .

3963 from the 110 th congress .

most of this report summarizes changes to current law across the major provisions of chipra 2009 .

where the provisions of the house and senate versions are identical , the references in this report are simply to "chipra 2009. .

where the provisions differ , the house and senate versions are described separately .

during the 110 th congress , a number of schip bills saw legislative action .

a majority of the schip changes enacted in public laws included provisions to add additional appropriations to schip , but did not make any major substantive changes to the program .

the 110 th congress enacted provisions to: address certain states' shortfalls in fy2007 federal schip funding ( u.s. troop readiness , veterans' care , katrina recovery , and iraq accountability appropriations act , 2007 , p.l .

110-28 ) ; provide temporary fy2008 appropriations for schip through december 31 , 2007 through continuing resolutions ( p.l .

110-92 , p.l .

110-116 , p.l .

110-137 , p.l .

110-149 ) ; and provide additional appropriations through march 31 , 2009 ( the medicare , medicaid , and schip extension act of 2007 , p.l .

110-173 ) .

the 110 th congress also considered schip reauthorization legislation that would have made important changes to medicaid and schip .

numerous bills were introduced , and two that were passed by congress ( h.r .

976 and h.r .

3963 ) were vetoed by president bush .

table 1 includes a timeline of the legislative floor action on the major schip reauthorization bills during 2007 .

the children's health insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 ( chipra 2009 , h.r .

2 ) was passed in the house on january 14 , 2009 , and in the senate on january 29 , 2009 .

the overall structure of chipra 2009 is similar to its two predecessors ( h.r .

976 and h.r .

3963 from the 110 th congress ) .

the remainder of this report summarizes changes to current law across the major provisions of chipra 2009 .

cost estimates from the congressional budget office ( cbo ) indicated that the house - passed version of h.r .

2 would increase outlays by $32.3 billion over 5 years and by $65.4 billion over 10 years .

those costs would be offset by increases in federal tobacco taxes ( mostly from an increase in the federal tax by 61 cents per pack of cigarettes ) and other changes , which the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) estimated would increase on - budget revenue by $32.5 billion over 5 years and by $65.6 billion over 10 years .

cbo cost estimates initially indicated that the senate version would increase outlays by $32.8 billion over 5 years and by $66.1 billion over 10 years .

like the house version , those costs would be offset by increases in federal tobacco taxes , which were estimated to increase on - budget revenue by $32.8 billion over 5 years and by $66.6 billion over 10 years .

cbo estimated both versions of chipra 2009 would increase average monthly fy2013 medicaid and schip enrollment by 6.5 million , for a total of 37.7 million projected enrollees .

about 80% of the increased enrollment would occur among current eligibility groups , rather than new ones .

of the 6.5 million increased average monthly enrollment in fy2013 , cbo estimates that 2.4 million ( 37% ) would have private coverage in the absence of the legislation and that 4.1 million ( 63% ) would be uninsured .

the source of revenue for chipra 2009 would be an increase in tobacco excise taxes .

the legislation would also incorporate a revision in corporate estimated tax payments to shift revenues into the five - year budget horizon .

the vast majority of tobacco taxes are on cigarettes , which account for 97% of federal tobacco tax revenue .

under current law , excise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products include the following rates: federal cigarette taxes: $0.39 per pack ; small cigars: $.04 per package of 20 ; large cigars: 20.719% of sales price , not to exceed $48.75 per 1,000 units ( i.e. , a maximum tax of almost $.05 cents per cigar ) ; chewing tobacco: $.01 per ounce ; snuff: $.04 per ounce ; and pipe and roll - your - own tobacco: $.07 per ounce .

there are also taxes on cigarette paper and cigarette tubes .

these taxes are imposed per pound and the rates are as follows: ( 1 ) $0.195 for chewing tobacco , ( 2 ) $0.585 for snuff , and ( 3 ) $1.0606 for pipe and roll - your - own tobacco .

there are also taxes on large cigarettes that are essentially non - existent ( although a tax is necessary for administrative reasons ) .

the house version of h.r .

2 would increase taxes on cigarettes and tobacco - related products ( effective april 1 , 2009 ) to the following rates: federal cigarette taxes would be increased to $1.00 per pack ; small cigars would have their taxes gradually increased to the same level as cigarettes: $0.25 per pack in 2009-2010 , $0.50 in 2011-2012 , $0.75 in 2013-2014 , and $1.00 in 2015 and thereafter ; large cigars would be subject to a tax of 52.4% of sales price with a maximum of $0.40 per cigar ; chewing tobacco would be increased to approximately $.03 cents per ounce ( and $0.50 per pound ) ; snuff would be increased to $.09 per ounce ( $1.50 per pound ) ; pipe tobacco would be increased to $.18 per ounce ( $2.8126 per pound ) ; roll - your - own tobacco would be increased to $1.53 per ounce ( $24.62 per pound ) .

the definition of roll – your - own tobacco would be expanded to include tobacco that could be used to make cigars .

the large increase in roll - your - own tobacco reflects concerns that this tobacco might substitute for cigarettes ; cigarette papers taxes would rise from $1.22 per 40 , to $3.13 ; cigarette tubes would rise from $2.44 to $6.26 .

chipra 2009 also would include provisions affecting floor stock taxes that would apply to items removed from the manufacturer before the april 1 , 2009 , effective date , and subsequently sold after that date .

the person holding the items on april 1 , 2009 , would be liable , and there would be a $500 credit per person .

 ( a person is considered to be a controlled group .

for example , a corporation can not receive the $500 credit for each of its subsidiaries. ) .

the floor stocks tax would also apply to products in a foreign trade zone ( i.e. , imports ) .

the purpose of the floor stock tax would be to prevent the stockpiling of tobacco products before the april 1 , 2009 , effective date for future sales .

chipra 2009 would also impose some regulatory and reporting requirements on manufacturers and importers of processed tobacco other than the tobacco products subject to excise taxes .

finally , chipra 2009 would expand the scope of penalties for not paying the tobacco - related tax , clarify the statute of limitations , and mandate a study of tobacco smuggling .

these provisions in the senate version of h.r .

2 are essentially identical to the house version , with very small increases in tax rates across the tobacco products .

however , the senate version proposes to increase the tax on small cigars to the same level as cigarettes immediately ; federal cigarette taxes would be increased to $1.0066 per pack ; small cigars would have their taxes increased to the same level as cigarettes ; large cigars would be subject to a tax of 52.75% of sales price with a maximum of $0.4026 per cigar ; chewing tobacco would be increased to approximately $.03 cents per ounce ( and $0.5033 per pound ) ; snuff would be increased to $.09 per ounce ( $1.51 per pound ) ; pipe tobacco would be increased to $.18 per ounce ( $2.8311 per pound ) ; roll - your - own tobacco would be increased to $1.55 per ounce ( $24.78 per pound ) .

the definition of roll - your - own tobacco would be expanded to include tobacco that could be used to make cigars .

the large increase in roll - your - own tobacco reflects concerns that this tobacco might substitute for cigarettes ; cigarette papers taxes would rise from $1.22 per 40 , to $3.15 ; cigarette tubes would rise from $2.44 to $6.30 .

under current law , quarterly estimated corporate tax payments due in july , august , and september of 2013 are 120% of the normal required payment , with the next such payment reduced accordingly .

the house version of h.r .

2 would increase this ratio to 121% , shifting $600 million of corporate taxes from fy2014 to fy2013 .

the senate version of h.r .

2 would increase the ratio to 120.5% and shift $300 million of corporate taxes from fy2014 to fy2013 .

the current - law 120% withholding provision does not apply to firms with assets of less than $1 billion , and the withholding increase under chipra 2009 would not alter that exemption .
