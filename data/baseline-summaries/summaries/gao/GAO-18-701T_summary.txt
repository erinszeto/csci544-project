hiring . additionally , in our june 2017 report , we found that eoir did not have efficient practices for hiring new immigration judges , which has contributed to immigration judges being staffed below authorized levels and to staffing shortfalls . for example , in fiscal year 2016 , eoir received an appropriation supporting 374 immigration judge positions but had 289 judges on board at the end of the fiscal year . eoir officials attributed these gaps to delays in the hiring process . our analysis of eoir hiring data supported their conclusion . specifically , we found that from february 2014 through august 2016 , eoir took an average of 647 days to hire an immigration judge — more than 21 months . as a result , we recommended that eoir ( 1 ) assess the immigration judge hiring process to identify opportunities for efficiency ; ( 2 ) use the assessment results to develop a hiring strategy that targets short - and long - term human capital needs ; and ( 3 ) implement any corrective actions related to the hiring process resulting from this assessment . in response to our report , eoir stated that it concurred with our recommendation and was implementing a new hiring plan as announced by the attorney general in april 2017 intended to streamline hiring . among other things , eoir stated that the new hiring plan sets clear deadlines for assessing applicants moving through different stages of the process and for making decisions on advancing applicants to the next stage , and allows for temporary appointments for selected judges pending full background investigations . in february 2018 , eoir indicated to us that it had begun to use the process outlined in its hiring plan to fill judge vacancies . the attorney general also announced in april 2017 that the agency would commit to hire an additional 50 judges in 2018 and 75 additional judges in 2019 . in january 2018 , eoir officials told us that the agency had a total of 330 immigration judges , an increase of 41 judges since september 2016 . however , eoir remained below its fiscal year 2017 authorized level of 384 immigration judges based on funding provided in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 . additionally , the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 provided funding for eoir to hire at least 100 additional immigration judge teams , including judges and supporting staff , with a goal of fielding 484 immigration judge teams nationwide by 2019 . in september 2018 , eoir reported it had a total of 351 immigration judges and was continuing to hire additional judges . hiring additional judges is a positive step ; however , eoir has not assessed its hiring process to identify opportunities for efficiency , and we found in our june 2017 report that eoir was not aware of the factors most affecting its hiring process . for example , we reported that eoir officials attributed the length of the hiring process to delays in the federal bureau of investigation background check process , which is largely outside of eoir's control .
