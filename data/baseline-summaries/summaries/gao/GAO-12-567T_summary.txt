this action item is in progress . according to iscd officials , almost half of the action items included in the june 2012 action plan either require iscd to collaborate with nppd and ip or require nppd and ip to take action to address the challenges identified in the iscd memorandum . nppd , ip , and iscd officials have been working together to identify solutions to the challenges the memorandum identified and to close pertinent action items . according to division officials , 46 of the 94 action items included in the june 2012 action plan required action either by nppd and ip or collaboration with nppd and ip . this includes collaborating with nppd officials representing the nppd human capital , facilities , and employee and labor relations offices , among others , and with ip's directorate of management office . as of june 2012 , 13 of the 46 items that require action by or collaboration with nppd or ip were complete ; 33 of 46 were in progress . as of august 2012 , iscd reported that it had completed 8 more of these action items , such that 21 of the 46 were complete and 25 were in progress . we did not verify iscd's efforts to close these additional action items . chairman shimkus , ranking member green , and members of the subcommittee , this completes my prepared statement . i would be happy to respond to any questions you may have at this time . for information about this statement please contact cathleen a. berrick , managing director , homeland security and justice , at ( 202 ) 512-8777 or berrickc@gao.gov . we expect to report the results of these efforts early in 2013 . our analysis of the april and june versions of the plan shows that the division had extended the estimated completion dates for nearly half of the action items . estimated completion dates for 52 percent ( 48 of 93 items ) either did not change ( 37 items ) or the date displayed in the june 2012 plan was earlier than the date in the april 2012 version of the plan ( 11 items ) . conversely , 48 percent ( 45 of 93 ) of the items in the june 2012 version of the plan had estimated completion dates that had been extended beyond the date in the april 2012 plan . figure 2 shows the extent to which action plan items were completed earlier than planned , did not change , or were extended , from april 2012 through june 2012 , for the human capital management , mission , and administrative issues identified in the plan . iscd officials told us that estimated completion dates had been extended for various reasons . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our analysis based on our audit objectives . we initially reviewed an iscd action plan developed in january 2012 . iscd periodically updated the plan to monitor progress on the action items and we reviewed 8 versions of the action plan up to and including one developed in june 2012 .
