the house passed h.r . 2 in a second vote of 213-211 on june 21 . in the senate , the agriculture committee reported its bill ( s. 3042 ) on june 13 , 2018 , by a vote of 20-1 . the senate passed its bill as an amendment to h.r . 2 by a vote of 86-11 on june 28 . conference proceedings officially began september 5 and concluded on december 10 . the 1973 farm bill was enacted less than 3 months after being introduced . in contrast , the 2014 farm bill took more than 21 months from introduction to enactment , spanning two congresses . the house rejected a bill in 2013 and then passed separate farm and nutrition assistance components — the first time a chamber - passed farm bill did not include a nutrition title since 1973 . the house later procedurally recombined them for conference with the senate . both the 2002 and 2008 farm bills had expired for about three months ( from october through december in 2007 and 2012 ) before extensions were enacted . in each case , the fiscal year began under a continuing resolution for appropriations . the extensions of the 2002 farm bill were for relatively short periods totaling about five months during final house - senate negotiations . however , the extension of the 2008 farm bill in 2013 was for a full year . fiscal years , calendar years , and crop years can be important to different programs . programs authorized by the 2018 farm bill ( the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ) would generally expire either at the end of fy2023 ( september 30 , 2023 ) or after the 2023 crop year , which varies among crops . as farm bill reauthorization has tended to become more complex and engender greater political sensitivity , the process of enacting a new farm bill prior to the expiration of the existing law has become more difficult . as stakeholders in the farm bill have become more diverse , more people are affected by the legislative uncertainty around this process . this lack of certainty may translate into questions about the availability of future program benefits , some of which may affect agricultural production decisions or market uncertainty for agricultural commodities . this has made the timeline for reauthorization less certain . recent farm bills have been subject to developments that have delayed enactment , such as insufficient votes to pass the house floor , presidential vetoes , and short - term extensions . the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-334 ) , often called the "2018 farm bill," was enacted on december 20 , 2018 . in the house , the agriculture committee reported the bill on april 18 , 2018 . an initial floor vote on may 18 failed by 198-213 , but procedures allowed that vote to be reconsidered ( h.res . this report examines the major legislative milestones for the last 12 farm bills over 54 years , a period representing modern farm bills with growing complexity . table 1 contains a history of major legislative action on farm bills since 1965 . figure 1 shows the major dates on a timeline .
