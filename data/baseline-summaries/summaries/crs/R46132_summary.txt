the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied . it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables . in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities . the intensity and economic importance of each of these activities , as well as their underlying market structure and production processes , vary regionally based on the agro - climatic setting , market conditions , and other factors . the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2019 at 13.4% , the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 23 ) . if realized , this would be the seventh consecutive year of increase in the debt - to - asset ratio . a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its income statement and balance sheet of assets and debt . thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy . average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $120,082 in 2019 ( table a - 2 ) , up 7.0% from 2018 but 10.5% below the record of $134,165 in 2014 . about 20% ( $24,106 ) of total farm household income in 2019 is projected to be from farm production activities , and the remaining 80% ( $95,976 ) is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) . the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 24 ) . since 2014 , over half of u.s. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations . since the late 1990s , farm household incomes have surged ahead of average u.s. household incomes ( figure 25 ) . in 2018 ( the last year for which comparable data were available ) , the average farm household income of $112,211 was about 25% higher than the average u.s. household income of $90,021 ( table a - 2 ) . figure a - 1 to figure a - 4 present usda data on monthly farm prices received for several major farm commoditiesâcorn , soybeans , wheat , upland cotton , rice , milk , cattle , hogs , and chickens . the data are presented in an indexed format where monthly price data for year 2010 = 100 to facilitate comparisons . usda farm income data tables table a - 1 to table a - 3 present aggregate farm income variables that summarize the financial situation of u.s. agriculture .
