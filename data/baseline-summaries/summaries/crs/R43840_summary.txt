this rumor is false . as discussed in question 1 , for federal tax purposes , a noncitizen is classified as either a resident or nonresident alien . resident aliens are generally taxed in the same manner as u.s. citizens . thus , just like u.s. citizens , resident aliens are subject to tax on income earned from performing services or conducting a business in the united states . nonresident aliens are subject to a different set of tax rules ; however , none would exempt these individuals from tax under the circumstances described . nonresident aliens , just like u.s. citizens and resident aliens , are generally subject to tax on income earned while performing services or conducting business in the united states . while there are limited exceptions , none would allow an individual to avoid paying income tax under the situation presented in the rumor . finally , a noncitizen cannot incorporate a business in his or her home country and operate that business tax - free in the united states . foreign corporations are generally subject to u.s. taxation on income from conducting a trade or business in the united states . thus , a noncitizen could not set up a foreign corporation to avoid taxation in the manner described in the rumor . there is a persistent rumor that noncitizens who own businesses in the united states are exempt from federal income taxes for a certain period of years ( typically five or seven ) . in some versions of the rumor , the individual is then able to transfer the business to another alien , thus ensuring a continuous exemption from taxation .
