The MBDA's mission is to assist medium and large-scale minority businesses, specifically, but not exclusively, in overcoming social and economic disadvantages that have limited their participation in the nation's free enterprise system. Through a network of local business development centers, the MBDA carries out this mission by providing technical and managerial expertise, support and resources as well as advocacy and research on behalf of minority-controlled business enterprises.", "Because the MBDA, and its predecessor OMBE, were created by executive order, the MBDA's continued survival has rested with each President, in the absence of Congress passing authorizing and enabling legislation. The Carter Administration renamed the agency and refocused its efforts on medium and large-scale businesses, particularly in growth industries. Successive administrations since the Carter Administration have continued to support the mission of the MBDA by refining the agency's focus and reorganizing the delivery of assistance and services. For example, in 1981, the Ronald Reagan Administration established the Minority Business Development Center program, which became the MBDA's primary method for delivering technical and management services to minority businesses. The George H.W. Bush Administration proposed eliminating the agency and transferring its mission to the Small Business Administration (SBA), but ultimately continued the agency as an entity within the Department of Commerce. The Clinton Administration supported substantial increases in the agency's budget to fund the establishment of Rural Business Development Centers, and the activities of the Minority Business Development Centers and Minority Business Opportunity Committees. The George W. Bush Administration continued efforts to coordinate the MBDA's programs with the programs of the SBA, pledged to focus its resources on minority firms with at least $500,000 or more in annual revenues, and to increase their presence in the global economy. The Obama Administration placed increased emphasis on quantifying the impact of MBDA activities, increasing the efficient delivery of its services to minority business communities, and increasing coordination with other federal agencies.", "Currently, the MBDA provides a number of services principally through a network of business centers located in areas with the largest concentration of minority populations and the largest number of minority businesses.

Eager to demonstrate his commitment to these goals and pressed by civil rights advocates to fulfill his campaign promise, President Nixon chose to bypass Congress and the legislative process, instead opting to establish a cabinet level committee on minority enterprise. Within the first 100 days of his administration, President Nixon had established the OMBE as a policy prescription for issues of racial inequality and social injustice.

The approximately 100 centers, located in metropolitan areas, served as one-stop service centers intended to address the needs of minority entrepreneurs. The centers focused on recruiting and encouraging private corporations to do business with minority firms, including creating a directory of minority firms and their capabilities.
