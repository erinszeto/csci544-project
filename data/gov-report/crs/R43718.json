Congress uses farm bills to address emerging rural issues as well as to reauthorize and/or amend a wide range of rural programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) three rural development mission agencies: Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service.", "Title VI of the 2014 farm bill addresses a wide range of policy issues concerning rural America, many of which were also addressed in the 2008 farm bill. These issues included provisions such as equity capital development in rural areas, regional economic planning and development, essential community facilities, water and wastewater infrastructure needs, value-added agricultural development, and broadband telecommunications development. The 2014 farm bill expands high-speed broadband access in rural areas through a new rural gigabit network pilot program, establishes new criteria for prioritizing broadband loans, creates a new rural energy savings program, establishes a program for strategic economic and community development, and consolidates several existing business development grants into a broader program of business development grants. The bill also authorizes $150 million in mandatory spending for pending rural development loans and grants, primarily water and wastewater infrastructure projects. A side-by-side comparison of the final bill with the House- and Senate-passed provisions is provided at the end of the report.", "The 2014 farm bill authorizes USDA to prioritize otherwise eligible applications that support multijurisdictional strategic economic and community development. The provision reserves 20% of a fiscal year's appropriation for community facilities, water and wastewater projects, and rural business development for such strategic economic development projects. The bill authorizes a new Rural Energy Savings Program that will provide 0% interest rate loans to eligible borrowers to implement energy efficiency measures. The bill also authorizes appropriations of $10 million annually (FY2014-FY2018) for a new Rural Gigabit Network Pilot program for \"ultra-high speed\" broadband connectivity, and amends through FY2018 many long-standing programs funded through annual appropriations\u2014water and waste disposal grants, technical assistance for rural water systems, emergency community water assistance, business opportunity grants, water assistance to Native villages in Alaska, community facilities for tribal colleges, and distance learning and telemedicine, to name a few. Most of these programs received authorized funding at levels generally lower than authorized by the 2008 farm bill."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policy Background and Overview", "paragraphs": ["While farm commodity issues may occupy center stage in policy discussions of the periodic omnibus farm bills, rural community and economic development are also topics of congressional concern and are a separate title within the farm bill. Since 1973, omnibus farm bills have included a rural development title. The most recent is Title VI of the Agricultural Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-79 ). Positioning rural areas to better compete in a global economic environment is one of the key issues framing the current debate about the future of rural America. When agricultural production and related businesses dominated rural economies, policies that strengthened and improved agriculture tended to strengthen and improve the well-being of most of America's small communities and rural residents. As the strength of this linkage has declined, the need for new sources of rural economic development has become more apparent to policymakers and rural development practitioners. ", "Congressional interest in rural policy encompasses a wide range of issues, including agriculture, forestry, and mining; community infrastructure; natural resource conservation and management; medical care; bioenergy; and economic development. Current challenges to and reform of existing federal rural policies are evolving in an environment of increasing concern about economic competitiveness, a shift away from agriculture toward services, and new federal political strategies. A changing rural America is also producing pressures for different policies and raising new questions about what Congress's role should be in shaping rural policy.", "Both agriculture and manufacturing issues are increasingly regarded as elements of global and regional restructuring, which have significant implications for rural areas, especially those areas where these production sectors remain dominant. Today, over 90% of total farm household income comes from off-farm sources. The service sector, as with the U.S. domestic economy as a whole, now dominates the rural labor market, although the rural service sector differs from the metropolitan service sector in terms of job categories, skills, and wages.", "The rural development title of farm bills generally supports (1) the infrastructure of rural areas, with traditional assistance for housing, electrical generation and transmission, water and wastewater, and community capacity; (2) agricultural development; and (3) rural business creation and expansion. More recently, policymakers have pushed for programs that support innovative and alternative business development, and new mechanisms to finance it. Pressure for such alternative approaches is expected to continue as policymakers recognize the changing structure of agriculture and the great diversity among rural communities, with some rural areas growing and prospering, and others falling further behind as their primary industries (including agriculture) either decline or adapt to a global economy. Such adaptation and dislocation over the past decade has often meant fewer rural employment opportunities and significant population outmigration for many rural communities.", "To emphasize the importance of agricultural production in the local economies that still characterize many rural areas, legislative support for technologies to help farmers with planting decisions and local investments in industries that will add value to their products have become important aspects of rural development policy. Research is also increasingly focused on improvements in agricultural waste management and environmental protections. Traditional strategies, notably value-added agriculture (e.g., regional food processing plants, cooperatives, organic farming, biofuels) are being promoted by many in the farm sector. While these strategies hold promise for agriculture and surrounding communities, there remain limits on the extent to which agriculture and other mature industries can become a significant engine for renewed rural economic prosperity.", "While commodity policy dominates much of the debate and most of the funding in the farm bill, production agriculture remains a comparatively small and shrinking part of the rural economy, with less than 8% of the rural population employed in agriculture. There is growing recognition that farmers in many rural areas depend more on a healthy rural economy than the rural economy is dependent on farmers for its vitality. The need to strengthen the capacity of rural areas more generally to compete in a global economy is becoming more widely appreciated as the limitations of commodity subsidies, peripheral manufacturing, and physical infrastructure as mainstays of rural development policy become more obvious."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues Influencing the Rural Development Title", "paragraphs": ["The policy debate focuses on the question of whether current farm policies, which rely heavily on commodity support payments and subsidies to a few production sectors, help, hinder, or have little impact on the future development of economically viable rural communities. Rural manufacturing, which tends to be lower-skilled and lower-waged, is also undergoing restructuring with the loss of manufacturing to foreign competition. While transformation to a service economy continues in rural America, service employment in many rural areas tends to be in lower-wage personal services rather than business and producer services. Continuing population and economic decline in many farming and rural areas is compelling policymakers and rural areas to create new sources of competitive advantage, innovative ways of providing public services to sparse populations, and new ways of integrating agriculture into changing rural economies.", "More recently, economic development efforts in some areas have targeted various entrepreneurial strategies and microenterprise development. These approaches attempt to capitalize on a particular area's distinctive social, economic, and environmental assets and advantages to build endogenously on existing local and regional strengths. Developing a local and regional entrepreneurial culture seems to be an important approach in these efforts' successes. Linking public and private sources to build \"business incubators\" is a common strategy, as is developing new commercial ties with area colleges and universities. Communities are also applying such entrepreneurial energy to making their local governments, schools, and hospitals more efficient through, for example, telecommunication innovations.", "The trends noted above suggest a range of issues that were important in shaping the provisions of the rural development title of the 2014 farm bill:", "conservation and environmental restoration as rural employment opportunities; stemming rural population out-migration; vertical integration and coordination of agriculture into supply networks and their implication for rural areas; developing rural entrepreneurial capacity; rebuilding an aging rural physical infrastructure; public service delivery innovations in sparsely populated areas; increasing suburbanization and the conflicts between agriculture and suburban development; human capital deficiencies in rural areas; regionally based efforts for economic development; and connecting businesses and rural communities with broadband telecommunications infrastructure.", "The rural development title of the 2014 farm bill took shape against this backdrop of shifts in the rural economy, widespread and long-term poverty in some rural areas, outmigration in other rural areas, dwindling economic opportunity in rural areas, gaps in critical infrastructure, and a growing appreciation in many quarters of the limits of existing rural development programs to respond to the great diversity of rural places and socioeconomic circumstances.

The Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-355 ), however, named USDA as the lead federal agency for rural development. USDA administers most of the existing rural development programs and has the highest average of program funds going directly to rural counties (approximately 50%). Three agencies are responsible for USDA's rural development mission area: the Rural Housing Service (RHS), the Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). An Office of Community Development provides community development support through Rural Development's field offices.", "It is important to note that most loan and grant programs administered by USDA Rural Development are funded through annual (discretionary) appropriations. The rural development title of omnibus farm bills does not address every program administered by the three USDA mission agencies. Many of these programs are \"permanently\" authorized, often through amendments to the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 (the ConAct, P.L. 87-128) or the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, and are funded through annual appropriations. Farm bills generally give the authority to appropriate discretionary funds for these \"permanently\" authorized programs for specific time, usually for the authorized period of the farm bill.

Congress has chosen instead to address national rural policy issues in this and most previous farm bills, through support for a portfolio of loans, loan guarantees, and competitive grant programs that generally address three major deficits that most all rural areas experience: (1) rural infrastructure, (2) rural business development and retention strategies, and (3) rural investment capital. The three mission agencies of USDA Rural Development support such a policy, with their respective emphasis on housing and community facilities, water, broadband, and electrical generation, and business/cooperative development. While local rural economic development is shaped by the distinctive resources that different rural areas can draw on, infrastructure, business planning and development, and the general absence of capital are three clear needs that virtually all rural areas can identify. The nearly 60 different loan and grant programs currently administered by USDA Rural Development generally follow this agenda. Newly authorized programs in the 2014 farm bill, as with previous farm bills, have reinforced this emphasis. ", "In the 2014 and the 2008 farm bills, newly authorized programs that address rural development issues from a regional perspective, as opposed to a local emphasis alone, have become more prominent. In addition to the authorization of three new regional development commissions in the 2008 farm bill, the 2014 farm bill also prioritized multijurisdictional planning for strategic rural development. These regional efforts suggest some movement away from the very local, ad hoc needs of rural communities, and toward a more comprehensive planning approach that, in time, could begin to shape the contours of a more comprehensive national and integrated rural policy.

The general concern is that rural development funding may not be targeted as well or as effectively as it could be. Section 6209 directs USDA to begin collecting data regarding economic activities created through USDA Rural Development grants and loans, and to measure the short- and long-term viability of award recipients. The provision also directs USDA to submit a report every two years with information on rural employment generation, new business start-ups, and any increased local revenue.

Other criteria for project selection include planning developed through the collaboration of multiple stakeholders in the service area of the plan, including the participation of combinations of stakeholders such as state, local, and tribal governments, nonprofit institutions, institutions of higher education, and private entities. Priority is also given to projects with investment from other federal agencies, and philanthropic organizations.
