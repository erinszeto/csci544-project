Many states haveexperienced greater challenges in demonstrating conformity as air quality requirements have becomemore stringent.", "Background. Section 176 of the Clean Air Act prohibits federal agencies from funding projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, unless thoseprojects conform to a state's SIP. (6) Because newhighways generally lead to an increase in emissions,both the statute and regulations currently require that a metropolitan planning organization'sTransportation Improvement Program (TIP) demonstrate conformity no less frequently than everytwo years.

There has been increasing support for allowing states more time to demonstrate conformity, due to the likelihood that theimpact of conformity requirements on states will grow in the next several years. Numerous factorshave made it more challenging for states to control emissions and demonstrate conformity, such as(1) the growth of emissions from sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and other light trucks whoseemissions are not regulated as strictly as passenger vehicles, (2) greater than expected increases invehicle miles traveled, (3) recent court decisions that tightened conformity rules, and (4) theimplementation of more stringent federal air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates,scheduled for 2004, which will result in more areas being subject to conformity demonstrations.", "Numerous metropolitan areas may face a cutoff of highway and transit funds in the future, unless they impose sharp reductions in emissions to demonstrate conformity. During a lapse inconformity, a state may receive federal highway funds only for a limited set of exempted projects(mostly safety-related or replacement and repair of existing transit facilities). The rules do not evenallow funding of new projects that might reduce emissions, such as new transit lines.

This program is based on the fundamental conceptthat lowering the number of miles traveled by motor vehicles, and reducing congestion to makevehicles operate more efficiently, can reduce emissions and improve overall air quality. Theprogram has been widely popular among local areas struggling to reduce air pollution, as it is thelargest single source of federal funding for air quality projects. While questions have been raisedabout the program's effectiveness, there appears to be broad support for increasing its funding levelsin response to concern that greater emission reductions will be needed in many states when newnonattainment areas are designated.", "Background. Congress originally authorized $6 billion for the CMAQ program from FY1992 through FY1997. In enacting TEA-21, Congressauthorized another $8.1 billion for continuing it from FY1998 through FY2003. CMAQ funding isavailable only for projects that would reduce traffic congestion and assist states in complying withthe NAAQS for carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate matter. States with areas that are innonattainment with the NAAQS for these pollutants, and those that must maintain them, receiveCMAQ funds according to a formula based on the severity of air pollution in those areas and thepopulation residing in them. States that do not have any nonattainment or maintenance areas receive0.5% of the total annual CMAQ apportionment, and have the flexibility to use this amount fortransportation projects that are eligible under CMAQ or the Surface Transportation Program. TEA-21 also allowed each state to transfer a portion of its CMAQ funds to other highway programsthat the state determines to have a higher priority, if certain conditions are met.", "Most transportation control measures identified in Section 108 of the Clean Air Act are eligible for funding. (8) CMAQ projects generally fall into oneof the following eight categories: (1) masstransit; (2) traffic flow improvements; (3) rideshare programs; (4) traffic demand managementprograms; (5) bicycle and pedestrian projects; (6) public education; (7) vehicle inspection andmaintenance programs; or (8) alternative fuel conversions. According to the Federal HighwayAdministration, more funding has been obligated for conventional mass transit projects than for anyother activity, approximately 44% of total CMAQ funds since FY1992.", "Key Policy Issues. After more than a decade of implementation, questions have been raised as to whether the CMAQ program has reducedemissions significantly enough to help states comply with the NAAQS. Whether to modify variouselements of the program to improve its effectiveness, or possibly to shift its focus, is an issue forreauthorization. Congress included a provision in TEA-21 that required the National Academy ofSciences (NAS) to study whether the emission reductions from CMAQ projects have been largeenough to help states comply with the NAAQS. The NAS released its report in the spring of 2002. (9) The study indicated that the air quality benefits of CMAQ projects were difficult to assess becauseof the lack of quantitative data for all projects. For those with quantitative data, the NAS concludedthat the emission reductions were relatively small and that these projects were less cost-effective thanother pollution control measures. However, the NAS also concluded that when these emissionreductions are assessed collectively the overall air quality benefits that they provide may be greatenough to help states attain and maintain the NAAQS in areas that are on the margin of compliance. Consequently, the NAS recommended that the program be continued and suggested variousmodifications to improve its effectiveness.", "The findings of the NAS have raised numerous issues for reauthorization. Since the impact of the program on air quality was difficult to quantify, some argue that the focus should be shifted toreducing traffic congestion in general, rather than linking eligibility to air quality benefits that arequestionable. There also are arguments that the statutory formula should at least be amended toprovide a higher amount of minimum funding to states that do not have any air quality problems, butthat would still benefit from a reduction in traffic congestion. Rising traffic congestion andprogressively lengthier commuting times in some metropolitan areas have motivated support for suchoptions among some transportation stakeholders.", "On the other hand, proponents of the program argue that areas on the verge of attainment may benefit from the continued use of CMAQ funds for air quality projects, even if the emissionreductions are relatively small. They also argue that more areas will be in need of emissionreductions in order to comply with stricter federal standards for ozone and fine particulates,scheduled to become effective in 2004, and that air quality benefits from CMAQ projects, no matterhow small, would be helpful. However, the current funding formula does not include a factor toaccount for new areas that will be in nonattainment with these stricter standards. Consequently, theformula would need to be changed during reauthorization, in order to allow affected states to receivegreater funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clean Fuel Buses", "paragraphs": ["In general, transit projects provide air quality benefits by reducing the number of motor vehicles on the road and the emissions that are generated from their operation. However, transit vehicles(mainly buses) produce emissions themselves. In many local areas with air quality problems, transitagencies have purchased buses that operate on cleaner-burning fuels as a means to control emissions. In enacting TEA-21, Congress set aside funding for a program to assist transit agencies in purchasingclean fuel buses, but subsequently redirected this funding to a more general fund for bus purchasesnot restricted to fuel type.", "While this program has not been implemented, many transit agencies have still chosen to purchase clean fuel buses with federal funds at their discretion. The upcoming designation of newnonattainment areas has sparked further interest in the use of clean fuel buses, and some haveadvocated that a dedicated source of funding should be established for acquiring them. This proposalhas been controversial to those who argue that local transit agencies should be allowed to decidewhat kinds of buses best meet their capacity needs, rather than having a portion of federal transitfunds restricted to certain types of buses based on fuel type.", "Background.

Of the $200 million annualauthorization, $100 million was authorized as guaranteed \"firewalled\" funds, and the remaining $100million was authorized as traditional discretionary funds subject to the annual appropriations process. In appropriations bills subsequent to TEA-21, Congress has not appropriated any of the $100 millionin traditional discretionary funds that were annually authorized for the program, and has redirectedthe $100 million in guaranteed annual funding to traditional capital bus improvement projects.

For example, transitagencies located in metropolitan areas that need emissions reductions to comply with federal airquality standards under the Clean Air Act are more likely to choose cleaner buses that operate onalternative fuels. Other factors may include the extent to which the purchase of cleaner buses wouldimprove the public's perception of transit and increase ridership, and whether there are any state orlocal mandates or incentives for the use of alternative fuels.", "Apart from air quality concerns, an economic factor that transit agencies typically consider in their planning process is the extent to which the purchase of alternative-fueled buses would help tomaximize the benefits of past investments in the refueling infrastructure necessary for such vehicles. Consequently, transit agencies that have invested in alternative-fueled buses in the past are morelikely to purchase additional ones in the future. Conversely, transit agencies that have not yetinvested in them are less likely to do so, as they would need to invest additional resources in newrefueling infrastructure.", "Federal Funding Obligated by the Federal Transit Administration for the Purchase of Buses by Type of Fuel from FY2000 to FY2002a", "Source: Prepared by the Congressional Research Service using data from the Federal TransitAdministration, Statistical Summaries for FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002.", "a Dollar amounts in the table reflect the amount of federal funding obligated to assist transit agenciesin purchasing buses.

Some also point out that stricter standards for heavy-duty dieselengines and fuels, which are scheduled to be phased in beginning in 2007 and 2006respectively, will allow diesel buses to achieve a level of emissions performance thatis equivalent to alternative fuels such as CNG. Such critics say that the cleanerperformance of new diesel buses that are on the way will negate the need forreserving a portion of transit funds for alternative-fueled buses in order to reduceemissions. On the other hand, some environmental organizations have expressedskepticism that diesel buses equipped with cleaner engines will generate as fewemissions in actual operation as those that operate on alternative fuels.

A reduction in tailpipe emissionscan help to reduce the impact of highway travel on air quality. However,alcohol-based fuels can be more \"volatile\" than conventional gasoline or diesel, andthe use of these alternative fuels can result in higher evaporative emissions duringrefueling, which could offset tailpipe emission reductions in some cases.

While methanolcan also be derived from renewable biomass or municipal waste, it usually isproduced from natural gas, which is not renewable. Consequently, the tax benefitsfor alcohol-based fuels apply mostly to the sale of ethanol.", "Among alternative fuels, ethanol is the most commonly used. The majority of the ethanol sold is not used in its pure form. Rather, it is blended with gasoline toproduce \"gasohol,\" which can be used in any conventional vehicle as a substitute forordinary gasoline. Ethanol is also used as an additive for various purposes. It iscommonly added to \"reformulated\" gasoline (RFG) to increase the oxygen contentof the fuel. RFG must be made available in certain areas to meet Clean Air Actrequirements to reduce vehicular emissions of precursors to ground-level ozone,commonly referred to as smog. During the winter months, RFG also must be usedin certain areas to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide. In addition to meetingoxygenate requirements for RFG, ethanol is added to gasoline in some areas toincrease octane levels. (For additional information on ethanol, refer to CRS Report RL30369, Fuel Ethanol: Background and Public Policy Issues .)", "The excise tax reduction for ethanol is most commonly taken at the blended state by either fuel producers or distributors. The amount of the tax reductiondepends on the percentage of the blend that is composed of ethanol. The current taxreduction is 5.2 cents per gallon for gasohol consisting of at least 10% ethanol, 4.0cents per gallon for blends of at least 7.7% ethanol, and 3.0 cents per gallon forblends of at least 5.7% ethanol. These amounts reduce the excise tax levied on thesale of gasohol below the current tax rate of 18.4 cents per gallon for ordinarygasoline. While nearly all of the excise taxes on gasoline are deposited into theFederal Highway Trust Fund, 2.5 cents of the per gallon tax for gasohol are depositedinto general Treasury funds, and are therefore not dedicated to the support of federalsurface transportation programs. ", "Key Policy Issues. Since the wholesale cost of ethanol is relatively high, tax benefits for the sale of ethanol areneeded to make it competitive with other fuel additives and with conventional fuels. However, there has been disagreement as to whether these benefits are appropriate. Proponents argue that ensuring the commercial viability, and resulting availability,of ethanol improves air quality due to reduced vehicle emissions, lowers U.S.dependence on foreign oil, and provides an additional market for corn farmers whogrow the biomass needed to produce ethanol. On the other hand, opponents arguethat gasohol tax benefits are essentially a subsidy for the ethanol industry, whichreduces overall revenues for the Federal Highway Trust Fund. Some also argue thatthe emissions and energy benefits of ethanol can be offset by the energy needed toproduce the fuel and the resulting emissions from generating that energy. Key issuesfor reauthorization include (1) whether to extend the tax benefits beyond this timeframe, (2) whether to increase or decrease the amount of the excise tax reduction andthe income tax credit, and (3) whether to continue the current policy of devoting aportion of alcohol fuel tax revenues to general Treasury funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes", "paragraphs": ["Many states have constructed HOV lanes as a means to reduce traffic congestion. Through reducing congestion, these types of lanes also can provide airquality benefits because vehicles typically generate fewer emissions when operatingmore efficiently at steady speeds. In TEA-21, Congress approved a novel approachto using HOV lanes for air quality purposes by allowing states to permit vehicles withextremely low emissions to operate in an HOV lane with only one occupant. Thepremise was to offer a benefit that would possibly encourage the purchase of cleanervehicles, thereby helping to improve air quality. This authority expired on October1, 2003. Some have advocated that it should be renewed and expanded to includeother low-emission vehicles that were not clean enough to qualify under the previousauthority. However, others have expressed concern that expanding this benefit toinclude a greater number of vehicles could cause traffic congestion to rise, impairingthe primary function of HOV lanes.", "Background. TEA-21 provided the authority for states to permit a vehicle with only one occupant to operate in anHOV lane, if the vehicle is certified under federal regulations as an \"inherentlylow-emission vehicle\" (ILEV). The law authorized states to implement this policythrough September 30, 2003, and granted each state the right to revoke this policywithin its borders if HOV lane congestion were to increase as a result of this practice. EPA established the ILEV category to recognize the inherently low emissions ofcertain types of fuel and vehicle technologies and to encourage their use. The ILEVstandards are so strict that only those vehicles without evaporative fuel emissions areable to meet them. Consequently, a vehicle that burns any quantity of gasoline ordiesel cannot meet the standards, including hybrid vehicles that operate on acombination of gasoline or diesel and electric batteries. Vehicles that operate entirelyon alternative fuels with no evaporative emissions, such as compressed natural gas(CNG), liquified natural gas (LNG), or purely electric vehicles, are the only ones thatare able to meet the standards. Such vehicles account for a very small percentage ofthe on-road fleet.

There has been growing interest among motorists, the vehicle industry, and some states in renewingthe HOV lane benefit and expanding it to hybrid vehicles, which are more widelyavailable. Proponents argue that hybrid vehicles are almost as clean as ILEVs, andthat expanding this benefit to include them would encourage additional sales of\"cleaner\" vehicles that would help to improve overall air quality. Over theshort-term, allowing hybrid vehicles to use HOV lanes with only one occupant maynot cause HOV lanes to become noticeably more congested in areas where there isexcess HOV lane capacity to accommodate them, because they currently representa fairly small percentage of the vehicle fleet.

Surface Transportation Program funds may be spent on environmental restorationand pollution abatement activities only when an existing highway is undergoing\"reconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, or restoration.\" The portion of programfunds that can be spent on environmental restoration and pollution abatementactivities for these types of highway projects is limited to 20% of the total projectcost. The law does not provide the authority for states to expend program funds tomitigate water pollution from past runoff, if improvements are not being made to thehighway at the time.", "While environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities are eligible for funding, the law does not require states to expend their Surface TransportationProgram funds on these activities. Rather, a state may use program funds for theseactivities at its discretion. Determining how many states have done so, and in whatamount, is not possible because states are not required to comprehensively track thisinformation. However, states may voluntarily supply this information to the FederalHighway Administration. Based on the data that have been provided, the statesreport that they have spent a total of $19 million in Surface Transportation Programfunds on environmental restoration and pollution abatement projects from FY1998through mid-FY2003. However, the actual expenditure may be significantly greaterthan this amount, due to the absence of complete data from all states. States alsomust spend a portion of their federal funds for new highway construction to satisfywater pollution mitigation requirements. Due to the scope of most new constructionand the extent of its impacts, these amounts mostly likely have exceeded the fundingthat has been spent to mitigate pollution from older highways. However, data on thespecific amount of funding are not available because states do not typically separatemitigation costs out from the total costs of new highway construction.", "Key Policy Issues. Some of the relevant issues for the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Program are (1)whether to increase the limitation on the portion of the total project cost that can bespent on environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities, in order toaccommodate cases in which mitigation costs may exceed the current 20% cap; (2)whether to establish a comprehensive reporting mechanism for tracking the amountof STP funds expended by states on these activities, so as to gain a betterunderstanding of the extent to which transportation facilities have impacted waterquality and necessitated mitigation; and (3) whether to permit STP funds to be usedto address water pollution from highway runoff, even if no highway improvementsare underway at the time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transportation Enhancement Set-Aside", "paragraphs": ["Although states have the flexibility to fund a wide variety of projects under the Surface Transportation Program, they must set aside 10% of their annualapportionment of funds under this program for \"transportation enhancements\" thatwould improve the multimodal, environmental, cultural, or aesthetic aspects of thenation's surface transportation system. In enacting TEA-21, Congress modified thedefinition of enhancements to include the mitigation of water pollution from highwayrunoff as an eligible activity. While the use of enhancements funding to addresswater quality needs has not been controversial, some criticisms have been raisedabout the use of federal highway funds for some enhancements that are not directlyrelated to surface transportation infrastructure needs.", "Background. States may choose to spend their enhancements funds on numerous categories of eligible activities. Thecategories that have received the most funding include bicycle paths and pedestrianwalkways, preservation of historic transportation facilities, and landscaping andscenic beautification. (15) Of the eligible categories,mitigation of water pollution fromhighway runoff has received a relatively small percentage of overall enhancementsfunding. TEA-21 authorized a total of $3.3 billion for transportation enhancementsfrom FY1998 through FY2003. Of this amount, the National TransportationEnhancements Clearinghouse reports that states had expended $66 million (or nearly2%) on water pollution mitigation projects through mid-FY2003. (16) While thisamount represents a small fraction of enhancements funding, it is more than threetimes the amount that states had reportedly spent on these types of projects withgeneral Surface Transportation Program funds.", "The federal contribution to the cost of projects funded under the Surface Transportation Program, including pollution mitigation, is generally limited to 80%,as is the case with most other federal highway programs. However, states have theflexibility to calculate the nonfederal share of the total cost of TransportationEnhancements based on individual projects, multiple projects, or on a programmaticlevel. States also can use funds from federal agencies other than the Department ofTransportation to count toward the nonfederal share of the cost of enhancements. (17) Consequently, the federal share of the cost of an individual project can be as high as100%, if the federal share for others is low enough to offset that amount and yield afederal share of no more than 80% for an entire group of projects.", "Key Policy Issues. Whilenumerous states, local communities, historic preservation interests, andenvironmental organizations have expressed support for the diversity of activities thatare supported with enhancements funding, some argue that certain enhancements arean ineffective use of federal highway funds. Opponents believe that federal highwayfunds should only be spent on improvements to surface transportation infrastructure,rather than on projects that may provide some related benefit, but that do not meethighway capacity needs, help to relieve traffic congestion, or meet an environmentalrequirement necessary for project approval. Limitations on federal highway fundsas a result of a recent decline in trust fund revenues have sparked some support forsuch arguments.
