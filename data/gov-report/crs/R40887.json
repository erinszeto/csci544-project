The USA PATRIOT Act expanded NSL authority. Later reports of the Department of Justice Inspector General indicated that (1) the FBI considered the expanded authority very useful; (2) after expansion the number of NSLs requests increased dramatically; (3) the number of requests relating to Americans increased substantially; and (4) FBI use of NSL authority had sometimes failed to comply with statutory, Attorney General, or FBI policies.", "Originally, the NSL statutes authorized nondisclosure requirements prohibiting recipients from disclosing receipt or the content of the NSL to anyone, ever. They now permit judicial review of these secrecy provisions. As understood by the courts, recipients may request the issuing agency to seek and justify to the court the continued binding effect of any secrecy requirement.", "Several USA PATRIOT Act provisions are scheduled to expire on February 28, 2011. The NSL statutory provisions are not among them. Nevertheless, several bills were introduced in the 111th Congress which would have amended and in some cases repealed NSL authority. The bills included: (1) the National Security Letter Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 1800), introduced by Representative Nadler; (2) the USA PATRIOT Amendments Act of 2009 (H.R. 3845), introduced by Representative Conyers and reported out by the House Judiciary Committee ( H.Rept. 111-382, Pt.1); (3) the Counterterrorism Authorities Improvements Act of 2009 (H.R. 3969), introduced by Representative Reyes; (4) the Judicious Use of Surveillance Tools in Counterterrorism Efforts Act of 2009 (JUSTICE Act) (S. 1686/H.R. 4005), introduced by Senator Feingold and Representative Holt; and (5) the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act of 2009 (S. 1692), introduced by Senator Leahy and reported out by the Senate Judiciary Committee (S.Rept. 111-92). A sixth bill, the USA PATRIOT Reauthorization Act of 2009 (S. 2336), introduced by Senator Sessions, which would have neither amended nor repealed NSL authority, would have amended the judicial review provisions governing NSL recipient secrecy requirements.", "In addition to sunset and repeal, the bills raise issues involving amendment of nondisclosure requirements; the promulgation of standards to minimize capturing, using, and holding (long term) NSL generated information, continued periodic IG audits and reports, and limitations on statutory provisions thought by some to permit circumvention of NSL statutory requirements. The 111th Congress adjourned without further action on any of the proposals.", "This report includes a chart comparing the provisions of the bills and current law.

It reached a wider range of potential recipients at the demand of large group of federal officials, but for a more limited purpose. It rested the obligation to provide consumer reports, together with financial information and records, upon consumer reporting agencies, financial agencies, and financial institutions, or holding companies.

Unlike the traditional linear counterintelligence case, in which the foreign agent tried to recruit the domestic spy using infrequent and highly secure forms of communication, many counterterrorism cases involved complex networks generating a much larger volume of communication and financial transactions. In counter-terrorism cases, the starting point was often not a clearly identifiable agent of a foreign power (as in counterintelligence); indeed, the relevant \"foreign power\" was itself an imperfectly understood terrorist organization that might defy precise definition.

The Nadler bill would have used a different approach to meet the Second Circuit requirement that the government seek and justify judicial approval for a nondisclosure order. Under the Nadler bill, recipients would be under a disclosure ban for 30 days during which the agency might apply to the court to issue a nondisclosure order.", "The Leahy, Reyes, Sessions, and Conyers bills would have left unchanged the concerns a requesting official might rely upon in order to impose a nondisclosure order: reason to believe disclosure may endanger national security or individual safety or interfere with diplomatic relations or a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation (but in the Conyers bill the court would have been required to find that disclosure would\u2014rather than might\u2014result in one or more of the adverse consequences). The Nadler and Feingold/Holt bills would have adopted a higher threshold and would have established a narrower range of adverse consequences necessary to justify nondisclosure: reason to believe disclosure \"will\" (rather than \"may\") result in a danger to personal safety; flight from prosecution; destruction or tampering with evidence; witness intimidation; a serious danger to national security by tipping off the foreign agent who is the target of the investigation, or his associates, or the foreign power that is the agent's principal; or (only in the case of the Feingold/Holt bill) interfere with diplomatic relations.", "In all six bills, the government would have had the burden of petitioning for and securing U.S. district court approval of a nondisclosure provision, although in the Sessions bill the court would have been required to give \"substantial weight\" to the government's certification of the possible adverse consequences of disclosure. In the Nadler bill, the recipient would have been subject to a preliminary 30 day nondisclosure requirement during which the issuing agency might seek a court nondisclosure order. In the Feingold/Holt bill, should the agency have determined that nondisclosure was appropriate it would have inform the recipient that he had 21 days to ask for judicial review. Those who elected not to request judicial review would have been bound by the nondisclosure requirement for not more than a year. In the case of those who request judicial review, the agency would have had 21 days to petition the court for review. In the Leahy, Sessions, Reyes, and Conyers bills, the agency would have notified the recipient of the right to judicial review and petition for review within 30 days of a recipient's request for judicial review.", "Each of the bills would have required that the agency's application for judicial approval or review include a statement of facts giving reason to believe that disclosure would have (or might in the case of the Leahy, Reyes, and Conyers bills) resulted in one of the statutory list of adverse consequences\u2014(A) in the Leahy, Reyes, Sessions, and Conyers bills, endanger national security or individual safety or interfere with diplomatic relations or with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation; or (B) in the Nadler and Feingold/Holt bills, endanger personal safety; flight from prosecution; destruction or tampering with evidence; witness intimidation; a serious danger to national security by tipping off the foreign agent who is the target of the investigation, or his associates, or the foreign power that is the agent's principal; or (only in the case of the Feingold/Holt bill) interfere with diplomatic relations.", "The Feingold/Holt bill would have compelled applicants to explain how the adverse consequences relate to the investigation in which NSL is sought and how the secrecy order is narrowly crafted to counter the possibility of those adverse consequences. In addition, the Feingold/Holt bill would have required that agency applicants recommend when the secrecy order should expire.", "Should the court feel the agency had met its burden, it would have been authorized to approve the requested secrecy order. The Feingold/Holt bill would have limited the order to no more than a year; the Nadler and Conyers bills to no more than 180 days. Renewals would have been available under the same conditions and with the maximum duration as in the original. Unlike the other bills, the Leahy, Reyes, and Sessions bills had no such explicit provision for maximum duration of a gag order, and unlike existing law, they had no explicit provision to allow a recipient to petition for judicial review after the passage of time. On the other hand, they would have placed no express time limit on the recipient's right to judicial review nor upon the court's jurisdiction over the question; they stated only that the recipient would have a right to judicial review of the order, that the recipient would have needed to notify the agency of any desire for judicial review, and that the agency would have been obligated to petition the court for review within 30 days of receiving a recipient's request."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Judicial Review of NSL Itself", "paragraphs": ["Existing law permits the recipient of a NSL to petition the U.S. district court to modify it or set aside under the same grounds as a grand jury subpoena might be quashed or modified or if it is otherwise unlawful.

Minimization standards are drawn with an eye to the purposes for which information is acquired; the authority under which it is acquired; the legitimate interests which may be affected by its acquisition, use, or disclosure; and the governmental interests served by its acquisition, maintenance, use, and disclosure.", "Minimization standards ordinarily reinforce statutory and regulatory limitations that attend the use of possibly invasive means of acquiring information. For example, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides fairly rigorous statutory procedures that must be honored before electronic surveillance or physical searches may be authorized in a national security context. It also supplies statutory conditions under which information acquired using those techniques may be used, and both judicial and legislative oversight procedures. As an additional safeguard, it also calls for the creation and implementation of minimization procedures to protect private information relating to Americans consistent with the U.S. foreign intelligence interests.", "Section 119(f) of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act directed the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to report to the Congressional intelligence and judiciary committees on the feasibility of NSL minimization procedures \"to ensure the protection of the constitutional rights of Untied States persons.\" The Inspector General's reports noted the need for minimization standards or their regulatory equivalent:", "In our first NSL report, the OIG noted the proviso in the Attorney General's NSI Guidelines that national security investigations should use the \"least intrusive collection techniques feasible\" to carry out the investigations. The OIG reported that we found no clear guidance on how Special Agents should reconcile the Attorney General guidelines' limitations with the expansive authority provided in the NSL statutes. Our concerns over the lack of formal guidance were magnified because of the volume of NSLs generated by the FBI each year and because the information collected is retained for long periods in databases available to many authorized law enforcement personnel.", "The Justice Department convened a working group to study and make recommendations concerning possible NSL minimization standards in response to its statutory obligation and the Inspector General's initial report. The working group's proposals apparently have yet to be finalized and accepted, and the Inspector General testified that \"final guidance is needed and overdue.\"", "Each of the bills, other than the Sessions proposal, had minimization components. Some took the form of statutory limitations and others instructions for Justice Department guidelines. The Leahy, Feingold/Holt, and Conyers bills would have directed the Attorney General to promulgate minimization procedures within 180 days with features comparable to the FISA definition in 50 U.S.C. 1801(h): procedures that are calculated, consistent with U.S. needs for foreign intelligence information, to minimize the capture and retention of private information (information not publicly available) relating to a U.S. person (and to ban its retention); procedures that preclude the disclosure of private information relating to a U.S. person (that is not foreign intelligence information) that identifies the person, unless necessary to appreciate its significance; and procedures that permit evidence of a crime to be retained and disclosed. The Reyes bill would have provided a 90-day deadline for \"procedures for collection, use, and storage of information obtained in response to a national security letter\" under any of the four NSL statutes, other than the National Security Act statute, 50 U.S.C. 436. The Feingold/Holt bill would have also insisted that the procedures called for the return or destruction of information acquired outside the scope of the NSL or in a manner that failed to comply with the NSL statute.", "The Nadler bill would have given the Attorney General 90 days to promulgate minimization procedures that were calculated to minimize the capture and retention of private information (information not publicly available) relating to a U.S. person (and to ban its dissemination). The additional requirements would have focused on procedures for the return or destruction of information that did not reflect the activity of an agent of a foreign power; that was superfluous; or that exceeded the bounds of the original NSL request.", "In provisions modeled after those in FISA, the Nadler and Feingold/Holt bills would also have added explicit provisions describing some of the circumstances under which NSL generated information might be disclosed. They would have:", "prohibited disclosure except for lawful purposes and in compliance with minimization procedures; required a statement of origin and of Attorney General approval when used in criminal proceedings; when the information was to be used in federal proceedings, directed that the person to whom the information relates and the tribunal be informed beforehand of the information's source; when the information was to be used in state proceedings, directed that the person to whom the information related, the tribunal, and the Attorney General be informed beforehand of the information's source and intended use; when the information was to be used in either state or federal proceedings, afforded the person to whom the information relates an opportunity to move for suppression based on the NSL statute, the Constitution, or other laws of the United States; authorized the U.S. district court to order suppression should it find that due process so required or that the NSL was not issued in compliance with the NSL statute, the Constitution, or other laws of the United States; and made binding the U.S. district court's suppression decisions except for federal appellate purposes.", "The Conyers bill would have required the prior approval of the Attorney General or senior Justice Department official before NSL information could be used in a criminal proceeding.", "The Feingold/Holt bill also included a \"least intrusive means\" section. The current Attorney General's guidelines governing FBI intelligence investigations in this country state that the FBI investigations should use the \"least intrusive method feasible\" in light of the circumstances.
