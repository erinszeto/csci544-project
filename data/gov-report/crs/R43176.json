Today, the European Union has established binding renewable energy targets with the goal of having the entire EU derive 20% of total energy consumption (electricity, heating/cooling, and transportation) from renewable sources by 2020. EU member countries have discretion to decide how best to achieve EU-level targets. Each country uses a unique set of policies and financial incentives to stimulate renewable energy production. While EU and U.S. energy markets are very different, knowledge of the history, evolution, financial mechanics, and market impacts of EU renewable electricity policies may be useful to Congress during future debates about renewable electricity policy in the United States.", "Renewable electricity generation is one component of the EU energy sector that has been emphasized. Several member countries have designed and implemented various mechanisms to encourage renewable electricity production. To date, the majority of renewable electricity deployment has been in the form of onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Feed-in tariffs (FiT) are the most commonly referenced incentive mechanism used by EU countries. However, other mechanisms, such as market premiums, green certificates, and reverse auctions are also used to motivate renewable electricity generation.", "Germany, Spain, and Italy are EU countries that have deployed renewable electricity generation systems at a relatively large scale. At the end of 2012 Germany and Italy were the top two countries in terms of cumulative installed solar PV capacity with 32 Gigawatts (GW) and 17 GW, respectively. Spain was the largest global solar PV market during calendar year 2008. Those high deployment levels have established these countries as leaders in renewable electricity generation. However, political, economic, and power system concerns are causing these same countries to adjust, modify, and often reduce financial support incentives. Further, the policies, deployment profiles, financial mechanics, and incentive modifications differ for each country.", "To control escalating surcharges on consumer electricity bills, German policy officials have been rapidly reducing financial incentives for solar PV and have instituted a solar PV capacity support limit of 52GW, at which point incentives will no longer be available for new projects. Similarly, Italy has placed limits on financial support\u2014also paid through consumer surcharges\u2014for all renewable electricity generation. In 2012, Italy's renewable electricity surcharge represented approximately 20% of the average electricity bill. As of June 2013, financial support limits for solar PV in Italy were reached and feed-in tariffs are no longer available for new projects. Spain has completely suspended FiT incentives for renewable electricity and has implemented retroactive incentive reduction policies that affect revenue, cash flow, and investment returns for existing operational projects.", "EU countries are transitioning from electricity production-based incentives (i.e., feed-in tariffs) to market integration incentives such as market premiums, bonus payments for remotely controlled wind and solar projects, and flexibility premiums for renewable generation that can reduce grid instability. Power market integration of renewables, combined with declining costs of renewable electricity, may result in a more stable, albeit smaller, competitive market for renewable electricity generation. A second trend in EU countries is the implementation of retroactive incentive reductions to control costs associated with renewable electricity support. While retroactive measures may be fiscally necessary, they will likely affect future renewable electricity deployment by introducing an element of policy risk that causes financing costs, and thus production costs, to rise. These trends are likely to result in lower EU renewable capacity additions for some member countries. However, carbon policies and declining technology costs may support future EU renewable electricity market growth."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope of this Report", "paragraphs": ["The subject matter covered within this report is European Union (EU) renewable electricity generation\u2014specifically onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity\u2014and does not include discussion about the broader renewable energy sector (i.e., alternative transportation fuels, heating/cooling, and energy efficiency). Onshore wind and solar PV were selected as they have experienced the largest amounts of deployment in the EU to date. European Union energy policy is complex and multi-dimensional.

EU net imports of natural gas, solid fuels, and oil/petroleum products represented 54% of total primary energy consumption in 2010. Starting as early as 1986, EU communications and directives have been aimed at reducing fossil fuel consumption, diversifying the EU energy mix, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and encouraging the use of renewable energy for electricity, heating/cooling, and transportation. In 1997, in preparation for the upcoming \"Third Council of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\" held in Kyoto, Japan, the European Commission published a white paper that, among other things, called for the EU community to obtain 12% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2010. Subsequently, EU members became Kyoto Protocol signatories and eventually ratified commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "In 2001 the European Parliament and the EU Council published Directive 2001/77/EC, which set out non-binding national indicative targets for EU members that would result in the EU, as a whole, sourcing 12% of total energy, including 22.1% of electricity, from renewable sources by 2010. However, the non-binding nature of renewable energy targets in the 2001 directive did not provide the degree of certainty needed to motivate the development and investment necessary to achieve the targets.

These targets were included in EU legislation, known as the climate and energy package. The EU targets are commonly referred to as the \"20-20-20\" targets as they focus on three key objectives to be met by the year 2020: (1) binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990 levels, (2) binding target to increase to 20% the portion of final EU energy consumption that is produced from renewable energy sources, and (3) non-binding target to improve energy efficiency in the EU by 20% compared to 2020 projections.", "In 2009 the EU adopted Directive 2009/28/EC to promote and encourage the use of renewable energy resources in member countries. The directive codified the EU goal that 20% of total final EU energy consumption be produced from renewable energy sources by 2020. To achieve the 2020 goal, the directive established binding renewable energy targets for each EU member country. Each national renewable energy target is different, with some national targets higher than 20% and some lower. Country-specific renewable energy targets were established based on a number of factors, including the quality of renewable energy resources, country economies, energy resource mix, and others (for a list of all EU member country 2020 targets, see the Appendix ). In order to comply with the 2020 goal, countries can use renewable energy sources for heating/cooling, electricity, and transport, although each member country is required to source a minimum of 10% of transport energy from renewable sources by 2020. ", "Each EU member country has discretion to decide what policies and incentives are offered that might motivate renewable energy development in order to achieve the binding EU renewable energy targets. The EU directive also allows for the transfer of renewable energy between member countries, joint projects among member countries, and projects with developing countries outside the EU, as long as they meet certain qualifying criteria.

Generally, each country uses a unique mix of policy incentives. The application of those policy tools is customized to suit the objectives of each EU member. Also, each EU country has discretion with regard to the types of financial incentives offered to renewable electricity projects. The most commonly cited and referenced EU financial incentive is the feed-in tariff, described below, which has been used in several EU countries to encourage deployment of renewable electricity generation projects. However, there are other incentive mechanisms used to support renewable power in the EU. Some member countries have started to transition from feed-in tariffs to other incentive types as a way to control costs, manage capacity installations, and integrate renewable electricity with power markets. The following sections provide a brief overview of four primary types of financial incentive mechanisms used by EU member countries to stimulate renewable electricity generation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Feed-In Tariff", "paragraphs": ["A feed-in tariff (FiT) is a renewable electricity incentive mechanism that generally serves two primary functions. First, it guarantees that all electricity generated from a renewable project will be purchased and will have access to the electric power grid (the \"feed-in\" portion of the FiT). Second, it guarantees the renewable project a long-term price for electricity produced, generally 15 to 30 years or even for the lifetime of a project, (the \"tariff\" portion of the FiT). The tariff, or rate, paid for renewable electricity is generally set higher than the prevailing wholesale electric power price. Thus, FiT incentives eliminate two key investment risks: (1) purchase risk, and (2) price risk. As a result, the FiT mechanism can create an attractive finance and investment opportunity that could stimulate development and installation of renewable power generation capacity.", "FiT incentive designs vary by country and the costs associated with FiT incentives can be paid for in different ways. Some countries distribute FiT costs to certain electricity rate-payers by adding a surcharge to consumer electricity bills. Other countries guarantee FiT compensation to power system operators, thus resulting in a national government budget commitment. FiT mechanisms can also include other design elements such as caps, which set a maximum amount of renewable electricity capacity that may be supported by the FiT, and \"degression,\" which provides for a periodic reduction of the FiT rate based on defined criteria. Additionally, some countries require regular reviews of FiT incentives in order to make rate adjustments that reflect changes to electric power, technology, and capital markets.", "One key challenge for a FiT incentive is for the national government to set a tariff rate that is high enough to incentivize development and investment in the renewable electricity sector, but not so high as to create windfall profits or stimulate capacity installations that result in power system operational issues and/or cost concerns. Despite these challenges, several EU countries have supported renewable electricity development through the use of FiT incentives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market Premium", "paragraphs": ["A market premium is a financial incentive that provides renewable power producers additional revenue above the market price for electricity. The market premium can either be fixed or variable. A fixed market premium provides a constant value for electricity generated from renewable energy sources in addition to the revenue received from wholesale power market sales. The value of the premium never changes regardless of the underlying wholesale power price, which can fluctuate up or down depending on the season and time-of-day. ", "A variable market premium provides a renewable power producer with an electricity price premium, above the wholesale market price that results in the power producer receiving a pre-determined value for each unit of electricity generated and sold. For example, a market premium policy may be designed to provide solar power projects total compensation of $0.30 for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity sold. The solar project would first sell power into the wholesale market and, for this example, the project received $0.18 per kWh. The market premium incentive mechanism would then provide an additional $0.12 per kWh to the solar project in order to reach the $0.30 per kWh pre-determined value. In essence, the variable market premium is equal to the pre-determined compensation value minus the wholesale power price. A variable market premium policy may also require the renewable power project to return some of its revenue should the wholesale market price exceed the pre-determined value. Initially, market premium incentives were designed to provide a fixed payment above the wholesale electricity price. Now, many market premium incentive policies provide a variable premium that places a cap on total compensation received for renewable electricity. The variable market premium provides a greater degree of revenue certainty to the project; however, it also limits the potential for investment returns.", "The market premium incentive can function much like a FiT in that a pre-determined value for electricity is received by the renewable power project owner. This is especially true for a variable premium. However, one key difference between the two incentives is that the market premium may just focus on price risk. Depending on how it is designed, the market premium may not eliminate purchase risk by guaranteeing access to the electricity grid. As a result, a renewable power project owner may be required to secure a purchase agreement with a third party for its electricity generation, consume the renewable electricity generated on site, or participate in wholesale market activities in order to sell its power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Green Certificates", "paragraphs": ["Green certificate incentive programs provide additional revenue, above that received from power sales, to renewable electricity generators through accumulation and sale of certificates to entities required to comply with annual renewable electricity quotas. The value of green certificates is generally determined through a market mechanism and typically fluctuates based on supply and demand. Green certificate programs can include various design elements (i.e., multipliers for different technologies, validity lifetimes for certificates). Certificates can be granted based on different metrics. For example, some countries might grant green certificates for each megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from a renewable power project, while other countries might award green certificates based on calculated carbon dioxide emission reductions. Power production at a renewable electricity generation facility is monitored and measured so green certificates can be issued based on the metric (i.e., electricity generation, carbon emission reduction) used. Generally, each certificate is assigned an identification number and is recorded in a central registry. A green certificate program results in the creation of a saleable commodity that is separate from the actual electricity generated by the renewable power project. Once granted, green certificates can be sold to entities that are required by law to comply with a defined renewable electricity quota obligation.", "Green certificate programs instituted in Europe have characteristics similar to renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and tradable renewable energy certificates (RECs) used in certain U.S. states. Whereas state RPS requirements set the renewable electricity obligations, RECs can be bought, sold, and traded among renewable power generators and obligated entities as a means of complying with annual renewable electricity requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tenders/Reverse Auctions", "paragraphs": ["Tenders are programs typically used to encourage development and installation of a defined amount of new renewable electricity capacity. Tenders function much like solicitations and procurements, whereby a government-authorized entity releases a tender document with the intent of entering into contracts with renewable electricity generators in order to meet a pre-determined renewable power quota. Qualified respondents generally submit an application, and sometimes a financial deposit, in response to the tender announcement. Successful projects are selected based on offers received by respondents that comply with the tender criteria. ", "Reverse auctions, sometimes included as part of the tender process, are policy mechanisms that encourage project developers to offer renewable electricity at the lowest cost. Since the reverse auction mechanism awards renewable power capacity based on the lowest renewable electricity bids, this approach can limit government financial commitments associated with renewable electric power incentives. When using reverse auctions, governments can set both minimum and maximum tariffs that will be paid for each unit (kilowatt-hour) of renewable electricity generated. Ideally, respondents are able to calculate the minimum tariff value needed in order for the project to obtain financing and be economically viable\u2014this tariff level is typically the price per kWh included in the respondent's application. When evaluating respondent offers, government agencies generally give preference to projects that offer the lowest tariffs they are willing to receive, assuming that respondents meet other qualification criteria included in the tender.

The German federal government's Electricity Feed-In Law of 1991 provided grid access for renewable power generators and required utilities to pay premium prices, equal to 90% of retail electricity rates, for renewable electricity. By some accounts, this was the first application of FiTs as a means of supporting deployment of renewable power generation assets. However, while the 1991 law did stimulate development of some wind and other renewable electricity generation projects, it only provided a single FiT value that was not high enough to motivate deployment of solar PV and other technologies at that time.", "In 2000, the German government replaced the 1991 Feed-In Law by passing the Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG), also known as the Renewable Energy Sources Act. The EEG shifted electricity purchase requirements to grid operators and set specific tariffs for individual technologies based on their respective power generation cost. The objective of technology-specific tariff levels in the EEG was to provide renewable electricity projects a guaranteed investment return that would stimulate development of renewable power capacity. ", "The German Bundestag (Parliament) passes binding EEG legislation, while the Federal Ministry of the Environment (BMU) and the Federal Grid Agency are responsible for implementing the EEG. Additionally, when making EEG policy decisions, the Environment Ministry consults with the Ministry of Economics, which has responsibility for overall energy policy in Germany. Between 2000 and 2012, the EEG was modified and amended multiple times to change and eliminate quotas on certain technologies, modify feed-in tariff values, and make other policy adjustments. Finally the EEG is generally credited with the expansion and growth of renewable power capacity in Germany, especially solar PV capacity.

One of the reasons for this policy change is to encourage renewable power projects to participate in the electric power market, thereby integrating renewable power with power market operations. Additionally, Germany's FiT/market premium incentives are designed to decline over time based on both pre-determined and market-responsive schedules. Feed-in tariffs, market premiums, and degression as applied in Germany are discussed further in the sections that follow."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Feed-in Tariffs for Onshore Wind and Solar PV Power", "paragraphs": ["Feed-in tariffs in Germany are provided for the first 20 calendar years of project operations, plus a partial year, based on the start-of-operations date, in which the project was commissioned. Germany's FiT incentive design has several unique aspects. For example, the German EEG specifies FiT payment levels for a wide range of renewable power technologies as well as for electricity generated from mine gas. Each technology receives a specific tariff level based on its estimated power generation cost. Additionally, onshore wind and solar PV FiT levels, provisions for project size and location, and degression schedules are fundamentally different. ", "Wind power in Germany is currently incentivized through a two-tiered tariff structure. All wind projects receive an initial tariff level for the first five years of project operations. At the end of five years the actual amount of electricity production from each project is compared against a reference yield, and the initial tariff can either be extended for a certain period of time or the project may receive a lower tariff level for the remainder of the 20-year FiT availability period. Additionally, the EEG provides a system services\u2014typically referred to as ancillary services in the United States\u2014bonus for projects that comply with requirements for wind projects to provide services such as frequency and voltage control. These services are currently provided by conventional power generators. The systems service bonus aims to incentivize wind power generators to install technical solutions that can provide system services, which will be needed as Germany's wind project portfolio grows. Table 1 provides FiT levels for onshore wind generation out to 2021 per the 2012 EEG amendment.", "FiT incentives for solar PV electricity provide a different level of compensation. Also, compensation varies with the size of solar projects. Different degression methods are used for wind (1.5% annually) and solar PV (dependent on the amount of capacity installed). Table 2 provides FiT levels, as of January 2012, for electricity generated from solar PV. The discussion below about degression provides detailed information about how solar PV FiT incentives are designed to be reduced over time.", "Originally, the 2012 EEG did not set any limits or quotas on the amount of wind or solar capacity that could be installed, either in a given year or on a cumulative basis. The EEG was subsequently modified to include a cumulative solar PV capacity limit of 52,000 MW, at which time FiT incentives will no longer be available for new projects. Capacity limits are one policy option that can help Germany manage the amount of renewable electricity installations as well as the costs associated with supporting renewable power deployment. To date, Germany has generally elected to use annual FiT incentive reductions, periodic FiT policy adjustments, and a federal project registry to monitor and manage renewable electricity capacity additions. Generally, the purpose of the federal project registry is to provide the government with solar PV market transparency in order to quickly assess capacity installations levels over a certain period of time. This transparency allows the government to respond to changing market conditions quickly and make periodic policy decisions based on actual market information.", "Significant and frequent reductions of solar PV feed-in tariffs have occurred since the January 2012 release of Germany's EEG. Key changes include 20% to 29% tariff cuts in April 2012 and monthly FiT reductions that use a degression approach based on capacity installations\u2014also referred to as \"corridor\" degression. Additionally, starting January 1, 2014, all solar PV projects commissioned after March 9, 2012, will receive FiTs for only 90% of solar electricity generated; this policy change encourages self-consumption of solar electricity and selling electricity in the wholesale power market. ", "Monthly FiT degressions, a policy change since 2012, can be difficult for project developers to navigate since development times for large projects can take months or longer to develop. With FiT rates constantly changing, obtaining project finance for some new projects may be difficult due to the complexities of accurately estimating project revenue, cash flow, and profitability.

One goal of introducing market premiums is to encourage renewable electricity projects to participate in wholesale power markets, thereby integrating renewables with the broader power sector. The value of the market premium is equal to the difference between technology-specific feed-in tariffs and the average monthly wholesale market price of electricity. In addition to the market premium, renewable project operators are also eligible to receive a management fee to compensate for administrative costs associated with participating in German power markets. While the market premium approach may appear to serve the same function as a FiT incentive, there are several distinct differences. The primary difference is that the market premium incentive requires renewable electricity projects to participate in the wholesale power market, and project owners must sell their electricity either to the electricity exchange or to a willing buyer through a power purchase agreement.", "Since the introduction in 2012, the market premium option has been popular with many wind and solar PV projects due to the additional revenue provided by the management fee. In fact, cost concerns with the market premium option caused the German government to reduce the management fee starting in January 2013. However, in an effort to incentivize market integration of renewable electricity, higher management fees are available to wind and solar PV projects that can be controlled remotely. This may result in wind and solar electricity production and distribution to be based more directly on demand, power prices, and other economic market conditions.", "A February 2013 joint proposal by the Federal Environment Ministry and the Federal Economics Ministry suggested eliminating FiT incentives for projects larger than 150 kW and requiring such projects to receive financial support via the market premium incentive.

Generally, the objective of degression is to set feed-in tariffs at a level that stimulates investment in project development and expands the market for renewable electricity generation, while at the same time avoiding windfall profits for project owners and the potential for over-deployment of renewable electricity projects. Ideally, the incentives for new projects are gradually reduced in order to motivate innovation and economies of scale that could result in renewable power becoming more economically competitive in the absence of subsidies or incentives.", "Germany's EEG includes FiT reductions for all renewable power technologies. However, the rate at which FiT levels decline for specific technologies is modified from time to time. FiTs for all renewable electricity technologies, with the exception of solar, are reduced annually by a certain percentage. For example, the 2012 EEG requires that onshore wind FiTs be reduced by 1.5% annually. Solar power FiTs are subject to a unique degression approach that is designed to respond to solar PV market dynamics. Solar FiT degression was designed as a way to limit and control the amount of solar power installed each year, without having to institute quotas or caps. For example, Germany's 2012 EEG indicates that the country is targeting annual solar PV installations between 2,500 MW and 3,500 MW, levels consistent with Germany's National Renewable Energy Action Plan. However, this target is neither a ceiling nor a binding limit. When annual solar installations reach base case levels between 2,500 MW to 3,500 MW, FiTs are reduced by 9%. However, the degression rate is adjusted either up or down based on the actual amount of annual solar PV installations. Table 3 illustrates how the solar PV degression rate is adjusted depending on the amount of annual solar PV installations.", "This market-based and responsive degression policy design was instituted in order to respond to rapidly changing solar power markets, which were experiencing rapid equipment cost declines due to over-capacity in the global solar module manufacturing marketplace. As a result, German FiTs were staying relatively high while the cost of solar electricity was falling. This situation motivated large amounts of solar power installations\u2014more than 7,000 MW in each of years 2011 and 2012 \u2014that far exceeded the implied 2,500 to 3,500 MW annual target."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Mechanics (Equalization Scheme)", "paragraphs": ["Electricity surcharges have emerged as a political issue ahead of September 2013 national elections. Germany's approach to pay for renewable electricity incentives is to spread the costs over a large electricity consumer base. Therefore, Germany does not use federal tax revenues to fund the EEG. In practice the EEG financial mechanics, known as the Equalization Scheme, includes several nuances and complexities. Generally, however, grid system operators pay feed-in tariffs to renewable power projects, and the above-market costs of the FiT incentives are passed along to certain domestic retail electricity customers through an EEG surcharge that is added to customer electricity bills. A more detailed description of the equalization scheme is provided in the text box below.", "The EEG surcharge applied to some consumer\u2014residential, commercial, and industrial\u2014electricity bills has increased since 2000 and annual increases have emerged as an important public policy issue. Figure 1 illustrates the cost components of residential electricity prices in Germany from 2000 to 2011. For reference, the 2013 EEG surcharge was set at approximately 5.3 \u20accent per kWh, an estimated 47% increase over 2012.", "While the EEG surcharge has increased, wholesale market prices for conventional sources of electric power (coal, nuclear, natural gas) have either stabilized or decreased due, in part, to what is known as the merit-order effect. This effect results from the priority access to the grid enjoyed by renewables. The merit-order effect is based on the general assumption that electricity is supplied from power generators starting with the lowest cost sources first. As power demand increases, so does the marginal cost of electricity. Renewable electricity in Germany has priority grid access. Therefore, as more renewables are added to the system the less demand for higher marginal cost power. As reflected in the retail electricity generation cost component, the merit-order effect observed to date is generally less than the EEG surcharge applied to retail electricity bills (see Figure 1 ).", "The rising EEG surcharge is a result of the costs associated with financial support provided to renewable electricity generation. As more renewables are added, the cumulative costs, and therefore the surcharges needed to cover those costs, go up as well. However, the rising surcharge is also influenced by two other factors: (1) EEG surcharge reductions for certain industries and (2) the method used to calculate the required surcharge. First, industrial operations and rail companies with high electricity consumption can apply for a reduced EEG surcharge of 0.05 \u20accent per kWh that is applied to a certain percentage of electricity purchases. Industrial operations that qualify for reduced EEG surcharges pay lower surcharges on a percentage of their total electricity purchases. The percentage varies depending on the volume of electricity consumed by industrial operations and rail companies. For example, industrial operations that consume more than 10 gigawatt-hours of electricity are eligible to pay the reduced surcharge on 90% of their electricity consumption; industrial operations that use more than 100 gigawatt-hours are eligible to pay the reduced surcharge on 100% of their electricity consumption. Other electricity customers, such as residential and small businesses, pay 5.3 \u20accent per kWh in 2013. The number of companies allowed to qualify for EEG surcharge reductions has been increasing; this increases the EEG surcharge since the costs are being distributed over a smaller customer group.", "The surcharge exemptions for certain industrial companies are in place in order to maintain global competitiveness for German manufacturers.

Total installed solar PV capacity was larger than any other country in the world, as of the end of 2012. As discussed above, financial incentives for wind and solar electricity have evolved over time. Initially, incentives were set at a single rate and provided enough revenue certainty to support some wind power development. A policy overhaul in 2000, along with subsequent modifications, created technology-specific tariffs with tiers based on project size and location. Each policy change affected the economics and market demand for wind and solar power generation.

While the system operators are able to recover costs associated with FiT incentives, they also must manage the integration and economics of variable sources of renewable power.

While some steps have been taken to adjust electricity rates to better reflect the all-in cost of electricity (i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution), many consumers continue to pay rates that are less than all-in electricity costs. As a result of selling electric power at a loss, Spanish utility companies have been accumulating a tariff deficit.

Also, while capacity limits were instituted for solar installations, the government provided a one-year grace period (2008) for projects in the development pipeline to be completed, after which the Spanish government would rigorously enforce capacity limits. The industry responded by installing as much capacity as possible in 2008, with nearly zero installed in 2009. Subsequently, the Spanish government took action to limit further solar PV deployment. Since 2008, several Royal Decrees have been enacted that reduce the financial incentives for solar PV, place annual limits on new installations, and require new projects to pre-register for the FiT incentive.

Import situations in the United States and EU are, therefore, quite different. Energy supply motivations may be relatively more compelling in the European Union. Additionally, energy resource endowments, ownership, and regulatory structures in the United States and EU are also very different. These factors can influence energy markets, resource development, and policy decisions. Finally, some fuels used for power generation are priced differently in the United States and EU. For example, natural gas, which typically sets the value of electricity during peak demand periods, is much more expensive in the EU than in the United States. In 2012, the average price of natural gas paid by U.S. electric power generators was $3.52 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). However, EU industrial natural gas consumers were paying, on average, more than $12.00 per MMBtu in 2012. The combination of the above factors may provide the EU with more economic motivation to stimulate renewable electricity generation deployment when compared to other countries.", "Electricity markets in the United States and EU countries are also different. While the United States does not have a single national market\u2014rather, multiple regional markets with different operating models and pricing structures\u2014many EU member countries do have national electricity markets. In some EU countries (i.e. Spain and Italy) the national government has ownership and/or control rights of electricity markets and transmission infrastructure. Additionally, EU national governments may also control electricity rates charged to consumers. In the United States, there are multiple regional electricity/transmission markets with different operating models and pricing structures. Further, some U.S. electricity markets are based on competitive market dynamics and some are based on cost-of-service models. Also in the United States, consumer electricity price levels are influenced by state-level commissions that regulate and monitor electric power utilities. These fundamental U.S. and EU market structure and regulation differences may result in difficulties\u2014technical and political\u2014associated with applying EU member-country incentive policies to the United States at a national level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EU Countries Contributed to Global Solar PV Cost Declines, to the Benefit of the United States", "paragraphs": ["Arguably, EU countries and electricity consumers paid for a large part of the development and scale-up of the global solar PV industry. As a result, significant equipment and system cost declines have been realized since 2008. Germany, Spain, and Italy set incentives at high enough levels to support adequate investment returns based on solar equipment and installation costs using a baseline set of assumptions. Incentives in some countries were generous enough to support high investment returns, which created opportunities for manufacturers to offer value-based pricing in order to capture substantial profit margins from the sale of PV equipment. These margin opportunities caused the manufacturing base to expand rapidly as more companies, many of them located in Asia, entered the market. Due to a number of circumstances\u2014including fiscal and economic challenges and declining policy support for renewable electricity\u2014the solar module manufacturing market reached an over-supply situation (i.e., manufacturing capacity exceeded solar PV demand) and prices began a precipitous decline in 2009.

Solar PV module costs began a rapid decline in 2009, reaching less than $1 per watt in 2012. As module costs came down, U.S. PV installations increased. Annual PV installations in the US are projected to continue rising out to 2015, while EU installations are forecasted to decline in the near term.

Some policies are at the EU and U.S. national level and some policies are available only in specific EU member-countries and individual U.S. states. Generally, the European Union sets binding renewable electricity requirements for each member, and each member country provides a unique set of financial incentives to motivate deployment of renewable power systems that will achieve the EU-level targets. In the United States, the federal government provides financial incentives for renewable electricity\u2014production tax credits for wind and investment tax credits for solar, for example\u2014and some states have established renewable portfolio standards that mandate a certain percentage of electricity be generated from renewable energy sources. As of June 2013, 29 states and the District of Columbia had binding renewable electricity targets. Details of the policy landscape in both the EU and U.S. are much more complicated than this general description.

Solar PV market growth in EU countries provides an illustrative example. Generally speaking, deployment follows incentives; countries with the most generous incentives\u2014in combination with solar resources, access to financial capital, and regulatory conditions\u2014typically experience the largest amounts of deployment. Up until 2012, EU countries such as Germany and Italy were installing more solar PV capacity each year than any other country in the world. In 2008, Spain had more solar installations that year than any other country. Each of these countries utilized generous FiT and market premium incentives as a solar PV financial support mechanism. However, managing and controlling FiT incentive programs can be difficult, especially in a dynamic and rapidly changing market like solar PV. Germany and Italy were the largest solar PV markets between 2010 and 2012, but installations in these countries were far exceeding plans and implied targets for annual solar PV capacity additions. Germany reacted by rapidly and frequently reducing incentives offered to new projects. Italy imposed an annual expenditure limit for new solar PV systems; this limit was reached in June 2013 and solar PV FiTs are no longer available as of July 2013. Ultimately, actions by Germany and Italy will reduce annual solar capacity additions in each respective country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EU Countries are shifting from Electricity Production-based to Market Integration-based Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Following several years of significant renewable electricity deployment, especially solar PV, some EU countries are changing financial support mechanisms to encourage electricity market integration\u2014i.e., selling electricity in the wholesale market, allowing for curtailment under certain circumstances\u2014instead of electricity generation. To date, FiTs and declining equipment prices have resulted in significant solar PV deployment in the EU, most notably in Germany and Italy. However, concerns with electric power system reliability are prompting these countries to incentivize the integration of renewables into electric power markets. Integration incentives are generally motivated by high levels of renewables penetration into the electric power system and countries are looking for ways to address the output variability of renewable power systems. Market integration incentives could potentially create a situation whereby renewable electricity generators respond to market and price signals, which could help to manage the power production variability from renewable energy sources. Analysis of Germany's renewable electricity production highlights the variability of wind and solar during certain time periods throughout the year; renewable electricity output in Germany ranged from approximately 10 Gigawatts to nearly 70 Gigawatts in 2012. This variability not only causes challenges with grid system operations, but also with wholesale electricity price levels that can potentially strain the economics of power generation assets that may be needed to maintain system reliability. As a result, countries may need to consider different market designs that support various types of generation and services that might be necessary to ensure stable and reliable electric power system operations. Additionally, Germany started offering an energy storage subsidy for solar PV projects to encourage investment in battery storage that might support the integration of solar PV with the electric power system. Germany has indicated that it plans to shift from feed-in tariffs to market premiums as a way to better integrate renewables with the grid and power market. Additionally, Germany now provides a flexibility premium for electricity generated from non-intermittent renewable sources like biogas, which has the ability to ramp production up and down based on grid system needs. Germany also provides bonus incentives for wind and solar projects that are remotely controlled, thereby allowing the grid system operator to control and manage electricity output from variable renewable power sources.", "Italy's National Energy Strategy (NES) states that the \"growing amount of production from intermittent, non-programmable sources is increasingly becoming a challenge for the network infrastructure and for the market.\" The NES also indicates that Italy aims to \"gradually integrate renewable electricity with the market and grid.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Phasing-out Renewable Electricity Financial Incentives is Possible but Challenging", "paragraphs": ["Germany's renewable electricity support policy, the EEG, was designed to gradually reduce incentives in order to stimulate cost reductions that would, in turn, result in renewable electricity being cost competitive on an unsubsidized basis. Italy also introduced a degression plan to reduce incentives over time and its National Energy Strategy states that \"it is expected that incentives will gradually be reduced (and eventually cease ... ), the eventual aim being the full integration with the electricity market and the grid.\" Generally, the goal of incentive reductions is to match the evolutionary pace of economies of scale and deployment experience to push down system costs, thereby allowing a lower incentive level to stimulate demand for new renewable electricity capacity. However, experience in Germany and Italy indicates that incentive reductions can be challenging to adapt to rapidly changing market circumstances. For example, solar PV installations in Germany and Italy were well above government plans and targets between 2010 and 2012. Germany responded by applying degression every six months to solar PV FiT incentives, instead of once a year, and then instituted monthly FiT degression in order to better manage and control annual solar PV capacity additions. Both Germany and Italy have also instituted policies that eliminate financial incentives for solar PV once certain capacity and cost milestones are reached; Germany's incentives will cease once 52,000 MW of capacity is installed and Italy's incentives will no longer be available when annual support costs reach \u20ac6.7 billion. Once these milestones are reached\u2014Italy reached its milestone in June 2013\u2014annual PV capacity additions may decline and it seems unlikely that they could return to 2010-2012 levels in the near future.

As discussed earlier in this report, Spain has introduced retroactive incentive reductions that change the baseline financial performance on which project investment decisions were made. Other EU countries, such as Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania, have also made retroactive cuts to renewable power incentives. In early 2013, Germany proposed a renewable electricity incentive modification plan, which included a one-year 1.5% FiT reduction for all operating renewable projects. This plan was not approved and future policy direction in Germany is not expected until after national elections in September 2013.", "Retroactive incentive cuts immediately impact the economics of existing projects that are subject to the reduction. However, future projects are also affected and the cost of electricity from renewables will likely increase, all else being equal. Retroactive incentive reductions introduce an element of policy risk and uncertainty into the finance and investment decision matrix. This additional investment risk is likely to increase the cost of capital used to finance future renewable electricity projects. Higher financing costs generally result in renewable electricity generation cost increases. Further, as renewable electricity generation costs increase, so does the cost of the certain incentive programs since these costs are calculated as the difference between renewable generation costs and electricity market prices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
