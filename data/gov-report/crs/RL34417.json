These programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads by 20 to 30 years through design, certification, manufacture, and replacement of components. Two LEPs are underway. One for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs will complete actions needed to close out the program in FY2009; its FY2008 budget was $61.9 million, and the FY2009 request was $2.2 million. The other LEP is for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile. Its FY2008 budget was $172.2 million, while its FY2009 request was $209.2 million. Work in FY2008 involved preparation for manufacture with a goal of making the first production unit. NNSA plans to ramp to full production in FY2009, and the first life-extended W76 entered the stockpile in February 2009. P.L. 111-8 provided $205.0 million. Stockpile Systems. This program involves routine maintenance, replacement of limited-life components, ongoing assessment, and the like for all weapon types in the stockpile. The FY2008 budget was $340.1 million; the FY2009 request was $338.7 million. Of the eight warhead types listed, the two largest programs under stockpile systems are for the B61 and W76. P.L. 111-8 provided $328.5 million. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD). The President and Congress have agreed on the desirability of reducing the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security, and numbers of warheads have fallen sharply since the end of the Cold War. According to NNSA, \"Reducing the total number of U.S. nuclear weapons sends a clear message to the world that critical modernization programs do not signal a return to the arms race of the Cold War.\" WDD involves interim storage of warheads to be dismantled, dismantlement, and disposition, i.e., storing or eliminating warhead components and materials. The FY2008 budget was $134.7 million; the FY2009 request was $183.7 million. P.L. 111-8 provided $190.2 million. Within WDD, the major activity is the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF). The \"pit\" is the fissile component (usually plutonium) of a nuclear warhead that initiates a thermonuclear explosion. As warheads are dismantled, pits may be stored, but for permanent disposition PDCF would convert the plutonium in pits to plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), where it would become fuel for commercial light-water nuclear reactors. The project also includes a Waste Solidification Building (WSB) to convert liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site. (In FY2008, MFFF was transferred from NNSA to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The FY2009 budget request would transfer the project to Other Defense Activities.) In FY2009, NNSA plans to begin construction of WSB and to continue design and technology development for PDCF. Stockpile Services. This category includes Production Support; R&D Support; R&D Certification and Safety; Management, Technology, and Production; Pit Manufacturing; and Pit Manufacturing Capability. Under Pit Manufacturing, NNSA plans to manufacture stockpile-quality pits for the W88 warhead at Los Alamos National Laboratory. NNSA established a capacity of 10 pits per year in FY2007, a figure it plans to increase to 50 to 80 pits per year. Closely related is Pit Manufacturing Capability, which develops processes to manufacture pits other than for the W88. The budget for Stockpile Services was $692.4 million for FY2008; $931.9 million was requested for FY2009. P.L. 111-8 provided $866.4 million. Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW). This program seeks to develop a warhead initially to replace W76 warheads. The design would trade characteristics important during the Cold War, notably high warhead yield per unit of warhead weight, for features deemed more important now, such as ease of manufacture, enhanced use denial, reduced cost, and ease of certification without nuclear testing. Supporters assert RRW can meet these goals; critics raise technical concerns, argue that it could spur nuclear proliferation, and hold that the Life Extension Program can maintain existing warheads. Congress eliminated FY2008 funds for developing this warhead. For FY2009, NNSA requested $10.0 million to address certain questions on certifying RRW and to document work completed through FY2007.

Another component of the Science Campaign is Test Readiness, the ability to conduct nuclear testing should that be deemed necessary. In FY2007, NNSA had achieved the ability to conduct a test within 24 months of an order to do so; because of budgetary pressures, that schedule increased to 24 to 36 months.

The committee recommended reducing nuclear test readiness to $5.4 million. Engineering Campaign. This campaign develops capabilities to assess and improve nonnuclear components of nuclear warheads. It provides technologies to improve surety, which includes such nuclear weapon characteristics as safety, security, and use control; develops means to assess weapons design, manufacturing, and certification; provides the means to qualify components to meet requirements for high-radiation environments, such as from missile defenses; and develops capabilities to detect and assess stockpile aging at an early stage. The FY2008 budget for this campaign was $169.5 million. For FY2009, the request was $142.7 million and P.L. 111-8 provided $150.0 million. Within this campaign, the request for advanced surety was $35.6 million; the committee provided $70.0 million and barred use of the funds for RRW.

The centerpiece of this campaign is the National Ignition Facility (NIF), the world's largest laser. While NIF was controversial in Congress for many years and had significant cost growth and technical problems, completion is expected in 2009, so the controversy over NIF has waned. The FY2008 budget for this campaign was $470.2 million. The FY2009 request was $421.2 million, which included no funds for NIF construction. P.L. 111-8 provided $436.9 million.

Through this office, DOE also administers the disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination at sites where the federal government conducted civilian nuclear energy research.", "Altogether, over 100 federal facilities across the United States were involved in the production of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy research. The total land area of these facilities encompasses over 2 million acres, approximately the size of the states of Rhode Island and Delaware combined. Although cleanup is complete at over 80 of these facilities, DOE expects cleanup to continue at some facilities for many years, even decades at the larger and more complex facilities where substantial volumes of wastes are stored and contamination is more severe. DOE estimates that total outstanding costs to complete cleanup at all of the remaining facilities could range between $205.43 billion and $260.53 billion, and that the last facility, Hanford, in the state of Washington, may not be cleaned up until as late as 2062. DOE expects additional funds to be needed for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities at many facilities for additional decades after the initial cleanup work is completed to ensure protection of human health and the environment. All of these needs combined represent a substantial financial liability to the United States for many years into the future.", "Some of the facilities historically administered under the Office of Environmental Management have been transferred to other offices within DOE and to the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1997, Congress directed the Office of Environmental Management to transfer responsibility for the cleanup of smaller, less contaminated facilities under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) to the Corps. Once cleanup of a FUSRAP site is complete, the Corps is responsible for any long-term activities that may be needed only for the first two years after the initial cleanup work is completed. After that time, jurisdiction over the site is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management to administer these activities.

This task is one of the more costly cleanup challenges facing DOE. Some of the tanks at Hanford are known or suspected to have leaked wastes that have migrated through groundwater that eventually discharges into the Columbia River.
