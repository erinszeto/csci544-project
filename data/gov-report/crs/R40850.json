Concerns about e-waste landfill disposal have led federal and state environmental agencies to encourage recycling. To date, 23 states have enacted some form of mandatory e-waste recycling program. These state requirements, mixed with increased consumer awareness regarding potential problems with landfilling e-waste, have led to an increase in recycling. With that increase have come new questions about e-waste management.

For example, little information is available to allow a complete assessment of how e-waste is ultimately managed. General estimates have been made about the management of cathode ray tubes (CRTs, the only devices where disposal is federally regulated), but little reliable information is available regarding other categories of e-waste. For example, accurate data regarding how much is generated, how it is managed (through disposal or recycling), and where it is processed (domestically or abroad) are largely unknown. Further, little information is available regarding the total amount of functioning electronics exported to developing countries for legitimate reuse.", "What is known is that e-waste recycling involves complex processes and it is more costly to recycle e-waste in the United States.

As a result, the majority of e-waste collected for recycling (either for reuse or recycling) appears to be exported for processing.", "Although there may be limited data regarding how e-waste is managed, the consequences of export to developing countries that manage it improperly are becoming increasingly evident. In particular, various reports and studies (by the mainstream media, environmental organizations, and university researchers) have found primitive waste management practices in India and various countries in Africa and Asia. Operations in Guiyu in the Shantou region of China have gained particular attention. Observed recycling operations involve burning the plastic coverings of materials to extract metals for scrap, openly burning circuit boards to remove solder or soaking them in acid baths to strip them for gold or other metals.

Electronic devices, particularly older units in use today or in storage, contain a host of hazardous constituents such as lead, mercury, or chromium, as well as plastics treated with brominated flame retardants.

Further, state and local waste management agencies have expressed concerns regarding the potential cumulative impact to human health and the environment of landfilling millions of pounds of e-waste. As a result, individual states have begun to enact their own e-waste management requirements. To date, 23 states and New York City have enacted some form of e-waste management law. Those laws include provisions such as restrictions on landfill disposal of certain e-wastes and the establishment of mandatory recycling programs, generally paid for by electronics manufacturers.

With increased exports have come increased media attention on the improper handling of e-waste in those areas and its resulting impacts. Various reports have graphically documented health and safety threats to workers and environmental contamination from e-waste recovery practices in developing countries.

Further, heavy metal contamination in surface water and sediments was found that could be attributed to the direct effects of e-waste recycling operations in Guiyu. Copper from surface water was found to be 2.4 to 131 times the reference background concentrations, and sediment samples were 3.2 to 429 times the reference levels. The study also found severe levels of contamination for lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic in sediment and surface water as a result of recycling operations.", "In addition to environmental contamination, impacts on humans have been observed. In a 2007 study, children from one to six years old in Guiyu were compared to those living in a neighboring town where no e-waste processing was done.

E-waste would most likely exhibit toxicity characteristics, meaning it would be harmful or fatal when ingested or absorbed (because it contains toxic substances such as mercury or lead). When toxic wastes are disposed of on land, contaminated liquid may drain (leach) from the waste and pollute ground water. A common test method to determine the toxicity level of a waste is the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). The TCLP test is intended to simulate conditions that would likely occur in a landfill, and measures the potential for toxic constituents to seep or \"leach\" into groundwater.

Studies have determined that devices such as personal computer central processing units (CPUs), laptop computers, printers, computer mice, and keyboards have the potential to exceed toxicity limits, but it has not been determined that entire classes of electronic devices will always be toxic. Toxicity levels would likely vary by manufacturer, make, and model.", "Even if a device meets the definition of hazardous waste, that does not necessarily mean that the device must be disposed of in accordance with RCRA's hazardous waste regulations.
