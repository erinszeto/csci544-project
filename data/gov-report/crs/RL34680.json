The longest such shutdown lasted 21 full days during FY1996, from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996. More recently, a relatively long funding gap commenced on October 1, 2013, the first day of FY2014, after funding for the previous fiscal year expired. Because funding did not resume on October 1, affected agencies began to cease operations and furlough personnel that day. A 16-full-day shutdown ensued, the first to occur in over 17 years.

The options include", "coming to agreement on regular appropriations acts by October 1, the beginning of a new fiscal year; using one or more interim continuing resolutions (CRs) to extend temporary funding beyond the beginning of a fiscal year, until a point in time when negotiators make final decisions about full-year funding levels; or not agreeing on full-year or interim appropriations acts, resulting in a temporary funding gap and a corresponding shutdown of affected federal government activities.", "If Congress and the President pursue the second or third options, they may agree on full-year appropriations after the beginning of the fiscal year.

A funding gap and shutdown are distinct events, however (see Box 1 ). ", "In general, a shutdown implies the furlough of certain personnel and curtailment of agency activities and services. There are multiple exceptions to this general process, however, as this report explains later.

They also have occurred when Congress and the President did not come to an agreement on stop-gap funding through a CR. As noted in another CRS report, six relatively lengthy funding gaps occurred from FY1977 to FY1980, ranging from 8 to 17 full days. These funding gaps occurred before the Department of Justice issued legal opinions in 1980 and 1981 about agency activities that may continue during a funding gap. The opinions, which are discussed later in this report, were more restrictive in their implications about allowable activities during a funding gap compared to what agencies had done in the past. After FY1980, funding gaps continued to occur at times, but the durations of funding gaps shortened considerably compared to prior years. From FY1981 to FY1995, nine funding gaps occurred with durations of up to three full days. ", "A significant exception to the trend toward shorter funding gaps occurred in FY1996. Two funding gaps and corresponding shutdowns of affected activities ensued, amounting to five full days during November 1995 and 21 full days during December 1995-January 1996. In the wake of the FY1996 experience, funding gaps did not occur again for over 17 years. Nevertheless, another relatively long funding gap began on October 1, 2013, the first day of FY2014, after funding for FY2013 expired at the end of September. A 16-full-day shutdown of affected activities followed. ", "Subsequently, in FY2018, two brief shutdowns occurred. The two shutdowns illustrate how the time of day when funding resumes may affect choices that are made about when government operations will resume. They also illustrate some challenges related to counting the number of days that correspond to a particular funding gap or shutdown. Notably, they show, in different ways, how a shutdown can occur on a particular day, even in the absence of a funding gap.", "The first FY2018 shutdown began after a CR expired at the end of the day on Friday, January 19, 2018. A funding gap and shutdown ensued over the weekend. OMB directed agencies to execute plans for an orderly shutdown, and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) indicated that a lapse in appropriations could affect agency operations with implications for whether employees should report to work on Saturday, January 20, 2018. Funding resumed on Monday, January 22, 2018, through another CR, which technically closed the funding gap for the entire day of Monday. Nevertheless, many federal agencies continued to shut down certain operations and furlough related employees on this weekday, because the CR that resumed funding was enacted during Monday evening, after working hours had already passed. OPM then announced late in the evening on January 22, 2018, that due to enactment of a CR, employees would be expected to return to work on Tuesday, January 23, 2018.", "The second FY2018 shutdown began after a CR expired at the end of the day on Thursday, February 8, 2018. In the hours after the CR's funding expired, OMB directed agencies to execute their shutdown plans, and OPM indicated that employees might be affected. A few hours later, in the morning of Friday, February 9, 2018, Congress and the President enacted another CR to extend funding. This prompted OMB and OPM to inform employees to come to work on the same day, that morning. From the perspective of prior OMB statements, a funding gap technically did not occur on February 9, 2018. However, given that OMB and OPM issued directions for a shutdown after funding expired, it is possible that some agency operations may have been affected in the few hours between expiration of the previous CR and enactment of the succeeding CR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Framework for How Shutdowns Have Occurred", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution, statutory provisions, court opinions, and Department of Justice (DOJ) opinions provide the legal framework for how funding gaps and shutdowns have occurred in recent decades. Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution states, \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" Federal employees and contractors cannot be paid, for example, if appropriations have not been enacted in the first place. Nevertheless, it would appear to be possible under the Constitution for the government to make contracts or other obligations even if it lacks funds to pay for these commitments. Several provisions of law\u2014which commonly are referred to as the Antideficiency Act\u2014generally prevent this from happening, however. The act, which evolved over time and is located in Title 31 of the U.S. Code , prohibits federal officials from obligating funds before an appropriations measure has been enacted, except as authorized by law. The act also prohibits federal officials from accepting voluntary services or employing personal services exceeding what has been authorized by law. Therefore, the Antideficiency Act generally prohibits agencies from continued operation in the absence of appropriations. Failure to comply with the act may result in criminal sanctions, fines, and administrative discipline including suspension without pay or removal from office. The act makes exceptions to the prohibitions on acceptance of voluntary services and employment of personal services, however, for \"emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\"", "For years leading up to 1980, many federal agencies continued to operate during a funding gap, \"minimizing all nonessential operations and obligations, believing that Congress did not intend that agencies close down,\" while waiting for the enactment of annual appropriations acts or CRs. In 1980 and 1981, however, then-U.S. Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti issued two opinions that more strictly interpreted the Antideficiency Act, along with the law's exceptions, in the context of a funding gap.", "The Attorney General's opinions addressed \"the scope of currently existing legal and constitutional authorities for the continuance of government functions during a temporary lapse in appropriations.\" In brief, the opinions stated that, with some exceptions, the head of an agency could avoid violating the Antideficiency Act only by suspending the agency's operations until the enactment of an appropriation. In the absence of appropriations, exceptions would be allowed only when there is \"some reasonable and articulable connection between the function to be performed and the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" In addition, \"there must be some reasonable likelihood that the safety of human life or the protection of property would be compromised, in some degree, by delay in the performance of the function in question.\" Apart from this broad category of \"human life and property\" exceptions to the act, the Civiletti opinions identified another category: those exceptions that are \"authorized by law.\" GAO later summarized the 1981 Civiletti opinion as identifying four sub-types of \"authorized by law\" exceptions:", "Activities funded with appropriations of budget authority that do not expire at the end of one fiscal year, such as multiple-year and no-year appropriations. These activities may continue when the multiple-year and no-year appropriations still have budget authority that is available for obligation at the time of a funding gap. In addition, agencies that receive most or all of their budget authority for their day-to-day operations through means that are not dependent on annual appropriations acts, such as the U.S. Postal Service, would fall under this exception. Activities authorized by statutes that expressly permit obligations in advance of appropriations, such as contract authority. Activities \"authorized by necessary implication from the specific terms of duties that have been imposed on, or of authorities that have been invested in, the agency.\" The Civiletti opinion illustrated this abstract concept by citing the situation when benefit payments under an entitlement program are funded from other-than-one-year appropriations (i.e., where benefit payments are not subject to a funding gap, because they are authorized by permanent entitlement authority), but the salaries of personnel who administer the program are funded by one-year appropriations (i.e., the salaries are subject to a funding gap). In this situation, the Attorney General offered the view that continued availability of money for benefit payments would necessarily imply that continued administration of the program is authorized by law at some level and therefore excepted from the Antideficiency Act. Obligations \"necessarily incident to presidential initiatives undertaken within his constitutional powers,\" such as the power to grant pardons and reprieves. GAO later expressed the view that this same rationale would apply to legislative branch agencies that incur obligations \"necessary to assist the Congress in the performance of its constitutional duties.\"", "For its part, the 1980 Civiletti opinion included in the \"authorized by law\" exception an inference that federal officers may, in the temporary absence of appropriations, exercise authority to incur minimal obligations necessary to closing their agencies in an orderly way. Subsequently, OMB interpreted this exception to fall under the \"necessary implication\" sub-type of the \"authorized by law\" exception.", "In 1990, in response to the 1981 Civiletti opinion, Congress amended 31 U.S.C. \u00a71342 to clarify that \"the term 'emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property' does not include ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) issued a memorandum in 1995 (hereinafter \"1995 OLC opinion\") that interpreted the effect of the amendment. The 1995 OLC opinion said one aspect of the 1981 Civiletti opinion's description of emergency governmental functions should be modified in light of the amendment (suggesting that the phrase \"in some degree\" be replaced with \"in some significant degree\"), but that the 1981 opinion otherwise \"continues to be a sound analysis of the legal authorities respecting government operations\" during a funding gap. ", "More recently, OMB summarized its interpretation of exceptions to the Antideficiency Act in a series of similar, detailed memoranda. The memoranda were issued to agencies in April and December 2011 (regarding FY2011 and FY2012 annual appropriations, respectively), September 2013 (regarding FY2014 annual appropriations), and January 2018 (regarding FY2018 annual appropriations). ", "Notably, the opinions of OLC and OMB do not permit outlays\u2014such as the issuance of checks, disbursement of cash, or electronic transfer of funds\u2014to liquidate federal obligations for operations that lack appropriated funding during a shutdown. Rather, OLC and OMB have interpreted the Antideficiency Act as including exceptions that provide only the authority to incur obligations that will be paid upon enactment of appropriations in the future. ", "Observers sometimes wish to contrast the effect of a government shutdown, on one hand, with the effect of the federal government reaching its statutory debt limit and not raising it, on the other. The two situations are distinct in terms of their effects on agency operations and on federal government payments to liquidate obligations (see Box 2 )."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OMB and Agency Processes for Shutdown Planning", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Annual Instructions for Agencies", "paragraphs": ["In the annually revised Circular No. A-1 1 , OMB provides instructions to executive branch agencies on how to prepare for and operate during a funding gap. The circular cites the two Civiletti opinions and the 1995 OLC opinion as background and guidance. The circular also establishes two \"policies\" regarding the absence of appropriations: ", "a prohibition on incurring obligations unless the obligations are otherwise authorized by law and permission to incur obligations \"as necessary for orderly termination of an agency's functions,\" but prohibition of any disbursement (i.e., payment).", "The circular also directs agency heads to develop and maintain shutdown plans. These plans sometimes also have been called \"contingency plans.\" ", "Prior to the 2011 revision of Circular No. A-11 , the circular broadly indicated that the plans were to be submitted to OMB when initially prepared and also when revised. The plans themselves were required to contain summary information about the number of employees expected to be on-board before a shutdown and also the number of employees who would be \"retained\" (i.e., excepted from furlough) during a shutdown. With the August 2011 revision of the circular, however, OMB newly required that these plans contain more detailed information, be updated under certain conditions, and be updated periodically, with a minimum frequency of a four-year schedule starting August 1, 2014. OMB's change in instructions occurred four months after Congress and the President almost came to an impasse, in April 2011, on FY2011 appropriations. After the FY2014 shutdown, OMB's 2014 revision to the circular changed the schedule for updates to shutdown plans. Henceforward, agencies were instructed to submit updated plans to OMB for review with a minimum frequency of every two years, beginning August 1, 2015.", "Under OMB's instructions from Circular No. A-11 , agency heads are told to use the DOJ opinions and the circular, in consultation with the agencies' general counsels, to \"decide what agency activities are excepted or otherwise legally authorized to continue during a lapse in appropriations.\" Furthermore, these plans are required to address agency actions in two distinct time periods of a shutdown: an initial period of one to five days, which OMB characterized as a \"short\" lapse, and a second period if a shutdown were to extend further. Among other things, a shutdown plan is required to include ", "a summary of agency activities that will continue and those that will cease; an estimate of the time to complete the shutdown, to the nearest half-day; the number of employees expected to be on-board (i.e., filled positions) before implementation of the plan; and the total number of employees to be retained (i.e., not furloughed), broken out into five categories of exceptions to the Antideficiency Act, including employees (1) who are paid from a resource other than annual appropriations; (2) who are necessary to perform activities expressly authorized by law; (3) who are necessary to perform activities necessarily implied by law; (4) who are necessary to the discharge of the President's constitutional duties and powers; and (5) who are necessary to protect life and property.", "After providing this information for the agency as a whole, an agency's plan is required to further break out some of the information by \"component\" (e.g., a bureau-size entity within a department). OMB's circular also instructs agencies to take personnel actions to release employees according to applicable law and OPM regulations. OPM maintains a website with guidance, historical OMB documents, and frequently asked questions about furloughs. In 2018, OMB newly directed agencies to, \"in coordination with OMB,\" notify employees two business days before a potential lapse about their work and pay status under a lapse.", "In general, the OMB circular refers to employees who are to be furloughed as \"released,\" and employees who will not be furloughed as \"excepted\" or \"retained.\" More broadly, officials and observers may employ a variety of personnel-related terms in the context of a government shutdown, many of which begin with the letter \"e.\" For discussion of the term \"excepted\" and other terms that may be used in practice, see Box 3 . Notably, some parts of the federal government may employ a term in a way that is official but different from usage elsewhere. At other times, usage of a term may be colloquial or may suggest meanings that are not intended.", "Aside from Circular No. A-11 , other OMB documents and guidance from previous funding gaps and shutdowns may provide insights into current and future practices.

Some of these OMB documents also have been reproduced in legislative branch documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detailed Guidance to Agencies and Posting of Shutdown Plans", "paragraphs": ["In addition to OMB's annual instructions in Circular No. A-11 , OMB may provide more detailed guidance to agencies in specific situations.

On occasion, Members of Congress have questioned the rationales for how determinations of \"excepted\" status were made. (See the section of this report that is titled \" Quality and Specificity of Agency Planning .\") Consequently, it is conceivable that non-public guidance documents might be of interest to Congress in some circumstances. ", "Both of the aforementioned kinds of communications have been in evidence in the context of shutdown planning. For example, in the days leading up to near-impasses on appropriations for FY2011 and FY2012, OMB supplemented its annual Circular No. A-11 instructions with more detailed guidance to agencies. Shortly before FY2011 funding was scheduled to expire in April 2011, OMB instructed agencies through a publicly available memorandum to create or revise shutdown plans and post them on the Internet. In these instructions, OMB said it had earlier been \"providing guidance and coordinating the efforts of the Executive Branch to facilitate appropriate contingency planning in accordance with the provisions of the Antideficiency Act.\" OMB apparently provided the earlier guidance and coordination over a period of time through non-public documents and instructions. ", "For the near-impasses of FY2011 and FY2012, as well as the actual impasses of FY2014 and FY2018, agencies and OMB followed generally the same process of posting new or revised shutdown plans on the Internet. In each instance, OMB posted agencies' plans on the same web page. Many agencies also created their own web pages, which described shutdown procedures and linked to their plans. These resources covered many topics in addition to the information that OMB Circular No. A-11 addressed. Additional topics included shutdown precedents, guidelines, furlough policies, and frequently asked questions. Documents also addressed availability of government services, unemployment compensation for federal employees, union concerns, and information about past shutdowns. ", "For the shutdowns that occurred in FY2014 and FY2018, agencies implemented their plans after OMB instructed them to do so. On September 30, 2013, for example, OMB said in a memorandum that it did not have a clear indication that Congress would act in time for the President to sign a CR before the end of October 1.

Shutdown furloughs are not considered a break in service and are generally creditable for retaining benefits and seniority. With regard to pay, there appears to be no guarantee that employees placed on shutdown furlough would receive pay for the time they are placed on furlough. This may be the case, because if furloughed employees are prohibited from coming to work during a shutdown, the government arguably would not be incurring a legal obligation to pay them. Several considerations, including personnel costs, future productivity, and employee retention, might be weighed when assessing the issue of retroactive pay for furloughed staff. Nevertheless, in historical practice, federal employees who were furloughed under a shutdown generally have received their salaries retroactively as a result of legislation to that effect. For example, a CR provision required that employees who were furloughed during the FY2014 government shutdown be paid retroactively:", "Employees furloughed as a result of any lapse in appropriations which begins on or about October 1, 2013, shall be compensated at their standard rate of compensation, for the period of such lapse in appropriations, as soon as practicable after such lapse in appropriations ends.", "In the case of excepted employees, OMB has stated several times in detailed, shutdown-related guidance to agencies that ", "[w]ithout further specific direction or enactment by Congress, all excepted employees are entitled to receive payment for obligations incurred by their agencies for their performance of excepted work during the period of the appropriations lapse. After appropriations are enacted, payroll centers will pay all excepted employees for time worked.", "In addition, a 1981 memorandum from OMB to the heads of executive departments and agencies included the following statements: ", "It should be made clear that, during a [sic] appropriations hiatus, funds may not be available to permit agency payment of obligations. All personnel performing excepted services, including activities incident to the orderly suspension of agency operations, should be assured that the United States will not contest its legal obligation to make payment for such services, even in the absence of appropriations.", "Historically, Congress has authorized retroactive pay for excepted employees who work during a government shutdown by ratifying and approving the obligations incurred in anticipation of appropriations. For example, the CR that was enacted following the FY2014 shutdown included the following provision:", "All obligations incurred in anticipation of the appropriations made and authority granted by this joint resolution for the purposes of maintaining the essential level of activity to protect life and property and bringing about orderly termination of Government functions, and for purposes as otherwise authorized by law, are hereby ratified and approved if otherwise in accord with the provisions of this joint resolution.", "Congress pursued similar courses of action regarding the two FY2018 shutdowns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of Furloughs During the FY1996 and FY2014 Shutdowns", "paragraphs": ["The experiences of FY1996 and FY2014 illustrate what may occur with respect to furloughs during a shutdown of relatively long duration.

The first shutdown, which lasted five full days between November 13-19, 1995, resulted in the furlough of approximately 800,000 federal employees in agencies funded by 10 of the then-13 regular appropriations bills. The shutdown was caused by the expiration of a CR agreed to on September 30, 1995 ( P.L. 104-31 ), and by President William J. Clinton's veto of a second CR. As of December 15, 1995, four additional regular appropriations acts for FY1996 had been enacted. Therefore, six regular appropriations bills remained unenacted at the start of the second shutdown. The second shutdown lasted 21 full days between December 15, 1995, and January 6, 1996. It was triggered by the expiration of a CR that had been enacted on November 20, 1995 ( P.L. 104-56 ), which funded the government through December 15, 1995. On January 2, 1996, the estimate of furloughed federal employees for the second shutdown was 284,000. Fewer employees and agencies were affected, because some funding bills were enacted during and after the first shutdown and before the second shutdown. In addition, many employees were recalled back to work even in the absence of funding, due to ongoing redeterminations of employees' status as excepted or non-excepted. There were eight CRs from January 6, 1996, until April 26, 1996, when the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-134 ) was enacted.

At that time, none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2014 had been enacted.

This narrow CR provided funds for FY2014 pay and allowances for certain members of the Armed Forces and supporting contractors and civilian personnel. Full implementation of the law was delayed several days while agencies determined how to interpret and implement its provisions.

The number decreased during the course of the shutdown due to the implementation of P.L. 113-39 (see Box 5 ).

At first, many media accounts drew primarily from the shutdown plans that agencies and OMB posted online. As the shutdown continued, national and local outlets typically focused on specific agencies, programs, or experiences of citizens or stakeholders who said they were affected. Agencies themselves often did not report information about the ongoing impact of the shutdown during the 16-day period, however, due to the furlough of relevant staff and non-updating of their websites. ", "After the FY2014 shutdown, some Members of Congress requested assessments of its effects. Three weeks after the shutdown concluded, OMB posted on its website a 27-page report compiling the \"impacts and costs\" of the FY2014 shutdown. The publication's level of detail stood in marked contrast with the document that OMB produced after the two shutdowns of FY1996, when, as described earlier, OMB generated a three-page paper compiling \"illustrations\" of the impacts of the two shutdowns. OMB's FY2014 report discussed the impact of the shutdown through five sometimes-overlapping perspectives, in separate sections. The bullets below provide an illustrative sampling of the contents in each section.", "C osts to the E conomy. 169 According to OMB, these costs included overall macroeconomic effects (the subject of another CRS report) and several kinds of \"economic disruption\" due to cessation of \"government activities the private sector relies on.\" In the latter category, OMB cited among other things a halt to several kinds of permitting, reviews, and licensing (e.g., 200 applications for a permit to drill for energy resources); suspension of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income verification used by financial institutions to help determine credit-worthiness of prospective borrowers; a halt to hundreds of federal loans to small businesses; and disrupted tourism and travel by closing national parks. Federal Employee Furloughs. 171 OMB cited payroll costs for \"work not performed\" by furloughed federal employees as the \"largest direct cost\" of the FY2014 shutdown. As one way to quantify the furloughs, OMB said that executive branch employees were furloughed for a total of \"roughly 6.6 million\" employee work days, with \"furloughs affecting workers at the vast majority of agencies.\" An accompanying table broke out this total by executive branch agency, listing 1,600,000 employee furlough days at DOD, 985,000 days at the Department of the Treasury, and a further 4,055,000 days at 33 additional agencies. If these day-based figures were translated into an annual, work-year equivalent, it could be said that the furloughs amounted to over 25,000 employee work years. OMB characterized the impact of the furloughs qualitatively, saying ", "\"[e]mployees not on the job could not conduct food, product, and workplace safety inspections; prepare for flu season or monitor other public health issues; process tax refunds or respond to taxpayer questions; or provide numerous other services important to the general public and the economy.\"", "Impacts on Programs and Services. 177 In another section of the report, OMB identified shutdown impacts on multiple government programs and services. OMB described the impacts of the shutdown, often in quantitative terms, with 29 bullets that focused on separate policy and programmatic areas. The bullets were grouped in six categories: (1) direct services for veterans, seniors, and other \"vulnerable\" groups; (2) public health and research; (3) product safety and environmental protection; (4) worker rights and safety; (5) international trade and relations; and (6) other government services. In the sixth category, for example, one bullet said the shutdown suspended the issuance of Social Security cards and, in addition, closed down the E-Verify system for employers to check prospective employees' immigration status. Other Direct Budgetary Costs. 179 Apart from the costs of employee furloughs (discussed in the next section of this CRS report), OMB identified \"other direct budgetary costs\" that executive branch agencies incurred. These costs included a variety of topics, such as lower revenues (e.g., $7 million in user fees and other revenue not being collected for the National Park Service); a halt to \"program integrity\" activities (e.g., activities intended to identify noncompliance with tax laws, collect unpaid taxes, and thereby help incentivize voluntary compliance, which OMB characterized as collecting $1 billion per week); interest due on late federal payments; increased costs on federal contracts due to over 10,000 stop work orders; and shutdown-related costs, such as the cost of employee and contractor time that was used to undertake pervasive shutdown-related activities\u2014such as planning, implementation, and re-start activities\u2014that diverted from mission-related work that otherwise would have been performed in the absence of a shutdown. Impacts on the Federal Workforce. 180 In a final section of the report, OMB discussed impacts of the shutdown on the federal workforce apart from those discussed elsewhere. These included federal employees not receiving their full pay during the shutdown (including many employees who legally were required to work) and potential adverse impacts on recruitment and retention of federal employees and contractor personnel.", "The FY2014 shutdown also affected many federal grant programs that provide funding for state and local governments. State and local governments rely upon federal aid to fund projects and provide services that benefit communities and individuals. During the shutdown, agency contingency plans stated that several grant-related activities would be disrupted. These activities included executing grant agreements, processing payments to grantees, and investigating waste, fraud, and abuse. ", "In the judicial branch, as during the FY1996 government shutdowns, courts generally operated with limited disruption to their personnel. According to internal guidance, the judiciary was prepared to keep the federal courts operating for about two weeks by using non-annually appropriated funds (as it did during the 1995-1996 government shutdowns). In practice, the judicial branch was able to operate on non-annually appropriated funds for the entirety of the FY2014 shutdown. Had that funding been exhausted, the judiciary would have continued operating under the terms of the Antideficiency Act. ", "The funding lapse, however, did affect some court functions. Some civil cases were postponed, in part due to continuance requests from the Department of Justice. Many courts also operated on condensed criminal calendars and reduced building maintenance. The judiciary also advised judges and court unit executives, in the event of a funding lapse, to post information on their individual court websites about what operations would continue during and after the initial two-week period.", "Across the legislative branch, the impact of the FY2014 shutdown varied. At the outset, the House of Representatives and some legislative branch agencies publicly released official guidance or operational plans.

The case of government shutdowns arguably is no exception. An additional complication frequently arises when assessing costs, due to a lack of relevant or readily available data. Nevertheless, in the aftermath of past shutdowns, some efforts have been undertaken to ascertain what the costs of the shutdowns were. ", "After a one-day shutdown in late November 1981, Senator Alan Cranston asked GAO on a quick-turnaround basis to ascertain the costs of paying employees who had been furloughed, as well as \"other costs directly or indirectly related to the shutdown.\" In response to the inquiry, GAO interviewed agency officials and developed a uniform set of questions for agencies. GAO responded to the Senator's inquiry two weeks later, saying \"[d]ata on the number of employees furloughed and the costs of implementing a shutdown are neither readily available nor easily obtainable.\" The agencies' abilities to respond varied considerably, leading GAO to portray limited information in a tabular format. Because agencies took multiple approaches to define what constituted costs, GAO also cautioned against comparing the extent of costs across agencies, concluding \"[w]e would not suggest that the figures are any more than indicative of the types of costs incurred\" (emphasis added).", "A similar inquiry about costs and shutdown-related impacts came in the aftermath of the much-longer FY1996 shutdowns. In response, OMB provided an overall cost estimate of \"over $1.4 billion\" for the two shutdowns. According to earlier testimony from OMB after the first shutdown, a portion of shutdown-related costs corresponded to retroactive pay for furloughed employees. OMB also said that significant additional costs, which then could not be determined, arose from interest payments to third parties required under the Prompt Payment Act and, in addition, additional personnel costs to deal with backlogs of work. Years later, OMB broke down the $1.4 billion figure. OMB said $430 million of the total corresponded to payroll costs from the first FY1996 shutdown (retroactive pay for furloughed employees), $630 million related to similar payroll costs for the second FY1996 shutdown, and $300 million were associated with \"other\" costs. In this accounting, OMB did not appear to quantify costs in monetary terms corresponding to the three pages of itemized impacts on government services that it earlier had identified in its letter from 1996, such as costs accruing to small businesses that experienced delays in receiving financing from the Small Business Administration.", "After the FY2014 shutdown, some Members of Congress requested assessments of its costs and impact. As noted earlier, OMB released a 27-page report on the subject three weeks after the shutdown ended. The report characterized all of its contents as focusing on \"costs,\" broken down into five categories: (1) effects on the economy, (2) federal employee furloughs, (3) impacts on programs and services, (4) other budgetary costs, and (5) impacts on the federal workforce. OMB did not attempt to quantify in monetary terms the items that it included in the third and fifth categories, as well as some program-specific items that it included in the first category. For the first category, however, OMB attributed $2 billion to $6 billion in lost domestic economic output to the shutdown. With regard to the second category, OMB estimated that the total cost of retroactive pay due to employees furloughed during the shutdown was \"roughly\" $2.0 billion, with another $500 million in costs added if \"total compensation costs\" were calculated (i.e., including benefits). OMB said the $2.0 billion total for the FY2014 shutdown exceeded the total payroll costs corresponding to the two FY1996 shutdowns, which OMB said were $1.65 billion in inflation-adjusted terms. Finally, in the fourth category, OMB estimated budgetary effects of some program- and policy-specific impacts, but OMB did not aggregate them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects on Mandatory Spending Programs, Generally", "paragraphs": ["Programs that are funded by laws other than annual appropriations acts\u2014for example, some entitlement programs\u2014may, or may not, be affected by a funding gap. Specific circumstances appear to be significant. For example, although the funds needed to make payments to beneficiaries may be available automatically pursuant to permanent appropriations, the payments may be processed by employees who are paid with funds provided in annual appropriations acts. In such situations, the question arises whether a mandatory program can continue to function during a funding gap, if appropriations were not enacted to pay salaries of administering employees. As noted earlier in this report, according to the 1981 Civiletti opinion, at least some of these employees would not be subject to furlough, because authority to continue administration of a program could be inferred from Congress's direction that benefit payments continue to be made according to an entitlement formula. That is, obligating funds for the salaries of these personnel would be excepted from the Antideficiency Act's restrictions during a funding gap. However, such a determination would depend upon the absence of contrary legislative history in specific circumstances.", "Nevertheless, the experience of the Social Security Administration (SSA) during the FY1996 shutdowns illustrates what might happen over a period of time in these situations. The lack of funds for some employees' salaries, for example, may impinge eventually on the processing and payment of new entitlement claims. SSA's administrative history describes how 4,780 employees were allowed to be retained during the initial stages of the first shutdown. The majority of these employees were \"in direct service positions to ensure the continuance of benefits to currently enrolled Social Security, SSI and Black Lung beneficiaries.\" Avoidance of furloughs was possible, because \"appropriations were available to fund the program costs of paying benefits, [which] implied authority to incur obligations for the costs necessary to administer those benefits.\" SSA furloughed its remaining 61,415 employees. Before long, however, SSA and OMB reconsidered. SSA had not retained staff to, among other things, respond to \"telephone calls from customers needing a Social Security card to work or who needed to change the address where their check should be mailed for the following month.\" SSA then advised OMB that the agency would need to retain 49,715 additional employees for direct service work, including the processing of new claims for Social Security benefits.

Congress might consider options for enacting legislation in advance of a shutdown to address whether states would be reimbursed for expenses that would have normally been covered by federal grant outlays but that were delayed due to a government shutdown. ", "In addition, grant administration personnel may play a critical role in evaluating the choices that contribute to the impact of a federal government shutdown. If grant administration personnel are furloughed due to a federal government shutdown, grant program administration activities such as grant agreement execution, payment processing, and investigation of waste, fraud, and abuse, may be interrupted. For example, GAO reported that during the FY2014 shutdown, \"[a]ll [National Institutes of Health] and [Federal Transit Administration] grants management officials were furloughed and were generally unavailable to assist grantees.\" If grant administration personnel are furloughed or not involved in the contingency planning, these activities may not be sufficiently addressed. Congress might consider the role of grant administration personnel when contemplating statutory changes that would affect grant program administration during a shutdown. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Narrow Continuing Resolutions222", "paragraphs": ["One previous congressional response to shutdowns has been the enactment of \"narrow\" continuing resolutions that provide temporary budget authority for only specified programs or activities, as opposed to all of the programs and activities in one or more regular appropriations bills. For example, during the second FY1996 shutdown, a narrow CR was enacted that funded benefits for veterans and certain children and families programs, and that allowed the District of Columbia government to operate. More recently, the Pay Our Military Act was enacted the day before the FY2014 shutdown commenced, to provide funds for certain DOD and DHS activities. ", "Narrow CRs have a number of potential implications in the context of a government shutdown. Proponents of such CRs have argued that they are an important tool to mitigate the effects of a government shutdown by eliminating funding gaps for certain vital government activities. However, others have posited that such CRs unfairly prioritize some programs over others, and that they may reduce the pressure on broader negotiations to end the shutdown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible National Security Implications229", "paragraphs": ["A federal government shutdown could have possible negative security implications, as some entities wishing to take actions harmful to U.S. interests may see the nation as physically, technologically, and politically vulnerable. The Antideficiency Act is silent regarding which specific organizations would be excepted in whole or part from a government shutdown. The act's provisions and historical guidance from OMB, however, suggest that entities that perform a national security function may be allowed to continue many of their operations. Historically, individuals responsible for supporting the nation's global security activities, public safety efforts, and foreign relations pursuits have been excepted from furloughs that accompany a government shutdown. In FY2018, the Trump Administration issued specific guidance that states, \"cybersecurity functions are excepted functions as these functions are necessary to avoid imminent threat to Federal property.\"", "The actions that are taken in anticipation of a government shutdown may lessen the negative effects of an incident of national security significance occurring during this period. How agencies and OMB prepare for a government shutdown may have short- and long-term consequences if an incident occurs during a period of reduction in government services or soon after a resumption of all government activities. Should federal government organizations traditionally not viewed as an excepted part of the security apparatus be shut down, and subsequently become needed during a crisis or emerging situation, the nation's ability to respond to an incident could be delayed. Such a situation could result in increased risk to the nation and a longer recovery time as services and support activities normally provided to nonfederal entities may not be available when needed. Some security observers may offer concerns that the longer the duration of a government shutdown, the more at-risk the nation becomes as enemies of the United States may seek to exploit perceived vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
