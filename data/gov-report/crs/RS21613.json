The same issue is appearing again in 2011 with high commodity prices. The producers claim that CRP rental rates are significantly lower than the producers could get by renting their land out for production. In 2008, many producers pressured USDA for penalty-free contract terminations. Similar pressures on USDA are again appearing in 2011. If rental rates are too low, there is some chance that producers will decline to enroll their land, or, if enrolled, will decline to renew their contracts at expiration. Putting CRP acreage back into production could have significant environmental effects. Although land put back into production would have to be managed under an environmental plan to be eligible for various agricultural assistance programs, there could still be an environmental cost in terms of increased sediment losses and nitrogen and phosphorus run-off if fragile land were put back into production. The decline in commodity prices from their 2008 highs reduced the pressures on producers to terminate their contracts.

Using National Resources Inventory data to simulate offers under general sign-ups, the study suggested that maintaining CRP under its current configuration could lead to significant expenditure increases for the program. When constraints were placed on increasing rental rates, the study suggested that enrollment goals could be met with moderate increases in the CRP rental rates.

A USDA report found that, although high CRP enrollment was associated with some job loss in rural areas between 1986 and 1992\u2014the years the CRP was first underway\u2014this was generally not the case during the 1990s. However, the report noted that national trends could mask regional adjustments, and that \"local economic adjustments might be sizeable.\" Losing existing CRP acreage or halting new enrollments may also have effects on local economies where hunting and fishing are important economic activities.", "By statute, CRP enrollment is capped at 25% of a county's cropland. According to FSA, approximately 130 counties have at least 22.5% enrolled as of 2009, although this can include counties with very small total acreage of cropland. Of these 130 counties, 80 have at least 25% enrolled. The farm bill exempts CREP and continuous sign-up acreage from the 25% county cap.", "Some groups believe that retiring land from productive agricultural use is detrimental. In comments on the SEIS noted above, the president of the National Grain and Feed Association argued that CRP has substantial negative economic impacts on agricultural production and rural communities:", "If U.S. agriculture is to achieve economic growth, which in turn contributes to job creation and revitalization of rural communities, it is imperative that the CRP be right-sized and reformed. The idling of productive land resources cuts off the economic multiplier inherent in crop, livestock and poultry production, thereby costing jobs and suffocating economic vitality in rural communities. Further, it risks compromising the United States' ability to provide abundant, affordable and cost-competitive food, animal feed, exports and biofuels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CRP Environmental Effects", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-five years ago, when CRP was introduced, soil erosion exceeded more than 3 billion tons per year, wetlands were being drained, water quality was deteriorating, and wildlife populations were under stress due to the loss of habitat. CRP contributed important solutions for each of these environmental problems, provided natural habitats for wildlife, restored more than 2 million acres of wetlands, and removed millions of tons of carbon dioxide from the air.", "FSA estimates that, compared with 1982 erosion rates, the CRP has reduced erosion by more than 454 million tons per year on the 34.6 million acres enrolled in the program in 2009. Since its inception, the program has helped reduce soil erosion by 622 million tons. Through April 2006, CRP had also restored 2 million acres of wetlands and 2.5 million acres of buffers. Other conservation benefits NRCS has documented on these lands include the sequestration of more than 48 million metric tons of carbon annually; more than 3.2 million acres of wildlife habitat established; and a reduction in the application of nitrogen (by 681,000 tons) and phosphorus (by 104,000 tons). Also, participants have planted nearly 3 million acres of trees, making it the largest federal tree-planting program in history. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
