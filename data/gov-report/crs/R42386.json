The First Congress made mandatory capital offenses of treason, murder in a federal enclave, piracy, forgery, and counterfeiting. A few years later, the Sedition and Logan Acts arrived with six- month mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment. Congress made rape committed within the maritime jurisdiction of the United States a mandatory capital offense in 1825. So the punishment remained until the 1948 recodification of federal criminal law, when rape became punishable by death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life. ", "Congress increased the number of federal sex offenses and their attendant mandatory minimum sentences beginning in 1978 with the enactment of the first federal child pornography statutes: 18\u00a0U.S.C. 2251, 2252. It filled out the complement of federal sex offenses with mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment at fairly regular intervals thereafter.", "In United States Sentencing Commission survey which addressed mandatory minimum sentences in child pornography cases but not other sex offense cases, a majority of the judges responding to a United States Sentencing Commission survey thought that the mandatory minimum sentences for production and distribution of child pornography and other child exploitation offenses were generally appropriate. Well over two-thirds, however, considered those for receipt of child pornography too high. ", "The Commission's report on mandatory minimum sentencing statutes noted that its \"review of available sentencing data [relating to sex offenses] indicates that further study of these penalties is needed before it can offer specific recommendations in this area.\" It concluded preliminarily, however, that \"the mandatory minimum penalties for certain non-contact child pornography offenses may be excessively severe and as a result are being applied inconsistently.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is a Mandatory Minimum?", "paragraphs": ["There may be reasonable disagreement over what constitutes a mandatory minimum sentencing statute.

", "Subsection 2241(c) certainly appears to require a mandatory minimum sentence (\"imprisoned not less than 30 years\"). Section 2242 also appears to require a mandatory minimum sentence, absent the dubious conclusion that the phrase, \"imprisonment for any term of years\" authorizes a court to impose a sentence of imprisonment for some particular number of years with the permissible choices ranging from zero to infinity. ", "The mandatory minimum status of subsection 2241(a)(\"fine [or] imprisonment for any term of years\") seems more debatable. The subsection can hardly be said to require a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, if a court is free to impose a fine instead. Moreover, in another context, the courts have concluded that in the face of such language a court is free to impose a fine instead of a term of imprisonment. Nevertheless, it is treated as requiring a mandatory minimum sentence here, because as a practical matter a court is virtually required to impose a sentence of imprisonment following conviction for a crime as serious as a violation of subsection 2241(a).

Among the powers which the Constitution bestows upon Congress are the powers to define and punish felonies committed upon the high seas, to exercise exclusive legislative authority over certain federal territories and facilities, to make rules governing the armed forces, and to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and to enact legislation necessary and proper for the execution of those and other constitutionally granted powers.
