In general, the bill would expand health insurance coverage to many Americans who currently are uninsured, while attempting to reduce expenditures and offering mechanisms to increase care coordination, encourage more use of health prevention, and improve quality of care. The bill would reform the private health insurance market, impose a mandate for most legal U.S. residents to obtain health insurance, establish health insurance \"Exchanges\" that would subsidize health insurance coverage for eligible individuals; expand Medicaid eligibility; create programs to improve quality of care and encourage more use of preventive services; address healthcare workforce issues; and propose a number of other Medicaid and Medicare program and federal tax code changes.", "Among the proposed Medicaid reforms, the bill would modify eligibility standards and methodologies, add several new mandatory and optional Medicaid benefits, expand Medicaid benefits, and increase CHIP funding. Beginning in 2014, or sooner at state option, nonelderly, non-pregnant individuals with income below 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) would become eligible for Medicaid. New optional eligibility groups also would be added, such as non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals (childless adults) with income above 133% of poverty. The bill also would require states to maintain current coverage levels for individuals under Medicaid and CHIP. In addition, the bill would add several new mandatory Medicaid benefits including coverage of services in free standing birth clinics, and coverage of tobacco cessation services for pregnant women.", "The bill would make a number of Medicaid and CHIP financing changes, such as reducing Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments, increasing prescription drug rebates and increasing certain pharmacy reimbursement, increasing federal spending for the Territories, providing special enhanced disaster recovery Medicaid funding, and requiring payment system reforms.", "The bill includes provisions that would give states and other stakeholders new program integrity (PI)\u2014waste, fraud and abuse\u2014enforcement and monitoring tools as well as impose some new data reporting and oversight requirements on states and providers. Additional PI provisions affecting Medicaid and CHIP include requirements for states to implement a national correct coding initiative similar to the Medicare program, a broad new nursing home accountability initiative, and other new requirements to enhance PI that increase the uniformity of Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP requirements.", "The bill also offers opportunities for states and other stakeholders to use new demonstrations and grants to modify payment systems, introduce care delivery models, and improve care quality, which include a medical global payment system demonstration and school-based health center grants."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Status of Legislation", "paragraphs": ["This report summarizes key provisions applicable to Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in H.R. 3590 , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as passed by the Senate on December 24, 2009.

To help highlight the Senate bill's most important Medicaid and CHIP health reforms, applicable provisions were grouped into the following six major issue areas: eligibility, benefits, financing, program integrity, demonstrations and grant funding, and miscellaneous Medicaid and CHIP provisions. ", "The eligibility issue area may include the bill's most dramatic health reforms applicable to Medicaid, namely a coverage expansion for nonelderly, non-pregnant individuals with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). This reform not only would expand eligibility to a group of individuals who were previously ineligible for Medicaid (low income childless adults), but also would raise Medicaid's mandatory income eligibility level for certain existing groups from 100% to 133% of the FPL. In addition, federal financial participation (FFP) would be increased for these new eligibility groups. Further, the bill would encourage states to improve outreach, streamline enrollment, and coordinate with the American Health Benefit Exchanges (Exchange). ", "Other eligibility reforms would require states to maintain current Medicaid and CHIP coverage levels\u2014through 2013 for adults and 2019 for children. The bill also would require states to maintain the current CHIP structure through FY2019, but would not provide federal CHIP appropriations beyond FY2013. ", "The benefit reforms proposed in the bill for Medicaid and CHIP, would add new mandatory and optional benefits. Mandatory benefit additions would include premium assistance for employer-sponsored health insurance, coverage of free standing birth clinics, and tobacco cessation services for pregnant woman. The bill also would authorize states to offer new optional benefits such as preventive services for adults, health homes, and a program to permit Medicaid beneficiaries first choice to remain in their community, rather than institutional care. ", "Under financing reforms, the bill would introduce measures to reduce the growth of Medicaid expenditures and would increase federal matching payments for eligibility expansion. Cost control reforms include proposed reductions in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments, reduced expenditures for prescription drugs and payment reforms to reduce inappropriate hospital expenditures for health-care acquired conditions. ", "The bill would give states and other stakeholders new program integrity enforcement and monitoring tools as well as impose new data reporting and oversight requirements on states and providers. Additional Medicaid and CHIP program integrity provisions would include requirements for states to implement initiatives used by the Medicare program, such as a national correct coding initiative and a recovery audit contract program. The bill also proposes a broad nursing home accountability initiative that would add a number of requirements to improve the transparency of information on facilities and chains as well as provide LTC consumers with information on the quality and performance of nursing homes. ", "The bill includes a number of demonstrations, pilot programs, and grants. These proposals would provide the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) and state Medicaid and CHIP programs with opportunities to test models for improving the delivery, quality, and payment for services. Finally, the Senate bill would include a number of miscellaneous Medicaid and CHIP reforms. These proposals would add several offices within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to work to better coordinate care across the Medicare and Medicaid/CHIP programs. One of these offices would be dedicated to improve coordination for beneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles) and another would add a Medicare and Medicaid innovation center, which may permit states to have more control over both Medicare and Medicaid expenditures for dual eligibles.

To qualify, an individual must meet both categorical (i.e., must be a member of a covered group such as children, pregnant women, families with dependent children, the elderly, or the disabled), and financial eligibility requirements. Medicaid's financial requirements place limits on the maximum amount of assets and income individuals may possess to participate in Medicaid. Additional guidelines specify how states should calculate these amounts. The specific asset and income limitations that apply to each eligibility group are set through a combination of federal parameters and state definitions. Consequently, these standards vary across states, and different standards apply to different population groups within states. State application of income counting rules result in expanding eligibility to higher-income individuals. ", "Of the approximately 50 different eligibility \"pathways\" into Medicaid, some are mandatory while others may be covered at state option. Examples of groups that states must provide Medicaid to include pregnant women and children under age six with family income below 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL), and poor individuals with disabilities or poor individuals over age 64 who qualify for cash assistance under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Three examples of groups that states may choose to cover under Medicaid include pregnant women and infants with family income between 133% FPL and 185% FPL, and \"medically needy\" individuals who meet categorical requirements with income up to 133% of the maximum payment amount applicable under states' former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs based on family size. \"Childless adults\" (nonelderly adults who are not disabled, not pregnant and not parents of dependent children), for example, are generally not eligible for Medicaid, regardless of their income.", "The measure would make several changes to Medicaid eligibility.

States submit proposals outlining the terms and conditions of the demonstration program to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for approval prior to implementation.

States were required to provide CMS a written description of their process for public involvement at the time their proposal was submitted.", "Public involvement requirements for the waiver approval process continued through the early 2000s.
