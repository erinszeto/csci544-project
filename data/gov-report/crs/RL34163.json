In 1994, however, Congress revived the death penalty as a federal sentencing option. More than a few federal statutes now proscribe offenses punishable by death. A number of bills were offered during the 110th Congress to modify federal law in the area. None were enacted. One, S. 447 (Senator Feingold)/H.R. 6875 (Representative Kucinich), would have abolished the federal death penalty. Another, H.J.Res. 80 (Rep McCollum), would have amended the Constitution to abolish capital punishment as a sentencing alternative for either state or federal crimes. Other proposed amendments would have eased constitutional limitations on the death penalty as a sentencing option, particularly in cases involving the rape of children, H.J.Res. 83 (Representative Broun), H.J.Res. 96 (Representative Chabot).", "Several bills would have increased the number of capital offenses to include one or more newly created offenses or existing non-capital offenses newly designated as capital offenses, e.g., H.R. 855 (Representative Lungren), H.R. 880 (Representative Forbes), H.R. 1118 (Representative Keller), H.R. 1645 (Representative Gutierrez), H.R. 2376 (Representative Franks), H.R. 3147 (Representative Wilson), H.R. 3150 (Representative Keller), H.R. 3156 (Representative Lamar Smith), S. 330 (Senator Isakson), S. 607 (Senator Vitter), S. 1320 (Senator Kyl), S. 1348 (Senator Reid), and S. 1860 (Senator Cornyn).", "Numbered among the new capital offenses and newly designated capital offenses were murder related to street gang offenses or Travel Act violations, murder committed during and in relation to drug trafficking, murder committed in the course of evading border inspection, murder of disaster assistance workers, and various terrorism-related murders.", "A third category of proposals would have adjusted in one way or another the procedures used to try and sentence capital defendants, including those relating to where a capital offense may be tried, the appointment of counsel in capital cases, the pre-trial notification which the parties must exchange in capital cases, the procedures that apply when the defendant claims to be mentally retarded, adjustments in the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances, jury matters, and the site of federal executions. Among the bills offering one or more of these proposals were: H.R. 851 (Representative Gohmert), H.R. 880 (Representative Forbes), H.R. 1645 (Representative Gutierrez), H.R. 1914 (Representative Carter), H.R. 3150 (Representative Keller), H.R. 3153 (Representative Gerlach), H.R. 3156 (Representative Lamar Smith), S. 1320 (Senator Kyl), and S. 1860 (Senator Cornyn).", "An abridged version of this report \u2013 without footnotes, appendices, and most citations, is available as CRS Report RS22719, Capital Punishment Legislation in the 110th Congress: A Sketch, by [author name scrubbed]."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Most capital punishment cases are state cases.

None were enacted. This is an overview of some of those proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Amendments", "paragraphs": ["The United States Constitution does not mention capital punishment or death penalty in so many words. It does, however, prohibit imposition of cruel and unusual punishments as well as the deprivation of life without due process of law. The Supreme Court recently held that the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes imposition of the death penalty for rape of child under twelve years of age when the victim was neither killed nor intended to be killed.", "Two constitutional amendments were offered at least in partial response. H.J.Res. 96 (Representative Chabot) would simply have amended the Constitution to state that \"The penalty of death for the forcible rape of a child who has not attained the age of 12 years does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\" H.J.Res. 83 (Representative Broun) is equally terse although seemingly more sweeping: \"The death penalty is permitted under the Constitution and does not constitute cruel and usual punishment, including when the death penalty is imposed for the rape of a child under sixteen years old.\" Both proposals would have removed any Eighth Amendment impediment to capital punishment as a sentencing option in child rape cases. The Broun proposal was apparently designed to remove any Eighth Amendment impediment to capital punishment as a sentencing option in any case. At some point, due process concerns may have contained the sweep of the proposals had they been accepted.", "H.J.Res. 80 (Representative McCollum), in contrast, would have abolished capital punishment as a sentencing alternative for either state or federal crimes.

There is no statute of limitations for capital offenses. There is a preference for the trial of capital cases in the county in which they occur. Defendants in capital cases are entitled to two attorneys, one of whom \"shall be learned in the law applicable to capital cases.\" The Attorney General must ultimately approve the decision to seek the death penalty in any given case. Defendants are entitled to notice when the prosecution intends to seek the death penalty, and at least three days before the trial, to a copy of the indictment as well as a list of the government's witnesses and names in the jury pool. Defendants have twice as many peremptory jury challenges in capital cases as in other felony cases and prosecutors more than three times as many. Should the defendant be found guilty of a capital offense the sentencing hearing procedures set forth in chapter 228 of title 18 of the United States Code come into play.", "The chapter divides federal capital offenses into three categories for purposes of determining whether the death penalty should be imposed in light of the aggravating and mitigating facts presented in the case. The first group consists of espionage and treason; the second, of homicide offenses; and the third, of drug offenses.", "In homicide cases, the sentencing hearing involves two determinations: whether the defendant acted with the intent required in section 3591(a)(2) of the chapter and whether the weighing of the pertinent aggravating and mitigating circumstances warrant imposition of the death penalty in section 3592(c). In order to keep the two inquiries distinct and to avoid confusion and unfair prejudice, federal courts will generally permit the inquiries to be conduct sequentially.", "The same list of mitigating factors applies to each of the three categories of capital offenses. The list consists of seven specific statutory factors \u2013 impaired capacity, minor participation, disparate treatment of codefendants, no prior criminal record, mental or emotional disturbance, and victim consent \u2013 but also includes a catch-all, open-ended factor.", "Each of the three categories has its own list of statutory aggravating factors. They share a catch-all, open-ended aggravating factor available for each of the three categories of capital offenses which the jury may weigh, but the death penalty may only be imposed after first finding at least one of the more specific, designated aggravating factors.", "The list of designated aggravating factors relating to espionage and treason is the shortest of the three: prior espionage or treason conviction, grave risk to national security, and grave risk of death. The list of the designated homicide aggravating factors contains sixteen entries, including the fact that the murder was committed during the course of one of group of other federal offenses. The drug aggravating factors focus on prior convictions, the risk to children, the use of firearms, and lethal adulteration.", "The jury must unanimously agree that an aggravating factor has been established before the factor may be weighed in determining whether to impose the death penalty; on the other hand the finding of a single juror is sufficient for consideration of a mitigating factor. The death penalty may only be imposed if the jury unanimously finds that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors; or if the court so finds in the absence of a jury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedural Changes", "paragraphs": ["During the 110 th Congress, proposals were offered that would have modified existing law relating to:", "- where a capital offense may be tried,", "- the appointment of counsel in capital cases,", "- the pre-trial notification which the parties must exchange in capital cases,", "- the procedures that apply when the defendant claims to be mentally retarded,", "- adjustments in the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances,", "- jury matters, and", "- the site of federal executions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Venue and Vicinage", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Generally", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution provides that \"the trial of all crimes . . . shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed,\" and that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.\" From the beginning, Congress has provided in language that now appears in 18 U.S.C. 3235, that where possible capital cases should be tried in the county in which they occur. It has also long specifically provided that murder and manslaughter cases shall be tried where the death- inflicting injury occurs regardless of where the victim dies, as 18 U.S.C. 3236 now states. Furthermore, for some time it has provided in the words of 18 U.S.C. 3237 that multi-district crimes may be tried where they are begun, continued, or completed and that offenses involving the use of the mails, transportation in interstate or foreign commerce, or importation into the United States may be tried in any district from, through, or into which commerce, mail, or imports travel.", "Although some of the venue proposals offered in the 110 th Congress dealt primarily with venue for newly created or newly amended federal capital offenses, H.R. 3156 (Representative Lamar Smith) and S. 1860 (Senator Cornyn) addressed venue in capital cases generally. They struck the language of section 3235 that calls for the trial of capital cases in the county in which they occur if possible. In its place, they would have installed two subsections whose precise scope was somewhat uncertain.", "The proposal was apparently intended to repeal both the \"county trial in capital cases\" feature of section 3235 and, by indirection, the murder portion of the \"murder-manslaughter trial\" feature of section 3236. It seemed to replicate the continuing offense language of section 3237 with one significant addition; it would have permitted trial where commerce-related conduct occurred. The scope of the proposed amendment would likely have depended in part on the application of constitutional constraints.", "The proposed amendment must operate within constitutional venue and vicinage limitations, that is that \"The trial of all crimes . . . shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed,\" and that \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\"", "The Supreme Court in United States v. Cabrales held that in light of these provisions the crime of money laundering committed in Florida could not be tried in Missouri where the laundered funds had been criminally generated \u2013 absent other circumstances. Shortly thereafter, the Court held in United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno , that the crime of using a firearm during and in relation to the crime of kidnaping could be tried in New Jersey into which the victim had been carried, notwithstanding the fact that the firearm was acquired and used in Maryland after the victim had been moved there from New Jersey.", "Cabrales is not as restrictive as it might seem at first; nor is Rodriguez-Moreno as permissive. Cabrales laundered the Missouri drug money in Florida, but there was no evidence that she was a member of the Missouri drug trafficking conspiracy or that she had transported the money from Missouri to Florida. The Court acknowledged that she might have been tried in Missouri had either been the case.", "Rodriguez-Moreno and his confederates kidnapped a drug trafficking associate and transported him over the course of time from Texas to New Jersey and then to Maryland. Rodriguez-Moreno acquired the firearm with which he threatened the kidnap victim in Maryland but was tried in New Jersey for using a firearm \"during and in relation to a crime of violence [kidnaping]\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1). Section 924(c)(1) in the eyes of the Court has \"two distinct conduct elements . . . using and carrying of a gun and the commission of a kidnaping.\" A crime with distinct conduct elements may be tried wherever any of those elements occurred; kidnaping is a continuous offense that in this case began in Texas and continued through New Jersey to Maryland; venue over the kidnaping, a conduct element of the section 924(c)(1), was proper in Texas, New Jersey or Maryland; consequently venue over the violation of section 924(c)(1) was proper in either Texas, New Jersey or Maryland.", "The Court was quick to distinguish Cabrales from Rodriguez-Moreno : \"The existence of criminally generated proceeds [in Cabrales ] was a circumstance element of the offense but the proscribed conduct \u2013 defendant's money laundering activity \u2013 occurred after the fact of the offense begun and completed by others.\" In Rodriguez-Moreno , \"given the 'during and in relation to' language, the underlying crime of violence is a critical part of the \u00a7924(c)(1) offense.\" Subsequent lower federal appellate courts have read Cabrales and Rodriguez-Moreno to require that a crime be tried where at least one of its elements occurs.", "It is not clear how the proposed venue amendment would have fared in light of Cabrales and Rodriguez-Moreno . It stated that \"(a) The trial for any offense punishable by death shall be held in the district where the offense was committed or in any district in which the offense began, continued, or was completed. (b) If the offense, or related conduct, under subsection (a) involves activities which affect interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into the United States, such offense may be prosecuted in any district in which those activities occurred.\" The amendment would appeared to have permitted trial of an offense in a district in which related conduct affecting interstate or foreign commerce occurred even if the offense itself and each of its elements were committed entirely in another district.", "The Cabrales ' money generating drug trafficking in Missouri would seem to qualify as \"conduct related\" to the laundering in Florida for purposes of the proposal, and yet in Cabrales that was not enough. Nor would the proposal always appear to meet Rodriguez-Moreno 's \"conduct element\" standard. There was nothing in the proposal that would have required that the \"related conduct affecting interstate commerce\" be an element of the offense to be tried. In fact, the alternative wording \u2013 \"if the offense, or related conduct . . . involves activities which affect interstate commerce\" \u2013 seemed to contemplate situations in which affecting commerce was not an element, conduct or otherwise, of the offense. Such applications might have appeared to a reviewing court to do more than the Constitution permits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Specific offenses", "paragraphs": ["In the case of proposed venue provisions for new or existing federal capital offenses, one common proposal would have built upon the scheme approved in Rodriguez-Moreno . The statute before the Court there, 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), outlaws the use of a firearm \"during and in relation\" to a crime of violence or serious drug offense. Several bills \u2013 e.g., H.R. 880 (Representative Forbes), H.R. 3150 (Representative Keller), H.R. 3156 (Representative Lamar Smith), and S. 1860 (Senator Cornyn) \u2013 would have created a new federal crime, one that would have prohibited the commission of a crime of violence \"during and in relation\" to a drug trafficking offense, proposed 21 U.S.C. 865. They would have permitted prosecution for such an offense \"in (1) the judicial district in which the murder or other crime of violence occurred; or (2) any judicial district in which the drug trafficking crime may be prosecuted,\" proposed 21 U.S.C. 865(b).", "This analogy to Rodriguez-Moreno seems likely to have worked. The new crime, like section 924(c) in Rodriguez-Moreno , would have two elements, a crime of violence and a simultaneous, related drug trafficking offense. Rodriguez-Moreno involved a continuing offense. Many drug trafficking offenses are likely to be considered continuing offenses for venue purposes, but some may not be. It should not matter. Rodriguez-Moreno insists only that the crime may be tried where one of its conduct elements (crime of violence or drug trafficking crime) occur.", "The several of the same bills \u2013 e.g., H.R. 880 (Representative Forbes), H.R. 3150 (Representative Keller), H.R. 3156 (Representative Lamar Smith), and S. 1860 (Senator Cornyn) \u2013 would have added, to the existing federal capital offense of committing a crime of violence in aid of a racketeering (RICO) offense, an explicit venue provision. The addition would have stated that prosecution for a violation of section 1959 might be brought where the crime of violence occurs or where the racketeering activity of the enterprise occurs. Even without the explicit addition, the Second Circuit has held that since a RICO violation is an element of a section 1959 offense, venue for trial of a violation of section 1959 is proper wherever the underlying RICO might be tried, i.e., wherever an element of a RICO violation occurs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appointment of Counsel", "paragraphs": ["Capital defendants are entitled to the assignment of two attorneys for their defense.

The Department also noted the inefficiencies experienced in other circuits in cases where it is clear the death penalty will not be sought but where a second attorney must be retained until the formal decision is announced.", "H.R. 851 (Representative Gohmert) would have amended section 3005 so that prosecutor's notice of an intent to seek the death penalty, rather than indictment for a capital offense, would trigger the right to the appointment of second counsel.

More exactly, they have held (1) that a death notice filed unreasonably close to the date set for trial is properly subject to a motion to strike the government's death notice, without which the government may not seek the death penalty, and (2) that an interlocutory appeal may be taken from the denial of such a motion. The Second Circuit, on the other hand, concluded that section 3593(a) does not create a right to avoid the death penalty because of the government's untimely death notice and that consequently a refusal to strike the death notice is not a matter from which an interlocutory appeal may be taken.", "Prosecutors will sometimes provide a \"protective death notice\" in order to preserve the option to seek the death penalty before a final decision is made. The notice is withdrawn should the Attorney General decide not to seek the death penalty. The arrangement is not one which the Justice Department prefers.

Moreover, neither the Constitution nor federal statutory provisions allow the execution of a federal capital defendant suffering from mental retardation.", "The limited available case law suggests \u2013 with some exception \u2013 that the determination of the issue may be assigned to the court (rather than the jury) to be established by the defendant under preponderance of the evidence standard prior to trial. As for the definition of mental retardation, the Court in Atkins cites two clinical definitions of mental retardation, which it encapsulates with the observation that, \"As discussed above, clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18,\" 536 U.S. at 318.", "H.R. 851 (Representative Gohmert), H.R. 3156 (Representative Lamar Smith), and S. 1860 (Senator Cornyn) would have made several procedural adjustments to accommodate claims of mental retardation in federal capital cases. First, as noted earlier they would have established a reciprocal pre-trial notification requirement. After the prosecution notified the defendant of its intention to seek the death penalty and of the aggravating factors upon which it intends to rely, the defendant would have been required to notify the government of the mitigating factors, including mental retardation, upon which he intended to rely. Second, they would have called for comparable notice when the defendant intended to claim mental retardation as a bar to execution. Third, they would have given the prosecution the right to an independent mental health examination of any defendant claiming retardation and to a continuance to prepare for trial and sentencing if necessary. Fourth, they would have conditioned the defendant's presentation of evidence and argument relating to mental retardation, at least for mitigation purposes, to instances where the defendant had provided the required prior notification. Fifth, they would have stated that the defendant bears the burden of establishing mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence. Sixth, they would have instructed the trier of fact, be it judge or jury, to consider the issue of mental retardation only if an aggravating factor had been found and if so to consider the issue of mental retardation first among the mitigating factors. Seventh, they would have provided that a capital defendant found to be mental retarded is be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of years or to life imprisonment without the possibility of release. Eighth, they would have supplied a statutory definition of mental retardation with three components: that the defendant have an IQ of 70 or less, that he have had continuously since under 18 years of age, and that it has continuously impaired mental functions including the ability to learn, reason, and control impulses. The Justice Department endorsed similar legislative proposals in the 109 th Congress as a means of introducing consistency into federal practice in the area.", "There may be objections, however. The definition of mental retardation might be thought too narrow to embrace all those constitutionally protected. Resolution of mental retardation issues, some would contend, should occur prior to trial as a matter of fairness and judicial economy if nothing else.

First, as with mitigating circumstances, specific designation is less significant when the catch-all provision would allow presentation to the jury in any event. In the case of aggravating circumstances, however, expressly adding new crimes to the \"murder plus\" factor status is significant because the existence of a specifically designated aggravating factor is a sine qua non for imposition of the penalty; the mere presence of a catch-all aggravating factor is insufficient.

Instead, the courts have concluded that the phrase \"as consideration for\" covers the for-hire murders, and the phrase \"in expectation of the receipt\" covers murders from which there is a more general anticipated gain.
