Homeowners and potential homeowners indirectly depend on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which in recent years backed and guaranteed home loans accounting for nearly half of the outstanding home mortgages in the nation.", "Taxpayers have a large investment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Department of the Treasury kept the two insolvent companies in business by providing more than $175 billion in support. Based on past performance, it is not clear how the enterprises will be able to repay Treasury out of future earnings. In addition to the $175 billion in direct support, Treasury and the Federal Reserve (the Fed) purchased nearly $1.4 trillion in GSE-issued and guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS).", "These two entities are stockholder-owned, congressionally chartered companies that purchase home mortgages, commonly called government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). In 2008, increasing mortgage delinquencies and the general financial crisis weakened the two enterprises to the point that they agreed to a voluntary takeover by the federal government known as conservatorship.", "This report summarizes and analyzes bills introduced in the 112th Congress that seek to enhance the public accountability of the two enterprises. The bills covered are H.R. 31, H.R. 408, H.R. 463, H.R. 1182, H.R. 1221, H.R. 1222, H.R. 1223, H.R. 1224, H.R. 1225, H.R. 1226, H.R. 1227, H.R. 1859, H.R. 2413, H.R. 2425, H.R. 2428, H.R. 2436, H.R. 2439, H.R. 2440, H.R. 2441, H.R. 2462, S. 178, and S. 693. Some seek to reduce the cost to the government, while others seek to change the enterprises' charters if or when they leave conservatorship. None of the above bills introduced proposes government actions to replace the two enterprises.", "To date, two bills, H.R. 1859 and H.R. 2413, propose creating a replacement for the two enterprises. H.R. 1859 would authorize the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to charter special purpose associations to support the secondary mortgage market by issuing MBS with an explicit federal catastrophic guarantee. The associations would be charged for this guarantee. H.R. 1859 would require FHFA to develop a plan to transition from enterprise support for the secondary mortgage market to support by these new associations.", "The second bill, H.R. 2413, would create a government corporation (the Secondary Market Facility for Residential Mortgages) to purchase and to securitize mortgages. Those selling mortgages to the facility would be required to pay guarantee and reinsurance fees for an explicit federal guarantee on the securities.", "Because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are under conservatorship, Congress has unusual leverage to direct FHFA, which is both their regulator and conservator, to implement policy changes. Currently, FHFA has unusual control in that it both regulates and manages Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.", "This report will be updated as warranted."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The 112 th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's present and future risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two entities are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)\u2014congressionally chartered, stockholder-owned companies with special legal privileges and special obligations to facilitate the flow of mortgage funds. Their basic business includes purchasing mortgages that have been issued by others, pooling and guaranteeing the mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and either selling the MBS to investors or holding the MBS \"in portfolio\" as an investment. In recent years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together were responsible for nearly half of the nation's outstanding residential mortgage debt.", "In 2008, the enterprises' capital proved to be inadequate as mortgage defaults and foreclosures increased more than anticipated, and the cost of borrowing to finance their investment portfolios increased. To support the mortgage markets during the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and to keep these enterprises in business, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has purchased more than $175 billion of special preferred stock. In addition, Treasury and the Federal Reserve (the Fed) have provided mortgage market support by purchasing nearly $1.4 trillion in MBS from investors in the open market.", "Treasury's purchase of more than $175 billion in preferred stock is one element in contracts that require the enterprises to pay an annual 10% cash dividend on the Treasury funds. Based on their past histories, it is not clear that the enterprises could survive without Treasury's continued support.", "Some of the bills that have been introduced are likely to reduce the enterprises' future size by reducing or eliminating certain advantages conferred by their charters. More specifically, one category of proposed legislation would increase their cost of doing business (e.g., H.R. 1222 ). It is likely that the increased costs would be passed onto the enterprises' business partners in the form of lower prices for mortgages and higher interest rates to borrowers. This would potentially allow other securitizers to compete more effectively with the enterprises.", "A second group of bills would impose new limitations on the types of mortgages that the enterprises can purchase, leaving more of the mortgage market to their competition (e.g., H.R. 1227 ).", "A third category of changes contained in some of the bills would increase regulatory oversight and disclosure (e.g., H.R. 31 and H.R. 1225 ). The proposed increased capital requirements would be another source of increased costs, but would also reduce risks. New requirements to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would eliminate a competitive advantage enjoyed by the enterprises and require them to adhere to some of the same rules as their competitors.", "A fourth category of legislative proposals would set a deadline for the enterprises to return to stockholder control or to be dissolved; in the event they were to return to stockholder control, the bills would phase out their charters (e.g., two pairs of companion bills H.R. 408 / S. 178 and H.R. 1182 / S. 693 ).", "A fifth category of legislative proposals would make provisions for replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets (e.g. H.R. 1859 and H.R. 2413 ).", " Table 1 summarizes and illustrates differences in provisions of the various bills introduced in the 112 th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Difficulties", "paragraphs": ["The enterprises came to their current financial difficulties following a period of increasing losses due to mortgage delinquencies, coupled with inadequate capital.

At the same time, the Treasury signed separate contracts with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide whatever financial support might be needed to keep them solvent.", "Homeowners and potential homeowners indirectly depend on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a source of mortgage money. The enterprises are prohibited from making loans directly to borrowers; instead, they purchase mortgages that lenders have already made. They package the mortgages into MBS and either keep them \"in portfolio\" or sell them to institutional investors. Sometimes the originator \"swaps\" the mortgages for an MBS backed by the same loans. The advantage of a swap is the addition of the enterprise's guarantee that the loans will be repaid.

For example, the FHFA's quarterly Report on the Enterprises' Financial Performance covers capital, investments, and loss mitigation activities. The FHFA's monthly Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report also covers loss mitigation efforts.

Other employees of the enterprises would be paid according to the federal government's general schedule (GS), with a maximum pay in the Washington, DC, area in 2011 of $155,500. Executive compensation would be based in part on the enterprise's profitability. The enterprises would be covered by Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) provisions on executive compensation and corporate governance.

Alvarez, the Federal Reserve's general counsel, has testified that Dodd-Frank does not exempt the enterprises from the risk retention requirement, and that their 100% guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on their MBS is \"generally in the form of an unfunded guarantee, which would not satisfy the risk retention requirements of the proposed rules.\" Nevertheless, he said that the proposed rules would allow the enterprises' guarantees to satisfy the risk retention requirements as long as the enterprises were in conservatorship or receivership.", "H.R. 1224 , GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011, would require the enterprises to accelerate the reduction of their portfolios over five years to $250 billion each.

Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Emil Henry has written that there was a more formal process until the mid-1990s.", "Arguably, the Secretary of the Treasury could assert the existing review authority contained in the enterprises' charters. The requirements that the enterprises make the requests for approval in writing, that the secretary publish his decision, and that there be a seven-day waiting period would formalize the process.", "H.R. 1226 , GSE Mission Improvement Act, would repeal the affordable housing goals first established by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-550 , 106 Stat. 3672 et seq.) and amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 , 122 Stat. 2654 et seq.).

MERS is a centralized mortgage registration system that bypasses state laws requiring local registration of mortgages and other liens on real estate. MERS is involved in legal challenges questioning its authority to participate in foreclosures and its ability to maintain a clear history of ownership of real estate.", "Some of the employment contracts between the enterprises and employees and former employees provide that the appropriate enterprise shall pay legal expenses incurred as a result of the employment. H.R. 2428 , GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, would require the enterprises to propose to FHFA a methodology to determine \"reasonable\" legal expenses of an employee or former employee. Under HERA the conservator, FHFA, can repudiate any contracts (including employment contracts) entered into prior to the conservatorship.", "H.R. 2436 , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Taxpayer Payback Act of 2011, would prevent a reduction in the annual dividend rates of 10% in cash or 12% in preferred stock paid by the enterprises to Treasury.", "H.R. 2439 , Removing GSEs Charters During Receivership Act of 2011, would empower FHFA to revoke an enterprise's charter and requires the charter to be revoked at the termination of a limited-life entity created as part of the receivership process.", "Presently only Congress can terminate an enterprise's charter.", "H.R. 2441 , Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011, would terminate the Housing Trust Fund, the Capital Magnet Fund, and the Hope Reserve Fund, which were established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ) and were to be funded by the enterprises. The enterprises financial conditions precluded any contributions, but $80 million was appropriated in the FY2010 budget for the Capital Magnet Fund.", "H.R. 2440 , Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2011, would direct FHFA to identify non-mission critical assets held by the enterprises.

To keep each of the enterprises solvent, Treasury has contracted to purchase preferred stock subject to certain limits. Initially, the limit was $100 billion for each GSE, but this amount was raised to $200 billion each. In late 2009, the PSPA were amended to provide for unlimited support in calendar years 2010 through 2012. Outside of 2010-2012, the $200 billion limits apply.
