Members of Congress have always considered communication with constituents an essential part of their representational duties. Members also often utilize new tools and technologies to reach and engage their constituents and colleagues.", "Background", "The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 first enabled congressional committees to broadcast their proceedings, if desired. Separate decisions were then made by the House and the Senate in 1977 and 1986, respectively, to provide audio and video broadcasts of chamber proceedings.", "Congressional video and audio feeds are operated by the House and Senate but are available for any credentialed press gallery member to broadcast. Many Americans are familiar with these feeds in video format, as the primary content on the privately operated, nonprofit Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN). C-SPAN launched a dedicated television channel for House proceedings in 1979 and another for Senate proceedings in 1986, and they continue to be key information resources for Congress and the public.", "Live broadcasts provided real-time information about Congress to anyone outside of the Capitol. Previously, only credentialed press or members of the public seated in the galleries could see floor proceedings as they occurred. In addition to augmenting the legislative information available to the public, these broadcasts arguably were also of value to Congress. Broadcasts diminished the need to wait for transcripts or a reporter's account of events. Members and congressional staff could follow a variety of live proceedings from their offices or elsewhere.", "Key Issues", "Technological advancements over the last decade have presented new considerations for congressional video broadcasting. The House and Senate video feeds and C-SPAN all originated in an era when television was the presumed source for video-based news, and the ability to record or transmit video required specialized equipment. As the Internet became an influential medium, the House, Senate, and C-SPAN each adjusted and began to provide online access to live video streams and past recordings. These online videos expand the potential reach of congressional video, as cable television subscriptions are no longer required to watch Congress in action.", "The House and Senate continue to maintain exclusive control over their video and audio feeds, whether they are broadcast on television, radio, or over the Internet. Yet technology now exists enabling anyone with a smartphone to produce and broadcast an online video. This creates a greater potential for unauthorized videos to be broadcast from the House and Senate chambers. Some believe that these videos may disrupt decorum in Congress, while others view them as an essential alternate means of distributing congressional information. In light of these new technological capabilities, the use and regulation of wireless devices or broadcasting from the chambers may be reexamined. New rules adopted by the House at the start of the 115th Congress, for example, enable the Sergeant at Arms to impose fines on Members who disrupt decorum by taking photographs, recording audio or video, or broadcasting using an electronic device."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["From postal mail to social media, Members of Congress have regularly adopted and utilized new communications tools to better inform constituents about the workings of Congress and important policy matters.

", "The idea of offering live video broadcasts initially appealed to some, but others had reservations about the potential effects of broadcasting on congressional behavior. Technical challenges also existed, including setting up the necessary lights, microphones, cameras, and other equipment and making arrangements with media outlets for broadcast coverage. Although the House and Senate experimented with television broadcasts as early as 1948, regular coverage of the House floor began in 1977 and regular coverage of the Senate floor began in 1986.

In these instances, committees allowed camera operators from the television networks to attend and film the hearings.

Noting that the President had successfully utilized radio and television to increase executive branch exposure and prestige, the joint committee considered a number of ways to improve congressional mass communications, including televised floor proceedings. Instead of relying upon broadcast networks to air portions of congressional coverage in newscasts or in lieu of other programming, new cable and satellite technologies offered Congress the possibility of its own designated channels that could provide all proceedings in their entirety.

Ultimately, the House chose to control its own video production but rely on privately-operated television stations to distribute the content. This decision alleviated some concerns about the cost of televising the House, but others remained worried that the House's exclusive control of video coverage could lead the public to believe they only saw \"a censored view of our activities.\" The Internet made it possible for the House to distribute video easily and inexpensively, and in 2011, the House chose to supplement its existing means for distributing videos by providing video access through its website.

Under H.Res. 866 , the Speaker of the House set up a closed-circuit video system to show floor proceedings in locations throughout the Capitol and House office buildings. The Committee on Rules would study \"all alternative methods\" for providing video and audio coverage of the proceedings and provide recommendations by February 15, 1978, for how the House should proceed with video coverage. The Speaker would then devise a system for broadcasting, distribution to news organizations, and storage and preservation of recordings.

These provisions helped alleviate concerns that a House-controlled broadcast might be censored for political reasons or violate the rights of a free press. Additionally, House video footage can be used for news or public affairs programs, but it cannot be used for commercial or political purposes.

The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for FY1979 stated that House funds could be used for broadcasting floor proceedings if the cameras were controlled and operated by House employees as part of the House Recording Studio. The first live broadcast from the House floor was a speech by Representative Al Gore on March 19, 1979. This, and some of the other early broadcasts from the House floor, aired on C-SPAN and on local public broadcasting.

Occasionally, the Speaker has issued directions modifying floor television coverage. For example, in 1984, the Speaker directed the Clerk of the House to provide a caption during special-order speeches to indicate that legislative business was complete for the day and to implement periodic wide-angle camera shots to show more of the chamber during these speeches.

In 1981, for example, the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Broadcasting wanted C-SPAN to provide its committee hearing coverage to the House free of charge. When C-SPAN would not make this footage available, the chair of the committee blocked C-SPAN from airing on televisions in the House cable system. More recently, in 2007, the Speaker of the House posted a video clip of a committee hearing from C-SPAN on a website and was issued a cease-and-desist notification. After this incident, C-SPAN revised its copyright policy to allow for noncommercial copying, sharing, or posting of C-SPAN videos online with attribution. C-SPAN has also sometimes requested permission to use its own cameras to cover floor proceedings, and these requests are regularly denied by the House and the Senate.", "C-SPAN provides public affairs programming, much like local networks or public broadcasting stations, but C-SPAN operates cable television channels, which has sometimes meant there are limits to its reach.
