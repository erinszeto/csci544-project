Because student achievement is widely believed to depend largely on the quality of instruction, the law also contains provisions designed to improve teacher quality. These provisions establish professional credentials for teachers and charge states and school districts with developing plans to improve teacher quality. According to the law, these plans must ensure that all core subject-matter courses are taught by a highly qualified teacher and that poor and minority students have equal access to quality instruction.", "To be deemed highly qualified, NCLB requires that teachers possess a baccalaureate degree and a state teaching certificate, and that teachers also demonstrate subject-matter knowledge for their teaching level. Elementary school teachers must show knowledge of basic elementary school curricular areas. Middle and secondary school teachers must demonstrate a high level of competency in all subject areas taught. Demonstration of subject-matter knowledge and competency may be shown by passing a state certification exam or licensing test in the relevant subject(s).", "This report examines implementation of the NCLB requirement and examines the extent to which schools achieved the law's goal of placing a highly qualified teacher in every classroom. After describing the highly qualified teacher requirement in detail, the report analyzes data from a national survey of schools conducted a year before NCLB became law. These data suggest that as many as four out of five teachers met the NCLB requirement prior to its enactment. Data reported throughout implementation of the law indicate that the proportion of highly qualified teachers increased each year, but that no state has reached 100%. In addition, analysis of these data also support concerns about the equitable distribution of teaching quality between poor and nonpoor schools.", "This report concludes with a discussion of teacher quality issues that may be considered as the ESEA reauthorization process unfolds. Several of these issues have been the subject of waiver authority exercised by the Secretary of Education under both the current and previous Administrations. Congress has also taken up these issues along with reauthorization of the rest of the ESEA. This report will be updated as significant legislative developments occur."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["It is widely believed that good teachers are critical to student learning. A large body of academic research has produced strong evidence that teacher quality is positively related to student performance. However, the strength of this research finding depends on the measure used to indicate \"quality.\" Studies that use credentials such as degree attainment or teacher certification show weaker impacts on student performance than studies that use direct measures of teachers' pedagogical and subject-matter knowledge. Nevertheless, credentials are more readily available to local school administrators that hire teachers and more easily incorporated into state and federal policy. In recent years, education policy governing the attainment of teaching credentials has evolved to incorporate pedagogy and subject expertise. General state certification exams have been replaced or enhanced with testing for knowledge of subject matter. Some states have developed multi-tiered, knowledge-based certification systems. Teacher preparation programs in some states have begun requiring that candidates obtain a major or minor in a subject as a prerequisite for or in conjunction with an education degree.", "Federal education policies have also aimed to enhance teaching credentials by placing added emphasis on subject expertise. Most recently, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) ( P.L. 107-110 ), requires that all public school teachers, in states participating in the ESEA Title I-A program, be highly qualified by demonstrating subject knowledge for their teaching level. Elementary school teachers must show knowledge of basic elementary school curricular areas. Middle and secondary school teachers must demonstrate a high level of competency in all subject areas taught. Subject-matter knowledge and competency may be demonstrated by passing a state certification exam or licensing test in the relevant subject(s).", "One of the major goals of NCLB is to raise the achievement of students who currently fail to meet grade-level proficiency standards. Since student achievement has been shown to be largely dependent on teacher quality, the law seeks to improve achievement by setting higher minimum teacher quality requirements. In complying with the law, schools are prevented from hiring teachers with emergency or provisional certification, those without a baccalaureate degree, or those with limited subject knowledge.", "For some time, it was thought that schools hired teachers lacking full credentials because a shortage existed in the overall supply of qualified teachers. That idea has been challenged in recent years by research that revealed the shortage is in fact a distribution problem. Some so-called \"hard-to-staff\" schools find it difficult to maintain a staff of qualified teachers, while other schools have an adequate supply (and in some cases an oversupply) of quality teachers.", "The reasons for the uneven distribution in the teacher supply are still a matter of debate. Some argue that rules providing priority in reassignment options to teachers with seniority and the late decision deadline given to resigning teachers relegates the least-qualified teachers to less desirable schools. Others point to working conditions and other factors that make these schools less desirable to quality teachers in the first place. Whatever the reasons for the uneven distribution of quality teachers, the persistence of hard-to-staff schools may undermine the impact of NCLB teacher quality standards in reducing the student achievement gap. To address this issue, Congress included in NCLB a requirement that poor and minority students have equal access to quality instruction.", "This report examines implementation of the NCLB requirement of a highly qualified teacher in every public school classroom. The first section of the report describes the highly qualified teacher (HQT) requirement and how it was specified through regulation, guidance, and policy statements issued by the Education Department (ED). In the second section, the report analyzes data from a national survey of schools to assess teacher quality prior to enactment of NCLB and examines state reporting data to track how teacher quality may have improved throughout the law's implementation.

First, to be deemed highly qualified, a teacher must possess a baccalaureate degree and full state teaching certification (i.e., must not have had any certification requirements waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis). Second, a teacher must demonstrate subject-matter knowledge in the areas that she or he teaches. The manner in which teachers satisfy the second component depends on the extent of their teaching experience and the level at which they teach. These subject knowledge requirements are as follows:", "New elementary school teachers must pass a rigorous state test demonstrating subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, math, and other basic elementary school curricular areas. New middle or secondary school teachers must demonstrate a high level of competency in all subjects taught by (1) passing rigorous state academic tests in those subjects, or (2) completing an academic major (or equivalent course work), graduate degree, or advanced certification in each subject taught.

In general, these policy statements addressed concerns about the scope and application of the HQT requirements. Among a wide variety of implementation issues, ED sought to clarify what constitutes \"core\" subject matter, how states should develop and apply a HOUSSE, how the HQT requirements may be differentially applied to different types of teachers and in different types of educational settings, and when various aspects of the requirement must be completed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Subject Matter Issues", "paragraphs": ["Early in the implementation of these provisions, some asked whether they apply to all teachers, including vocational education teachers, special education teachers, or others not teaching core academic subjects. According to ESEA Section 9101(11), \"The term 'core academic subjects' means English, reading or language arts, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history, and geography.\" Final regulations for the Title I program published on December 2, 2002, in the Federal Register clarified that these requirements apply only to core academic subject teachers. ED noted that these requirements would apply to a vocational education teacher or a special education teacher providing instruction in a core academic subject.", "ED addressed other subject matter issues in subsequent guidance and policy letters. A March 2004 policy announcement modified earlier nonregulatory guidance (issued in January 2004), which stated that science teachers teaching more than one field of science (e.g., biology and chemistry) would have to be highly qualified in each of the fields taught. Under the new flexibility, states determine whether science teachers need to be highly qualified in each science field they teach or highly qualified in science in general, based on how the state currently certifies teachers in these subject areas.", "This new flexibility, along with other changes, was incorporated into the revised nonregulatory guidance issued on August 3, 2005. For example, the guidance clarifies that social studies is not considered a core subject and that certification in social studies or possession of a \"composite social studies degree\" does not necessarily indicate that a teacher is highly qualified to teach related subjects (e.g., economics and history). States are to determine whether a social studies teacher is qualified to teach the specific subject he or she is assigned to teach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Objective Uniform State Standard of Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["According to NCLB, a teacher who is not new to the teaching profession may demonstrate subject matter knowledge through state-determined HOUSSE procedures.

The HOUSSE must provide objective information about teachers' content knowledge in all subjects taught and be applied uniformly statewide to all teachers in the same subjects and grade levels. Finally, the statute states that the HOUSSE may use multiple measures of teacher competency and may consider, but not be based primarily on, time teaching the relevant subjects.", "Nonregulatory guidance, published on September 12, 2003, included suggestions on the development of HOUSSE procedures. According to the guidance, states should consider several factors when developing their HOUSSE procedures, including whether the proposed HOUSSE measures provide an \"objective\" way of determining whether a teacher has adequate subject-matter knowledge. The latest (August 2005) guidance defines new teachers as those with less than one year of teaching experience and teachers who are not new as those with more than one year of experience. However, the guidance indicates that states have the authority to determine who is new to the profession and who is not.

This allowance is made only for a teacher in an alternative certification program who is receiving high-quality professional development, intensive supervision, and is making satisfactory progress toward full certification.", "Concerns had been raised that the HQT requirements would limit participation in international teacher exchange programs. In a policy letter issued on March 24, 2003, the Secretary addressed these concerns by indicating how teachers from other countries could be considered highly qualified in the state in which they teach. The Secretary pointed out that each state has the full authority to define and enforce its own requirements for certification and licensure and make accommodations for foreign teachers. Accommodations could also be made in developing tests and other ways of demonstrating subject-matter expertise. In making this point, the Secretary clarified that one such demonstration provided in the law is coursework equivalent to an academic major.", "These changes were included in the September 2003 updated guidance, along with clarification on the issue of middle school teachers. When determining whether teachers of core academic subjects in grades 6 through 8 should meet competency requirements for elementary or middle school teachers, the guidance advises states to \"examine the degree of rigor and technicality of the subject matter that a teacher will need to know in relation to the state's content standards and academic achievement standards for the subjects in those grade levels.\" In addition, states may choose to consider teachers with middle school certification to be \"highly qualified,\" and states may approve tests that are specifically developed for middle school teachers if the tests are \"rigorous content-area assessments that are developed specifically for middle school teachers and aligned with middle school content and academic standards.\"", "In a March 31, 2004, policy letter, the Secretary announced that additional flexibility could be applied in the implementation of the HQT requirements with regard to teachers in small rural school districts. In small rural districts, ED provided that teachers teaching core academic subjects who meet the highly qualified requirements in at least one of the subject areas they teach may have an additional three years to meet these requirements in the other subjects they might teach. For current teachers, this three-year grace period began with the 2004-2005 school year, meaning that rather than facing a deadline of the end of the 2005-2006 school year to be highly qualified in all core subjects taught, current rural teachers had until the end of the 2006-2007 school year. For newly hired teachers, a full three-year grace period can be provided from the date of hiring. But those newly hired teachers will have to be highly qualified in one of their core subject areas when hired.

In turn, each LEA was also to have a plan to meet this deadline. In addition, beginning with the first day of the 2002-2003 school year, any LEA receiving ESEA Title I funding must ensure that all teachers hired after that date who are teaching in Title I-supported programs are highly qualified.
