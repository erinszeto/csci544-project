The states are responsible for managing wildfires that originate on all other lands. Although a greater number of wildfires occur annually on nonfederal lands, wildfires on federal lands tend to be much larger, particularly in the western United States. The federal government's wildfire management responsibilities\u2014fulfilled primarily by the Forest Service (FS) and the Department of the Interior (DOI)\u2014include prevention, detection, response, and recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also may provide disaster relief for certain nonfederal wildfires.", "Congress provides appropriations for wildfire management to both FS and DOI. Within these appropriations, suppression operations are largely funded through two accounts for each agency: Wildland Fire Management (WFM) accounts and Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act (FLAME) reserve accounts. If the suppression funding in both of these accounts is exhausted during any given fiscal year, FS and DOI are authorized to transfer funds from their other accounts to pay for suppression activities. Congress also may provide additional funds for suppression activities through emergency or supplemental appropriations. Thus, for any given year, total suppression appropriations to FS or DOI may be a combination of several sources: the WFM account, the FLAME account, additional funding as needed through transfers, and/or supplemental appropriations.", "Overall appropriations to FS and DOI for wildland fire management have quadrupled since the 1990s, going from $1.2 billion in FY1994 to $4.9 billion in FY2016 in constant dollars. A significant portion of that increase is related to rising suppression costs, even during years of relatively mild wildfire activity, although the costs vary annually and are difficult to predict in advance. Since FY2001, FS and DOI have required more suppression funds than have been appropriated to them in all but three years. This discrepancy often leads the agencies to transfer funds from other accounts, prompting concerns that increasing suppression spending may be detrimental to other agency programs. In response, Congress has enacted supplemental appropriations to repay the transferred funds or to replenish the agency's wildfire accounts 12 times, including $700 million provided as emergency spending in FY2016 to repay suppression costs from FY2015. Furthermore, wildfire spending\u2014like all discretionary spending\u2014is currently subject to procedural and budgetary controls. In the past, Congress has effectively waived some of these controls for certain wildfire spending, but it has not done so in more recent years. This situation has prompted some to explore providing wildfire spending outside of those constraints.", "The 115th Congress may consider legislation to address these issues. The 114th Congress considered\u2014but did not enact\u2014several wildfire spending bills that may be of interest. All of these bills, directly or indirectly, would have allowed for some wildfire suppression funds\u2014subject to certain criteria\u2014to be provided outside the statutory limits on discretionary spending, either through the annual appropriations process or through supplemental appropriations. Under those proposals, varying levels of wildfire funding would not have needed to compete with other programs and activities that are subject to the statutory limits. However, the amounts that could have been provided for wildfire suppression operations under these proposals\u2014both within and outside of the spending limits\u2014would have been subject to future appropriations decisions by Congress. These proposals also could have affected certain funding mechanisms that have been used to provide additional spending for major disaster recovery (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["F unding for federal wildfire management\u2014particularly for suppression operations on federal lands\u2014raises several interrelated policy questions for Congress to consider.

The federal agencies tasked with suppression activities may deplete their suppression resources rapidly, so Congress also may consider if, and how, to provide these agencies with quick access to additional funds to enable continued federal services in response to wildfires. In addition, Congress may address questions related to the source of the suppression funds, such as if rising suppression costs should be offset by cuts to other agency programs, or if those costs should be considered outside of certain budgetary and procedural constraints. Furthermore, Congress may consider options to enact budgetary controls on suppression spending or other methods to constrain rising federal costs.

This figure is almost double the average annual acreage burned in the late 1990s (3.6 million acres), although a greater number of fires occurred annually (83,000 wildfires on average) in that period (see Figure 1 ). Over the past 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, nearly 6.6 million acres burned annually on average. In 2016, nearly 68,000 fires burned 5.5 million acres, below the 10-year average and a significant decrease from 2015. In 2015, just over 68,000 wildfires burned 10.1 million acres, the largest acreage burned on record and more than the previous two years combined (3.6 million acres burned in 2014 and 4.3 million acres burned in 2013). More than half of the acres burned in 2015 were in Alaska (5.1 million acres), which is more than the total acreage burned in that state over the previous five years. Of the wildfires in 2016, 1.8% (1,251) were classified as \"large or significant\" and 19 wildfires exceeded 40,000 acres in size. In 2015, there were fewer \"large or significant\" fires in total than in 2016 (1,052), but there were more wildfires that burned over 40,000 acres (52).", "In 2016, 54% of the nationwide acreage burned by wildfires was on federal lands (3.0 million acres; see Table 1 ). The other 46% of the acreage burned occurred on state, local, or privately owned lands but also accounted for most (82%) of the fires (55,193 wildfires). On average, from 2007 to 2016, 67% of the total acreage burned was on federal lands, whereas 77% of the fires occurred on nonfederal lands. These figures reflect that the fires that occur on federal land are larger in size, although fewer in number, compared with those on nonfederal land. This is particularly true in the West, where less than one-third of the fires burned 60% of the acreage on federal lands compared to nonfederal lands in 2016. In the East, however, where there is less federal acreage, most of the fires and acreage burned occurred on nonfederal lands. ", "Although the number of fires and acreage burned are indicators of the annual level of wildfire activity, they also may be misleading, since many fires may occur in areas that are large and relatively undeveloped, with very little impact to human development or communities. Acreage burned also does not indicate the severity of the wildfire or the degree of damage caused to the ecosystem. Thus, other indicators of wildfire activity also are considered in conjunction with acreage burned, such as the intensity and severity of each wildfire, the cumulative number of severe wildfires in a year, or the number of days spent at the highest national preparedness levels. The National Fire Preparedness Levels (PLs) are indicative of the level of nationwide mobilization of resources, with higher numbers indicating higher levels of response. Over the past 10 years (2007-2016), the PL was at the highest level (PL5) for nine days on average annually, although PL5 was not reached in half of those years.

More than one-third of all housing developments in the United States are now located within the WUI. In the West, nearly 900,000 homes are estimated to be at very high or high risk of wildfire damage. While attention has focused on protecting life, property, and communities in the WUI, opinions vary over if and how much the federal government should pay to protect those resources.", "U.S. federal wildland fire guidance directs that the response to wildfire is to prioritize the safety of the firefighters first, then the ecological, social, and legal consequences of the fire. The guidance further states that the cost of federal response to wildfire should be commensurate with the values to be protected (human, natural, historical, or cultural), but economic efficiency is not necessarily required. Response priorities include managing costs but without compromising safety. While some believe this policy allows the federal land management agencies flexibility to provide a high-quality emergency response, others believe this is akin to a \"blank check\" policy and has removed any incentive for the agencies to control suppression costs. ", "Federal wildfire suppression spending is influenced by several factors, including the size and intensity of the fire and the proximity of the fire to valuable resources. These resources require protection, which often increases firefighter risks as well as suppression costs as more personnel or assets are deployed to provide protection. Federal suppression costs\u2014daily, overall, and on a per-acre basis\u2014become higher as the number and value of homes near a fire increase. ", "When wildfire expenditures began to increase in the 2000s, many were concerned that the federal government was bearing too much of the cost of wildfires and that state, local, and private landowners lacked incentive to mitigate future fire risk to offset suppression costs. The agencies have since modified their cost-share agreements with many of the states to provide more consistent arrangements, although these still may vary by state and by fire. The agencies, particularly FS, also have initiated several technical and financial assistance programs to increase WUI community preparedness and homeowner protections. A 2006 USDA Office of Inspector General (OIG) report asked Congress to clarify the federal government's role in protecting WUI developments.

This may include assigning the cost based on the proportion of acres burned within each agency's jurisdiction or on resources deployed, among others.

Therefore, Congress has granted FS and DOI the authority to transfer funds from other accounts and programs to ensure that federal emergency response activities continue under certain conditions (often referred to as fire transfers or fire borrowing ). The transfer authority is granted annually in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations acts, specifically in the general provisions section for DOI and the administrative provisions section for FS. The authority to transfer funds for WFM-related activities was first granted in the FY1980 appropriations law ( P.L. 96-126 ), which allowed transfers for the emergency rehabilitation of lands impacted by wildfire. The authority was continued annually. The FY1989 Interior appropriations law ( P.L. 100-371 ) expanded the authority to allow for funds to be transferred for firefighting purposes in addition to emergency rehabilitation.

Agencies often target programs that have relatively large unobligated balances. These programs are often funded in one year, but the funds may not be obligated for several years, potentially allowing for transfers to be made with minimal immediate impact so long as the funds are reimbursed. The agencies may then also make a request to Congress to provide additional funding to replenish the FLAME accounts and to repay the transferred funds. Congress often provides a supplemental appropriation to repay those accounts. For example, Congress appropriated $700.0 million to FS in FY2016 as a supplemental appropriation to repay accounts used to cover suppression expenses incurred in FY2015.

This method originated in the 1990s from an agreement between the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget. Prior to the enactment of the FLAME Act, the agencies' WFM suppression activity requests would equal their rolling 10-year suppression obligation averages. From FY2010 to FY2014, the agencies' WFM suppression activity requests plus their FLAME account requests equaled their rolling 10-year suppression obligation averages.

This means that suppression spending from FY2005 through FY2014 was used to formulate the suppression budget request for FY2016. ", "Because it is based on past spending, the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average is a lagging indicator of future suppression spending. Lagging indicators, in general, demonstrate patterns across previous years but do not necessarily signal future trends. As such, the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average may not be the most accurate method to predict future suppression spending needs during the budget formulation process. For example, the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average has underestimated suppression spending for both FS and DOI in all but 2 of the past 10 fiscal years (FY2007-FY2016). On average, over the past 10 fiscal years, the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average has been nearly 50% below the obligations for FS and 6% below the DOI suppression obligations. ", "When wildfire spending began to increase in the 2000s, GAO noted that the agencies' forecasting methods were insufficient in terms of both annual and in-season budgeting. FS reportedly analyzed alternative methods, but FS and DOI still use the 10-year suppression obligation average to formulate budget requests, even though suppression spending surpasses the estimate most years. An earlier proposed version of the FLAME Act would have required the agencies to use a rolling 5-year suppression obligation average to formulate their budget requests. A rolling 5-year average potentially would have predicted future suppression spending more accurately than a 10-year average, since the lower values from earlier years would drop out of the calculation. However, because a rolling 5-year average still would have been based on past spending, it also would have been a lagging indicator and likely would have underestimated suppression spending. The enacted version of the FLAME Act did not contain that provision, however. Instead, the FLAME Act requires the agencies to develop an estimate based on the best available science\u2014the FLAME forecasts discussed below\u2014but does not direct that these estimates or forecasts be used to formulate budget requests. ", "FS and DOI also must predict suppression spending during a wildfire season to ensure the availability of funds and to determine if and how much additional funding is going to be necessary. In response to FLAME Act requirements, FS and DOI began using regression models that incorporate weather and climate data, among other data, to forecast spending. The models predict a range of suppression spending within a 90% confidence interval (CI) and are published four times per year: March, May, and June, with a September outlook for the upcoming year. The FLAME forecasts vary; for example, the estimate for the upper 90% CI ranged from $1.6 billion for FS in the March 2014 forecast to $2.0 billion in the May 2014 forecast three months later. In the six years (FY2011-FY2016) for which data are available, suppression obligations exceeded the annual average FLAME median forecast for the FS five times and DOI four times, although only by $8 million in FY2016. Suppression obligations exceeded the average upper 90% CI three times for FS, but not for DOI (see Figure 8 and Figure 9 ). ", "The FLAME forecasts generally have not been the basis used for funding requests in the annual budget formulation process, although out-year forecasts are provided to the agencies two fiscal years in advance. Instead, the Obama Administration's budget requests for suppression have continued to use the 10-year obligation average but also have included requests for access to additional funds above the 10-year obligation average up to the upper forecast range. The agencies have used the out-year and current-year forecasts to inform congressional decisionmakers about potential spending levels throughout a wildfire season or during budget hearings.

The 114 th Congress explored several interrelated issues pertaining to funding federal wildland fire management in general\u2014and to wildfire suppression operations in particular\u2014through congressional hearings, and it considered several legislative proposals. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appropriation Levels and Forecasts", "paragraphs": ["Each year, Congress considers at what level suppression (and wildland fire management in general) should be appropriated. Suppression costs are difficult to predict and can fluctuate widely. From FY2010 to FY2011, for example, combined FS and DOI suppression obligations increased more than 50%, but from FY2011 to FY2012, obligations increased by less than 10%. From FY2013 to FY2014, obligations decreased by 15%, but between FY2014 and FY2015, obligations increased 40%. These variations make it difficult for Congress to know at what level to appropriate in any given year. As discussed above, the budget formulation process is based on a rolling historic average, which has underestimated suppression spending 8 out of the last 10 years, by nearly 50% annually on average (FY2007-FY2016). The agencies have borrowed funds from other accounts in 6 of those 10 years, and Congress has also appropriated supplemental suppression appropriations in 5 of those years (and in FY2016 to repay funds borrowed in FY2015). ", "The intent of the FLAME accounts was to eliminate the need for fire borrowing or supplemental appropriations by serving as a reserve fund. The FLAME accounts, however, are funded through a definite appropriation (a specified amount) that is still budgeted using the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average. After the FLAME accounts were established, the agencies continued to receive suppression appropriations equal to the 10-year suppression obligation average, although the funds were divided in two different accounts. The FLAME Act, in essence, created an additional account for suppression operations but did not create access to any additional funds above what was already being provided. The FLAME Act directed that the agencies develop a better formula to forecast suppression spending, but it did not mandate that the agencies use that formula to formulate budget requests (although that was debated). It also may be argued that the FLAME Act actually created various hurdles for the agencies to access a portion of the suppression funds they previously could access freely. ", "While it may be argued that the issue is that suppression costs are not being fully funded\u2014requiring the agencies to deplete other accounts and, potentially, the appropriation of supplemental funds\u2014the ability to access other funding sources has allowed the agencies to honor all suppression obligations incurred during any given fiscal year. However, this may sometimes be at the expense of not fully funding other programs. A more accurate description may be that suppression costs for any given year are not necessarily being fully funded in advance for that fiscal year. In this sense, funding for suppression is sometimes reactive, not proactive. This is in part due to the unpredictable nature of wildfires and wildfire spending as well as difficulties in accurately predicting future suppression costs. Improving the suppression spending forecasts used for budget decisions may alleviate some of the agencies' needs to supplement their suppression accounts during the fiscal year. Congress may consider directing the agencies to use a different or specified methodology during their budget formulation processes, or it may continue to allow the agencies the discretion to formulate their own budget requests using the methodologies they deem most appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Source", "paragraphs": ["Federal spending on wildland fire management is currently more than four times what it was in the 1990s. A significant portion of that increase is related to rising suppression costs, even during years of relatively mild wildfire activity. The year 2015 saw significant wildfire activity and significant federal spending on wildfire suppression; FS and DOI combined obligated $2.1 billion in 2015. The year 2016 saw less wildfire activity than 2015 but more spending ($2.2 billion combined in 2016, the most spent in one year to date). Although the 2013 and 2014 wildfire seasons had fewer fires and burned fewer acres than in 2012, Congress appropriated more funds in each successive fiscal year, including providing supplemental appropriations in FY2013 and FY2014. In FY2016, in addition to providing $700 million in supplemental appropriations to FS to repay funds borrowed in FY2015, Congress also appropriated significantly more to each agency's WFM suppression and FLAME accounts. Not including the supplemental appropriation, FS received $1.6 billion in FY2016 for suppression activities, more than $600 million more than in FY2015 ($1.0 billion). DOI received $468.7 million in FY2016, $85 million more than in FY2015 ($383.7 million). ", "Congress may consider whether or how to address the rising costs of wildfire management and suppression operations. Some are concerned that the rising costs are coming at the expense of funding other agency programs, some of which may potentially reduce future suppression spending. Wildfire accounts for an increasing proportion of FS's budget, up from 47% in FY2007 to 61% in FY2016 (57% not counting the $700 million supplemental). As wildfire funding has accounted for a larger proportion of total FS appropriations, other FS programs naturally account for a smaller proportion, even though the actual dollar amounts appropriated to those programs may have increased. For example, the proportion of FS's budget devoted to managing the National Forest System and for construction and maintenance each decreased over the same time period, although it is not clear if the declines are attributable entirely to increasing wildfire funding. Congress may want to consider options that would maintain consistent levels of funding for other agency programs, although doing so could come at the expense of other agencies or programs funded through the Interior appropriations bill (discussed below) or may contribute to increasing the federal deficit if the costs are not offset. ", "Congress also may want to discuss ways to reduce the overall cost of suppression spending. FS, DOI, GAO, and others have argued that increasing current investments in hazardous fuel reduction projects may potentially reduce long-term suppression spending. Others argue that the agencies should place a higher priority on cost containment efforts, perhaps by reducing agency budgets or restricting access to additional funds under certain conditions. Another option Congress may consider is addressing the proportion of wildfire suppression costs borne by the federal government\u2014for example, by developing a consistent federal cost apportionment method, which currently varies by state and often by fire, depending on the terms of the cooperative fire agreement.

The defense category includes all discretionary spending under budget function 050 (defense); the nondefense category includes discretionary spending in all other budget functions. Enacted discretionary spending may not exceed these limits. In the event that spending is enacted that exceeds a limit, the limit is to be enforced through sequestration, which involves the automatic cancellation of budget authority through largely across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities. These reductions would occur to spending in the category of the limit that was breached. ", "Certain spending is effectively exempt from the discretionary spending limits pursuant to Section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA), because those limits are \"adjusted\" upward to accommodate that spending. For example, these adjustments include budget authority designated as emergency requirements, as well as that designated as for disaster relief. The purpose of these designations is, in part, to address the unpredictable nature of disaster assistance while attempting to impose discipline on the amount spent by the federal government on disasters. The emergency designation could apply to a number of different types of purposes, whereas the disaster relief designation is more narrowly limited to costs of major disasters that have been declared pursuant to Section 102(2) of the Stafford Act. Wildfire suppression operations are an allowable purpose for the emergency designation but are not included under the disaster relief designation. Of the six supplemental appropriations provided for wildfire suppression operations from FY2007 through FY2016, Congress designated four as emergency spending, including the supplemental appropriations provided in FY2016. The supplemental appropriations provided in FY2013 and FY2014 did not receive emergency designations. ", "While there is no limit on the amount of budget authority that can be designated as emergency requirements each fiscal year, the amount that can be designated using the disaster relief designation is limited by a formula. This formula is based on the average funding provided for disaster relief over the last 10 years, excluding the highest and lowest annual amounts. If less than the maximum amount allowed by the formula is ultimately appropriated for a fiscal year, then the difference is added to the amount that the disaster formula yields for the next fiscal year. For example, if the formula for a fiscal year allows $10 billion in disaster designated spending, but only $6 billion is appropriated, then the amount of the allowable disaster designation for the following fiscal year will be the formula plus the $4 billion in carryover from the previous fiscal year. This total amount\u2014formula plus carryover, if any\u2014is sometimes referred to as the disaster cap .", "Since FY2012, when the BCA discretionary spending limits were first implemented, three different types of discretionary spending have been provided to prevent or respond to natural disasters\u2014spending that is subject to the discretionary spending limits, spending designated as for disaster relief, and spending designated as for emergency requirements. ", "Spending subject to the limits has been provided each fiscal year in regular appropriations measures to respond to disaster events, including wildfires, in a number of different appropriations accounts, such as certain FEMA appropriations in the Disaster Relief Fund and the Small Business Administration appropriations for disaster loans. Disaster-designated spending has been provided each fiscal year through the regular appropriations process for response and recovery work for presidentially declared events that are not wildfires. In previous practice, the great majority of such spending also has been appropriated to the FEMA DRF to be used for the response to major disasters. However, in some instances, disaster-designated funding also has been provided to address the unmet needs created by major disasters beyond those provided to the DRF, such as for the Community Development Block Grant program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Army Corps of Engineers. Emergency spending usually has been provided to supplement disaster-designated spending, as well as spending that is subject to the discretionary spending limits, in response to events that have already occurred, including wildfires.", "According to FEMA, the BCA necessitated the development of a new, two-part approach to accounting for disaster-related activity, with one approach for major disasters and another for all other DRF activity:", "Essentially, requests for DRF funding for FEMA's Stafford Act programs and disaster support activities fall into two categories: disaster relief cap adjustment and base/non-major disasters.

As a consequence, the amounts that were provided under the wildfire adjustment would have been gradually incorporated into the calculation of the 10-year rolling average for disaster relief. Second, after the disaster cap for a fiscal year was calculated (including incorporating the amount of the prior-year wildfire adjustments into the calculation), the amount of the disaster cap was to be reduced by the amount of the previous fiscal year's wildfire adjustment.

For example, were these proposals to have been in effect for FY2016, Congress could have appropriated the minimum of $1.057 billion for suppression operations, which was 70% of the combined FS and DOI suppression obligation for FY2016 ($1.510 billion). But then Congress could have appropriated an additional $2.689 billion under H.R. 167 or $1.410 billion under S. 235 in FY2016, effectively outside of the budget controls discussed above.

This proposal would have largely codified recent agency practices, with some modifications. This could have given Congress more advance notice about the need for supplemental wildfire suppression operations appropriations, as well as information on how the agencies proposed to use those additional appropriations. Both this advance notice and additional information could have aided Congress in appropriations decisionmaking and oversight. They also might have added to the workload of both the FS and DOI during a critical time of providing wildfire assistance.", "This interaction between the proposed wildfire and existing disaster relief adjustments had a number of potential implications for the amount of the disaster cap in the future. However, because these potential implications were highly sensitive to future appropriations decisions made by Congress and the President each fiscal year, the extent to which the calculation for the disaster cap would have been affected by the use of the wildfire adjustment cannot be determined definitively. Assuming that the wildfire adjustment was first used in FY2016, for the next several years, the disaster formula would have been based on 10 fiscal years of funding for disaster relief (minus the highest and lowest fiscal year), but fewer than 10 fiscal years of the wildfire adjustment would have been available to be incorporated into the base calculation. This would have had the potential to make the amount available for the disaster cap lower than it otherwise might have been. On the other hand, appropriations for the full adjustment allowed by the disaster cap have not been made since FY2013, which is causing the amounts that are used to calculate the 10-year rolling average for the amount of the cap in future fiscal years to be lower than they would have been had the full amount of the disaster cap been appropriated.

( H.R. 2647 also contained additional titles addressing other federal forestry issues, which are not discussed in this report.) "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Summary", "paragraphs": ["Title IX of H.R. 2647 would have broadened the purposes for major disasters under the Stafford Act to include \"wildfires on federal lands\" (\u00a7901), and it would have created a related budgetary mechanism that potentially could have been used to fund the response to each wildfire on federal land that had been declared to be a major disaster (\u00a7902). Under this proposal, the affected federal land management agency (either the DOI Secretary or the USDA Secretary) could request a presidential declaration of a major disaster for wildfire on federal lands if the following requirements were satisfied:", "The Secretary made the request in writing. The Secretary certified that wildfire suppression operations appropriations that had been enacted for that fiscal year equaled or exceeded a certain minimum level, which was the rolling 10-fiscal-year average cost of wildfire suppression operations incurred by the federal land management agencies. This minimum level included any concurrently enacted rescissions. The unobligated balance of wildfire suppression operations funding, presumably from previous fiscal years, also could be credited to that minimum level for the purposes of this requirement. The Secretary certified that the amount available to the agency for anticipated and ongoing suppression operations for the wildfire on which the declaration request had been made would be obligated not later than 30 days after the notification. The Secretary specified the amount of the current fiscal year funds required for suppression operations related to the wildfire for which the declaration was requested.", "Title IX of H.R. 2647 would have required that the President establish a specific account from which available funds could be transferred to the DOI Secretary or USDA Secretary to conduct wildfire suppression operations if a declaration of a major disaster had been made. This account could be used only to fund assistance for major disaster declarations for wildfires on federal lands and nonfederal lands pursuant to a fire protection agreement or cooperative agreement. The bill would have established reimbursement procedures from the nonfederal entity if any of the funds transferred from this account were used for wildfires on nonfederal lands under a fire protection agreement. This account could be funded in anticipation of one or more such major disasters, or in response to them, through regular or supplemental appropriations. ", "Within 90 days after the end of a fiscal year in which a major disaster for wildfire on federal lands had been declared, the affected Secretaries would have been required to submit reports detailing their wildland fire management decisions and cost expenditures to several congressional committees. These reports were required to include the risk-based factors that influenced management decisions; an analysis of the effectiveness of management decisions and cost factors across a statistically significant sample of large fires; suppression operations expenditures broken out by fire size, cost, regional location, and other factors as deemed appropriate by each Secretary; and lessons learned. ", "Section 903 of H.R. 2647 would have prohibited the agencies from transferring funds from their other accounts for suppression purposes, potentially eliminating the agencies' fire borrowing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Implications", "paragraphs": ["The budgetary mechanism under this proposal potentially could have provided an additional discretionary spending option for wildfire suppression operations funding related to the disaster relief designation. As previously discussed, spending designated as \"disaster relief,\" which is effectively exempt from the BCA limits, may be provided only for activities carried out pursuant to a determination of a major disaster under Section 102(2) of the Stafford Act. Because H.R. 2647 would have amended the Stafford Act to include wildfires on federal land as an incident for which major disasters could be declared, these changes might have allowed appropriations for such activities to be disaster-designated under certain circumstances:", "First, the preconditions for requesting a major disaster declaration for wildfires on federal land would have to be fulfilled. These preconditions included a minimum level of budgetary resources for wildfire suppression operations, and that minimum amount would need to have been appropriated (and therefore would have been subject to the statutory discretionary spending limits). Second, even if disaster-designated funds were appropriated in anticipation of a major disaster for wildfires on federal lands, they could not be transferred and made available to the requesting agency until a major disaster had been declared by the President. They would not have been available to the agencies prior to that time.", "In the contexts of their various budget enforcement responsibilities, the House and Senate Budget Committees, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget would have had to determine how the changes to the Stafford Act proposed by H.R. 2647 would have affected the BBEDCA disaster designation, if at all.", "If the Stafford Act changes in Title IX of H.R. 2647 had led to the use of the disaster designation for additional wildfire suppression operations funding, these changes would have had implications for the future operation of that designation. In addition to allowing wildfires that meet certain criteria to be eligible for funding using the disaster designation, the calculation for the disaster cap would have only gradually incorporated appropriations for any major disaster declarations for wildfires on federal lands over the following 10 fiscal years. This would have had the potential to increase the competition for budgetary resources that could be provided using the designation. However, because appropriations for the full adjustment allowed by the disaster cap have not been made since FY2013, adding purposes to the designation might have caused more of the allowable adjustment to be used and factored into future disaster cap calculations. This might have had the effect of increasing the amount of disaster cap in future fiscal years above what it otherwise might have been. Because the amount available under the disaster designation is highly sensitive to future appropriations decisions, CRS cannot determine the extent to which the calculation for the disaster cap would have been affected by this expansion of Stafford Act purposes. ", "The bill also would have prohibited fire borrowing, although it was unclear if fire borrowing authorities would continue to be provided in appropriations laws. It was also unclear how H.R. 2647 would have impacted the agencies' budget formulation process. The precondition to appropriate a minimum amount was based on the rolling 10-year suppression obligation average, but the rescissions and unobligated balances might have complicated that calculation. ", "H.R. 2647 would have required the agencies to provide Congress and the public with reports analyzing cost expenditures and management decisions. These reporting requirements could have provided Congress\u2014and the agencies\u2014with more information on agency decisionmaking and spending to aid in future appropriations decisions and oversight. However, the development and production of these reports and the required analyses potentially could have required substantial investments from the agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Action", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 2647 passed the House on July 9, 2015, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture.
