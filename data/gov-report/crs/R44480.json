Debate over the use of the CAA to regulate GHG emissions has its origins at least as far back as 1999, when several groups filed a petition urging EPA to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines under CAA Section 202. EPA denied the petition in 2003 after soliciting public comments. Shortly thereafter, some of the groups were joined by 12 states and others in filing a petition for review of EPA's decision in the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit, in a fractured opinion, deferred to EPA's denial of the petition. On appeal, however, in its 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , a five-Justice majority of the Supreme Court held that EPA has statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions under CAA Section 202(a)(1), which requires the EPA Administrator to set emission standards for \"any air pollutant\" from motor vehicles \"which in his judgment cause[s], or contribute[s] to\" air pollution which \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" GHGs, the Court said, unambiguously fell within the broad definition of \"air pollutant.\" The Court also found that EPA had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in explaining its denial of the petition. ", "Citing the Massachusetts v. EPA decision, EPA issued an \"endangerment\" finding and a \"cause or contribute\" finding in December 2009. These findings formed the basis for the light-duty vehicle GHG emission standards and corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards issued jointly by EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2010.", "In 2011, in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (\" AEP \"), the Supreme Court unanimously held that EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA\u2014including its power under Section 111(d), the basis of the CPP\u2014displaced any common law tort or nuisance claims against power plants and other GHG emissions sources. The Court in AEP explicitly ruled that \"air pollutant\" includes GHGs when applied to power plants under Section 111, as under Section 202 for motor vehicles. The Court concluded that federal judges may not set limits on GHG emissions because the CAA \"empower[s] EPA to set the same limits,\" and therefore did not allow the plaintiffs, including states, to proceed with their lawsuits against power plant operators. ", "With GHGs being regulated under CAA Section 202, EPA proceeded with regulating GHGs under other CAA authorities for stationary sources. In particular, EPA interpreted the mobile source GHG regulations as triggering regulations under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. The PSD program generally requires new or modified stationary sources that will emit threshold amounts (250 or 100 tons per year depending on the type of source) of air pollutants subject to regulation under the CAA to obtain permits and comply with emissions limitations that reflect the \"best available control technology\" (BACT). EPA likewise sought to regulate GHGs under the Title V permit program. Title V requires permits for \"major sources\" with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of any air pollutant. As EPA noted, GHG emissions tend to be \"orders of magnitude greater\" than emissions of other types of air pollutants, so the statutory thresholds would have swept in many smaller sources not previously subject to CAA permitting. EPA addressed this by issuing a \"tailoring rule,\" structured to phase in GHG permitting under the PSD and Title V programs first for \"anyway\" sources already subject to permitting for other air pollutants, and then to non-anyway sources meeting higher thresholds.", "In 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (\" UARG \"), the Supreme Court rejected EPA's interpretation of the \"triggering\" provisions for the stationary source programs; it held that EPA cannot regulate a power plant solely due to its GHG emissions, striking down EPA's \"tailoring\" rule. Justice Scalia, writing for a five-Justice majority of the Court, stated the following:", "EPA's greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the PSD and Title V triggers \u2026 [is] unreasonable because it would bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPA's regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization. When an agency claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate \"a significant portion of the American economy,\" we typically greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism. ", "On the other hand, in a part of the decision joined by seven Justices, the Supreme Court affirmed EPA's authority under the CAA to require Best Available Control Technology (BACT) to regulate GHG emissions from power plants if the source is regulated for other air pollutants, holding EPA's interpretation of such requirements reasonable. In sum, UARG held that EPA \"may not treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant for purposes of defining a 'major emitting facility' \u2026 in the PSD context or a 'major source' in the Title V context.... EPA may, however, continue to treat greenhouse gases as a 'pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter' for purposes of requiring BACT for 'anyway' sources.\" As a practical matter, UARG affirmed EPA's ability to regulate roughly 83% of U.S. stationary-source GHG emissions under PSD and Title V permitting programs, and struck down its ability to regulate the additional 3% that would have been reached had the tailoring rule been upheld."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clean Air Act Section 111", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, EPA finalized a settlement agreement with states and others to promulgate New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs) for GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants under Section 111(b) of the CAA, and emission guidelines covering existing power plants under Section 111(d). President Obama also directed EPA to issue GHG regulations under Section 111(b) and 111(d) in a presidential memorandum issued in June 2013. ", "As characterized by EPA, Section 111 operates to address one of three \"general categories of pollutants emitted from existing stationary sources,\" the other two being (1) \"criteria\" air pollutants under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) program under CAA Sections 108-110; and (2) \"hazardous air pollutants\" (HAP) under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) program under CAA Section 112. Section 111 addresses \"air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" Section 111 directs EPA to list categories of stationary sources that cause or contribute significantly to such air pollution; to establish NSPSs for new sources within any such category; and then to issue a \"procedure\" requiring states to submit plans that establish standards of performance for existing sources in a category, under certain conditions. In other words, NSPSs under Section 111(b) may trigger what EPA terms \"emission guidelines\" under Section 111(d).

Air pollutants and source categories for which EPA has issued emission guidelines under Section 111(d) include, among others, methane and non-methane compounds from large landfills; acid mist from sulfuric acid production units; fluoride emissions from phosphate fertilizer plants; reduced sulfur emissions from kraft pulp mills; and fluoride emissions from primary aluminum plants. In addition, EPA's 2005 Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) delisted coal-fired power plants from CAA Section 112 and, instead, established a cap-and-trade system for mercury under Section 111(d); the D.C.

In addition, state plans could measure compliance using an emission rate target, measured in pounds of CO 2 per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity, or a mass-based target, measured in tons of CO 2 . The CPP also requires state plans to include certain other components and considerations, such as electric reliability. ", "EPA cannot legally compel a state to submit a Section 111(d) plan. Rather, if a state fails to submit a satisfactory plan by EPA's deadline, CAA Section 111(d) authorizes EPA to prescribe a federal plan for the state.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , a court reviewing an agency rule defers to the agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute if the agency's interpretation is reasonable. In the 2014 UARG v. EPA decision, however, the Supreme Court opined that where a statutory interpretation by EPA \"would bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPA's regulatory authority\"\u2014which some petitioners say the CPP would do\u2014a court should demand \"clear congressional authorization.\" ", "Petitioners emphasize this and other language from UARG . They also highlight language from King v. Burwell , the 2015 Supreme Court decision which, though it ultimately upheld the Affordable Care Act's insurance premium tax credits in all states, declined to give deference to the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) interpretation of that act because the IRS lacked \"expertise in crafting health insurance policy\u2026.\" Petitioners' position against applying deference in the CPP litigation is illustrated by the first paragraph of their initial merits brief's Introduction: ", "EPA \u2026 purports to have discovered sweeping authority in section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act\u2014a provision that has been used only five times in 45 years\u2014to issue a \"Power Plan\" that forces States to fundamentally alter electricity generation throughout the country.", "But as the Supreme Court recently said, courts should \"greet \u2026 with a measure of skepticism\" claims by EPA to have \"discover[ed] in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the American economy\" and make \"decisions of vast economic and political significance,\" [ UARG ], especially in areas outside an agency's \"expertise,\" King v.

The intervenors' brief also opposes Chevron deference on the grounds that the CPP is, in their view, an example of lawmaking, among other reasons. ", "Respondents, in contrast, argue for standard Chevron deference on statutory interpretation, and the likewise familiar \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard for review of agency actions under the Clean Air Act. With respect to Chevron deference, EPA expands on its argument within its defense of including generation-shifting within its selected \"best system\":", "[T]he familiar two-step Chevron standard \u2026 fully applies to the interpretation of ambiguity that concerns the scope of an agency's regulatory authority. ", "Petitioners, citing King v. Burwell , claim that Chevron does not apply. They are wrong. The CAA clearly delegates to EPA authority to fill gaps in the Act concerning the appropriate amount of pollution reduction that should be obtained from long-regulated major pollution sources.... Unlike Burwell , this case involves EPA's construction of a statute that it has long administered and of provisions that go to the core of EPA's mission to protect public health and welfare.

Under Petitioners' view, ambiguity in such cases must necessarily be resolved against the implementing agency's exercise of its regulatory authority \u2026. But UARG does not nullify Chevron . UARG simply reflected one application of Chevron to particular facts, which are readily distinguishable from those here.\u2026", "A number of EPA's supporting intervenors and amici share the agency's emphasis on deference and \"normal administrative law principles.\"", "During the oral argument, the judges questioned whether the court should apply a heightened standard of review beyond the traditional Chevron deference, citing UARG as an example where the Supreme Court ruled that \"[w]e expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast 'economic and political significance.'\" The judges raised the \"major questions\" doctrine, citing King v. Bur w ell , in questioning if the CPP was of such \"deep 'economic and political significance'\" that the court should not presume that Congress delegated interpretive authority and defer to the agency's interpretation of CAA Section 111 unless Congress expressly did so. The court spent a significant portion of the oral argument on whether the CPP was \"transformative\" in terms of the Rule's impact on the power sector or the method in which EPA has chosen to regulate GHG emissions from power plants.

They say that Section 111 precludes generation-shifting from one type of electric generating unit to another, and does not authorize what they characterize as a reorganization of the nation's electric grid or states' energy economies. Petitioners also maintain that EPA \"cannot require States to adopt as a 'standard of performance' reduction obligations that can be met only through non -performance by regulated sources,\" saying the CPP \"does not involve a source improving its emissions performance when it generates, but instead consists of plants reducing or ceasing work, or nonperformance, as their production is 'shifted' to EPA-preferred facilities.\" During oral argument, the petitioners argued that power plants would be \"subsidizing their competition\" because the CPP effectively forces them to buy emission credits from renewable energy providers to meet their emission limits. In their view, EPA has \"confuse[d] 'standards of performance' with other [air quality based] programs\" in the CAA, such as the NAAQS or acid rain cap-and-trade program. This view is expanded on by various amici curiae, including the Members of Congress supporting the petitioners.", "EPA wrote in the preamble to the final CPP that \"the phrase 'system of emission reduction' \u2026 is capacious enough to include actions taken by the owner/operator of a stationary source designed to reduce emissions from that affected source, including actions that may occur off-site and actions that a third party takes pursuant to a commercial relationship with the owner/operator.\" In its brief, EPA states that \"[t]he plain meaning of the word 'system' is expansive,\" that \"statutory context makes clear that the word 'performance' refers to emissions performance, not production performance,\" and that the agency appropriately applied contextual constraints on BSER by, among other factors, limiting the CPP to actions taken by sources that result in emission reductions from sources. Altogether, EPA says, petitioners \"posit limitations on EPA's discretion that are not compelled by the statute, and would frustrate the statutory objective to protect public health and welfare.\" Several of EPA's supporting intervenors and amici curiae generally agree; for example, intervenor power companies state that \"[e]lectricity providers have been shifting generation among affected units and to zero-emitting sources as a means of achieving emission reductions for decades, as these strategies achieve greater reductions at lower cost than by relying on control technology alone.\" ", "Part of the oral argument focused on the definition of \"system\" with respect to BSER.

To understand the dispute, it is useful to briefly review the history of the subsection and its cross-reference to the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) program under CAA Section 112. ", "Prior to the CAA Amendments of 1990, Section 111(d) required EPA to prescribe regulations for states to submit plans establishing and implementing standards of performance for any existing source, for any air pollutant meeting two requirements: (1) the air pollutant must be one \"for which air quality criteria have not been issued or which is not included on a list published under section [1]08(a) or [1]12(b)(1)(A) of this title,\" and (2) the air pollutant must be one to which a Section 111(b) NSPS would apply if such existing source were a new source. At that time, Section 112(b)(1)(A) described a process for listing HAPs. (Section 108(a) describes a process for listing \"criteria\" air pollutants; this cross-reference has not changed, nor has the second requirement.) Thus, for any air pollutant to which a Section 111(b) NSPS applied for new sources, EPA had to regulate the same pollutant under Section 111(d) for existing sources unless that air pollutant was already listed under the NAAQS or HAP programs. ", "In 1990, Congress made substantial amendments to CAA Section 112; among other changes, it replaced the former HAP listing process with a list of nearly 200 HAP, now contained in Section 112(b). In doing so, it made Section 111(d)'s cross-reference to Section 112(b)(1)(A) obsolete, as there was no longer an (A). Both the House and the Senate offered amendments to the cross-reference\u2014 both of which were included in the final legislation that was passed, signed into law by President Bush, and included in the Statutes at Large . Under the House-originated provision, the Section 111(d) authority applies for any air pollutant that \"is not included on a list published under section [1]08(a) of this title or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section [1]12 of this title.... \" The House-originated amendment was added to the U.S. Code by the House Office of the Law Revision Counsel. The Senate-originated 1990 amendment to CAA Section 111(d)(1)(A) simply excludes from Section 111(d) regulation any air pollutant \"included on a list published under section [1]08(a) or [1]12(b).... \" It is not in the U.S. Code .", "Because power plants are a source category which is regulated under Section 112 for mercury and other HAP, petitioners and their supporters argue that EPA is barred from regulating power plants under Section 111(d) for CO 2 in any manner. Petitioners claim that EPA itself has previously given the U.S. Code text its \"literal\" meaning, and that \"EPA's attempts to escape the literal reading of the exclusion are unavailing.\" In particular, they dispute EPA's \"new assertions of ambiguity\" and any reliance on the Senate-originated amendment, which they describe as an \"erroneous 'conforming amendment.'\" Petitioners also cite a footnote in the 2011 Supreme Court case AEP v. Connecticut , which said that \"EPA may not employ [section 111(d)] if existing stationary sources of the pollutant in question are regulated under \u2026 \u00a7\u00a0[1]12.\" Members of Congress who submitted an amicus curiae brief against the CPP further discuss the Section 112 exclusion and its legislative history, as did petitioners' intervenors, who further argue that EPA's interpretation violates constitutional principles of separation of powers.", "EPA generally counters that it \"reasonably interpreted\" Section 111(d) and its exclusion language, \"which is ambiguous in several respects[,] consistent with the Act's purpose, the statutory context, and the legislative history,\" as well as its own past rulemakings. The Agency states, among other things, that \"Petitioners' interpretation of Section 111(d)\u2014which would strip that provision of nearly all effect\u2014is not reasonable, let alone mandatory,\" and that \"when construing [the House-originated amendment] in a particular statutory context, one must take a 'commonsense' approach, and ask not only 'who' is regulated under Section 112 (i.e., source categories including power plants), but also 'what.'\" Essentially, EPA interprets Section 111(d)(1)(A) to exclude from Section 111(d) regulation any HAP emitted from a source category regulated under Section 112; otherwise, it says, EPA would have to choose between regulating HAP or Section 111 air pollutants, leaving a \"gap\" and allowing the \"unregulated emission of pollutants not listed as 'hazardous' or 'criteria,' but nonetheless dangerous to public health or welfare.\" In addition, EPA argues that it \"properly considered\" the Senate-originated amendment as a \"clear indication of congressional intent when interpreting Section 111(d),\" stating that \"[i]t is black-letter law that the U.S. Code cannot prevail over the Statutes at Large when the two are inconsistent.\" EPA's supporters also weighed in on the Section 112 exclusion issue, including the current and former Members of Congress who filed an amici curiae brief supporting the CPP.

They argue that it does so even with the federal implementation plan option: ", "In order to pass constitutional muster, cooperative federalism programs must provide States with a meaningful opportunity to decline implementation. But the Rule does not do so; States that decline to take legislative or regulatory action to ensure increased generation by EPA's preferred power sources face the threat of insufficient electricity to meet demand. The Rule is thus an act of commandeering that leaves States no choice but to alter their laws and programs governing electricity generation and delivery to accord with federal policy.", "However, during the oral argument, some judges questioned whether the CPP was any different from other regulatory programs (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act) that impose certain provisions that require state action to implement.", "Additionally, in arguing that the court should apply a non-deferential \"clear statement\" standard of review, petitioners cite D.C.

To support this argument, petitioners submitted a letter to the court on September 23, 2016 (four days before the oral argument), citing California's proposed state plan to implement the CPP that would limit trading to states that had plans as stringent as California's requirements. They claim that the proposed California plan that limits its carbon trading program may prevent robust trading systems from developing and shows that EPA has not demonstrated that states such as Montana, Kentucky, North Dakota, and West Virginia will be able to meet their reduction goals within their own borders. When petitioners raised the proposed California trading program during the oral argument, the judges noted that California's plan was still in the proposal phase and questioned whether these issues should be deferred until states experience such difficulties during planning and implementation.

EPA: Section 111(b) Litigation", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the direct legal challenge to the CPP rule for CO 2 from existing power plants under CAA Section 111(d), 25 states\u2014led by North Dakota and West Virginia\u2014have filed petitions in the D.C. Circuit challenging EPA's final NSPS rule for CO 2 from new, modified, and reconstructed power plants under CAA Section 111(b), which it calls the \"Carbon Pollution Standards. \" The states have been joined by other petitioners including a labor union, a rural electric cooperatives association, several other fossil-fuel-related companies and utilities, and several industry and trade groups; most of the petitioners overlap with those who also filed challenges to the CPP, although there are somewhat fewer petitioners challenging the NSPS. The petitions have been consolidated under the case caption North Dakota v. EPA . Most of the states and a number of the nonprofit organizations that intervened in support of EPA in the CPP case also intervened in the NSPS challenge in support of EPA. ", "In the Section 111(b) litigation, one of the primary issues is EPA's establishment of standards of performance based on technologies including carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS). Natural gas plants and modified coal plants can reach the final NSPSs with efficient generation technology, but new coal plants would need to implement partial CCS. Critics of the NSPSs for power plants say, for example, that CCS technology is not yet commercially available nor fully technically feasible, and therefore that it is not \"adequately demonstrated\" or the \"best system\" under Section 111(b). They also argue that EPA improperly relied on separate demonstrations of individual components of the technology, and that the NSPSs are otherwise arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, contrary to law, or unconstitutional. EPA, in the Section 111(b) final rule's preamble, argued that its Carbon Pollution Standards were reasonable and lawful. EPA provided rationales for basing the standard for new coal plants on partial CCS: It explained technical configurations and operational flexibilities that may be available; worked through its analyses of feasibility, cost, and other criteria; and discussed \"alternative compliance options that new source project developers can elect to use, instead of \u2026 partial CCS, to meet the final standard of performance.\"", "In addition to the D.C. Circuit litigation, petitions were filed before EPA seeking administrative reconsideration of the NSPS rule; EPA denied the petitions in May 2016. The D.C. Circuit suspended the briefing schedule in the North Dakota v. EPA case in June 2016 to allow the court to consolidate new lawsuits filed challenging EPA's denial of the petitions. On August 30, 2016, the court issued a revised briefing schedule to begin on October 13, 2016, with opening briefs and conclude by February 6, 2017. The court has scheduled oral arguments for April 17, 2017.", "As noted above, the finalization of NSPSs for new air pollutant sources under Section 111(b) of the CAA is a prerequisite for the use of authority under Section 111(d) to regulate existing sources, so this litigation could threaten EPA's basis for the CPP. Thus, regardless of the outcome of West Virginia v. EPA , the litigation in North Dakota v. EPA potentially could impact the CPP as well."], "subsections": []}]}}
