Its advantages include its ability to be a continuous, or baseload, power source that releases minimal air pollutants during power generation relative to fossil fuels. Some of its disadvantages, depending on the type of hydropower plant, include high initial capital costs, ecosystem disruption, and reduced generation during low water years and seasons.", "Hydropower project ownership can be categorized as federal or nonfederal. The bulk of federal projects are owned and managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These projects are typically authorized and funded by Congress. Nonfederal projects are licensed and overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).", "Considered by many to be an established and renewable energy source, hydropower is not always discussed alongside clean or other renewable energy sources in the ongoing energy debate due to its potential environmental impacts. However, hydropower proponents argue that hydropower is cleaner than some conventional energy sources, and point to recent findings that additional hydropower capacity could help the United States reach proposed energy, economic, and environmental goals. Others argue that the expansion of hydropower in the form of numerous small hydropower projects could have environmental impacts and regulatory issues similar to those of existing large projects.", "The 114th Congress may face several issues as it considers how hydropower fits into a changing energy and economic landscape. For example, existing large hydropower infrastructure is aging; many of the nation's hydropower generators and dams are more than 30 years old. Proposed options to address these concerns include increasing federal funding, utilizing alternative financing and/or customer investments, and privatizing federally owned dams, among other options. Additionally, whether to significantly expand hydropower (either through new or more efficient federal hydropower generation or through federal incentives to encourage expansion or efficiency gains of nonfederal hydropower) may require congressional input due to the role of the federal government in hydropower development and permitting. Another issue receiving attention is the rate at which FERC issues licenses for nonfederal projects, which some find slower than ideal. Others defend the licensing process due to the environmental and other statutes with which agencies must comply.", "Legislation related to hydropower development was enacted in the 113th Congress, including P.L. 113-23 and P.L. 113-24. P.L. 113-23, the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013, grants small hydropower projects with a capacity of 10 megawatts or less an exemption from FERC licensing requirements, promotes conduit hydropower projects, and requires FERC to examine the feasibility of a two-year licensing process to promote hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed-loop pumped storage projects, among other things. P.L. 113-24, the Bureau of Reclamation Small Conduit Hydropower Development and Rural Jobs Act, authorizes nonfederal hydropower development at all Reclamation projects, provides for the preference of existing project sponsors in developing this power, and makes Reclamation the lead agency in implementing this authority. Other legislation related to hydropower enacted in the 113th Congress included the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121), part of which expedites the approval and development of nonfederal Corps hydropower projects and orders a report on the status and funding of nonfederal hydropower projects as well as a study on the implications of issuing federally tax-exempt bonds from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to hydropower facilities. Additionally, P.L. 113-76, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, provided new funding to the Department of Energy (DOE) for the expansion of hydropower development at existing dams, as authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Conventional hydropower accounted for more than 6% (258,749 gigawatt hours) of total net U.S. electricity generation in 2014.

Although there is some interest in increasing the current level of hydropower investment, such investment remains limited, in part because of federal and nonfederal financial constraints, high uncertainty in electricity generation policies and markets (which may dissuade capital investment), and the environmental operating requirements required for hydropower projects. Some hydropower proponents are pursuing policies to reduce what they view as impediments to hydropower development. Other stakeholders prefer that hydropower investments only proceed when they are protective of other interests, including other water users and the aquatic environment and its species.", "At issue for the 114 th Congress is whether, and if so how, to change federal support for hydropower and what priority to give hydropower vis-\u00e0-vis other energy investments, and social and environmental concerns. These issues are ongoing and are shaped by the introduction and consideration of hydropower-related bills from past Congresses. For example, more than 25 bills dealing with various aspects of hydropower were introduced in the 112 th Congress, a quarter of which were state- or site-specific legislation. And more than 30 hydropower-related bills were introduced in the 113 th Congress. For example, Congress passed P.L. 113-20 (Bonneville Unit Clean Hydropower Facilitation Act), P.L. 113-23 (Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013) P.L. 113-24 (Bureau of Reclamation Small Conduit Hydropower Development and Rural Jobs Act), and P.L. 113-121 (Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014).

Many have pointed out advantages and drawbacks of conventional hydropower. Cited advantages include its possible renewable energy status, zero to minimal greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and high operational efficiency. Supporters also note its ability to generally serve as a reliable and flexible domestic energy source. Generally speaking, hydropower generation can be dispatched on relatively short notice, and can supplement shortfalls in generation. However, others note that conventional large hydropower has relatively high initial capital costs, can be detrimental to surrounding ecosystems (e.g., fish and wildlife), may not be reliable during low water years and seasons, and may disrupt recreational or scenic values.", "The legislative environment for hydropower can be complicated. Whether the hydropower project investor is a federal or nonfederal entity dictates which laws apply and thus may affect which committees are involved in oversight or changes to such laws. Several federal government agencies own and operate large hydropower projects, while other agencies administer the process by which nonfederal hydropower projects are built, maintained, and operated. Large federal hydropower projects are managed primarily by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The power from these projects is generally marketed by the Department of Energy's Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs). FERC regulates investigation, construction, and operations of nonfederal hydropower projects as well as overseeing dam safety for nonfederal projects.", "This report explains how the federal government is involved directly in hydropower generation at federal facilities and in the regulation of nonfederal hydropower generation; the focus is on current roles and processes and common concerns and questions about changing those roles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Most of U.S. hydropower capacity is from conventional hydropower. Conventional hydropower plants take three general forms: storage (or impoundment), run-of-river (or diversion), and pumped storage. A storage plant uses a dam to store enough water in a reservoir so that, when released, it flows through a penstock to a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity. A run-of-river plant directs a portion of a river through a canal or penstock to generate electricity without the need for a reservoir. A pumped storage facility stores energy and generates electricity by pumping water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir during off-peak hours, releasing the stored water from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir during periods of higher electricity demand.", "Conventional hydropower is a significant contributor to the national electric power portfolio. Hydroelectric facilities produced 6%-9% of U.S. electric generation between 1998 and 2014. When considered a renewable power source, hydropower was the largest contributor to renewable electric power generation in 2014, followed by wind and by wood and wood-derived fuels. The western states produced the most hydropower in 2014, but the top individual hydropower-producing states were Washington, Oregon, and New York. ", "As the West continues to experience drought, hydropower generation may decline. For example, in 2014, hydropower in California (the fourth-largest producer of hydropower among the states) contributed half (10%) of its average generation (20%) to California's energy portfolio. Generally, reductions in hydroelectric generation are addressed by increasing the use of natural gas, which some argue is more expensive and produces more greenhouse gas emissions than hydropower. Facilities in western states, such as the Hoover Dam, are producing significantly less power than average due to drought conditions. ", "There is an ongoing debate about whether hydropower should be characterized as \"renewable.\" It has historically been characterized as renewable because it is a replenishable resource. More recently, others have asserted that it is not renewable because of its size (e.g., in the case of large-scale projects) and environmental impact, particularly on ecosystems, and in some cases induced evaporation (particularly at reservoirs at low elevations in dry climates) and greenhouse gas emissions during construction. However, for purposes of this report, hydropower is discussed as renewable because it does not originate from a fossil fuel (i.e., its source is not finite).", "The precise number of hydropower projects in the United States is unknown. Different databases yield different results based on selected criteria. As of 2015, 90 nonfederal hydropower projects are licensed to operate at Corps dams and 28 are licensed to operate at Bureau of Reclamation sites. ", "The public sector (federal, states, cooperatives, and municipalities) owns the majority of hydropower capacity because it owns mostly large (>30 megawatt [MW]) hydropower plants (see Figure 1 ). The private sector (e.g., private utility, private nonutility, and industrial entities) owns the majority of hydropower projects, and many are small hydro (1 MW-30 MW) and low-power (< 1 MW) plants (see Figure 2 ). Small hydro and low-power plants make up of 83% of total plants but constitute approximately 10% of total hydropower production capacity in the United States. In contrast, large hydropower plants are responsible for approximately 90% of total hydropower capacity though they make up 16% of total plants.", "Without considering economics, current hydropower capacity represents a fraction of U.S. hydropower resources that technically could be developed at non-powered dams in addition to accessing new stream-reaches. The National Inventory of Dams identifies that of the more than 80,000 dams in the United States, 2.5% are used for hydropower. According to a 2012 Department of Energy (DOE) study, there are more than 54,000 non-powered dams with a total potential capacity of 12 GW, which would increase hydropower capacity by 15% (See Figure 3 ). The majority of this capacity (8 GW) is concentrated at 100 non-powered dams, 81 of which are operated by the Corps. ", "Some have argued that many of the monetary costs and environmental impacts of construction already have occurred at non-powered dams, so using non-powered dams for hydropower is an option for increasing the U.S. renewable energy portfolio.

Today, the Corps owns and operates 353 units at 75 projects, with a total estimated capacity of 22.9 GW, or approximately one-fourth of all national hydropower capacity.

In 2014, the average age of Corps hydropower facilities was 49 years, and approximately 40% of the Corps hydro fleet was 50 years old or older. Hydroelectric generation is highly variable and depends on a number of factors. In the past, some have raised concerns that generation at Corps facilities may be declining due to aging infrastructure. However, the exact effects of aging infrastructure on Corps facilities has not been documented on a nationwide basis and thus remains uncertain. Relative to national generation totals, the Corps contribution to total hydropower generation has remained steady since 2008 at approximately 24%.", "In addition to overall declining generation, the delivery of Corps hydroelectric power is also an issue connected to aging infrastructure. That is, unit availability is down because of maintenance and repairs. According to the Corps, many of its hydropower assets have fallen below the generally accepted hydropower industry goal of 95% unit availability. Unit availability at Corps dams has fallen to the point where no Corps division is meeting the 95% target, while at the same time, the total hours of \"forced outages\" have grown.", "Concerns related to aging infrastructure have resulted in internal reviews of the Corps hydropower program and recommendations for ways to improve Corps hydropower operations. Under its Hydropower Modernization Initiative (HMI), the Corps has reviewed facilities requiring rehabilitation that would produce the greatest returns on investment, reliability, and safety. In the first phase of the HMI, the Corps concluded that modernization of six \"critical needs\" projects could produce 341 GWH in additional electricity per year, or an average increase in production of approximately 8% per plant. The cost for these upgrades would have been approximately $600 million. The second phase of the HMI looked at facilities outside the Federal Columbia River Power System (i.e., projects not eligible for funding by the Bonneville Power Administration, or BPA) and concluded that if the Corps took no action to modernize the 54 units not financed by BPA, it would forego potential revenues of approximately $7 billion over a 20 year horizon.

Some of the options commonly mentioned include", "Increase federal funding for hydropower upgrades and/or modernization initiatives within annual appropriations processes . This option would maintain the status quo practice of funding hydropower upgrades within existing discretionary budget allocations, albeit at increased levels or over a different timetable. Some point out that increased funding in annual appropriations is unrealistic in the current budgetary climate. Use alternative funding mechanisms to finance hydropower upgrades . Some have proposed alternative funding mechanisms that fall outside of the regular appropriations process, such as an infrastructure bank or some form of private sector contracting vehicle (such as Energy Savings Performance Contracts, or ESPCs). Advocates argue that these funding mechanisms could increase hydropower production without requiring annual appropriations. However, using these alternative programs to fund federal projects typically entails \"up-front\" budgetary costs, especially if they entail federal backing (e.g., loan guarantees) or otherwise commit future federal outlays. Increase rates to re-coup \"full\" costs of operations and maintenance (including major upgrades) and/or institute new user charges to pay for upgrades. Some argue that rates charged by the PMAs should be increased to recover the costs for major infrastructure upgrades. Congress could alter existing law to allow for these increased rates. However, any practice that results in increased rates for PMA customers may be viewed negatively by customers and some Members of Congress. Privatize federally owned dams through divestiture of assets. One option sometimes raised is the potential to privatize federally owned hydropower assets, thereby relieving the federal government of its operation and maintenance responsibilities and putting these dams in the hands of other interests, who might better afford to invest in facility upgrades that would increase generation. However, private entities might also increase electricity rates to achieve greater revenues and repay investments in these projects. Allow customers to commit future power revenues to pay for upgrades to federal facilities. Some would prefer that those entities that benefit from federal hydropower upgrades be allowed to directly finance these upgrades by redirecting funds that would otherwise flow to the Treasury for these projects. Some PMAs, including BPA, already have some form of this authority, and some advocate for extending it to the other PMAs.

Federal facilities are often operated based on procedures set out in operating manuals, which are commonly put together based on past trends and the assumption of \"stationarity\" (i.e., the idea that future hydrologic trends will be similar to past time periods). Revising these estimates can be difficult, and much uncertainty still exists in the process. Alterations to federal operations are further complicated by existing requirements to meet multiple competing goals in the face of uncertain water conditions. Some stakeholders have questioned whether federal agencies will require greater flexibility in operating existing reservoirs if climate conditions result in changes to weather patterns, less predictability, and more extreme events. In 2009, the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, issued an order stating that the department (which has purview over the Bureau of Reclamation) would consider and analyze climate change impacts when undertaking long range planning exercises, but to date the effect of the order on hydropower operations at specific facilities remains unclear.
