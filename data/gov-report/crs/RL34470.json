Colombia accounts for a very small percentage of U.S. trade (approximately 1%), ranking 22nd among U.S. export markets and 27th among foreign exporters to the United States in 2017. Because the FTA has been in effect for only five and a half years, the economic effects of the agreement are not yet clear. Some economic studies estimated that, upon full implementation, the impact on the United States would likely be positive but very small due to the small size of the Colombian economy.", "The congressional debate surrounding the US-Colombia FTA mostly centered on violence, labor, and human rights issues in Colombia. Numerous Members of Congress opposed passage of the agreement because of concerns about alleged targeted violence against union members in Colombia, inadequate efforts to bring perpetrators to justice, and weak protection of worker rights. However, other Members of Congress supported the FTA and took issue with these charges, stating that Colombia had made great progress over the last 10 years to curb violence and enhance security. They also argued that U.S. exporters were losing market share of the Colombian market and that the agreement would further open the Colombian market for U.S. goods and services.", "To address the concerns related to labor rights and violence in Colombia, the United States and Colombia agreed upon an \"Action Plan Related to Labor Rights\" that included specific and concrete steps to be taken by the Colombian government with specific timelines.

The Colombian government submitted documents to the United States in time to meet various target dates listed in the Action Plan.", "The U.S. business community generally supports the FTA with Colombia because it contends that FTAs help increase U.S. exports. At the time of the debate, U.S. exporters urged policymakers to move forward with the agreement, arguing that the United States was losing market share of the Colombian market, especially in agriculture, as Colombia entered into FTAs with other countries. Colombia's FTA with Canada, which was implemented on August 15, 2011, was of particular concern for U.S. agricultural producers. Critics of the agreement expressed concerns about violence against union members and the lack of protection of worker rights in Colombia, especially in labor cooperatives.

Major findings of the USITC study on the likely effects of a U.S.-Colombia FTA on the U.S. economy, should the agreement be fully implemented, include the following: ", "U.S. exports to Colombia would increase by $1.1 billion (13.7%) and U.S. imports from Colombia would increase by $487 million (5.5%). U.S. GDP would increase by over $2.5 billion (less than 0.05%). The largest estimated increases in U.S. exports to Colombia, by value, would be in chemical, rubber, and plastic products; machinery and equipment; and motor vehicles and parts. In terms of percentage increases, the largest increases in U.S. exports would be in rice and dairy products. The largest estimated increases in U.S. imports from Colombia, by value, would be in sugar and crops not elsewhere classified. The largest estimated increases in U.S. imports, by percent, would be in dairy products and sugar. On an industry level, the FTA would result in minimal to no effect on output or employment for most sectors of the U.S. economy. The U.S. sugar sector would be the only sector with an estimated decline of more than 0.1% in output or employment. The largest increases in U.S. output and employment would be in the processed rice, cereal grains, and wheat sectors.

One study found that U.S. exports to Colombia would increase by 2.4% to 8.3%, while another study assessed that the expected increase would be 44%. Two studies found that the largest increases in U.S. exports would be in agriculture products, metal and wood, and food products. In assessing the impact on U.S. imports from Colombia, the results of the studies also varied. One study found that U.S. imports from Colombia would increase by 2.0% to 6.2%, while another found that U.S. imports would increase by 37%. The largest increases would be in apparel and leather goods, textile products, and metal and wood. The studies also assessed that an FTA would result in small overall welfare gains for both the United States and Colombia and a positive impact on the U.S. agricultural sector despite an increase in U.S. sugar imports.", "The nongovernmental Institute for International Economics (IIE) did a study in 2006 assessing the possible impact of a U.S.-Colombia FTA on both the U.S. and Colombian economies. The study found that a U.S.-Colombia FTA would be expected to result in an increase in total trade between the two countries. The total value of U.S. imports from Colombia would increase by an estimated 37% while the value of U.S. exports to Colombia would increase by an estimated 44%. In terms of welfare gains, the study assessed that a U.S.-Colombia FTA would result in small welfare benefits for both partners, though the gains would be larger for Colombia. On a sectoral level, the study found that an agreement would have minor sectoral effects on the U.S. economy, but the effect would be more significant for Colombia because it is the smaller partner. The study indicated that Colombia would face certain structural adjustment issues with a displacement of low-skilled workers in some sectors, but that these workers would all be able to find job possibilities in the expanding sectors. ", "One of the drawbacks to the bilateral free trade agreement is that it may result in trade diversion because it is not fully inclusive of all regional trading partners. Trade diversion results when a country enters into an FTA and then shifts the purchase of goods or services (imports) from a country that is not an FTA partner to a country that is an FTA partner even though it may be a higher cost producer. In the case of the United States and Colombia, for example, goods from the United States may replace Colombia's lower-priced imports from other countries in Latin America. If this were to happen, the United States would now be the producer of that item, not because it produces the good more efficiently, but because it is receiving preferential access to the Colombian market. The IIE study assessed that a U.S.-Colombia FTA probably would not cause trade diversion in the United States, but that it could cause some trade diversion in Colombia.

U.S. imports of meat from Colombia would eventually increase, but those are currently restricted by Colombia's lack of certification to export fresh, chilled, or frozen beef or pork to the United States. Colombia's elimination of trade barriers and certain government support measures under a U.S.-Colombia FTA would likely result in increased U.S. grain exports to Colombia.

U.S. agricultural exports would gain a small but not insignificant preference in the Colombian market for temperate-zone agricultural produce. The study's authors state that the long time periods for phasing out tariffs for sensitive products and safeguard provisions that would replace Colombia's price band system would lessen the impact of increased imports from the United States.

Colombia was excluded from the 2015, 2016, and 2017 lists of member states invited to appear for the annual International Labor Conference's Committee on the Application of Standards, indicating the progress Colombia has made in applying international labor standards. Exclusion from the list means that Colombia is considered as a case of progress in the observation of labor rights and labor inspection. Colombia was included in the 2014 list, however. The 2017 announcement took place in the framework of the 106 th International Labor Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, in June 2017, which addressed labor migration governance, fair labor recruitment, and the promotion of decent work for people in conflict zones or disaster areas. Colombia continues to work with the ILO to promote job creation. On June 6, 2015, the Colombian government and the International Labor Organization (ILO) signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a framework for cooperation on job creation in rural areas. The ILO Director Guy Rider emphasized the importance of such cooperation to create jobs in the formal sector of the Colombian economy and move away from informality.", "Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about implementation of the Labor Action Plan. An October 2013 congressional staff report to the Congressional Monitoring Group on Labor Rights in Colombia acknowledged that the Colombian government had undertaken important measures to protect worker rights and was working at the highest levels of government to implement the plan and improve working conditions in Colombia. The report, however, stated that, despite the \"best intentions\" by the Colombian government, the actions had not resulted in improved conditions for workers and activists in Colombia. The report's findings include the following: (1) indirect employment is still pervasive and growing; (2) the inspection system is ineffective, and worker protections are weak; and (3) the right to organize is being denied, and a lack of justice prevails. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indirect Employment Arrangements", "paragraphs": ["Prior to approval of the U.S.-Colombia FTA, labor groups raised concerns regarding the widespread practice of indirect employment relationships in Colombia such as labor cooperatives. Colombian cooperatives are work arrangements mostly found in the sugar cane, palm oil, flower, mining, and port industries. Critics of the programs\u00a0contend that these indirect employment relationships lead to a lack of protection of worker rights, wages below the minimum wage, and lower health and pension benefits. The Colombian government established such work arrangements years ago to help generate employment, but later recognized these pacts could lead to an erosion of worker rights. Subsequently, it undertook a series of reforms since 2004. A key law was passed by Colombia's Congress on December 12, 2010. Article 63 of Ley 1429 , a law for formalizing the labor force and generating employment, has new and stronger measures to help ensure that worker rights are not being violated and to impose sanctions on businesses that are violating Colombian laws. The major changes in this law are increased sanctions on companies for violations of the law from about $25,000 to $1.5 million; accountability for inspectors if they do not enforce the law; and enhanced bargaining rights for workers belonging to a cooperative. The law was to have a transition period and not enter into effect until July 2013. However, in an agreement with the United States under the Action Plan Related to Labor Rights, the Colombian government agreed to accelerate implementation of the law to June 2011. ", "Critics of the cooperative work arrangements contend that the arrangements lead to worker oppression, prevent workers from joining unions, and result in a denial of basic benefits. Critics also contend that certain marginalized groups, especially the Afro-Colombian population, are particularly vulnerable to unfair treatment. Colombian labor representatives urged Congress to delay passage of the FTA until Colombia improved its labor laws. Labor groups contend that indirect employment relationships in Colombia persist, even after implementation of the Action Plan, preventing workers from exercising their rights to free association and collective bargaining.", "According to the Colombian government, cooperatives are required by law to provide health benefits, worker rights protections, and pension benefits, but they have had numerous cases of non-compliance with the law. The government contends that it has increased inspections and imposed sanctions for non-compliance. For example, according to government documents, between 2007 and January 2011, inspectors made 4,787 visits to work areas, conducted 4,052 investigations, and imposed sanctions 816 times. As a result, the number of workers participating in cooperatives reportedly decreased from 2 million in 2007 to 600,000 in 2010, and the number of cooperatives reportedly decreased from 12,317 to 4,555 between 2007 and 2010. ", "The government also contends that in 2012 and 2013, thousands of Colombian workers have benefitted from \"formalization agreements\" between employers and workers as a direct result from the Labor Action Plan. A 2013 Colombian government document states that numerous employers in the transportation, sugar cane, palm tourism, health, and other sectors reached agreement with their workers in which 15,700 workers moved from indirect working arrangements to permanent direct employment.

According to progress reports issued by the embassy, government reforms in Colombia since 2002 helped protect Colombian worker rights to form unions, bargain collectively, and strike. Reforms include enhanced efforts to open dialogue with union members, including meetings with Colombia's President and Vice-President. A September 2011 report provided indicated that homicides dropped by 45% since 2000 and homicides of union members decreased 81% during the same period. Another report stated that a protection program aimed at vulnerable groups, including union members, and the creation of the special unit at the Prosecutor General's Office led to an 86% reduction in the level of homicides of union members. ", "Regarding allegations that Colombia is the world's most dangerous country for union members, the Colombian government contends that because other countries use different methods for tracking this data, it cannot be compared among countries. The government argues that union membership in certain professions in Colombia is almost universal, including teachers and judicial branch employees. Government representatives have stated that many of victims of violence are union members, but that does not necessarily mean that they were targeted because of their union activities.

A report commemorating the occasion by the Obama Administration stated that Colombia had made \"meaningful\" progress since the plan's inception. Major achievements, according to the report, include reductions in the number of fake worker cooperatives and a doubling of labor inspectors within the Colombian Ministry of Labor. The report also listed certain issues that require attention going forward. According to the text, other forms of illegal subcontracting have started to replace worker cooperatives, threatening the improvements made over the past five years. Similarly, the report found that the government has been slow to address the culture of impunity that surrounds labor law violations and that the government has not been effective in collecting fines levied against employers.", "The Obama Administration continued to work closely with Colombia on issues of ongoing concern and devoted resources to address these matters. The Department of Labor sent a labor attach\u00e9 to be stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. Colombia is the second country to which DOL has sent an attach\u00e9, which highlights the importance placed on worker rights in Colombia.

The group alleged that the Colombian Government had failed to comply with the terms described in the labor chapter of the U.S.-Colombia FTA. Those alleged failures, according to the complaint, were especially damaging, as they helped undermine the fundamental labor rights of Colombian workers, particularly their rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. The group provided examples from the petroleum and sugar sectors to illustrate specific shortcomings.", "The OTLA investigated the group's claims and published its findings on January 11, 2017. It wrote that the Colombian government, despite making progress in certain aspects of the labor question, was marred by inconsistencies that endangered recent advances in labor rights. The OTLA specifically highlighted problems with the Labor Inspectorate, the inspection process, and the process for collecting fines. The OTLA also stated that Colombia's \"high rate of impunity\" in cases of violence against unionists, its unlawful collective labor pacts, and pervasive subcontracting practices were major obstacles for worker rights in the country. ", "The OTLA included a list of 19 recommendations in its investigation report to help the Government of Colombia address its labor rights issues. These included, among other things, strengthening the Ministry of Labor's labor inspection system; investigating and prosecuting cases of violence against unionists more thoroughly; and combating abusive subcontracting practices and collective pact agreements. The OTLA also encouraged the Secretary of Labor of the United States to \"initiate consultations\" with the Government of Colombia and indicated it would seek to involve relevant members of civil society in the consultation process. OTLA stated it would reevaluate the government's progress \"within nine months and thereafter, as appropriate.\"", "In January 2018, OTLA published an assessment of the actions taken by Colombia in response to the recommendations included in the January 2017 report. According to the assessment, Colombia has \"taken several steps\" toward satisfying some of the recommendations found in the 2017 report. The Ministry of Labor, for example, mandated the installation and use of an electronic case management system in all regional offices and two special administrative offices. It also took steps to address high turnover rates within the inspectorate body by converting close to 90 percent of its existing inspector positions into career civil servant positions.", "The OTLA assessment also noted other changes that, if fully implemented, would contribute to addressing the issues and questions raised in the 2017 report. Some of these include remedial training for ministry employees, and a larger budget appropriation from the Colombian Congress for 2018. Despite some positive signs, however, the OTLA warns that not all listed recommendations have received full attention.
