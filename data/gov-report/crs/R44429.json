This report provides information on the landscape of federal laws and regulatory agencies directly regulating or establishing standards for financial services cybersecurity. Because each of the applicable federal laws contains specific implementation provisions, there are varying degrees and methods of regulatory oversight of cybersecurity in the financial sector. Some laws distribute authority to issue regulations and take enforcement actions among a number of agencies; others require one agency to issue implementing regulations and distribute enforcement authority among several agencies; and finally, some laws delegate all authority for issuing regulations and administrative enforcement to a single agency. ", "Some agencies have authority to issue notice and comment rules; others have authority to impose requirements on the institutions that they regulate by guidance that has the same legal force as notice and comment rulemaking. The federal bank supervisory agencies, which have broad general authority to issue regulations, also issue any number of types of guidance documents under a variety of names such as policy statements, supervision and regulatory (SR) letters, financial institution letters (FIL), letters, bulletins, and other forms of communication. Many of the regulators issue informal guidance and bring adjudicatory enforcement actions on a case-by-case basis that often are interpreted as precedential signals to the regulated community as to how the agency interprets aspects of its regulatory authority.

Cybersecurity is a critical component of protecting the vital services to the economy provided by the financial sector. Maintaining the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the data held by financial institutions is critical to sustaining the level of trust which allows businesses and consumers to rely on the financial services industry to supply services on which they depend. In recognition of the importance of the information systems that support financial services, regulators have increasingly devoted attention to cybersecurity concerns by issuing regulations and various forms of guidance. ", "As discussed herein, the federal government's oversight of the financial sector includes cybersecurity and involves at least four separate types of oversight and specific encouragement of voluntary cooperation. ", "Depository institutions are subjected to comprehensive prudential regulation and supervision for safety and soundness. The federal securities regulators, who administer a regime that mandates disclosure of material information by publicly traded companies, oversee the major components of the securities industry by means of a system of self-regulation. This consists of an array of SROs, such as the national securities exchanges and securities associations registered with the SEC. Some federal agencies are charged with specific aspects of consumer protections that apply to products of the financial services industry. Some federal laws, which apply broadly, require financial institutions to safeguard information. Both Congress, with the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, and the executive branch, pursuant to a series of executive orders, are encouraging voluntary cooperation among owners and operators of critical infrastructure, including financial services providers, to implement cybersecurity practices and procedures best suited to safeguard the information that they hold which is critical to U.S. national security.
