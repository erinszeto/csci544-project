The scope ofthe proposed bulletin was very broad, covering virtually all agencies and defining regulatoryinformation as \"any scientific or technical study that ... might be used by local, state, regional, federaland/or international regulatory bodies.\" Such information would be subject to peer review if theagency could determine that it could have a \"clear and substantial impact on important publicpolicies or important private sector decisions\" when disseminated. The proposed bulletin placedadditional peer review requirements on \"especially significant regulatory information,\" and saidagencies were required to notify OMB in advance of any studies that might require peer review andhow any such reviews would be conducted.", "The proposed bulletin aroused controversy, with some observers expressing concern that itcould create a centralized peer review system within OMB that would be vulnerable to politicalmanipulation or control by regulated entities. OMB received nearly 200 comments on the proposal,and published a \"substantially revised\" peer review bulletin in April 2004 that was broader in scopethan the proposed bulletin in that it applied to \"influential scientific information\" (which includes,but is not limited to, regulatory information) and \"highly influential scientific assessments.\" However, agencies were given substantial discretion to decide whether information is \"influential\"and therefore requires a peer review. The revised bulletin also allowed agencies to use the NationalAcademy of Sciences for peer reviews or to use other procedures that had been approved by OMB. It also provided exemptions for certain classes of information, such as information related to nationalsecurity, products by government-funded scientists that are not represented as views of a federalagency, and routine statistical information. However, OMB retained significant authority to decidewhen information is \"highly influential\" (and, therefore, requires more specific peer reviewprocedures) and to approve alternative peer review procedures.", "OMB received more than 50 comments on the revised peer review bulletin, many of whichwere supportive of the changes made to the proposal. However, some commenters believed thechanges did not go far enough, while others believed that OMB had significantly weakened thebulletin. In January 2005, OMB published a final version of the bulletin with what it described as\"minor revisions\" to the version published in April 2004 (e.g., requiring agencies to disclose theidentities of peer reviewers and to prepare an annual report on their peer review activities). Anumber of issues regarding the implementation of the bulletin remain unclear (e.g., how muchdiscretion agencies will be given to decide when and what kind of peer review is required). Thisreport will be updated when any further revisions to the bulletin are published or other significantevents occur."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Peer Review and Regulatory Policy", "paragraphs": ["There is no official, government-wide definition of \"peer review,\" even in the OMBbulletins. (5) Agency-specific definitions and descriptions of the term differ, but all of them contain the basicconcept of a review of scientific or technical merit by individuals with both sufficient technicalcompetence and no unresolved conflicts of interest. In its final bulletin, OMB states that peer review\"typically evaluates the clarity of hypotheses, the validity of research design, the quality of the datacollection procedures, the robustness of the methods employed, the appropriateness of the methodsfor the hypotheses being tested, the extent to which the conclusions follow from the analysis, andthe strengths and limitations of the overall product.\" (6) "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Support for Peer Review", "paragraphs": ["Some type of peer review has been used for centuries within the scientific community tojudge the quality of science. Peer review can take many different forms, and is used for a variety ofpurposes. For example, it is used commonly by federal agencies to evaluate research proposals, andplays a major role in funding decisions. In these cases it is often part of a broader category ofevaluation known as merit review. Peer review is also the usual method by which the editors ofscientific publications evaluate proposed research reports. It even plays an important role in manyresearch institutions, including many government agencies, in decisions about retention andpromotion for individual scientists and in reviewing research programs. A February 1999 reportfrom the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy concluded that expert review (themost common form of which is peer review) is the most effective means of evaluating federallyfunded research programs. (7) ", "Peer review is also used for scientific and technical products relating to policies, includingregulations, to determine whether the underlying scientific findings are well supported. Forexample, such peer review was established as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policy in1993. (8) In 1996, a panelof leading economists concluded that peer review should be used for economic analyses supportingregulations with a potentially large impact on the economy (e.g., those whose annual economic costsexceed $1 billion). (9) Thepanel also indicated that reviewers should be selected based on their demonstrated expertise andreputations.", "In its peer review bulletins, OMB recognized the variety of ways that peer review is used.OMB said that independent peer review is especially important in the regulatory arena becausefederal agencies often develop or fund the science that underlies their regulations, and then overseethe peer review of those scientific studies -- thereby creating the appearance of a conflict of interest. ", "Legislative Proposals. A number of statutes andlegislative proposals have advocated the use of peer review in a regulatory context for particularissues. For example, the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A)) requires EPA, whentaking action under the act based on science, to use the \"best available, peer reviewed science andsupporting studies.\" In the 108th Congress, the Water Resources Development Act of 2003( H.R. 2557 ) would have generally required project studies to be subject to peer reviewby an independent panel of experts if the project has an estimated total cost of more than $50 million. Similarly, the Sound Science for Endangered Species Act Planning Act of 2003 ( H.R. 1662 , 108th Congress) would have directed the Secretary of the Interior, in making decisions aboutspecies protection, to give greater weight to certain kinds of data that had been peer reviewed byqualified individuals as defined in the bill. ", "There have also been legislative efforts to require peer review more broadly. For example,in the 106th Congress, the Senate considered but did not enact bipartisan legislation ( S. 746 ) that would have required virtually all agencies to provide for an independent peer review of anyrequired risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses of major rules that the agencies or the OMBDirector reasonably anticipated were likely to have a $500 million effect on the economy. The billwould have required that peer reviews be conducted through panels that were \"broadlyrepresentative\" and involved participants with relevant expertise who were \"independent of theagency.\" However, if an agency certified that adequate peer review had already been conducted, andthe OMB Director agreed, no further peer review would have been required. In its comments on thislegislation, the General Accounting Office (GAO) (now the Government Accountability Office)generally supported the use of peer review in this context, noting that \"the rigorous, independentreview of economic analyses should help enhance the quality, credibility, and acceptability ofagencies' decisionmaking.\" (10) However, GAO cautioned that (given the number of reviewscontemplated) agencies would need to plan carefully for the reviews, and that the panels would needto reflect all points of view.", "Presidential Support. Recent presidentialadministrations have also supported peer review as a preferred means of assessing scientific research,both prospectively and retrospectively. For example, beginning with the FY1996 budget cycle,OMB and OSTP have jointly provided annual direction to agencies, encouraging them to emphasizethe funding of peer-reviewed research over nonpeer-reviewed research for most scientific activities. In 1997, the then-Administrator of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)testified that the Clinton Administration supported peer review, but also said the administrationrecognized that it is not cost-free in terms of agencies' resources or time. (11) ", "On September 20, 2001, the new OIRA Administrator for the George W. BushAdministration issued a memorandum for the President's Management Council recommending(among other things) that agencies subject regulatory impact analyses and supporting technicaldocuments for \"economically significant\" and \"major\" rules (e.g., those with a $100 million annualeffect on the economy) to independent, external peer review. (12) The OIRA Administratoralso recommended certain criteria for peer review (e.g., disclosure by peer reviewers of priortechnical or policy positions on the issues at hand and their sources of personal and institutionalfunding), and said OIRA would give agency analyses that had undergone such a review \"a measureof deference\" during its reviews of their regulatory proposals under Executive Order 12866. (13) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cautionary Notes About Peer Review", "paragraphs": ["Although the concept of peer review has generally received wide support, some observershave also raised cautionary notes or mentioned certain limitations to the approach in particularsituations. For example, as OMB indicated in its 1997 testimony, peer review costs can besignificant for agencies in terms of both time and agency resources. (14) To pay for peer reviewprocedures, agencies may have to divert resources from other areas (e.g., regulatory enforcement orstandards development). Scientists from academic institutions who perform peer reviews on avoluntary basis may also incur opportunity costs with respect to other activities such as teaching andresearch. Other concerns have focused on how peer reviews have been implemented. For example,GAO noted that peer review methods varied within and among federal agencies, (15) and that agencies'economic analyses of major rules were often not peer reviewed. (16) A number of observershave expressed concerns about the impact of peer review requirements on the pace of regulatoryactivity, with additional requirements exacerbating what is already often regarded as an \"ossified\"rulemaking process. (17) In fact, some critics have suggested that regulatory relief and delay is the primary purpose of peerreview proposals in this context. ", "Still other concerns about peer review have centered on issues of bias and balance. Expertsagree that effective peer review panels must be (and must be perceived to be) free from anysignificant conflict of interest and properly balanced, allowing for a wide range of views andappropriate expertise. However, in June 2001, GAO reported that the policies and proceduresdeveloped by EPA's Science Advisory Board to ensure balance and independence of the Board's peerreviewers had limitations that reduced their effectiveness. (18) For example, GAO said that the staff office did not routinelyensure that panel members' financial disclosures were complete or that they contained enoughinformation to determine whether a conflict of interest existed. Also, panel members reportedly didnot have to disclose information regarding previous positions on the matter being reviewed until thepanel's first meeting, thereby making it difficult to determine the independence and balance of thepanel members until after they had been selected. GAO also reported that the panel's policies andprocedures did not adequately inform the public about the points of view represented on the panels. GAO made several recommendations in this report that were designed to better ensure that theScience Advisory Board's peer review panels are independent and balanced. ", "Procedural Flexibility or Uniformity. As notedpreviously, GAO reported that federal agencies' peer review practices are not consistent. (19) However, several studiesof peer review in the federal government have suggested that rigidly uniform peer review proceduresmay not be desirable. For example, a 1996 National Science and Technology Council reportindicated that peer review implementation should be flexible and \"appropriate to the nature ofscientific processes.\" (20) Similarly, in its 1999 report on peer review, GAO reported that OSTP believed agencies' peer reviewpractices should be \"flexible and tailored to agency missions and type of research, and that specificuniform practices should not be dictated for every agency or all federally funded research.\" (21) GAO also said thatagencies viewed a variety of peer review methods as \"both appropriate and essential, reflecting thevarying nature of the research and its purposes, the differences in research timelines, the broadspectrum of [research and development] performers, and the varying funding mechanisms, such asgrants, contracts, and cooperative agreements.\" Notably, although GAO pointed out that peer reviewpractices varied across and within agencies, it did not recommend greater uniformity in thosepractices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Peer Review and the Information Quality Act", "paragraphs": ["OMB said that the final peer review bulletin was being issued \"under the Information QualityAct [IQA] and OMB's general authorities to oversee the quality of agency information, analyses, andregulatory actions.\" (22) The IQA (also known as the \"Data Quality Act\") was enacted in December 2000 as Section 515 ofthe Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 ( P.L. 106-554 ). Theact supplemented the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), which already required OMB to \"developand oversee the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines to apply to federalagency dissemination of public information.\" (23) The PRA also required agencies to manage their informationresources to \"improve the integrity, quality, and utility of information to all users within and outsidethe agency.\" (24) ", "Although little noticed at the time it was enacted, the IQA has subsequently been the subjectof significant debate and controversy. (25) The act required OMB to issue guidance to federal agenciesdesigned to ensure the \"quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity\" of information disseminated to thepublic. It also required agencies to issue their own information quality guidelines, and to establishadministrative mechanisms that allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintainedand disseminated by the agencies that does not comply with the OMB guidance. However, it did notrequire either OMB or the agencies to issue peer review bulletins. ", "OMB published its final government-wide IQA guidelines in the Federal Register inFebruary 2002. (26) Inthem, OMB encouraged (but did not require) the use of peer reviews in the development ofagency-disseminated information. Specifically, OMB indicated that agencies can presume that dataare sufficiently \"objective\" if they have been subject to an independent peer review process (e.g., asused by scientific journals), but said a member of the public could rebut this presumption \"based ona persuasive showing by the petitioner in a particular instance.\" OMB also indicated that journalpeer review may not be sufficient for information likely to have an important public policy or privatesector impact. Finally, the IQA guidelines set minimum standards for the transparency ofagency-sponsored peer review (referencing the standards in the above-mentioned September 20,2001, memorandum issued by the OIRA Administrator -- e.g., disclosure of reviewers' priortechnical or policy positions and sources of funding).", "The final peer review bulletin also cited Executive Order 12866 and OMB's authority to\"manage the agencies under the purview of the President's Constitutional authority to supervise theunitary Executive Branch\" as other authorities supporting the bulletin's issuance. (27) E.O. 12866 says thatOIRA within OMB is the \"repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues,\" and says thatagencies should base their decisions on \"the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical,economic, or other information concerning the need for, and consequences of the intendedregulation.\" (28) However, the executive order does not specifically mention peer review.

(50)", "The revised bulletin also explicitly exempted from its requirements information that (1) wasrelated to national security, foreign affairs, or international trade or treaties where compliance withthe bulletin \"would interfere with the need for secrecy or promptness\"; (51) (2) was produced bygovernment-funded scientists that was not represented as the views of the agency; (3) was an agencyregulatory impact analysis or regulatory flexibility analysis under Executive Order 12866; (52) or (4) was medical, health,or safety information that was time sensitive or based on a recent clinical trial that had already beenadequately peer reviewed. The bulletin also allowed agency heads to waive or defer the bulletinrequirements \"where warranted by a compelling rationale.\" (53) ", "In structure, the revised peer review bulletin was similar to the proposed bulletin in that itstill essentially required agencies to take three actions (to the extent permitted by law):", "have a peer review conducted on all \"influential scientific information\" thatthe agency intends to disseminate, ", "have all \"highly influential scientific assessments\" peer reviewed according tomore specific and demanding standards, and ", "indicate what \"influential\" and \"highly influential\" information the agencyplans to peer review in the future.", "Each of these required actions is described more fully in the sections below. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Influential Scientific Information", "paragraphs": ["The revised peer review bulletin defined the term \"influential scientific information\" asinformation the agency \"reasonably can determine that the dissemination of which will have or doeshave a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sector decisions.\" Therefore, in contrast to the proposed bulletin, the peer review requirements in the revised bulletinwere not limited to regulatory policies. ", "In addition to the limitations and exemptions discussed above, the revised bulletin said thatagencies were also not required to conduct a peer review of influential information that had alreadyhad an \"adequate\" peer review. The bulletin gave agencies substantial discretion in determiningwhether a prior review was \"adequate,\" specifically stating that the earlier review \"need not complywith all of the requirements of this bulletin.\" It also said that the sufficiency of the prior reviewdepended on the \"novelty and complexity of the science to be reviewed and the benefit and costimplications.\" Language in the proposed bulletin about rebutting an agency's presumption regardingwhether earlier peer reviews were sufficient was not included in the revised bulletin.", "The revised bulletin (like the proposed bulletin) also gave agencies discretion in determiningthe appropriate peer review mechanism for any information not previously reviewed, with the levelof rigor required again dependent on the \"novelty and complexity of the science to be reviewed andthe benefit and cost implications.\" The bulletin stated that \"appropriate\" reviews could range fromexaminations by other federal specialists to formal panels composed of independent experts. Thepreamble to the bulletin indicated that some peer reviews could be done by letter (e.g., when a draftdocument covers only one discipline), but said panels were preferable when time and resourcespermitted their use. Peer reviewers were to be selected based on their relevant expertise, and werenot to have participated in developing the product being reviewed. The revised bulletin alsocontained requirements to handle participation by scientists with conflicts of interest, (54) and said that the commentsof peer reviewers or a summary of those comments should be made available to the public. ", "When Peer Review Is Required. In response toconcerns that the trigger for peer reviews was too vague, OMB indicated in the revised bulletin thatthe reviews were needed whenever an agency \"reasonably determines\" that scientific information\"will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sectordecisions.\" ", "This change did not appear to address one of the underlying concerns voiced in the commentson the proposed bulletin. The definition of \"influential\" information is essentially the same as theone used to define \"significant\" information in the proposed bulletin; the only difference is thebroader applicability to non-regulatory information. Therefore, agencies still may find it difficultto determine whether a particular study will, at some point in the future, have a \"clear and substantialimpact on important public policies,\" much less \"important private sector decisions.\" Two agenciesin analogous situations may reach different conclusions regarding the need for peer review. As aresult, the overall purpose of the guidelines -- a more consistent application of peer review amongfederal agencies -- may not be achieved. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Highly Influential Scientific Assessments", "paragraphs": ["The revised bulletin contained a number of additional peer review requirements for\"scientific assessments\" that are \"highly influential.\" These requirements were much more specificthan those placed on \"influential\" scientific assessments, differed in some respects from therequirements in the proposed bulletin, and appeared to give OMB and the agencies significantauthority to determine when the requirements are applicable. ", "When Enhanced Peer Reviews Are Required. The revised bulletin defined a \"scientific assessment\" as \"an evaluation of a body of scientific ortechnical knowledge which typically synthesizes multiple factual inputs, data, models, assumptionsand/or applies best professional judgement to bridge uncertainties in the available information.\" Theterm \"highly influential scientific assessment\" was defined in the revised bulletin as \"influential\"scientific information (as defined in the previous section of this report) that either the disseminatingagency or OMB determined", "met the above-mentioned definition of a \"scientific assessment\";and", "could have a \"clear and substantial impact on important public policies ... orprivate sector decisions with a potential effect of more than $500 million in any year,\" or involved\"precedent setting, novel, and complex approaches, or significant interagencyinterest.\"", "As discussed previously, in the proposed bulletin enhanced peer review requirements appliedto \"especially significant\" influential information expected to be disseminated in support of aregulatory action that could have a $100 million impact in any year. Therefore, although the dollarthreshold for when enhanced peer review is required was higher in the revised bulletin ($500 millioninstead of $100 million), the peer review requirements were more broadly applicable in that theyapplied to more than just regulations. Also, the language regarding \"precedent setting, novel, andcomplex approaches\" replaced criteria in the proposed bulletin in which OMB alone could decidethat certain information required enhanced peer review because it was of \"significant interagencyinterest\" or \"relevant to an Administration policy priority.\" ", "Selection of Reviewers. The revised bulletindescribed in some detail how peer reviewers of highly influential scientific assessments should beselected, but still gave agencies substantial discretion in making the final decision. For example, thebulletin said that reviewers must be selected primarily on the basis of \"necessary\" expertise,experience, and skills, and must be diverse enough to \"fairly\" represent different perspectives. Therevised bulletin also said that agencies must consider requesting the public to nominate reviewers,and must generally \"bar participation by scientists employed by the agency sponsoring the review.\" (As noted previously, the proposed bulletin said agencies should \"strive\" to select peer reviewerswho were independent of the agency.) In addition, as in the proposed bulletin, the revised bulletinsaid agencies should try to avoid repeated use of the same reviewer on multiple assignments.", "However, in a significant departure from the proposed bulletin, the revised bulletin also saidthat research grants awarded to a scientist through a competitive, peer-reviewed process did notdisqualify that scientist from serving on a peer review panel. (The proposed bulletin indicated thatpeer reviewers who were \"receiving or seeking substantial funding from the agency through acontract or research grant\" should not be selected as peer reviewers.) Also, whereas the proposedbulletin advocated balancing panel members' biases, the revised bulletin contained no language tothat effect. Finally, the revised bulletin said that agencies could commission entities independent ofthe agency to select peer reviewers and manage the process. ", "Public Comments. The revised bulletin also gaveagencies discretion in the area of public comments. As noted previously, the proposed peer reviewbulletin instructed agencies to permit interested agencies and persons to submit comments on theinformation being reviewed, and to provide those comments to the peer reviewers for theirconsideration. In contrast, the revised bulletin said that agencies could decide on their own whetherto make the information at issue available for public comment, but said agencies should \"consider\"having a public comment period and public meetings before the reviewers \"when there is sufficientpublic interest.\" The revised bulletin did not indicate how agencies are to make this determination,or how much public interest is \"sufficient\" to trigger the need for public comments. The bulletin alsosaid that if an agency decides to make a draft assessment available to the public, it must, \"wheneverpracticable,\" provide peer reviewers with a summary or compilation of the comments received.", "Other Requirements. The revised bulletincontained several other types of requirements that were also in the proposed bulletin. For example,the revised bulletin required agencies to provide reviewers with \"sufficient information\" to allowthem to understand the data, assumptions, and analytic procedures used to support key findings orconclusions. Also, agencies were required to instruct peer reviewers to prepare a report summarizingtheir findings and conclusions. The report must contain the names, affiliations, and credentials ofthe reviewers. Agencies were, in turn, required to prepare a written response to the report, and boththe report and the response must be posted on the agency's website. ", "Alternative Procedures. The revised peer reviewbulletin said that an agency can (1) rely on scientific information produced by NAS, (2) commissionNAS to peer review the information, or (3) use an alternative procedure \"specifically approved bythe [OIRA] Administrator, in consultation with OSTP.\" As noted previously, the bulletin permittedthe agency head to waive or defer some or all of the peer review requirements for \"influentialscientific assessments\" and \"highly influential scientific assessments\" \"where warranted by acompelling rationale.\" (55) If the requirements are waived, however, the bulletin said peer review should be conducted \"as soonas practicable thereafter.\" The proposed bulletin did not provide for alternative procedures.", "OMB Authority. As is apparent from thepreceding discussion, the revised peer review bulletin (like the proposed bulletin) gave OMBsignificant authority to decide when agencies should use the more rigorous form of peer review. Specifically, the revised bulletin indicated that these procedures should be used when OMB (or theagency) determines that a scientific assessment (1) \"could have a clear and substantial impact onimportant public policies ... or private sector decisions with a potential effect of more than $500million in any year,\" or (2) involves \"precedent setting, novel, and complex approaches, orsignificant interagency interest.\" Therefore, under this definition, OMB could unilaterally determinethat certain information that an agency intends to disseminate is sufficiently \"novel\" or \"complex\"to trigger these \"highly influential\" additional peer review requirements. (56) ", "Also, whereas the revised bulletin defined \"influential\"scientific information as informationthat the agency can reasonable determine \"will have or does have\" a clear and substantial impact onimportant public policies or private sector decisions, the bulletin said that information should beconsidered \"highly influential\" if either the agency or OMB determines it \"could\" have such animpact -- conceptually, a lower threshold than for information that is only \"influential.\" ", "OMB retained significant authority over the peer review process in other ways. For example,OMB could determine that an agency's alternative peer review procedures are sufficiently rigorousto replace the requirements in the revised bulletin.
