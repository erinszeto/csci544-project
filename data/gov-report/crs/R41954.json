A key question is how renewable energy resources might be used to meet U.S. energy needs in general, and to meet U.S. electricity needs specifically. Renewable energy sources are typically used for three general types of applications: electricity generation, biofuels/bioproducts, and heating/cooling. Each application uses different technologies to convert renewable energy sources into usable products. The literature on renewable energy resources, conversion technologies for different applications, and economics is massive. This report focuses on electricity generation from renewable energy sources. In 2010, renewable sources of energy were used to produce almost 11% (7% from hydropower and 4% from other renewables) of the 4 million gigawatthours of electricity generated in the United States.", "This report provides a summary of U.S. electricity generation potential from wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, ocean-hydrokinetic, and biomass sources of renewable energy. The focus of this report is twofold: (1) provide an assessment of U.S. renewable electricity generation potential and how renewables might satisfy electric power sector demand, and (2) discuss challenges, issues, and barriers that might limit renewable electricity generation deployment.", "Data sources from 15 different organizations were reviewed to derive estimates of electricity generation potential. One key finding is that there exists no uniform national assessment of renewable electricity generation potential. No standard methods or set of assumptions are used to estimate renewable electricity generation potential. So even existing assessments for individual energy sources are difficult to compare objectively. In order to compare various estimates on an equivalent basis, CRS engaged experts in each renewable energy resource area to help normalize electricity generation potential estimates into a common metric: gigawatthours per year.", "After surveying, researching, and normalizing all of the third-party electricity generation estimates, results indicate that renewable energy sources may, in principle, have the potential to satisfy a large portion of U.S. electricity demand. However, a number of potential barriers to large-scale deployment exist, including cost, power system integration, intermittency and variability, land requirements, transmission access, possible limits to the availability of key materials and resources, certain environmental impacts, specialized infrastructure requirements, and policy issues. Ultimately, the amount of renewable electricity generation in the U.S. may be dependent on the ability to address these deployment barriers. The Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. renewable electricity generation will increase from 11% today to between 14% and 15% in 2035.", "As Congress considers policy options associated with increasing renewable electricity generation, policy makers may assess potential benefits such as emissions reduction, job creation, and global competitiveness, along with possible risks and consequences such as electricity cost and price increases, electricity delivery reliability, and environmental impacts associated with large-scale deployment of renewable electricity generation technologies."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. energy sector is large and complex.

Renewable energy sources, which can be used to generate electricity, produce liquid transportation fuels, and provide heating and cooling for industrial and residential/commercial sectors, provided 8% of total U.S. primary energy supply in 2009 (see Figure 1 ).", "The largest source of energy demand in the United States is the electric power sector, which consumed just over 40% of total U.S. energy supply in 2009. The U.S. electric power sector generates approximately 4 million gigawatthours of electricity each year. Like the total U.S. energy sector, electricity generation is dominated (89%) by fossil fuels and nuclear power. Renewable electricity generation, including hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass, contributed 11% of total U.S. electric power in 2009 ( Figure 2 ). Most U.S. renewable generation comes from conventional hydropower, which has limited growth potential. Other renewable electricity sources constitute about 4% of U.S. generation, but have been growing more rapidly.", "The purpose of this report is to analyze the prospects, opportunities, and challenges for renewable energy sources to increase their contribution to the electric power sector.", "There is growing interest in increasing the amount of renewable electricity generation to reduce the amount of fossil fuel consumption for U.S. electric power. That interest is driven by concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, the realization that economically recoverable fossil fuel supplies are ultimately finite, and the desire to position the United States as a global leader for renewable energy technology and manufacturing. These concerns are counter-balanced by the fact that fossil fuel electricity generation has long been\u2014and generally continues to be\u2014the least expensive form of electricity generation, by the fact that the United States has access to considerable resources of coal and natural gas for electricity generation, and from the economic and cultural inertia of the existing infrastructure in place for coal and natural gas to be used in large quantities for electricity generation. Renewable electricity generation provides two advantages when compared to fossil generation: (1) it relies on energy sources that may not decline over time, and (2) it produces little or no net greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants during use. However, renewable electricity generation does have liabilities and implementation challenges that will be further discussed in this report.", "This report addresses two fundamental questions about U.S. renewable electricity generation potential: (1) How much renewable electricity generation might be possible in the United States? and (2) What technical, operational, and economic challenges might renewables encounter when considering large-scale deployment for electricity generation?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Renewable Electricity Concepts and Units", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Definition and Characteristics of Renewable Electricity", "paragraphs": ["Renewable electricity is derived from renewable energy sources that \"regenerate and can be sustained indefinitely.\" This report does not use the term \"clean energy\" or \"alternative energy,\" which are terms used by some to include renewable energy resources plus other sources that may emit little or no carbon dioxide during use, such as nuclear plants and coal-fired power plants equipped with carbon capture and sequestration capabilities.

", "\"Renewable energy\" sources for electricity generation are often discussed as if they were a single entity, but renewable energy sources are more numerous and variable than fossil energy sources. Fossil fuels comprise oil, natural gas, and coal. The three major types of fossil fuels are extracted from the earth's crust by drilling or mining. Each of these fuels has very high energy density and is used primarily through combustion to exploit the heat produced. Renewable energy sources are more numerous and diverse and, thus, harnessing renewable energy requires a number of different technologies.

For example, the energy of the sun may be used by concentrating the energy to generate steam that drives electric turbines (concentrating solar power), or the energy of the sun may be converted directly to electricity using semiconducting materials (photovoltaics). Furthermore, photovoltaic electricity may be produced using solar panels that consist of crystalline silicon, cadmium telluride, or other materials, and each material has unique characteristics. ", "Renewable energy sources for electricity generation are naturally dispersed with rel a tively low energy densities. Fossil energy sources are typically concentrated as liquids or solids by millions of years of natural heating and pressure processes, which result in relatively high energy density that is accessible in wells or mines. In contrast, renewable energy sources are typically diffuse and require multiple technologies and management systems to gather and concentrate the resources. ", "Each renewable electricity generation project/installation can vary in size. Renewable electricity generation systems are being installed in large, megawatt-scale projects that feed electricity into the electric grid for consumption along with electricity from other sources. In fact, the largest electric power plant in the United States is a hydroelectric facility, Grand Coulee Dam, which has a capacity of 7.08 GW. At the same time, individual homes are being powered by small, kilowatt-scale rooftop solar panels.

In addition, the basic physics are different for extracting energy from solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass sources. Those physical differences give rise to different technologies, and many renewable energy technologies exhibit dramatically different performance according to geographic location and time of day or time of year. Therefore, estimating the amount of each type of renewable energy that is available to the nation is a challenging task. Examination of the literature reveals that estimates of available renewable energy resources vary widely. Attempting to compare estimates for different types of renewable energy multiplies those challenges.

Other federal and state agencies, federal labs, and academic institutions also collect, analyze, and report renewable energy resource data. These data and estimates change over time as data collection technologies advance and understanding of the natural processes improves. Nevertheless, comparing renewable energy assessments from different sources is difficult, and a complete and comprehensive assessment of all available renewable energy resources for the nation does not yet exist.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)", "paragraphs": ["A common metric for measuring the financial cost of electricity production is Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE. LCOE calculations are typically expressed in terms of dollars per unit of energy. The most common units of energy used for comparing the LCOE of different energy sources are kilowatthour (kWh) and megawatthour (MWh). LCOE estimates can provide a relative comparison of energy generation costs for different energy sources such as coal, natural gas, wind, solar, and others. However, policy makers may want to exercise caution when reviewing and considering LCOE estimates. Reasons for this caution include the following: (1) no agreed-upon or standardized LCOE calculation methodology exists, and methods can be tailored to skew results in favor of a particular technology or resource, (2) assumptions used to calculate LCOE estimates can have a major impact on calculations results, and (3) LCOE estimates may not reflect the variable time-of-day value of electricity generation. For example, electricity at 2 p.m. may have more value than electricity at 2 a.m. Therefore, it is unlikely that LCOE calculations performed by different organizations will be identical. Understanding the methodology and assumptions used is often critical when considering LCOE estimates. ", "Although there is no standard LCOE calculation method, two fundamental methods are commonly used. One method uses total life cycle costs (capital, operations and maintenance, etc.) and total life cycle energy production to calculate a $/kWh or $/MWh cost of energy. Another method uses a project cash flow model to calculate equity rates of return based on the price of energy paid to the project. Typically, a target equity rate of return, expressed as a percentage, is established and the price per unit of energy is adjusted in order to reach the equity return target. This cash-flow-based methodology is unique in that it may include specific project finance constraints such as debt service coverage ratios, cash reserves, and other factors that may not be reflected in the cost vs. energy production approach.", "Furthermore, differences in several key assumptions can significantly alter calculations of LCOE estimates. Assumptions that can impact LCOE estimates include (1) capital costs, (2) operation and maintenance costs, (3) government incentives, (4) capacity factor, (5) financial structure (debt/equity ratio), (6) financial costs for debt and equity, (7) project lifetime, and (8) technology performance degradation. Several key assumptions must be included in each calculation of LCOE estimates. Since different organizations often use different assumptions, the variation in LCOE estimates is not surprising.", "For this report, LCOE estimates from the EIA Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2011 were used to compare the cost of new electricity generation for various renewable energy resources. Figure 12 summarizes EIA's range of LCOE estimates for several technologies.", "It is important to note that EIA LCOE estimates reflect only the projected amount of capacity expected to be added to the electricity generation system during the forecast period. Costs for renewable electricity typically follow a supply curve where costs increase as new capacity is installed, which indicates that the lowest-cost capacity will be added first. Geothermal supply curve estimates provide an example to consider. Figure 13 shows a supply curve for enhanced geothermal electricity costs, developed by NREL. As indicated in the figure, depending on the amount of geothermal capacity installed, the projected LCOE could be as high as $1,000 per MWh. This example of how energy costs can change, as capacity additions increase, further illustrates the importance of understanding all assumptions used for projecting future electricity costs.

As with all cost calculations, assumptions used for estimating social costs can have a dramatic effect on calculation results. Nevertheless, some groups do attempt to place a value on the social costs of fossil energy as an alternative method for comparing the cost of energy from fossil and renewable resources. Furthermore, an Interagency Working Group was created under Executive Order 12866 to estimate the social cost of carbon for regulatory impact analysis. Over time, the costs of mitigating some of these social costs may be placed on the producers or consumers of fossil fuels.", "Technology and cost are closely related because renewable energy developers seek technologies that produce energy as inexpensively as possible in order to attain commercially viability. Today, research continues to identify new, more efficient materials and to seek technologies that can be manufactured at lower cost. Improvements continue as new technologies emerge and evolve.

The introduction of variable electricity generation may pose power system reliability challenges associated with moment-by-moment balancing of electricity supply and demand. A recent study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicates that many existing power systems currently have infrastructure and processes to manage some degree of variability, and these existing assets could potentially be used to manage variable renewable energy resources. However, not all renewable sources of electricity are classified as variable. Biomass, geothermal, and some hydropower sources have the ability to generate electricity on a consistent and predictable basis.

Geothermal, biomass, and some hydropower energy sources usually can be delivered continuously over time. However, wind power is usable only when the wind blows, solar power is usable only when the sun shines, and some hydroelectric power is usable only when water is available to flow through the turbines, so the production of renewable electricity from those sources varies over a period of minutes, hours, days, or months. In addition, wind speed may vary over a period of seconds, minutes, or hours, and solar energy may vary with cloud cover over a period of minutes or hours. This intermittent and variable nature of renewables contrasts with fossil and nuclear power plants, which produce electricity continuously and uniformly except during times of maintenance, fuel supply disruptions, operational problems, or natural disasters. The intermittency and variability of renewable energy might be partially overcome through the development of advanced storage technologies that provide storage of various quantities of electrical energy for use during renewable energy down time. A wide range of batteries, compressed-air storage, hydrogen generation and fuel cells, and other means of storing and recovering intermittent energy are being studied. Such storage is currently costly, and the combination of renewable electricity generation and reliable storage\u2014or backup reserve capacity from natural gas or other dispatchable sources\u2014will need to be considered by the electrical delivery system in order to maximize the potential contributions of renewable technologies.

", " Figure 14 displays different estimates of the land-use intensities of several energy production technologies. Estimates of the land-use intensity for renewable and nonrenewable sources of energy vary significantly, depending on a number of assumptions. To date, there is no standard methodology to produce these estimates. For example, the extent to which an energy site exclusively \"uses\" an amount of land is debatable. Only a small portion of area within a wind energy site is actually occupied by the turbines, so remaining land could potentially be\u2014and often is\u2014dedicated to other uses. In contrast, fields of energy crops to be burned in the production of electricity will fully occupy their allotted area. Further, energy production for renewables varies substantially with geography. A solar photovoltaic plant of a certain capacity will require less land if located in a region with more intense sunlight. In addition, it is difficult to compare land-use intensities for renewable energy technologies with those of fossil fuel technologies. For example, for fossil fuels, calculations of land-use intensity may include the power plant footprint, plus mining or production area, plus areas occupied by transportation and logistics infrastructure. Thus, the footprint for natural gas may include the gas power plant, but also the areas occupied by gas wells, the roads that connect the gas wells, and the pipelines that transport the gas to market. Also, the areal extent of infrastructure may not fully represent the impact on the landscape. The degree to which such infrastructure divides or dissects ecosystems may also be an important consideration. ", "The electric energy production technologies with the greatest land-use intensity (amount of land per unit of electrical energy produced) are biomass, wind, hydropower, and solar photovoltaic. Land-use intensities of natural gas, coal, geothermal, and nuclear power are likely significantly smaller than those of other forms of energy production. As demand grows for utility-scale installations of renewable energy, pressure will grow to integrate energy policy with land-use policy.

These geographic concentrations of renewable energy sources often mean that the energy may be optimally produced far from the existing energy demand centers, which are the large cities of the east and west coasts, upper Midwest, and South. Thus, large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies will likely be accompanied by the need for new electricity transmission infrastructure from the new regions of energy supply to the demand centers.
