{"id": "RL34318", "title": "Housing for Persons Living with HIV/AIDS", "released_date": "2016-09-27T00:00:00", "summary": ["Since the beginning of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the early 1980s, many individuals living with the disease have had difficulty finding affordable, stable housing. In the earlier years of the epidemic, as individuals became ill, they found themselves unable to work, while at the same time facing health care expenses that left few resources to pay for housing. In more recent years, HIV and AIDS have become more prevalent among low income populations who struggled to afford housing even before being diagnosed with the disease. The financial vulnerability associated with AIDS, as well as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, results in a greater likelihood of homelessness among persons living with the disease. At the same time, those who are homeless may be more likely to engage in activities through which they could acquire or transmit HIV. Further, recent research has indicated that individuals living with HIV who live in stable housing have better health outcomes than those who are homeless or unstably housed, and that they spend fewer days in hospitals and emergency rooms.", "Congress recognized the housing needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS when it approved the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program in 1990 as part of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (P.L. 101-625). The HOPWA program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), funds short-term and permanent housing, together with supportive services, for individuals living with HIV/AIDS and their families. In addition, a small portion of funds appropriated through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), may be used to fund short-term housing for those living with HIV/AIDS.", "In FY2016, Congress appropriated $335 million for HOPWA as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113). This was $5 million more than was appropriated in FY2015, and equaled the peak HOPWA funding level of $335 million in FY2010. Prior to FY2010, the most that had been appropriated for HOPWA was $310 million in FY2009. HUD awards 90% of appropriated funds based on a formula and the remaining 10% is distributed through a grant competition. Funds are used primarily for housing activities, although grant recipients must provide supportive services to those persons residing in HOPWA-funded housing. In FY2015, almost 55,000 households received housing assistance through HOPWA, a decrease compared to the previous years. See Table 1 for funding levels and households served since FY2001. The Appendix provides the formula grants distributed to eligible states and metropolitan statistical areas from FY2007 to FY2016.", "For years the formula used to distribute the bulk of HOPWA funds was an issue considered by both the Administration and Congress. Since the inception of HOPWA, the formula relied on cumulative cases of AIDS to distribute formula funds, a number that included those who had died but did not include living cases of HIV. Legislation to change the formula to include people living with both HIV and AIDS, but exclude those who have died, was introduced in the 114th Congress, including in FY2017 appropriations language. On July 29, 2016, Congress changed the HOPWA formula as part of the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-201). Going forward, the distribution of HOPWA formula funds will be based on people living with HIV or AIDS. In addition, HUD is to account for fair market rents and poverty in delivering a portion of funding, and a hold harmless provision ensures that, through FY2021, grantees will not see their allocations decrease by 5% or more nor increase by 10% or more from the previous year."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), weakens the immune system, leaving individuals with the disease susceptible to infections.

These estimates do not include those who have not yet been diagnosed as HIV positive but are currently living with the disease. Currently there is no cure for HIV/AIDS, and in the early years of the AIDS epidemic, individuals infected with AIDS often died quickly. In recent years, however, medications have allowed persons living with HIV and AIDS to live longer and to remain in better health. ", "Despite improvements in health outcomes, affordable housing remains important to many who live with HIV/AIDS. This report describes research that shows how housing and health status are related and the effects of stable housing on patient health. It also describes the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program, the only federal program that provides housing and services specifically for persons who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, together with their families. In addition, the report describes how a small portion of funds appropriated through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program may be used by states and local jurisdictions to provide short-term housing assistance for persons living with HIV/AIDS.

The inability to afford housing and the threat of homelessness confront many individuals living with HIV/AIDS. From the early years of the epidemic, individuals who are infected with HIV/AIDS have faced impoverishment as they become unable to work, experience high medical costs, or lose private health insurance coverage. The incidence of HIV/AIDS has also grown among low-income individuals who were economically vulnerable even before onset of the disease.", "Not surprisingly, researchers have found a co-occurrence between HIV/AIDS and homelessness. Homeless persons have a higher incidence of HIV/AIDS infection than the general population, while many individuals with HIV/AIDS are at risk of becoming homeless. Studies of the relationship between HIV and homelessness have found prevalence among homeless populations that range from 2% to 22%. Further, homelessness has been found to be associated with greater likelihood of participation in the risk factors that might lead to HIV/AIDS (multiple sexual partners, sex exchange, drug use, and diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection), as well as lowered adherence to anti-retroviral therapy.

Witnesses as well as committee members discussed various barriers to housing for persons living with HIV/AIDS. Among the issues confronting persons living with HIV/AIDS discussed at the hearing were poverty, homelessness, and discrimination in attempting to secure housing. Another issue discussed was the eligibility for subsidized housing for persons living with the disease. A question raised during the hearing, but left unresolved, was whether persons living with HIV or AIDS met the definition of \"handicap\" in order to be eligible for the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program (which also provided housing for persons with disabilities). Another concern was that persons living with HIV/AIDS often had difficulty obtaining subsidized housing through mainstream HUD programs such as Public Housing and Section 8 due to the length of waiting lists; individuals often died while waiting for available units. ", "In the 101 st Congress, at least two bills were introduced that contained provisions to create a housing program specifically for persons living with AIDS. These proposed programs were called the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act (which was part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1990, H.R. 1180 ) and the AIDS Opportunity Housing Act ( H.R. 3423 ). The bills were similar, and both proposed to fund short-term and permanent housing, together with supportive services, for individuals living with AIDS and related diseases. The text from one of the bills, H.R. 1180 , which included the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act, was incorporated into the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act ( S. 566 ) when it was debated and passed by the House on August 1, 1990. In conference with the Senate, the name of the housing program was changed to Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA). In addition, the several separate housing assistance programs that had been proposed in H.R. 1180 \u2014one for short-term housing, one for permanent housing supported through Section 8, and one for community residences\u2014were consolidated into one formula grant program in which recipient communities could choose which activities to fund. The amended version of S. 566 was signed into law on November 28, 1990, and became P.L. 101-625 , the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. ", "The HOPWA program is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and remains the only federal program solely dedicated to providing housing assistance to persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. The program addresses the need for reasonably priced housing for thousands of low-income individuals (those with incomes at or below 80% of the area median income). HOPWA was last reauthorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-550 ).

(For the amounts distributed to eligible states and MSAs in recent years, see Appendix .) HOPWA formula funds are available through HUD's Consolidated Plan process. Jurisdictions applying for funds from four HUD formula grant programs, including HOPWA, submit a single consolidated plan to HUD. The plan includes an assessment of community housing and development needs and a proposal that addresses those needs, using both federal funds and community resources.

Some of the formula requirements were recently changed as part of the Housing Opportunities Through Modernization Act (HOTMA, P.L. 114-201 ) and are to take effect when FY2017 funding is awarded. For more information, see \" The New HOPWA Formula Enacted in P.L. 114-201 .\" Formula funds are allocated in two ways:", "First, 75% of the total available formula funds, sometimes referred to by HUD as \"base funding,\" is distributed \u2014starting in FY2017, to the largest cities within metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with populations exceeding 500,000 and with more than 2,000 individuals living with HIV or AIDS (through FY2016, funds were distributed to MSAs with more than 1,500 cumulative AIDS cases), and \u2014starting in FY2017, to states with more than 2,000 individuals living with HIV or AIDS in the areas outside of that state's eligible MSAs (through FY2016, funds were distributed to states with more than 1,500 cumulative AIDS cases). Second, 25% of total available formula funds\u2014sometimes referred to by HUD as \"bonus funding\"\u2014is to be distributed to states and MSAs, starting in FY2017, using a method developed by the HUD Secretary that takes account of housing costs as represented by fair market rents, as well as poverty. Prior to enactment of P.L. 114-201 , bonus funding was distributed based on AIDS incidence (newly diagnosed AIDS cases). In addition, states had not previously been eligible for bonus funding.", "Although HOPWA funds are allocated to the largest city within an MSA, the recipient cities are required to allocate funds \"in a manner that addresses the needs within the metropolitan statistical area in which the city is located.\" While the distribution of the balance of state funds is based on HIV and AIDS cases outside of eligible, states may use funds for projects in any area of the state, including those that receive their own funds. According to HUD guidance, states should serve clients in areas outside of eligible MSAs, but the state may operate anywhere in the state because it \"may be coordinating the use of all resources in a way that addresses needs more appropriately throughout the state.\" In FY2016, 98 MSAs (including the District of Columbia) received funds, while 40 states and Puerto Rico received funds based on the number of AIDS cases outside of recipient MSAs. HUD jurisdictions that receive HOPWA funds may administer housing and services programs themselves or may allocate all or a portion of the funds to subgrantee private nonprofit organizations. HOPWA formula funds remain available for obligation for two years.", "As a result of language included in every HUD appropriations law between FY1999 ( P.L. 105-276 ) and FY2016, states did not lose formula funds if their reported AIDS cases dropped below 1,500, as long as they received funding in the previous fiscal year.

In determining proposals that qualify, HUD must consider the innovativeness of the proposal and its potential replicability in other communities.

As a result, HOPWA competitive grants for new projects are not awarded in every year. Most recently, in August 2015, HUD announced the availability of HOPWA competitive funds for a demonstration in conjunction with the Violence Against Women Act Transitional Housing Program. In June 2016, HUD announced awards to eight organizations that will provide housing and supportive services to people living with HIV/AIDS who experience sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking.

However, infection itself may not be sufficient to meet the definition of disability in these other programs. For example, in the case of housing developed prior to the mid-1990s under the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program (which also funded units for persons with disabilities) and units developed under the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, an individual who is HIV positive or has AIDS must also meet the statutory definition of disability (in which HIV/AIDS status alone is not sufficient) to be eligible for housing. The project-based Section 8 and Public Housing programs may also set aside units or entire developments for persons with disabilities. The definition of disability for these programs does \"not exclude persons who have the disease of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or any conditions arising from the etiologic agent\" for AIDS.

In 1995, at the request of two Senators from the Labor and Human Resources Committee, the General Accounting Office (GAO, now the Government Accountability Office) examined funding disparities per person living with AIDS that resulted from using cumulative AIDS cases to distribute Ryan White funds. It proposed several data changes that would result in more equitable per-case funding, including a way to weight CDC data to arrive at an estimate of persons living with AIDS. The next year, in 1996, Congress reauthorized the Ryan White program and changed the way in which grants to metropolitan areas were distributed to use CDC estimates of persons living with AIDS ( P.L. 104-146 ).

However, when the Ryan White program was reauthorized in 2006, the law limited the amount of grants to states and urban areas that could be used for supportive services to no more than 25% by requiring that at least 75% of funds be used for \"core medical services.\" Due to these funding limits, HRSA released guidance on time limits for housing assistance. Its final notice, released on May 12, 2011 (Notice 11-01), defined \"short-term or emergency housing\" as:", "transitional in nature and for the purposes of moving or maintaining an individual or family in a long-term, stable living situation. Thus, such assistance cannot be permanent and must be accompanied by a strategy to identify, relocate, and/or ensure the individual or family is moved to, or capable of maintaining, a long-term, stable living situation.", "In addition, the Notice 11-01 strongly encouraged grantees or local planning bodies to define short-term housing themselves, recommending that they consider adopting the HUD definition of transitional housing: 24 months.", "Under Notice 11-01, housing must either provide medical or supportive services, or, if it does not provide these services, the housing must be necessary for clients to gain access to or compliance with medical care.

In addition, during the last decade, research has found that the health outcomes of homeless individuals living with HIV/AIDS may be improved with stable housing. In response to evidence from some studies, the Administration's National HIV/AIDS Strategy , published in 2010, acknowledged that \"access to housing is an important precursor to getting many people into a stable treatment regimen. Individuals living with HIV who lack stable housing are more likely to delay HIV care, have poorer access to regular care, are less likely to receive optimal antiretroviral therapy, and are less likely to adhere to therapy.\" The National HIV/AIDS Strategy included pursuing the goal of housing as one of the ways to increase access to care and improve health outcomes for individuals living with HIV and AIDS.", "This section of the report gives a short overview of several studies that have examined how access to stable housing influences health outcomes for those living with HIV and AIDS."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Community Health Advisory & Information Network (CHAIN) Project Data", "paragraphs": ["The CHAIN Project is a longitudinal study, begun in 1994, of a sample of individuals living with HIV/AIDS in New York City and the northern suburbs.

Researchers measured the likelihood of six scenarios involving the receipt or continuity of both medical care in general and appropriate HIV medical care. In general, individuals who were unstably housed were less likely to enter into and retain both medical care and appropriate HIV care. However, the likelihood of obtaining and retaining medical care increased if individuals received some form of housing assistance.

Individuals in the comparison group received services, including assistance with finding housing, but did not receive HOPWA-funded housing. Despite the differences in rental assistance provided between the treatment and comparison groups, both groups had a statistically significant increase in stable housing. After 18 months, 82% of HOPWA-assisted renters and 52% of individuals in the comparison group were living in their own housing. Perhaps due to the fact that the comparison group also had some success in achieving and maintaining housing, both groups saw statistically significant improvements in health outcomes. After 18 months, both groups had fewer emergency room visits, fewer hospitalizations, reduced opportunistic infections (those that occur due to weakened immune systems), and reduced use of medical care generally.

The study found that, after 12 months, the group receiving housing assistance had higher rates of intact immunity compared to the comparison group and were more likely to have undetectable viral loads. There was no statistically significant difference between CD4 counts for the treatment and usual care group. (Very generally, CD4 counts are a measure of immune system strength.) At the conclusion of the study, the treatment group was found to have spent fewer days in emergency rooms and hospitals during the 18 month period in which the researchers followed participants.
