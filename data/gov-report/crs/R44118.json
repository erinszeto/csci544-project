After the attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), attention refocused on the adequacy of interior immigration enforcement, especially the perceived lack of federal resources. Although ICE has seen an increase in resources to carry out its immigration enforcement responsibilities, the number of ICE agents pales in comparison to the resources available to local law enforcement agencies (LEAs) throughout the country.

In implementing such policies, some jurisdictions were responding to increased numbers of removals from the U.S. interior of unauthorized aliens who were identified through Secure Communities. Many such unauthorized aliens, apart from their illegal status, reportedly had relatively minor or no criminal records. Other jurisdictions were reportedly responding to federal court decisions finding that holding an alien solely on the basis of an ICE detainer could violate the Fourth Amendment, potentially subjecting law enforcement to liability for doing so.

With the introduction of PEP, jurisdictions that previously resisted ICE enforcement measures and detainer requests have increasingly cooperated with the agency, allowing it to effectively custom tailor immigration enforcement mechanisms that comply with local ordinances and preferences. For example, some jurisdictions had concerns about detainers issued for aliens whom ICE did not have probable cause to believe were subject to removal. In response, ICE amended its detainer forms to note the basis for determining that an individual alien is subject to removal. Since establishing PEP, ICE reports that over 275 jurisdictions that previously had not honored ICE detainers have agreed to honor requests for notification and/or detention.
