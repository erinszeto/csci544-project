The report contained 41recommendations on ways to prevent future catastrophic assaults, including a series of proposalsdesigned to improve the presidential appointments process as it relates to the top national securityofficials at the beginning of a new administration. On October 6, the Senate passed legislation( S. 2845 ) to implement many of the changes recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The House on October 8 passed its version of the legislation ( H.R. 10 ). The Presidentsigned the final version of the bill on December 17, 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ).

Bush to theposts covered by the recommendation shows that the commission's proposed timetable was not metin 14 of the 49 cases, suggesting this is an issue in a minority of cases.", "The Constitution gives the Senate a role in the presidential appointments process, but theparameters of that role have never been clearly defined. The current process is regulated by amixture of formal rules and informal customs, as well as by political interactions between thePresident and Senators. Implementing the commission's proposal would presumably requireinstituting procedures that guarantee committee consideration of each nomination, at least at ahearing, and a final vote on each by the full Senate. Changes of this kind would involve newrestrictions on both the power of committee chairs to control the agenda of their committees and therights of Senators to delay or block nominations through holds and extended debate. These changeswould likely also alter the relationship between the legislative and executive branches, weakeningthe negotiating posture of the Senate in relation to the President, particularly if they were to beextended to additional nominations.", "Procedures adequate to implement the commission's recommendation would resemble anexpedited procedure, such as those used in resolutions of approval and disapproval of executiveactions.

While the Constitution includes the Senatein the confirmation process, it does not spell out how the chamber should fulfill its role of providingadvice and consent to a nomination. The extent of legislative and executive control of the processhas in many respects remained undetermined.", "In response to this Constitutional indeterminancy, some have asserted that the Senate shouldhave a co-equal role with the President in the process.", "The Senate's responsibility for confirming presidentialnominees, although fixed firmly in the Constitution, remains unsettled in its application. The Senatewas not meant to be a passive participant. Delegates to the Philadelphia convention believed thatthe Senate would be knowledgeable about nominees and capable of voting wisely. Yet, for the mostpart, it has acted cautiously, uncertain of the scope of its own constitutional power. The source ofthis uncertainty is not the Constitution. Nowhere in that document, or in its history, is there anobligation on the part of the Senate to approve a nomination. On the contrary, the burden should beon the President to select and submit a nominee with acceptable credentials. (13)", "Others have said the Senate should play a lesser role, allowing the President greater leewayin his choices for office than is currently the case. Law professor John C. Eastman told the SenateRules Committee on June 5, 2003, that", "... the appointment power is located in Article II of theConstitution, which defines the powers of the President, not in Article I, which defines the powersof the legislature. As the Supreme Court itself has noted, by vesting appointment power in ArticleII, the framers of our Constitution intended to place primary responsibility for appointments in thePresident. The \"advice and consent\" role for the Senate, then, was to be narrowly construed. (14)", "The practice of the Senate, however, has not systematically reflected either of theseperspectives. Historically, much of the regular order of business on the nomination and confirmationof presidential appointments has been regulated not by strict, formal rules, but rather by informalcustoms that can change (and have changed) over the years, as the relative balance of power betweenthe President and the Senate ebbs and flows. It is these traditions which form the process, accordingto appointments expert Michael J. Gerhardt.", "These informal arrangements -- those not clearlyrequired or clearly prohibited by the Constitution -- have come to define the dynamic in the federalappointments process. The informal arrangements through which the system operates -- includingsenatorial courtesy; logrolling; individual holds, \"blue slips\"; consultation between presidents,members of Congress, and other interested parties, including judges; interest group lobbying;strategic leaking by administrations, senators and interest groups; manipulation of the press; themedia's effort to influence the news; and nominees' campaigning -- are the sum and substance of thefederal appointments process. Studying these arrangements provide even greater illumination thanstudying Supreme Court decisions or the Constitution itself of how the different branches of thefederal government interact on matters of mutual concern.

The committee may or may not act on thenomination. If the committee approves the nomination, it goes before the full Senate, which mayor may not take up the nomination on the floor. If the Senate does proceed to consider thenomination, it may or may not proceed to a final vote. A final vote of the full Senate is required fora nomination to be confirmed. The President gives to the confirmed nominee a commission withthe seal of the United States, and the individual is sworn into office. (18) ", "Nominations are part of the executive business of the Senate (the other component beingratification of treaties). These are matters that come directly from the President and require theSenate's approval to implement. The Senate treats these items as separate from its legislativebusiness: they are placed on a different calendar (the Executive Calendar ), and the Senate must bein executive session to consider them. The official record of Senate action on treaties andnominations is known as the Executive Journal , while the record of Senate action on legislation andother matters is called the Senate Journal .", "In practice, the chair of the committee of jurisdiction generally has the discretion whether tomove the nominee through his or her committee or not. The action can take the form of a hearingat which the nominee testifies or a markup of the committee to formally approve the nomination andsend it on to the full chamber, or both. If the committee reports a nomination, the majority leadermay ask unanimous consent, or move, that the Senate enter executive session to take it up. He is not required to take either action.

The power of committee chairs to control the agenda of their panels is longstanding. Severaltimes in recent years, committee chairs have refused to grant a nominee a hearing, and effectivelyprevented the Senate from being able to act on the nomination. (21) The Senate can dischargea committee from consideration of a nomination, and frequently does so by unanimous consent whenthe nominations concerned are non-controversial. When there is opposition, however, the processto discharge the committee from further consideration of the nomination is difficult and subject tofilibuster, and has been used rarely.", "Responding to concerns that committee chairs were too powerful in their ability to blockconsideration of legislation, the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act created a new Senate rule toallow a majority of a committee to call a meeting without the approval of the chair.

The leader alsomay decide to honor the hold for a specific period of time or not at all. The power of the hold liesin its implicit threat -- that if the item is scheduled for floor consideration, the concerned Senator andhis or her allies might wage a filibuster and try to prevent a final up or down vote on the matter.

In order to ensure that nominees receive afinal vote, it would be necessary to preclude the possibility of a successful filibuster.

There isnothing in our Constitution which in any respect implies, directly or indirectly, that majority ruleshould be the rule of the Senate.

Expedited procedures have notpreviously been used in the Senate to consider executive business, so enactment of the 9/11Commission's recommendations would be precedent-setting. That would not necessarily, however,be a barrier to using expedited procedures for executive business. ", "Necessary Elements.

This provision mightrequire that the committee hold a hearing on the nomination and report it to the full chamber by aset time after receiving it, such as 20 days. (32) An effective expedited procedure would need to include anenforcement mechanism at this stage, so that if the committee did not act, either the nominationwould automatically be discharged from committee and placed on the Executive Calendar , makingit available for consideration by the full chamber, or a motion to do so would be in order.", "An effective expedited procedure also would need to provide some controls regarding Senatefloor action. Currently, under Senate precedents, a Member may move to go into executive sessionto take up a particular nomination without that motion being subject to debate, and thus a filibuster. The nomination itself, however, is subject to debate and, therefore, to filibuster. The expeditedprocedure would need to foreclose the possibility of filibustering a nomination, probably by placinga limit on the total amount of time the Senate could spend debating the nomination of a member ofthe National Security Team.

The Senatespent no floor time debating the two nominations for Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacyand Public Affairs it has approved during the Bush Administration. That position is included in the9/11 Commission's definition of the National Security Team. The Senate might, however, want tobe sure it includes sufficient debate time to consider other members of the National Security Team,such as Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State or Attorney General.", "In general, the Senate does not tend to include in its expedited procedures a provisionautomatically calling a measure to the floor. (33) Usually, the expedited procedure would make it in order for themajority leader or another Member to bring the matter up. If desired, the expedited provision forNational Security Team nominations could include such a provision, requiring that within severaldays after the end of committee consideration, the Senate take it up. This provision would need tospecify when, in the Senate's normal course of daily operations, the nomination would come up.

The majority leader might simply decline tocall it up. It is not apparent how any form of procedure could provide effective recourse in thissituation. Expedited procedures in existing statutes often provide that if Congress does not act ona presidential proposal within a specified time, the proposal goes into effect.

Similar changes alsocould be implemented by amending the Senate rules. This approach would have the advantage tothe Senate of not having to go through the House or be signed by the President; rather, the changeswould take effect as soon as the Senate adopted them.

The Senate also could tryto amend its rules to conform to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations by a unanimous consentagreement. For this approach to succeed, all Senators would have to agree on a plan to implementthe new confirmation procedure -- one objection would prevent the agreement from going into effect. Unanimous consent agreements have been used to structure debate on specific nominations. Thisagreement, however, would be binding into future Congresses, unless it specified otherwise or wasmodified by another unanimous consent agreement. ", "Standing Order. Finally, the Senate could try toamend its rules through adoption of a Standing Order, which would take the form of a simpleresolution. Such a Standing Order would have effects like those of a rule, but the resolution wouldrequire 60 votes for cloture if it was filibustered, not two-thirds of Senators voting. Such a standingorder resolution was used for the creation of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (S.Res.400, 94th Congress).

Taking nominations out ofthis equation could shift the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.", "\"The appointments process is deeply contentious, and as legislative policymaking has grownmore difficult in recent decades, the process has increasingly become a venue for pitched battles overthe shape of public policy,\" wrote appointments expert Mackenzie.

What is different now,he said, is the extent to which those connections are made.", "Political scientists Nolan McCarty and Rose Razaghian studied more than 100 years ofSenate action on nominations. They said: \"The thrust of our theory is that the supermajoritarianismof the Senate in general and the confirmation process in particular gives partisan and ideologicalminorities a strategic opportunity to have an impact on public policy by delaying nominations thatwould pass on a simple majority vote.\" (36) ", "For some, the ability to engage in extended debate on (and effectively block) measures ormatters is what empowers the Senate to deal on equal footing with the President in their fights overboth nominations and legislation. Political scientist Rogers argued that \"For the fact of the matteris, as I hope to show, that, as the much vaunted separation of powers now exists, unrestricted debatein the Senate is the only check upon presidential and party autocracy. The devices that the framersof the Constitution so meticulously set up would be ineffective without the safeguard of senatorialminority action.\" (37) ", "Some also believe that the Senate's opportunity to play a vigorous role in the nomination andconfirmation process is essential to the public's trust in the process. \"Nonetheless, the process ofvetting and voting on the president's candidates for high position is an essential balance wheel in ourcomplicated form of government. It lends legitimacy to the whole structure, and it is worth theoccasional loss of a good person,\" wrote former judge, and former Member of Congress, AbnerMikva. (38) Hecontinued:", "Neither branch always chooses good people, as historyshows, and frequently the best people don't get appointed. Learned Hand never made it to theSupreme Court. Nonetheless, political involvement, including confirmation by the very politicalSenate, offers a reality check on who gets the power to make very important judicial decisions forlife. The case is a little less compelling for appointments to the executive branch, but it still can bemade. Most of the federal work force come into their positions and are protected in them, by a civilservice system based on meritocracy. For those relatively few policy makers whose appointmentsrequire Senate confirmation, an extra \"look see\" is justified. (39)", "Others believe that the delaying strategies being employed by some in the Senate detract fromthat legitimacy. (40) ", "And some contend that it is not right to use nominations as bargaining chips in legislativenegotiations. \"The Senate's constitutional and institutional role of advice and consent is beingsupplanted by informal, extra-constitutional customs that allow individual senators to effectivelyveto the President's nominees -- even if only to gain leverage with the executive branch on anunrelated matter,\" wrote Denning.

A vote deadline, for example, could still lead to a defeat, so requiring a vote could lead tomore presidential defeats or to pressure to go along with the President so as to not hand him a defeat.", "Political scientist Burdett Loomis observed that trying to change the Senate's rules may notbe an effective plan. \"Is there any indication that the Senate might smooth the way for futurenominees? Given the profound changes in the chamber over the past twenty-five years -- the greaterlatitude allowed individual members and the intense partisanship that dominates muchdecision-making -- it seems unlikely that reformers would profit much from attempting to reshapeSenate procedures.\" (42) Instead, he argued, \"Striving to \"govern together\" by bridging the separate institutions may bevaluable than seeking to change an institution that has proved highly resistant to structuralreforms.\" (43) ", "If the history of the confirmation process is more about practices than rules, perhaps it wouldbe useful to consider informal changes in the dynamics that undergird the process. Instead of settingup timetables for action, this approach would build upon a view that the problem is not procedural,but political.", "Political scientist Christopher J. Deering wrote that politics has always been a part of theprocess. \"The relationship between the executive and legislative branches has been and remainsessentially political. That should not change. The Senate's role in the review of executive personnelis but one example of that political relationship. The Senate's role in the confirmation process wasdesigned not to eliminate politics but to make possible the use of politics as a safeguard. From theoutset the political motivations of the two branches were to be a protection against tyranny.\" (44) ", "\"The one enduring characteristic of the process is that it is as deeply and intensely politicalnow as it has always been,\" (45) agreed Mackenzie. The process is political, he asserted, becauseits results can have a major impact on policy-making, and therefore, politics.", "Conflict occurs in the appointment process for a verysimple reason. Appointments matter. Were that not the case, presidential administrations would nothave several dozen White House aides devoting full time to appointment decisions; Senatecommittees would not hold hundreds of hours of confirmation hearings; interest groups, agencies,political parties and members of the House would not spend their time and resources trying to shapeappointments decisions. Yet they do all these things, and they do them because they think it makesa difference who gets appointed to serve in particular federal offices. (46)", "As a result, when the process has worked, it frequently was because the two branches ofgovernment found a way to make it work. \"The appointment power operates in a framework ofstudied ambiguity, its limits established for the most part not by court decisions but by imaginativeaccommodations between the executive and legislative branches,\" wrote separation-of-powersscholar Fisher.

Instead of, or in addition to,instituting new procedures to expedite action, the Senate might exercise more control over threatenedfilibusters against nominations by enforcing more stringently its existing rules. Under currentprocedures, debate on nominations and treaties is in some respects easier to limit than on legislativematters. First, the motion to proceed to consider a nomination may be offered in a non-debatableform, whereas the motion to proceed to consider legislation is usually debatable. Second, the \"TwoSpeech Rule\" of the Senate limits each Senator to two speeches per day on any given question. Withrespect to legislative matters, this rule is not a viable deterrent to extended debate, for each newamendment is viewed as a new question on which each Senator may speak two more times. Onun-amendable matters, such as nominations, the Two Speech Rule could more effectively be usedas a procedure to limit debate indirectly.", "Under current interpretations, however, the two-speech rule has proved to be an ineffectivedeterrent against extended debates on nominations because it has been interpreted to apply to thecalendar day. On each new calendar day every Senator is able once again to make two speeches onthe pending nominee. As a result, since the late 1980's, the Senate has rarely sought to enforce thisrule. A reinterpretation of the rule in its application to nominations could make it more effective. ", "Given such an interpretation, it would be easier for Senate leaders to overcome filibustersagainst a nominee by forcing opposing Senators to speak at length. In modern practice, mostfilibusters feature delay by means other than debate (quorum calls or agreements to turn to otheritems of business). In effect, the threat of a filibuster is treated as though the Senate is beingprevented, through extended debate, from reaching a final conclusion on the measure or matter athand. Keeping the Senate in continuous executive business session for consideration of anomination could make it more difficult for Senators to sustain a true filibuster, and, perhaps, reducethe incidence of filibuster threats. ", "Expiring Nominations. Another approach mightbe to place a time limit on a presidential nomination. While such a requirement might seemcounterintuitive, it would prevent an endless delay in filling the position in question. If the Senatedid not act on a nomination after a defined period of time, say 60 days, it would automatically bereturned to the President. While the President would have the ability to renominate the individualin question, if he so chose, he could also take the opportunity to reconsider his choice without thepolitically sensitive problem of asking a nominee to step aside.", " Table 1.
