Table 3 reveals a great deal of overlap between rural schools identified under the old and new systems. Of the schools classified as rural under the metro-centric system (i.e., coded as 7 or 8), over nine-in-ten (92.5%) were also classified as rural under the urban-centric system (i.e., coded as either 41, 42, or 43).

Unless there are significant increases in REAP funding, any formula change will produce \"winners\" and \"losers.\" Since the Census Bureau is eliminating the metro-centric codes, continued use of these data is not an option unless legislation specifically mandates their continued production. To mitigate the impact of the new codes, Congress could choose to hold harmless those eliminated LEAs indefinitely or for a period of time (perhaps at a decreasing percentage of their prior year grants) so they can adjust to the funding loss.

Alternatively, the statute could be amended to provide a different policy for dealing with additional appropriations. For example, the statute could specify a ratable increase procedure under which the minimum and maximum grants could be ratably increased along with all other grants.

This results because they have only one or a few students. One approach for reducing this result would be to limit LEA participation to LEAs with a minimum total enrollment. Another anomaly occurs when LEAs have offsetting program amounts that are just a few dollars less than their final SRSA grant. For example, some LEAs receive grants as low as $39. A solution to this would be to eliminate final grants that are deemed to be below a size to be effective. These funds could then be distributed to other LEAs to enhance their grants.

For states and counties, these estimates combine survey data with population estimates and administrative records. For school districts, the county estimates are combined with data from the decennial census and federal tax information to produce estimates of the number of related children ages five to 17 in families in poverty. For purposes of the REAP program, what is important to know about the SAIPE school district poverty estimates is that they are generated through a process in which data at broad levels of aggregation (i.e., from national, regional, or state sources) are progressively distributed to more narrow geographic levels (i.e., to counties and school districts). This process inevitably involves some degree of distributional error as it moves from large, populous areas to smaller, sparsely populated areas. ", "Some rural program proponents contend that in small, sparsely populated school districts, child poverty could be better estimated using data from the National School Lunch Program, commonly referred to as Free and Reduced-Price Lunch (FRPL) data. State agencies that administer the program submit data on the number of FRPL-eligible students to NCES through its Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey (part of the CCD).

Using the old locale codes, a switch from SAIPE data to FRPL data would add nearly 800 LEAs. Using the new locale codes, this switch would add over 900 LEAs. Should Congress decide to switch to FRPL data, it could set a threshold higher than 40% to reduce the number of newly eligible LEAs. Given the well documented problems with the quality of these data (see the Appendix at the end of this report for a discussion of these issues), Congress may wish to analyze the distributional impacts of using FRPL data more closely.

The researchers concluded:", "Through regression analysis we estimate a positive relationship between FRPL data and Census 2000 poverty estimates with a median prediction error of 30 percent. The high degree of prediction error suggests the FRPL data are not sufficiently precise for formal use in producing school district poverty estimates at this time.", "Since some have proposed that FRPL data replace SAIPE data for determining LEA poverty and RLIS eligibility, it is worth taking a closer look at the limitations of FRPL data. In its CCD documentation, NCES notes the following with respect to the counts of students eligible for the free school lunch program: \"These counts of students [eligible for the free school lunch program] may be taken by the schools at a different time than the membership counts [a measure of enrollment], therefore the count of free lunch and membership students may not be comparable in a given school.\"", "In a 2005 Federal Register notice, the Secretary of Education described additional problems with FRPL data as follows:", "First, the family income threshold needed to qualify for the FRPL program is 185 percent of the poverty level used by the Census Bureau. Hence, many more children qualify for the FRPL program than are considered poor under the census definition, which makes FRPL eligibility too expansive a measure of poverty. ", "Second, FRPL data tend to undercount children in middle and high schools, because children in the upper grades tend to participate in the school lunch program in significantly lower numbers. Therefore, the number of poor children in high school districts are typically not accurately represented by FRPL counts. ", "Third, FRPL data are self-reported data. The number of children included in the FRPL count depends on how many families apply for the program. The extent to which school districts and schools reach out and recruit families to apply for the program will affect the number. Because of this factor, the USDA, which administers the school meals programs, has raised concerns about the accuracy of these data. Several data sources, including the eligibility verifications performed by school districts, indicate that a significant number of ineligible children appear to have been certified for free and reduced meals and, therefore, that these data may not be an adequate measure for poverty for other program uses. USDA believes that the authority for school officials to use counts of children eligible for free and reduced-price meals in determining Title I within-district allocations may provide an incentive for those officials to inflate those counts. ", "Finally, because FRPL are self-reported data, the relationship between census poverty and FRPL is not consistent across geographic areas. Nationally, for example, the number of children eligible for the FRPL in school year 2000\u201301 among the States ranges from 1.5 to 41 times the number of children who meet the census criteria for poverty.", "Census Bureau analysis put the discrepancy between official poverty estimates and FRPL estimates this way: ", "Between 1994 and 2004, the ratio of school-age children receiving free or reduced-price lunch increased from 28.6 to 32.2 percent, using state-level data from the [Food and Nutrition Service]. For the same time period, the estimated poverty rate for related children ages 5 to 17 decreased from 19.8 to 16.2 percent, using data from the [Current Population Survey].", "As official estimates of poverty declined during the economic expansion of the late 1990s, the FRPL data collected during that time suggest that there was an increase in the number of low-income children."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
