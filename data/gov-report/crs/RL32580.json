Evo Morales, an indigenous leader and head of Bolivia's coca growers' union, and his party, the leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), won a convincing victory in the December 18, 2005, presidential election with 54% of the votes. Early in his term, President Morales moved to decriminalize coca cultivation and nationalized the country's natural gas industry. His efforts to reform the Bolivian constitution have, until recently, been stymied by a strong opposition movement led by the leaders (prefects) of Bolivia's wealthy eastern provinces who are seeking greater regional autonomy.", "In December 2007, the Constituent Assembly elected in mid-2006 passed a draft constitution without the presence of opposition delegates. In late August 2008, President Morales, buoyed by the strong support he received in a national recall referendum held on August 10, 2008, proposed to convoke a referendum on the draft constitution in December 2008. He later agreed to seek congressional approval for that referendum. Several opposition prefects were angered by Morales' proposal, and launched protests and blockades, which turned violent in mid-September. On October 20, 2008, after multiparty negotiations on the draft constitution's text, the Bolivian Congress approved legislation convoking a constitutional referendum on January 25, 2009. The new constitution was approved by a 61% to 39% vote following a peaceful election. Four eastern provinces, however, all voted against the constitution suggesting a strong possibility of continued opposition and discord.", "U.S.-Bolivian relations have been strained by the Morales government's drug policy and its increasing ties with Venezuela. Bilateral relations hit their lowest point in recent memory on September 10, 2008, when President Morales accused the U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia of supporting opposition forces and expelled him from the country. The U.S. government responded by expelling Bolivia's U.S. Ambassador. On September 16, 2008, President Bush designated Bolivia as a country that had failed to live up to its obligations under international narcotics agreements. That decision was closely followed by a Bush Administration proposal to suspend Bolivia's trade preferences under the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA). On November 1, 2008, Bolivian President Morales announced an indefinite suspension of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operations in Bolivia after accusing some DEA agents of espionage.", "Concerns regarding Bolivia in the 110th Congress focused largely on counternarcotics and trade issues. Bolivia received an estimated $99.5 million in U.S. foreign aid in FY2008, including roughly $47 million in counternarcotics assistance, significantly lower than in previous years. An enacted continuing resolution H.R. 2638/P.L. 110-329 will provide funding for U.S. programs in Bolivia at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. In October 2008, Congress enacted legislation to extend ATPA trade preferences for Bolivia until June 30, 2009 (P.L. 110-436). However, on November 25, 2008, President Bush announced his decision to suspend Bolivia's ATPA trade preferences effective December 15, citing Bolivia's failure to cooperate with the United States on counternarcotics efforts. The 111th Congress is likely to continue to focus on trade and drug issues as these concerns remain central to U.S. relations with Bolivia."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["On January 25, 2009, by a 61% to 39% vote, a new constitution promoting the rights of the indigenous majority and giving more control of the economy to the government was approved.

In 1825, Bolivia won its independence from Spain, but then experienced frequent military coups and counter-coups until democratic civilian rule was established in 1982. As a result of the War of the Pacific (1879-1883) with Chile, Bolivia lost part of its territory along the Pacific coast and has no sovereign access to the ocean, a source of lingering resentment among Bolivians. Bolivia does have preferential rights of access to the Chilean ports of Antofagasta and Arica and the Peruvian port of Ilo. As a result of the Chaco War with Paraguay (1932-1935), Bolivia lost access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Paraguay river and significant territory. Bolivia is rich in natural resources, with the second-largest natural gas reserves in Latin America after Venezuela and significant mineral deposits, yet 64% of Bolivians live in poverty and 35% earn less than $2 a day.", "Bolivia's population of 9.1 million people is among the most ethnically diverse in South America. Quechua and Aymara are the two predominant indigenous groups who live largely in the altiplano and highland regions. Approximately 30% of the Bolivian population are Quechuan, 25% are Aymaran, 30% are mestizo (mixed), while 15% are of European origin.", "Bolivia has been a major producer of coca leaf, the main ingredient in the production of cocaine. Although coca leaf is legal in the country for traditional uses and is grown legally in some parts of the country, its cultivation for illegal purposes increased in the 1970s and 1980s. Cultivation levels have decreased to half of the levels of the 1990s in response to policies to eradicate illicit production, according to the U.S. State Department. These policies, and the way in which they have been implemented, have caused social unrest and economic hardship in the two main coca-growing regions. One consequence has been the rise of coca growers' trade unions and an associated political party, the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Role of Indigenous Groups", "paragraphs": ["Despite the National Revolution of 1952, in which the Bolivian indigenous benefitted from land reform and expanded suffrage, indigenous groups have historically been under-represented in the Bolivian political system and disproportionately affected by poverty and inequality. In 2002, some 74% of indigenous Bolivians lived in poverty as compared to 53% of the general population.", "In the 1980s, indigenous-based political parties and movements emerged in Bolivia, and by 2006 some 17% of members of the Bolivian Congress self-identified as indigenous. In recent years, indigenous representatives have used the legislature as a forum to advocate for indigenous rights, equitable economic development, and the preservation of indigenous land and culture. Some assert that indigenous groups may gain more strength in the Bolivian political system if there continues to be an alliance between leftist and indigenous struggles, as has occurred since 2000. For example, an indigenous woman presided over the Constituent Assembly and the draft constitution it produced recognizes indigenous autonomy.", "The issues of land tenure and coca cultivation have been long-standing sources of conflict. An Agrarian Reform Law passed in 1996 allows indigenous communities to have legal titles to their communal lands. However, these communities argue that their lands have not been legally defined or protected, and that outsiders have been allowed to exploit their resources. Coca leaf is used legally by indigenous communities for spiritual and medical purposes, and its use is considered an important indigenous cultural right. Previous U.S. and Bolivian policy to eradicate illegal cultivation forcibly was met with violent protests. The Morales government has sought to help resolve these issues by promoting land reform and decriminalizing coca cultivation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Political Instability: 2003-2005", "paragraphs": ["Political protests led to the resignation of President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada on October 17, 2003, just 15 months after he was elected. The 2003 protests were led by indigenous groups and workers concerned about the continuing economic marginalization of the poorer segments of society. The protesters carried out strikes and road blockages that resulted in up to 80 deaths in confrontations with government troops. These events occurred against a backdrop of opposition to U.S.-funded coca eradication programs and to the government's implementation of austere fiscal reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The final spark that preceded S\u00e1nchez de Lozada's resignation was his plan to export natural gas via a port in Chile, a historic adversary of Bolivia.", "Succeeding S\u00e1nchez de Lozada as president was his former vice president, Carlos Mesa, a popular former television journalist and political independent. Mesa appointed a new cabinet, also largely of independents, and demonstrated a sensitivity to indigenous issues. He carried out his promise for a referendum on the export of natural gas. Acceding to demands of indigenous and opposition groups, he also overturned a 1997 decree that had given oil companies ownership of the natural gas they extracted. Mesa also shepherded legislation through Congress that allowed more popular participation in elections. Further, he announced plans for a constituent assembly to consider a new constitution.", "Despite these measures, President Mesa, like his predecessor, proved unable to resolve continuing discord over issues related to the exploitation of Bolivia's natural resources, coca eradication programs, indigenous rights, and the extent of power sharing between the central government and the country's nine departments. In June 2005, Mesa resigned in favor of Eduardo Rodriguez, head of the Supreme Court, in response to continuing street protests that at times paralyzed the country.

Morales captured the presidency with just under 54% of the vote, marking the first time since Bolivia's return to democracy in 1982 that a candidate won an absolute majority in the first round of a presidential election. The MAS won a majority in the lower chamber of the Bolivian Congress, 12 of 27 seats in the Senate, and three of the country's nine governorships (prefectures), with stronger electoral support than any of the country's traditional political parties. On January 22, 2006, Evo Morales became Bolivia's first indigenous president in the country's 180-year history.", "While some analysts forecasted a Morales victory, few predicted that he would win by such a decisive margin. That margin proved that Morales had broadened his support beyond rural, indigenous, union, and lower-middle class voters. Some factors that likely contributed to his victory included the perception that most Bolivians had not benefitted from pro-market economic reforms adopted by previous governments, the corruption of the traditional parties, and the tough, nationalistic stances he had taken against foreign investors and U.S. counternarcotics programs.", "The December 2005 elections were also significant because they included the first direct election of governors (prefects) in Bolivia. Department prefects have traditionally been appointed by the executive and have not been held directly accountable to citizen's demands. Although MAS dominated the presidential and legislative elections, candidates from the new center-right Social and Democratic Power Party (PODEMOS), won most of the gubernatorial races. Ongoing conflicts have since occurred between the Morales government in La Paz and departmental governments regarding the distribution of resources and political power in the country.", "More than halfway through his five-year presidential term, Evo Morales and the MAS have already had a profound effect on Bolivia's political system. Supporters maintain that, despite entrenched opposition to many of his policies, the Morales government has implemented some significant social and economic reforms, such as nationalizing the country's gas industry and starting to enact land reform. Critics argue that the Morales government has used anti-democratic methods, such as encouraging the Constituent Assembly elected in mid-2006 to approve a draft constitution despite a boycott by opposition delegates, in order to impose his will on the country.", "Despite these differing interpretations, most analysts agree that the Morales government has benefitted from high energy prices and that, despite ongoing cycles of civil unrest, President Morales continues to enjoy strong personal approval ratings. Morales recently received the support of 67% of Bolivian voters in a national recall referendum held on August 10, 2008. His governments' position has been strengthened vis-a-vis the opposition prefects by the support he has received from fellow Latin American leaders, the Organization of American States (OAS), and, most recently, the newly-formed Union of South American Nations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constituent Assembly", "paragraphs": ["Since 1990, there have been repeated calls from Bolivian civil society\u2014particularly the indigenous majority\u2014for a new constitution to increase the recognition and participation of the indigenous and other traditionally excluded groups in the political and cultural life of the country. The convocation of a constituent assembly to reform the Bolivian constitution has been a key demand of social protests since 2000. A constituent assembly was originally planned for 2004, but disagreements with the Congress on the subjects to be considered and other logistical considerations postponed it until 2006. In March 2006, President Morales secured passage of legislation establishing elections for a constituent assembly. Elections for assembly delegates were held on July 2, 2006. The MAS captured 50.7% of the popular vote and 137 of 255 seats in the assembly but lacked the two-thirds majority necessary to pass constitutional reforms. Any constitutional reforms approved by two-thirds of the delegates present were then to be voted on by Bolivians in a national referendum. On August 6, 2006, the Constituent Assembly was installed in Sucre, the colonial capital of Bolivia.", "President Morales and his supporters urged the assembly to draft a constitution that would redefine Bolivia as a \"multinational state made up of indigenous groups\" and incorporate indigenous institutions within the national structure. They also favored measures in support of agrarian reform and state ownership of the country's natural resources. Many opposition delegates, particularly those from Bolivia's wealthy eastern provinces, maintained that the MAS proposals could result in a \"radically ethnic\" governing model that is not representative of the entire country. They argued that President Morales was trying to dominate the assembly, as occurred in Venezuela under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Opposition delegates in the assembly pushed for increased regional autonomy from the central government.", "Throughout the assembly process, neither side appeared willing to compromise its positions in order to move negotiations forward. For the first eight months of its deliberations, the assembly was bogged down in a protracted debate over voting procedures. As a result, most of the constitutional commissions did not begin to consider reform proposals until the spring of 2007. In August 2007, the Bolivian Congress reached a last minute agreement to extend the assembly until December 14, 2007.", "By the fall, both sides' positions were becoming deeply entrenched and increasingly divergent. In October 2007, the MAS government introduced a decree, which was approved by the Congress that November, to divert a significant portion of the direct hydrocarbons tax (IDH) revenue that had gone to the departments to pay for a national pension payment for seniors. This provoked heated resistance from the opposition prefects and assembly delegates. At the same time, opposition delegates supported Sucre residents' proposal to move the capital from Laz Paz to Sucre, a seemingly inviolable proposal opposed by most of the MAS delegation. Recurring protests in Sucre, which turned violent, kept the assembly suspended for most the fall. Violent clashes between police and opposition protesters in Sucre in November 2007 resulted in three deaths and dozens of injuries.", "The Constituent Assembly passed a draft constitution on December 9, 2007, but many opposition delegates did not attend the final sessions during which it was approved and have denounced it as unlawful. The draft constitution provides for indigenous rights, communal justice, land redistribution, presidential reelection, and increased federal government control over the country's oil and gas resources. It does not resolve the issue of what size of private land should be considered excessive and therefore vulnerable to government expropriation. President Morales put his plans to convoke a national referendum on the draft constitution on hold until after a national recall referendum was held on August 10, 2008 to determine whether he and the prefects should remain in office.", "After securing some 67% of the votes in the recall referendum, President Morales decided to push forward with constitutional reform. In late August, he issued a decree scheduling a referendum on the constitution passed by the Constituent Assembly for December 7, 2008, a move that prompted widespread protests from the opposition. Then, in a conciliatory response to a national electoral court ruling that challenged the legality of that decree, President Morales sent a bill to the Bolivian Congress seeking its approval to schedule referendums on the constitution and on the question of land ownership. He moved the proposed date of those referendums from December 7, 2008 to January 25, 2009.", "After weeks of protests and confrontations between MAS and opposition supporters, a multiparty commission in the Bolivian Congress took up consideration of the draft constitution passed in December 2007. In order to assuage opposition legislators, the commission made more than 100 changes to the original text of that constitution, including adding a provision that will limit President Morales to one possible reelection. On October 22, 2008, the Bolivian Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of two laws which, taken together, approved the draft constitution, called for referendums on the constitution and on the land issue to be held on January 25, 2009, and scheduled the next general elections for December 2009. While some observers have praised the recent congressional compromise as a victory for both the Morales government and for moderate legislators in the Bolivian Congress, others have criticized the ambiguity of the agreement. ", "On January 25, 2009, the constitution championed by the Morales government won by 61% to 39% and the land ownership limit was set at 5,000 hectares by a wide majority of 81%. The constitution, which had been modified considerably from the one first advocated by the MAS government, guarantees indigenous rights and establishes new arrangements for governance. The bicameral Congress is retained, but the name changed to a \"pluri-national assembly.\" The Senate is enlarged from 27 members to 36 (4 senators from each of the nine departments). The new charter establishes a multi-tiered system allowing for some autonomy\u2014departmental, regional, municipal and indigenous\u2014while the central government retains the control of foreign, fiscal, energy and security policy. The supreme court will be elected rather than appointed as is currently the case. In a change of tone, the U.S. Department of State spokesperson Robert Wood complimented the Bolivian people on their \"successful\" referendum on January 27, 2009.

This movement is largely supported by Bolivia's four wealthy eastern regions. Nine governors or prefects were elected on December 18, 2005; however, their powers have yet to be well-defined. Several of the prefects are pushing for autonomy over budgetary and even military powers. This push for regional autonomy and devolution has caused friction between political and business leaders from the eastern regions and the Morales government in La Paz.", "On July 2, 2006, concurrent with the constituent assembly elections, Bolivia held a referendum on whether to grant increased powers and autonomy to the regional (departmental) governments. According to the law convoking both the Constituent Assembly election and the referendum on regional autonomy, the Assembly delegates would be legally bound to grant increased powers (which are still to be defined) to prefects in the departments where a majority of supporters approve the autonomy measure. The election results revealed the deep socioeconomic and geographic divisions within Bolivia. The country was split as the four wealthy eastern provinces voted strongly in support of increased autonomy, while the other five provinces opposed the measure.", "Notwithstanding the results of the autonomy referendum, the Morales government, including the MAS delegates in the Constituent Assembly, has resisted devolving power or resources to prefects in the four departments that voted in favor of the autonomy measure. President Morales has asserted that gas-producing departments will not receive higher percentages of revenue at the expense of the national government. In November 2006, he proposed legislation that would allow the Bolivian legislature to impeach elected prefects. These moves prompted six of the country's nine prefects to break ties with the MAS government in November 2006 and to launch massive protests in December 2006.", "Conflicts between the eastern prefects and the MAS government in La Paz continued throughout 2007. In mid-January 2007, after the opposition prefect from Cochabamba hinted that he would seek greater regional autonomy, MAS sympathizers launched protests demanding his resignation. Those protests led to violent clashes that left 2 people dead and more than 100 injured. In July 2007, the four eastern prefects commemorated the anniversary of the autonomy referendum by announcing draft autonomy statutes. In late November 2007, the prefects were deeply angered when the Morales government was able to push its proposal to redirect the IDH hydrocarbons revenues from their departmental budgets to pensions for seniors through the Bolivian Congress. They also vehemently opposed the draft constitution passed by the Assembly in early December 2007.", "In response to the draft constitution, four prefects issued autonomy statutes on December 14, 2007. The statutes, though varying by department, generally seek greater departmental control over taxes, land, security, and natural resources than is currently allowed. Whereas plans for a national referendum on constitutional reforms have stalled until recently, departmental referendums on autonomy have been held in four provinces, despite the lack of congressional approval for them to be convened. The statutes received strong popular support from those who voted in each of the referendums held in May and June 2008. The Morales government has used the high abstention rates in those autonomy referendums to minimize their results. According to the constitutional accord approved by the Bolivian Congress on October 22, 2008, the autonomy statutes drafted by the eastern departments will have to be brought into compliance with the new constitution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Economic Situation", "paragraphs": ["Bolivia pursued state-led economic policies during the 1970s and early 1980s. In the mid-1980s, however, external shocks, the collapse of tin prices, and higher interest rates combined with hyperinflation forced Bolivian governments to adopt austerity measures. Bolivia was one of the first countries in Latin America to implement an IMF structural adjustment program. In the 1990s, many state-owned corporations were privatized. Gross domestic product growth from 1990 to 2000 averaged 3.5%, but the economy remained highly dependent on foreign aid and had an extremely high debt/GDP ratio. Sluggish economic growth in 2001 and 2002 (1.2% and 2.5%, respectively) fueled resentment that the benefits of globalization and free market economic policies were not reaching most of the population.", "Bolivia posted faster growth rates of roughly 4% in both 2004 and 2005. Strong international demand for Bolivian mining products and gas, as well as high tax revenues from the natural gas sector, fueled growth of about 4% in 2006. Bolivia's GDP grew by close to 4% again in 2007, despite significant flooding that damaged much of the country's agricultural production. Economic growth was driven by strong performance in the construction, financial services, manufacturing, and hydrocarbons sectors. Despite that growth, some 63% of Bolivians live in poverty with 34.3% earning less than $2 a day. Future growth will likely be constrained by declining foreign investment and the country's high debt burden, among other things.", "President Morales opposes free market economic policies and supports more state involvement in economic policy-making and greater government spending on infrastructure, health, and education. In June 2006, the MAS unveiled a five-year national development plan (2006-2010) calling for $6.9 billion in government investment complemented by $6 billion of private investment, particularly in the housing, infrastructure, and small business sectors. The plan aims to increase GDP growth to 7.6% by 2010, create 90,000 jobs annually and reduce the percentage of the population living in poverty to below 50%. Critics of the plan argue that it lacks a clear financing plan and is overly ambitious.", "The Morales government has also negotiated for further debt relief from the major international donors. On July 1, 2006, the World Bank announced that Bolivia would receive a total of $1.8 billion in total debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.

The members of the Andean Community have requested an extension of trade benefits from the United States and started negotiating a free trade agreement with the European Union. The future of the CAN had been in question after Venezuela suddenly quit the trading block in April 2006 because it opposed free trade agreements negotiations conducted by Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia with the United States. Bolivia is also an associate member of Mercosur, the trading block composed of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and, as of July 2006, Venezuela. In May 2006, the Morales government signed a trade and cooperation agreement with Cuba and Venezuela. Morales and the MAS opposed the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and have been critical of the type of bilateral and sub-regional trade agreements reached by other countries in Latin America with the United States.", "Investors are concerned about the ad-hoc nature of the Morales government's economic policy. They are also worried about Morales' stated goal of increasing state control over mining, energy, transport, and telecommunications. Inflation, which reached 12% in 2008, has become a major challenge for the government to address. Some predict that the global financial crisis could reduce demand for Bolivia's commodity exports and weaken remittance inflows from Bolivians living abroad, thereby causing economic growth to slow in 2009. Some maintain that the job losses and lost revenue resulting from the suspension of Bolivia's ATPA trade benefits is likely to dampen growth in some sectors. Estimates of job losses resulting from the loss of ATPA benefits range from 12,000 to 50,000. While GDP growth was an estimated 6% in 2008, several factors threaten to sharply decelerate growth in 2009\u2014weakening export markets, reduced investment, lower remittances, as mentioned above, and rising unemployment.

In addition, Bolivia lacks the technological and financial capacity to develop its natural gas resources without significant foreign investment.", "Despite these limitations, most Bolivians believe that their government needs to assert greater control over its natural resources in order to ensure that the revenues they produce are used to benefit the country as a whole. In a June 2004 referendum, more than 92% of Bolivians support an increased state role in gas exploration and production, while stopping short of nationalization. As a result of the referendum, then-president Carlos Mesa sent legislation to the Congress to replace the 1996 Hydrocarbons Law, which had opened Bolivia's hydrocarbons sector to private investment. The state-owned energy company Yacimientos Petroliferos e Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) would resume a more active role in oil and gas operations. The proposed legislation raised taxes on oil and gas production and reestablished state ownership of oil and gas \"at the wellhead.\"", "In May 2005, the Bolivian Congress enacted its own version of hydrocarbons legislation that created a non-deductible 32% Direct Tax on Hydrocarbons (IDH) that would apply to production and maintained the current 18% royalty rate. Foreign oil companies vehemently criticized the law, but most elected to comply with its terms, at least in the short-term. As a result of the tax hikes, some companies initiated legal action over having their existing contracts rewritten and investment reduced, and predicted that new investments would not be feasible in Bolivia.", "On May 1, 2006, President Morales fulfilled his campaign pledge to nationalize the country's natural gas industry. As a result of the May 2006 nationalization measure, the Bolivian government's income from gas and oil rose to an estimated $1.57 billion in 2007 (compared to $173 million in 2002). The nationalization measure significantly raised energy costs for neighboring Argentina and Brazil and raised tax and royalty rates to a level that some investors perceived to be unprofitable. As a result, Brazil's Petrobras and Spain's Repsol-YPF\u2014the largest foreign investors in Bolivia's energy sector\u2014halted new investments in the country through the end of 2007. Owing to a lack of investment in production, Bolivia is currently unable to fulfill its domestic needs for natural gas and meet the contract demands of Brazil and Argentina. State oil companies from a number of countries (including Petrobras and Repsol) have pledged to make significant investments in Bolivia which could enable it to boost production. Critics of the nationalization measure assert that, even with new investments, YPFB still lacks the capacity to develop Bolivia's gas resources.", "In early January 2009, Bolivian gas exports to Brazil suddenly declined by a third because of hydropower increases available in Brazil and lowering demand due to the economic downturn. On January 8, 2009, Bolivia sent an emergency delegation to Brazil to reverse this development, and Petrobas announced it would maintain its gas purchases from Bolivia at around 24 million cubic meters a day down from the 31 million cubic meters a day it was receiving in December 2008. Argentina, Bolivia's only other client for natural gas exports, agreed to increase its daily intake by 5 million cubic meters absorbing some of the excess production made available by Brazil's cutback. These events shook the Bolivian government and made clear that Bolivia's failure in attracting investment in the sector and opening new markets for gas exports makes it vulnerable to continued fluctuations in demand from Brazil, which are likely as Brazil develops its own domestic supply more inexpensively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coca Cultivation", "paragraphs": ["The coca leaf has been used for thousands of years by indigenous communities in the Andean region for spiritual and medical purposes, and its use is considered an important indigenous cultural right. The coca leaf is also a primary component of cocaine, an illicit narcotic. Since the 1960s, coca leaf and coca paste produced in Bolivia have been shipped to Colombia to be processed into cocaine. At the height of its production, the Chapare region of Bolivia\u2014a jungle region stretching from the eastern Andes mountains to the Amazon\u2014produced enough coca leaf to make some $25 billion worth of cocaine per year.", "Since the 1980s, successive Bolivian governments, with financial and technical assistance from the United States, have tried various strategies to combat illicit coca production. In 1988, Bolivia passed legislation criminalizing coca growing outside 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares) in the Yungas region that was set aside to meet the country's traditional demand for coca. During the 1990s, the Bolivian government tried to implement that drug control law by paying coca growers to eradicate their crops. After this policy produced only modest results, the Banzer-Quiroga administration (1997-2002), implemented a forced eradication program focusing on the Chapare region. Although the program dramatically reduced coca cultivation in Bolivia, human rights abuses were committed by security forces during its implementation. In addition, the government failed to implement viable alternative development programs to benefit coca growers and their families. Forced eradication caused economic hardship and fueled social discontent in the Chapare region. Frequent clashes between coca growers and security forces, which occasionally turned violent, de-stabilized the region and the country as a whole.", "This ongoing conflict continued until October 3, 2004, when Chapare growers, led by Evo Morales and others, signed a one-year agreement with the Mesa government, which permitted limited coca production in the region and replaced forced eradication with a more cooperative, voluntary approach. Under the agreement, each family is allowed to produce one cato (1,600 square meters) of coca, but any coca grown beyond that is subject to eradication. U.S. State Department figures found that drug cultivation in Bolivia increased by 8% in 2005 compared to the previous year, but the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported an 8% decrease in cultivation for the same period. UNODC credited that reduction largely to the success of the Chapare agreement. Regardless of its merits, the Chapare agreement was only supposed to remain in place if a European Union-funded study, which just got underway in 2007 after a long delay, concluded that the \"traditional\" demand for coca in Bolivia exceeds the current 12,000 hectares allowed by law. Critics argue that since, according to police sources, some 99% of the coca grown in the Chapare goes to the cocaine industry, it is not going to meet traditional demand for coca and must therefore be eradicated.", "Evo Morales and the MAS have developed a \"coca yes, cocaine no\" policy for Bolivia based on the principles of the Chapare agreement. The policy seeks to (1) recognize the positive attributes of the coca leaf; (2) industrialize coca for licit uses; (3) continue \"rationalization\" of coca (voluntary eradication) in the Chapare and extend it to other regions; and, (4) increase interdiction of cocaine and other illicit drugs at all stages of production.", "President Morales has sought to decriminalize coca growing and his government is trying to develop alternative uses of the coca plant for products such as coca tea. Venezuela is funding the restoration of two factories in the Yungas region for the industrialization of coca products\u2014such as baking flour and toothpaste\u2014for export. In June 2006, President Morales announced a plan to end the current division of the Yungas region into legal and illegal coca growing zones, to allow licensed growers to sell coca directly to consumers, and to permit each family in the Yungas to grow one cato of coca. In July 2006, his government then targeted some 3,000 hectares in the Yungas for cooperative eradication, marking the first time that the Bolivian government has attempted eradication in that region. According to the U.S. Department of State's International Narcotics Strategy Control Report covering 2007, the Morales government met its coca eradication targets for 2007 and seized more cocaine base, marijuana, and precursor chemicals than in 2006.", "Proponents of the \"coca yes, cocaine no\" policy argue that it is a culturally sensitive approach to coca eradication that is widely accepted in Bolivia. For those reasons, they believe that, although it may take time to show results, it stands a much better chance of being successful than previous forced eradication programs. They assert that Morales' experience as a coca grower has enabled him to negotiate agreements with producers in regions where prior governments were unable to limit coca cultivation. Critics of Morales' coca policy argue that it is based on the false premises that traditional demand for coca exceeds the current legal threshold, and that there are viable markets outside Bolivia for licit coca-based products. They assert that both the \"rationalization\" policies and the December 2006 MAS proposal to expand the areas allowed for licit cultivation may encourage further increases in illegal drug cultivation and processing in both the Chapare and Yungas regions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land Reform", "paragraphs": ["Extreme land concentration and the lack of indigenous access to arable land has been a long-standing cause of rural poverty in Bolivia.

In 1996, Bolivia passed an Agrarian Reform Law 1996 that allows indigenous communities to have legal title to their communal lands. However, these communities argue that their lands have not been legally defined or protected and that outsiders have been allowed to exploit their resources.

According to the government, about one-third of the land to be distributed is state-owned, and the additional two-thirds would be reclaimed from individuals or companies that own land in the eastern lowlands without legal titles or with illegally obtained titles.", "This land redistribution policy has been vehemently opposed by the agro-industrial sector and other large landowners in the Santa Cruz region, who see it as a threat to their livelihoods.

Although press reports have described the agrarian reform bill as \"radical,\" some observers maintain that it does not represent a dramatic departure from the land policy enacted in 1996. The new agrarian reform law stipulates that government land, unused tracts of private land, and land that was illegally acquired will be distributed to settlers, peasants, and indigenous peoples.
