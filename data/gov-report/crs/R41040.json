Federal energy spending represents upwards of 1% of its total budget (discretionary and mandatory spending). Since the 1970s, Congress has enacted various laws that reduce energy consumption in the federal sector by improving energy efficiency. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) included measures to reduce energy and water in congressional buildings, install advanced meters to reduce electricity use in federal buildings, enact performance standards to improve federal buildings, and to reduce the federal government's electric energy consumption through renewable energy offsets (P.L. 109-58). The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) mandated further energy savings measures in government operations, including energy upgrades to the Capitol complex, permanent authority to use \"energy savings performance contracts,\" and federal procurement of energy efficient products and renewable fuels (P.L. 110-140).", "Two recent executive orders guide federal agencies in reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions. In 2007, Executive Order 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental Energy, and Transportation Management directed federal agencies to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing energy intensity. In 2009, Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance established GHG emissions reduction goals for federal agencies.", "Federal agencies can take advantage of several financing mechanisms to make energy efficiency improvements without increasing their operating budgets. These include Energy Savings Performance Contracts, Utility Energy Savings Contracts, and Power Purchase Agreements. In some cases, agencies may share in the savings gained from reduced energy costs made through the improvements. New authority to combine appropriated funds with energy savings performance contracts could further energy efficiency improvements, but the lack of federal rules delays implementation. However, federal agencies may be reluctant to participate in this financing option if it reduces their opportunity to retain savings from the improvements.", "The new GHG reduction goals come after three decades of effort to reduce energy consumption. GHG emissions associated with operating federal buildings result from consuming fossil fuels used in generating electricity and heating. Significant energy reduction resulted early from easily achievable, low-cost improvements that translate into GHG reductions. The opportunity for GHG reductions in the future may come through smaller, more difficult to achieve reductions in energy consumption based on high-tech solutions.", "The prospect of reducing the federal budget by reducing energy consumption may be low.

Buildings consumed roughly 40% of energy end-use, while vehicles consumed the remaining and most significant portion\u201463%. Overall, energy costs represented less than 1% of the total federal (discretionary and mandatory) spending for that year, roughly $2,655 billion (1.7 % if compared to discretionary spending only, some $1,017 billion). In the larger picture, federal energy consumption represented only 1.1% of the total United States energy use in 2006\u201499.61 quads. The federal government is the largest single purchaser of energy in the United States. Advocates for improving energy efficiency, achieving energy independence, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions believe the federal government can show leadership by reducing its federal energy use.", "Federal government initiatives to reduce energy consumption originated with the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) in 1973. The 1978 National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA\u2014 P.L. 95-619 ) instituted the program of retrofitting federal buildings to improve energy efficiency. The 1985 Deficit Reduction Act ( P.L. 99-272 ) amended NECPA by authorizing energy savings contracts of up to 25 years. NECPA also required that federal agencies report the energy consumed annually by their buildings, operations, and vehicles. FEMP compiles the consumption data and estimates related carbon emissions (excluding certain exempt facilities) in an annual report to Congress.", "In 1988, the Federal Energy Management Improvement Act ( P.L. 100-615 ) amended NECPA by requiring federal agencies to achieve a 10% reduction in energy consumption in federal buildings by FY1995 when measured against an FY1985 baseline in terms of British thermal units per gross square-foot (Btu/gsf) of building floor-space.", "The 1992 Energy Policy Act ( P.L. 102-486 ) further amended NECPA by adopting direct and indirect incentives to promote energy efficiency in federal buildings. It authorized and encouraged agencies to participate in utility-offered programs to increase energy efficiency, water conservation, and electricity demand. The act authorized agencies to accept any financial incentive, goods, or services that utilities offered to increase energy efficiency, conserve water, or manage electricity demand, and encouraged agencies to enter into negotiations addressing the unique needs of their facilities. A financial bonus program, established by the act, provided direct financial incentives to reward outstanding federal facility energy managers. Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) authorized under the act, offered federal agencies indirect incentives to make energy efficiency improvements through private funding that agencies pay back with energy savings.", "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) included various provisions for reducing energy and water use in federal buildings. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) mandated further energy savings measures throughout government operations and facilities, and permanently reauthorized \"energy savings performance contracts.\" Executive Order 13423 (Strengthening Federal Environmental Energy, and Transportation Management) directed federal agencies to reduce GHG emissions by reducing energy intensity. Executive Order 13514 (Federal leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance) followed with GHG reduction goals for federal agencies.

The ESCO guarantees that the improvements will generate energy cost savings sufficient to pay for the project over the term of the contract (terms up to 25 years are allowed). After the contract ends, all additional cost savings accrue to the agency. FEMP-streamlined \"Super ESPCs\" allow agencies to undertake multiple energy projects under the same contract in order to bypass cumbersome procurement procedures.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores ESPCs as future financial obligations on the federal government. CBO began scoring ESPCs as mandatory spending when the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act ( P.L. 101-508 ) pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules expired. The CBO scoring reflects how ESPCs create future commitments to appropriations, consistent with how appropriations-funded energy conservation improvement would be scored throughout the budget. ", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that federal agencies could achieve the benefits of ESPCs with lower financing costs by using upfront funds (that is, full funding in advance). As federal agencies generally did not receive sufficient funds upfront to make energy efficiency improvements, they had to rely on ESPCs in meeting their energy conservation goals. Agencies had previously indentified energy conservation improvements in their annual budget requests until the National Energy Policy Act 1992 allowed federal agencies to treat energy conservations measures as \"energy costs to be incurred in operating and maintaining (O&M) agency facilities.\" EISA 2007 now permits federal agencies to use a combination of appropriated funds and private financing for ESPCs. DOE interprets this provision as explicitly authorizing the payments from one-time avoided costs that originate from authorized sources, including appropriations specifically for energy improvements. However, how agencies practicably apply appropriated O&M funds to ESPCs is unclear, as DOE has not yet promulgated rules on the new authority. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) indicates in Circular No. A-11 (2009) that consistent with 42 U.S.C. 8255 agencies should identify funds requested for energy conservations measures in their budget justification.

In its recent report on federal energy management, GAO concluded that agencies would likely face challenges meeting EISA energy-reduction goals.

Generators usually sell RECs in one megawatt-hour units, and may sell them separately from the physical electricity with which they are associated. This provides customers the flexibility to offset a percentage of their annual energy use with RECs generated elsewhere (but not necessarily transmitted through the grid to them). ", "Wind-generated electricity currently accounts for most renewable energy purchased by the federal government, but offers agencies limited potential for site-generated energy. Consequently, agencies purchase wind RECs to take advantage of the source. Solar photovoltaic electricity does offer agencies the opportunity for site-generated renewable energy, primarily throughout the Southwestern regions of the United States and Hawaii. In cases where DOD installations may offer property to developers of photovoltaic farms (through enhanced use lease authority under 10 U.S.C. 2667), DOD may still have to purchase the generated electricity through the grid (i.e., as RECs). It is not clear whether an agency will be able to take advantage of the double-credit for site-generated renewable energy under EO 13423.", "The Alliance to Save Energy concluded over a decade ago that dispersed decision-making among federal agency staff, and each agency's unique legal requirements and stakeholder demands, create barriers to increased energy efficiency. The Alliance identified several specific barriers that remain relevant to varying degrees:", "Energy efficiency is not a core-mission of agency. Agencies lack personnel skilled in energy matters. Capital budgeting for energy improvements up front is difficult. Budget shortfalls. Too many decision makers. Lack of carrots and sticks to change institutional behavior.", "Since the Alliance's report, agencies have taken advantage of energy manager training and incentives such as ESPCs. Capital budgeting still offers challenges, as discussed further below.", "Finally, electricity represented only 1.06 quads or 17.6% of total federal energy-use in 2006. Buildings consumed the power almost exclusively. The federal government spent roughly $3.7 billion at an average cost of $78/megawatt-hour. Spending on electricity represented the equivalent of one-third of 1% of the federal discretionary budget. At that time, electricity rates ranged from 8.2\u00a2/kilowatt-hour for industrial users to 12.0\u00a2/kilowatt-hour for commercial users (or $82 to $120/megawatt-hours). EISA's 30% energy reduction goal for federal buildings could represent a $1.1 billion in savings if the reduction comes from reduced electricity use, assuming rates stayed constant. This would equate to roughly one-tenth of 1% of the 2006 discretionary budget. ", "In the case of ESPCs, agencies \"locked-in\" the pre-improvement budget for energy in order to pay for the energy improvement, which also allows the agencies to retain the balance of their energy savings. Under EISA, agencies may now combine appropriated funds with the contractor-financed portion of the improvement. DOE has not yet promulgated final rules on agencies' use of appropriated funds for this purpose. In the case of the Department of Defense, capital construction and operating budgets are separate appropriations. Under the EISA/ESPC provision, a DOD facility could feasibly benefit from improvements under both funding mechanisms. This may not be a clear-cut case for agencies with combined capital and operating budgets. ", "The federal government's prospect of seeing energy reduction translated into a budget reduction may be low. However, policy makers may want to weigh the direct monetary savings against the clean energy benefits of renewable energy in terms of avoided emissions of regulated pollutants and greenhouse gases to the environment.", "When the federal government embarked on its energy efficiency mission (following NECPA), the highest payback came from low cost, easily achieved improvements; for example, replacing incandescent lights with fluorescent lights, adding insulation, and upgrading window glazing. Further energy reduction came from, and most likely will continue to depend on, improved technology; examples include ENERGY STAR products, and more-efficient heating-ventilation-and-cooling (HVAC) equipment.
