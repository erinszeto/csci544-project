Pakistani officials have also indicated that this nuclear posture is designed to preserve territorial integrity against Indian attack, prevent military escalation, and counter India's conventional superiority. Air Commodore Khalid Banuri, Director of Arms Control and Disarmament Affairs in Pakistan's Strategic Plans Division, explained in December 2011 that Islamabad's nuclear arsenal is part of an effort \"to deny India the space for launching any kind of aggression against Pakistan.\" More recently, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesperson asserted in a September 3, 2013, statement that the country's \"nuclear deterrence capability is aimed at maintaining regional stability in South Asia.\" Pakistani Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry explained in October 2015 that the country's \"nuclear programme is one dimensional: stopping Indian aggression before it happens. It is not for starting a war. It is for deterrence.\" ", "Despite Islamabad's stated wish to avoid a nuclear arms race with New Delhi, Pakistan appears to be increasing its fissile production capability and improving its delivery vehicles in order to hedge against possible increases in India's nuclear arsenal and also to deter Indian conventional military action. Indeed, aspects of the credible minimum deterrence doctrine have always been ambiguous and the concept appears to have changed over time. A 2013 State Department report explains that Islamabad has not \"publicly articulated clear requirements or quantified what stockpile of nuclear weapons and fissile material would be sufficient to achieve\" its credible minimum deterrence posture. Pakistani officials have argued that a variety of nuclear arsenals could satisfy credible minimum deterrence; Air Commodore Banuri asserted in December 2011 that Pakistan's \"deterrence requirement remains dynamic\" and a precise number of nuclear weapons to satisfy this requirement \"cannot be quantified.\" He also argued that \"India's massive conventional military build up, the India-U.S. nuclear deal,\" and India's pursuit of missile defense systems, forced Pakistan \"to make qualitative and quantitative adjustments\" to its nuclear arsenal. Banuri also cited Indian military doctrines that Islamabad describes as prescribing rapid conventional military action against Pakistan. ", "Describing the evolution of Pakistan's deterrent, General Kidwai explained that the nuclear program \"started with a concept of credible minimum deterrence,\" but Islamabad \"translated it ... to the concept of full spectrum deterrence.\" Kidwai added that Pakistan developed this doctrine in response to possible Indian rapid conventional military attacks, arguing that some Indian officials were \"toying with the idea of finding space for conventional war,\" because Pakistan lacked non-strategic nuclear weapons and New Delhi did not believe that Islamabad would retaliate with its other nuclear weapons. Pakistani Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz asserted in July 2016 that Pakistan's \"tactical nuclear weapons were a response\" to a potential sudden Indian conventional attack.", "Pakistani officials have argued that non-strategic nuclear weapons can increase the credibility of its nuclear deterrent versus Indian conventional military operations. General Kidwai argued that \"by introducing the variety of tactical nuclear weapons in Pakistan's inventory, and in the strategic stability debate, we have blocked the avenues for serious military operations by the other side.\" In 2011, Kidwai described the first test of the NASR missile as \"a very important milestone in consolidating Pakistan's strategic deterrence capability at all levels of the threat spectrum.\" Some observers have expressed concern that such weapons could increase the risk of nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan for at least two reasons. First, Pakistani military commanders could lose the ability to prevent the use of such weapons, which would be more portable and mobile than Islamabad's current nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles. Second, Pakistani forces may launch non-strategic nuclear weapons in order to counter possible Indian preemptive attacks on those weapons' launch platforms. ", "Pakistani officials have also argued that the ambiguity concerning Islamabad's no-first-use policy serves to maintain deterrence against India's conventional superiority; a Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated May 21, 2009, that \"there are acquisitions of sophisticated weaponry by our neighbour which will disturb the conventional balance between our two countries and hence, lower the nuclear threshold.\" Other analysts argue that keeping the first-use option against New Delhi allows Islamabad to conduct operations, such as support for low intensity conflict or proxy war in Kashmir, while effectively deterring India at the strategic level. In any case, Pakistani statements suggest that the government has a high threshold for using nuclear weapons. According to a 2012 State Department report, Pakistan previously has said that \"nuclear use would be a 'last resort' under circumstances that are 'unthinkable.'\"", "Nevertheless, Pakistani officials have said for some time that the government may need to increase significantly its nuclear arsenal in response to possible Indian plans to do the same. According to an April 2006 television broadcast, Pakistani officials from the government's National Command Authority (NCA) expressed \"concern\" that the 2008 U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement could tilt the strategic balance between India and Pakistan in favor of the former. The officials suggested that Islamabad may need to increase or improve its nuclear arsenal in order to \"to meet all requirements of minimum credible defence deterrence.\" Similarly, according to the January 2010 statement, the NCA identified \"developments detrimental to the objectives of strategic stability in the region,\" including India's acquisition of \"advanced weapons systems\" and missile defense systems. The NCA also noted that the 2008 decision by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to exempt India from some of its export guidelines, as well as subsequent nuclear fuel supply agreements that New Delhi has concluded with several governments, \"would enable India to produce substantial quantities of fissile material for nuclear weapons by freeing up its domestic resources.\" The statement suggests that Pakistan could increase or improve its nuclear weapons in response to these developments, but does not explicitly say so. Shahzad Chaudhry, a retired Pakistani Air Vice Marshall, argued during a July 18, 2011, U.S. Institute of Peace event that India's stockpile of reactor-grade plutonium is an additional concern for Pakistan.", "India has stated that it needs only a \"credible minimum deterrent,\" but New Delhi has never defined what it means by such a deterrent and has refused to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Furthermore, both the 2008 U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement and associated NSG decision renewed New Delhi's access to the international uranium market. This access has apparently resulted in more indigenous Indian uranium available for weapons because it will not be consumed by India's newly safeguarded reactors. Pakistani officials have offered estimates for the number of additional nuclear weapons that New Delhi could build. For example, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, argued in an October 2010 letter to a British newspaper that eight Indian nuclear reactors that will not be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards have the potential to produce 280 nuclear weapons annually. India currently has approximately 110-120 nuclear weapons, according to one public estimate.", "Whether and to what extent Pakistan intends to continue increasing its nuclear arsenal is unclear. General Kidwai asserted in 2015 that the country's nuclear weapons program \"is not open ended\" and indicated that Islamabad will not increase the number of weapons significantly during the next 10-15 years. \"There's no need\" for Pakistan to develop longer-range missiles than it currently possesses, he added. Current and former Pakistani officials have also argued that the country has achieved its goal of deterring Indian conventional attacks. \"War is no more an option,\" Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry stated in October 2015. Despite its increasing nuclear arsenal, Pakistan \"reaffirmed\" in a May 17, 2016, joint statement with the United States that Islamabad \"will not be the first in its region to resume nuclear testing\" \"Pakistan has neither the need nor intention to test nuclear weapons and would sign the CTBT if India were to do the same,\" a former Pakistani official knowledgeable about the country's nuclear weapons program stated on July 14."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Command and Control", "paragraphs": ["Pakistan's command and control over its nuclear weapons is compartmentalized and includes strict operational security.

It warrants mention that, although separate storage may provide a layer of protection against accidental launch or prevent theft of an assembled weapon, it may be easier for unauthorized people to remove a weapon's fissile material core if it is not assembled. Dispersal of the assets may also create more potential access points for acquisition and may increase the risk of diversion.", "As the United States prepared to attack the Afghan Taliban after September 11, 2001, then-President Musharraf reportedly ordered that Pakistan's nuclear arsenal be redeployed to \"at least six secret new locations.\" This action came at a time of uncertainly about the future of the region, including the direction of U.S.-Pakistan relations. Islamabad's leadership was uncertain whether the United States would decide to conduct military strikes against Pakistan's nuclear assets if the government did not assist the United States against the Taliban. Indeed, then-President Musharraf cited protection of Pakistan's nuclear and missile assets as one of the reasons for Islamabad's dramatic policy shift. ", "These events, in combination with the 1999 Kargil crisis, the 2002 conflict with India at the Line of Control, and revelations about the A.Q. Khan proliferation network, inspired a variety of reforms to secure the nuclear complex. Risk of nuclear war in South Asia ran high during the 1999 Kargil crisis, when, according to former William J. Clinton Administration officials, the Pakistani military began preparing missiles to deliver nuclear weapons. It should be noted that, even at the high alert levels of 2001 and 2002, there were no reports of Pakistan mating the warheads with delivery systems.", "In the fall of 2007 and early 2008, some observers expressed concern about the security of the country's arsenal if political instability were to persist. Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in a November 5, 2007, interview that, although then-President Musharraf claimed to be in firm control of the nuclear arsenal, she feared this control could weaken due to instability in the country. Similarly, Michael Krepon of the Henry L. Stimson Center has argued that \"a prolonged period of turbulence and infighting among the country's President, Prime Minister, and Army Chief\" could jeopardize the army's unity of command, which \"is essential for nuclear security.\" U.S. military officials also expressed concern about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Experts also worry that while nuclear weapons are currently under firm control, with warheads disassembled, technology could be sold off by insiders during a worsened crisis. ", "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen described U.S. concern about the matter during a September 22, 2008, speech:", "To the best of my ability to understand it\u2014and that is with some ability\u2014the weapons there are secure. And that even in the change of government, the controls of those weapons haven't changed. That said, they are their weapons. They're not my weapons. And there are limits to what I know. Certainly at a worst-case scenario with respect to Pakistan, I worry a great deal about those weapons falling into the hands of terrorists and either being proliferated or potentially used. And so, control of those, stability, stable control of those weapons is a key concern. And I think certainly the Pakistani leadership that I've spoken with on both the military and civilian side understand that.", "U.S. officials have stated that U.S. knowledge of Pakistan's arsenal is limited. For example, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mullen stated during a May 14, 2009, hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee that \"we're limited in what we actually know\" about Islamabad's nuclear arsenal. Nevertheless, U.S. officials have expressed confidence regarding the security of Islamabad's nuclear weapons. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Stewart stated in February 2016 that \"Islamabad continues to take steps to improve its nuclear security, and is aware of the threat presented by extremists to its program.\" More recently, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated on October 15, 2015, that ", "we continue to have confidence that the government of Pakistan is well aware of the range of potential threats to its nuclear arsenal, and we continue to be confident that Pakistan has a professional and dedicated security force that understands the importance and the high priority that the world places on nuclear security.", "Ambassador Olson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on December 16, 2015, that Washington has \"confidence in the capabilities of ... the Pakistani security forces to control and secure their nuclear weapons,\" adding that Islamabad has \"specifically taken into account the insider threat\" to its nuclear arsenal. A former Administration official wrote in September 2014 that ", "The likelihood [of] terrorists obtaining nuclear weapons or nuclear material from Pakistani facilities is currently very low because of the extraordinary measures the Pakistan government and military have taken over the last decade... Pakistani nuclear materials do not pose the concerns that they once did.", "Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Rose Gottemoeller expressed confidence in the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal during a March 17, 2016, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, but added that Pakistan's \"battlefield nuclear weapons\" are a security concern because such weapons \"cannot be made as secure\" when deployed.", "Other governments have also voiced opinions regarding the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. For example, Indian National Security Adviser M. K. Narayanan said that the arsenal is safe and has adequate checks and balances. Similarly, then-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband told the Charlie Rose Show on December 15, 2008, that Islamabad's nuclear weapons \" are under pretty close lock and key.\" Furthermore, according to Director of the French General Directorate of External Security Erard Corbin de Mangoux, Pakistan's military and civilian leaders have a \"sense of responsibility\" to maintain control over the country's nuclear weapons; these leaders \"know that the international status to which they aspire depends directly on their ability to exercise complete control over such an instrument of power,\" he argued in an interview published in spring 2010. ", "Other non-U.S. officials, however, have sounded somewhat less optimistic. For example, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said in a March 24, 2009, television interview that Moscow is \"very much concerned\" about the security of Pakistan's arsenal. Indian officials expressed concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal following the May 2011 insurgent attack on the Karachi military installation.", "Pakistani officials have consistently expressed confidence in the security of the country's nuclear arsenal. Then-President Musharraf stated in November 2007 that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are under \"total custodial controls.\" According to Pakistan's 2014 Nuclear Security Summit statement, the country's \"nuclear security regime is anchored in the principle of multi-layered defense for the entire spectrum of any nuclear threat\" and includes a \"specially trained Special Response Force,\" an \"integrated intelligence system\" and \"[f]orce validation exercises.\" The SPD \"has two separate divisions to oversee security and intelligence, with more than 25,000 personnel between them,\" according to SPD official Adil Sultan. ", "Pakistan has also cited its Centre of Excellence on Nuclear Security to bolster its nuclear security credentials. In its 2016 Nuclear Security Summit statement, Islamabad explained that the center, in conjunction with two other Pakistani government bodies, provides \"exhaustive education and training in areas including physical protection, material control and accounting, transport security, cyber security and personnel reliability.\" In addition, the government points to its status as a party to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, including the 2005 amendment to the convention. ", "The May 2011 U.S. strike that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden generated a public discussion in Pakistan as to whether a country such as India or the United States could successfully attack and destroy Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Responding to these concerns, then-Prime Minster Gilani stated May 25, 2011, that the country's \"strategic assets are well protected and our capability to defend our sovereignty, territorial integrity and liberties of our people, is very much in place.\"", "In addition to the above scenarios, the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons could also be jeopardized by another conflict between India and Pakistan, Michael Krepon argued, explaining that an \"escalating war with nuclear forces in the field would increase the probability of accidents, miscalculations, and the use of nuclear weapons\" because ", "[w]hen tensions rise precipitously with India, the readiness level of Pakistan's nuclear deterrent also rises. Because the geographical coordinates of Pakistan's main nuclear weapon storage sites, missile, and air bases can be readily identified from satellites\u2014and therefore targeted by opposing forces\u2014the dictates of deterrence mandate some movement of launchers and weapons from fixed locations during crises. Nuclear weapons on the move are inherently less secure than nuclear weapons at heavily-guarded storage sites. Weapons and launchers in motion are also more susceptible to \"insider\" threats and accidents. ", "Such a war, Krepon added, would also place stress on the army's unity of command.
