The redistricting process determines where those seats are geographically located within each state. Apportionment allocates the seats by state, while redistricting draws the maps.", "Redistricting is a state process governed by federal law. Much of this law is judicially imposed because, in 1929, Congress let lapse its standards requiring districts to be made up of \"contiguous and compact territory and containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants.\" If Congress chooses to legislate again in this area, its authority will come from Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, granting the authority to Congress to change state laws pertaining to congressional elections.", "The goal of redistricting is to draw boundaries around geographic areas such that each district results in \"fair\" representation. An effort to favor one group of interests over another by using the redistricting process to distort this fairness is often referred to as gerrymandering. Aside from distorting representation, it is believed by some that such gerrymandering diminishes electoral responsiveness by minimizing political competition among the parties.", "Many of the \"rules\" or criteria for drawing congressional boundaries are meant to enhance fairness and minimize the impact of gerrymandering. These rules, standards, or criteria include assuring population equality among districts within the same state; protecting racial and language minorities from vote dilution while at the same time not promoting racial segregation; promoting geographic compactness and contiguity when drawing districts; minimizing the number of split political subdivisions and \"communities of interest\" within congressional districts; and preserving historical stability in the cores of previous congressional districts.", "Most redistricting is currently done by state legislatures. Some believe that allowing redistricting to be the purview of state legislators promotes, at best, status quo districts protecting incumbents and, at worst, blatant partisan gerrymandering that can lead to a decade of one-party dominance. Reform efforts mostly have aimed at transferring the redistricting task from state legislatures to independent redistricting commissions. Efforts at creating these commissions have been successful at the state level; however, proposed federal legislation (for the 112th Congress, see H.R. 453, H.R. 590, H.R. 3846, and S. 694) to create such commissions within all states has not been successful."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Every 10 years, through the apportionment and redistricting processes within each state, Congress and the states attempt to create a U.S. House of Representatives that reflects a fair representation of the people of the United States.

Once the reapportionment of seats among the states is complete, congressional district boundaries are subject to change by state governments in all states with more than one district. The goals of the redistricting process within states are that each congressional district shall be represented by a single Member; nearly equal in population within each state; and moderately unequal in population among states.", "The U.S. Constitution (Article 1, Section 2 as amended by the 14 th Amendment, Section 2) requires that \"representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.\" The requirement that districts must be apportioned among states means district boundaries cannot cross state lines. The Constitution, also in Article 1, Section 2, sets a minimum size for the House of Representatives (one Representative for each state) and a maximum size for the House (one Representative for every 30,000 persons). Congress is free to choose a House size (with the concurrence of the President) within these boundaries. ", "The single-member district is now the norm in the United States House of Representatives. States with more than one Representative are divided into districts that are each represented by one Member. There have been exceptions to this practice, especially prior to 1842, when a number of states elected Representatives on a \"general ticket\" or \"at-large\" basis by having them listed on a statewide ballot. The United States has also implicitly rejected the concept of proportional representation by party for Congress by adopting the single-member district standard.", "Once districts are allocated among the states based on population (apportionment), the actual redrawing of district lines (redistricting) is carried out by each state. This process is usually completed by the state legislatures, but a number of states provide for nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions to draft the plans. ", "Although the technology has changed, the process of redistricting in the 21 st century is likely to be much the same as it was in the 20 th century. Line-drawers use information from the census (and other data, such as voting patterns and voter registration figures) to plot district boundaries on maps.", "As legal requirements have changed and technology has improved for analyzing data, many districts are created using smaller and more complicated geographic units or entities. Rather than using whole counties, cities, towns, or other natural geographic features to delineate districts as in the past, line-drawers now use geographic units created by the Census Bureau for statistical purposes. These \"census tracts\" and the smaller \"blocks\" are used because, as very small geographical units, they facilitate the precision necessary to make districts absolutely equal in population.", "During the 1980s and 1990s the redistricting process moved from calculators and paper maps to computerized databases and mapping software. Whereas pre-1980s technology limited the number of competing plans that could be drawn, computerized redistricting often increased the number of plans that were presented to districting bodies in the states.

This is usually accomplished using two techniques: \"packing\" and \"cracking.\" \"Packing\" occurs when potential voters with similar expected voting behavior (e.g., Democrats, Republicans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, etc.) are deliberately concentrated into fewer congressional districts. \"Packing\" of more than a majority of any such group into a congressional district creates \"wasted votes,\" as it only takes 50% plus one vote to elect a preferred candidate in the American system of single-Member, winner-take-all congressional elections. By concentrating more like-minded voters into fewer districts with super-majorities, rather than distributing smaller majorities across multiple districts, the group of like-minded voters will be able to elect fewer of their preferred candidates.", "\"Cracking\" is the opposite of \"packing\" and occurs when like-minded voters are deliberately distributed among several districts such that there is no chance of a majority of these individuals in any one district. This dilutes the group's voting strength, and means that the group of like-minded voters is less likely to elect a candidate of its own choice. \"Cracking\" disperses like-minded voters, while \"packing\" concentrates them.", "Traditionally, gerrymandering has been used to describe what is now termed \"partisan gerrymandering.\" Partisan gerrymandering, as the name implies, is the process of manipulating the drawing of district boundaries to enhance the electoral chances of one political party above and beyond what would be expected based on statewide (or nationwide) partisan distribution of support. This is sometimes referred to as \"partisan bias.\"", "\"Racial gerrymandering\" has two meanings. The first refers to the attempts by white legislatures to structure congressional districts so that minority voting strength was diluted, often using \"cracking\" (generally pre-Voting Rights Act as amended in 1982). The second meaning refers to the creation of oddly shaped congressional districts for the sole purpose of creating distinctly racial districts within a state (post- Shaw v. Reno , 509 U.S. 630 (1993)).", "A third type of gerrymandering has been labeled \"bipartisan\" or \"incumbent gerrymandering.\" Simply put, this is a redistricting plan that favors incumbents, often without regard for their partisan affiliation, and aims to maintain the status quo with respect to the partisan distribution of seats within a state and to protect incumbents.", "It should be noted that, with the exception of both types of racial gerrymandering, both partisan and bipartisan forms of gerrymandering are currently legal, and, in some cases, allowed specifically by law. Brickner summarizes the positives and negatives about gerrymandering:", "While often criticized, gerrymandering can serve beneficial purposes. It can enhance minority representation by optimizing the proportion of minority voters in particular election districts. It can promote political stability by limiting the number of highly competitive districts in which turnovers are likely. And it can protect incumbents by avoiding district boundaries that group multiple incumbents together. Taken to its extreme, however, gerrymandering can serve less desirable purposes. It may be used to lock in undue partisan advantage for a decade (often the purpose of partisan gerrymandering). Or it may be used to eliminate all serious electoral competition (often the purpose of incumbent gerrymandering). Or it may be used to weaken the electoral strength of particular interest groups (often for the purposes of racial gerrymandering).", "While most expert commentators on redistricting consider gerrymandering to be, by its very nature, \"unfair\" and a distortion of representation, a few would not reject all forms of partisan or incumbent gerrymandering as completely unredeemable. Gelman and King, for example, have shown that gerrymandering can have some positive (or, at least, some non-negative) effects. For example, they show that the act of redistricting, in and of itself, increases electoral responsiveness over and beyond what it had been prior to redistricting. And, while gerrymandering biases the election system in favor of the party in control of districting over that of the party not controlling the process, any type of redistricting reduces partisan bias as compared to an electoral system without redistricting. Redistricting (whether partisan or bi-partisan) tends, on average, to increase electoral responsiveness by \"shaking up the political system in combination with the many constraints on the mapmakers\" (see below) and by \"creating high levels of uncertainty\" for all participants, according to Gelman and King. According to their analysis, \"no matter how fair or biased the electoral system is to begin with, the typical redistricting plan, whether Democratic, Republican, or bi-partisan controlled, will produce a fairer electoral system initially.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Re-establishment of the Rules and Constraints by the Federal Courts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Political Equality\u2014\"One Person, One Vote\"", "paragraphs": ["By tradition, courts initially stayed out of the \"political thicket\" of redistricting, arguing that such matters were \"political questions,\" best left to the legislatures.

Jeremy Buchman has summarized what are thought of as some of the possible benefits of contiguity in the redistricting process: it promotes geographic \"cognizability\" by incumbents, challengers, and voters; supports the appearance of fairness; hinders the gerrymanderer; and provides an easily applied rule for the courts.

Like Justice Potter Stewart's definition of pornography, compactness, as criteria for constructing congressional or state legislative districts, may only be knowable when it is seen. From a geographic perspective, compactness is usually \"defined\" by reference to shapes (e.g., most compact shape is a circle, followed by a square or rectangle), or references to geographic measures such as geographic dispersion, perimeter measures, and population measures. Webster's New World College Dictionary (4 th ed.) defines \"compact\" as \"closely and firmly packed or put together; dense; solid; taking little space; arranged neatly in a small space.\"", "According to Buchman, compact districts allegedly offer three benefits: they (1) promote better communications between representatives and constituents; (2) enhance \"voter knowledge of one's representatives and 'political neighbors,' thus facilitating community organization\"; and (3) \"insofar as it promotes the perception that the resulting congressional districting patterns are fair,\" add legitimacy to the redistricting process. In addition, compactness has also been defended as a preventive measure against gerrymandering. Compactness as a criterion for districting can also be defended because judges can easily apply the standard.", "There appear to be three schools of thought about the role that compactness has to play in the drawing of congressional district boundaries. First, there are those who hold that the concept, despite the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings, is relatively meaningless because there is no accepted operational definition or measure that does not have its shortcomings. Second, there are those who think that next to political equality, the compactness of districts is the most effective way of preventing gerrymandering.

It has been noted, however, that the concept of \"communities of interest\" can be difficult to define, and, consequently, making use of such an intangible concept in the actual constructing of boundaries may be difficult and arbitrary.", "Brickner suggests that aside from making it somewhat more difficult to gerrymander a district, preserving \"communities of interest\" and political subdivision boundaries may make it \"easier for a member to serve a homogenous district\"; \"undivided communities of interest may find strength in numbers\"; they may make it easier to represent from a logistical standpoint (\"fewer local officials to appease, parades to march in, and town halls to attend\"); and, they can reduce the \"complexity of running elections for a district office\" as most election administration in this country is based on a \"county-by-county or town-by-town basis.\" The strict promotion of the preservation of political subdivision boundaries and \"communities of interest\" may, however, run counter to the requirement for districts that are equal in population. Some type of trade-off is usually necessary, and currently, boundaries and \"communities of interest\" generally place second to political equality.

In both cases, it appears that using these criteria enhances the continuity of representation. In the 2000 redistricting cycle, seven states required preserving the core of prior districts and three states allowed for such preservation. However, no state required the protection of incumbents; seven states allowed it, but five states prohibited such protection altogether. There is criticism, however, of the whole notion of protecting incumbents. Michael McDonald has pointed out that there is some evidence that such protection is widespread. More so than partisan gerrymandering, incumbency protection has, for some, promoted calls for drawing congressional districts in a manner that enhances political competition and encourages elected officials to be more responsive to their constituents."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Promoting Political Competition", "paragraphs": ["Political philosopher Dennis Thompson has written that \"a competitive struggle for the people's vote is for many political scientists and political theorists the very definition of democracy.\" Many feel that electoral competition promotes voter turnout, is important in translating the desires of the voters into public policy, and promotes accountability and responsiveness of representatives.

For them, the evidence points to causes such as incumbency, and all that that implies (financial advantages, name recognition, etc.), as well as the fact that Americans are living in more homogenous communities than in the past. Also, it should be noted that political competition has been declining in Senate elections as well, but redistricting cannot be having an effect in that case.", "Regardless, there is no doubt that partisan competition in congressional elections has declined and reformers believe that using the redistricting process to help create competitive congressional districts may prove successful.
