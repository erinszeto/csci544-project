TANF is best known for funding state cash assistance programs for needy families with children, and it was created in the 1996 welfare reform law. However, TANF is not synonymous with cash assistance. In FY2013, only 28% of federal and state TANF dollars were for cash assistance.", "The bulk of federal TANF funding is in a fixed block grant, which has been set at $16.5 billion since FY1997. The basic block grant is not adjusted for inflation, or for changes in the circumstances of a state such as its cash assistance caseload, population, or number of children in poverty. States are also required to spend a specified minimum of $10.4 billion in state funds on TANF-related activities and populations. This amount also has not changed since FY1997.", "TANF cash assistance programs today reflect a long history (going back to the early 1900s) and much controversy. States set their own cash assistance benefit levels. In 2012, cash benefits in all states represented a fraction of poverty-level income. In New York, the state with the highest benefit among the 48 contiguous states, the maximum monthly TANF cash benefit for a family of three was $770, which translates to 48% of poverty-level income. In contrast, Mississippi paid a monthly cash benefit for a family of three of $170 (11% of poverty-level income). Families with adult recipients (and certain nonrecipient parents) come under work participation rules. Federally funded aid is also time-limited for such families.", "The cash assistance caseload has declined dramatically from its pre-welfare-reform high of 5.1 million families in 1994 to 1.7 million families in July 2008. The cash assistance caseload increased with the economic slump associated with the 2007-2009 recession, to a peak of 2.0 million families in December 2010. In December 2013, the cash assistance caseload stood at 1.7 million families. The cash assistance caseload has traditionally consisted of families headed by a nonworking parent, usually a single mother. However, in FY2011, less than half of the TANF cash caseload fit this description. The TANF cash caseload is very diverse, with more than half the caseload having different characteristics than the historical traditional cash assistance family.", "TANF is not a program per se, but a flexible funding stream used to provide a wide range of benefits and services that address the effects of, and the root causes of, disadvantage among families with children. In addition to cash assistance for needy families, TANF also funds child care; programs that address child abuse and neglect; various early childhood initiatives, including pre-kindergarten programs; earnings supplements for workers in low-income families; emergency and short-term aid; pregnancy prevention programs; responsible fatherhood programs; and initiatives to encourage healthy marriages."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides grants to states, Indian tribes, and territories for a wide range of benefits, services, and activities that address economic disadvantage.

It replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) cash assistance program and several related programs.", "The modern form of cash assistance for needy families with children dates back to the Progressive Era of the early 1900s and state- or locally funded mothers' pensions for \"fatherless\" families. The purpose of these programs was to permit these mothers to stay at home and care for their children. The Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271) provided federal funding for these types of programs by creating the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program. In the early years, benefits were paid only on behalf of the children (not the caretaker, usually the mother). Families receiving benefits were usually headed by a widow or had a disabled father. ", "However, over time, the nature of both the program and the families it aided changed. Social Security survivors benefits were created in the Social Security Amendments of 1939, and those receiving ADC increasingly were families where the father was alive but absent. The caseload also increasingly became nonwhite. Amendments to the program made in 1950 authorized benefits for caretakers. In 1956, the goals of creating \"self sufficiency\" and strengthening family life were added to ADC, along with funding for services that would seek to achieve these goals. In 1962, the program was renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).", "Policymakers became concerned that cash assistance was a contributing cause of economic disadvantage. Providing cash to a nonworking parent was seen as a work disincentive, during a time when an increasing number of women, and mothers, were going to work. Economic studies generally confirmed that providing cash assistance was a disincentive to work. ", "Further, there was concern that restricting benefits to only single-parent families (usually headed by the mother) contributed to the trend of an increasing number of children living in single-parent families. The social science research on the impact of assistance, as embodied in AFDC, on family structure is inconclusive. Cash assistance benefits for families headed by two able-bodied parents became available in 1961 at state option. It was not until the Family Support Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-485 ) that states were mandated to provide benefits for such families, and even then it was on more restrictive terms than those for single-parent families. Two-parent families never became a large portion of the cash assistance caseload.", "The 1980s also saw increasing attention to the notion of \"welfare dependency.\" Research showed that many single mothers received cash assistance for only a short period of time, but others were likely to spend a long time on the rolls. Additional research conducted in the 1980s showed that mandatory welfare-to-work programs could move families off the rolls and into employment.", "The Family Support Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-485 ) established in AFDC the notion of mutual responsibility between the cash assistance recipient and the state. It created the Job Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training program, which provided employment services, education, and training for cash assistance recipients. Following the Family Support Act, states also experimented with \"waivers\" of federal law, and began designing their own cash assistance programs and requirements for cash assistance recipients. The 1996 welfare law abolished AFDC, and consolidated the funding of AFDC, a program that provided emergency assistance, and JOBS into the TANF block\u00a0grant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TANF Funds", "paragraphs": ["TANF financing involves both federal and state monies.

New York had the highest benefits in the lower 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, paying $770 per month (48% of poverty-level income).

Most TANF cash assistance families receive aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, the program formerly known as Food Stamps) and have coverage from Medicaid.

Additionally, there are no federal rules for determining the income eligibility level, how much money a family may have in the bank, the value of a family's car(s), whether or not a state pays benefits to families with earnings, or other factors that go into determining a family's eligibility for TANF and its cash assistance benefit amount. ", "However, cash assistance paid to a family does come with some federal requirements. States must meet numerical work participation standards, which specify that a percentage of the cash assistance caseload must be engaged in certain activities. These standards also require that a minimum number of hours be spent in these activities, with the hours varying by family type. Guided by these standards, states themselves design participation rules that apply to individual recipient families and determine the sanction for families that fail to comply.", "The federal TANF time limit prohibits the use of federal funds to provide assistance to a family with an adult recipient beyond 60 months in a lifetime. States are free to use state funds\u2014and even count those funds toward their MOE requirements\u2014to assist a family beyond 60 months. States may also impose shorter time limits.
