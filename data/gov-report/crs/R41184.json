Congress subsequently appropriated another $265 million and authorized the SBA to reprogram another $40 million to extend those subsidies and the loan modification through May 31, 2010.

The act also temporarily expanded for two years after the date of enactment (or until September 27, 2012) the types of projects eligible for refinancing of existing debt under the 504/CDC program; provided $505 million (plus an additional $5 million for administrative expenses) to continue fee subsidies for the 7(a) loan guaranty program and the 504/CDC program through December 31, 2010; and established an alternative size standard that allows more companies to qualify for 504/CDC assistance. P.L. 111-322 , the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue the fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until funding provided for these purposes in P.L. 111-240 was exhausted (which occurred on January 3, 2011).", "During the 114 th Congress, P.L. 114-113 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, reinstated the expansion of the types of projects eligible for refinancing under the 504/CDC loan guaranty program in any fiscal year in which the refinancing program and the 504/CDC program as a whole do not have credit subsidy costs. The act requires each CDC to limit its refinancing so that, during any fiscal year, the new refinancings do not exceed 50% of the dollars it loaned under the 504/CDC program during the previous fiscal year.

Also, the Obama Administration had requested in its FY2016 budget request authority to reinstate the 504/CDC refinancing program (without a business expansion requirement) in FY2016 to support up to $7.5 billion in lending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Activity During the 115th Congress", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned previously, P.L. 115-371 , the Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency (ACE) Act, increased the threshold amount for determining when a CDC is required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan (from if the estimated value of the project property is greater than $250,000 to if the estimated value of the project property is greater than the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold, which was recently increased from $250,000 to $500,000). The act also increased the threshold amount for determining when a CDC may be required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan (from if the estimated value of the project property is equal to or less than $250,000 and such appraisal is necessary for appropriate evaluation of creditworthiness to if the estimated value of the project property is equal to or less than the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold and such appraisal is necessary for appropriate evaluation of creditworthiness). The change was designed to \"remove the uncertainty lenders now have juggling two different real estate appraisal thresholds.\" ", "In addition, S. 347 , the Investing in America's Small Manufacturers Act, among other provisions, would have allowed CDCs to provide up to 50% of project costs instead of up to 40% if the borrower is a small manufacturer and the 504/CDC loan guarantee program's subsidy cost for that current fiscal year is not above zero."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["During the 111 th Congress, congressional debate concerning proposed changes to the SBA's loan guaranty programs, including the 504/CDC program, centered on the likely impact the changes would have on small business access to capital, job retention, and job creation. As a general proposition, some, including President Obama, argued that economic conditions made it imperative that the SBA be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations, and create jobs. Others worried about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit and advocated business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small business economic growth and job creation.", "In terms of specific program changes, continuing the 504/CDC program's temporary fee subsidies, increasing its loan limits, temporarily (and later permanently) expanding its refinancing options, and authorizing the SBA to establish an alternative size standard were designed to achieve the same goal: to enhance job creation and retention by increasing the ability of 504/CDC borrowers to obtain credit at affordable rates. ", "Critics argued that these actions might increase the risk of defaults and result in higher guaranty fees or the need to provide the SBA additional funding to cover loan subsidy costs. Others advocated a more modest increase in the maximum loan limits to ensure that the programs focus on start-ups and early-stage small firms, \"businesses that have historically encountered the greatest difficulties in accessing credit,\" and that they avoid \"making small borrowers carry a disproportionate share of the risk associated with larger loans.\"", "During the 112 th -115 th Congresses, congressional oversight focused on the SBA's administration of the program changes enacted during the 111 th Congress, the impact of those changes on the SBA's lending, and ways to address and minimize increased costs associated with loan losses. Although there continues to be widespread congressional support for providing assistance to small businesses, federal fiscal constraints may impede efforts to further expand the 504/CDC program in the near future.", "Given existing fiscal constraints, it is likely that congressional oversight during the 116 th Congress will continue to focus on (1) the SBA's administration of the 504/CDC program to ensure that the program is as efficient as possible; and (2) the program's efficacy in job retention and creation."], "subsections": []}]}}
