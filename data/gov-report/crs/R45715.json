Several FY2019 appropriations bills had not been enacted at the time the President's FY2020 budget was prepared; therefore, the President's budget included the FY2018 actual funding levels, 2019 annualized continuing resolution (CR) levels, and the FY2020 request levels. On February 15, 2019, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6). This act included each of the remaining appropriations acts, completing the FY2019 appropriations process. The act also rendered the CR levels identified in the budget no longer relevant, though for some agencies the exact amount of R&D funding in the act remained uncertain. The analysis of government-wide R&D funding in this report compares the President's request for FY2020 to the FY2018 level. For agencies for which the FY2019 R&D funding levels are known, individual agency analyses in this report compare the FY2020 request to FY2019 enacted levels. For agencies for which the FY2019 R&D funding levels remain unknown, individual agency analyses in this report compare the FY2020 request to FY2018 actual levels; when the FY2019 levels become available, these sections will be updated to compare the FY2020 request to FY2019 enacted amounts. As of the date of this report, the House had not completed action on any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2020; nor had the Senate.", "In FY2018, OMB adopted a change to the definition of development, applying a more narrow treatment it describes as \"experimental development.\" This change was intended to harmonize the reporting of U.S. R&D funding data with the approach used by other nations. The new definition is used in this report. Under the new definition of R&D (applied to both FY2018 and FY2020 figures), President Trump is requesting approximately $134.1 billion for R&D for FY2020, a decrease of $1.7 billion (1.2%) from the FY2018 level. Adjusted for inflation, the President's FY2020 R&D request represents a decrease of 5.1% below the FY2018 level.", "Funding for R&D is concentrated in a few departments and agencies. In FY2018, eight federal agencies received 96.3% of total federal R&D funding, with the Department of Defense (DOD, 38.6%) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS, 27.2%) combined accounting for nearly two-thirds of all federal R&D funding. The same eight agencies account for 97.2% of the FY2020 request, with DOD accounting for 44.3% and HHS for 25.1%", "Under the President's FY2020 budget request, most federal agencies would see their R&D funding decline. The primary exception is the Department of Defense. DOD's requested R&D funding for FY2020 is $7.1 billion (13.5%) above the FY2018 level. The Departments of Transportation and Veterans Affairs would see small increases in R&D funding. Among the agencies with the largest proposed reductions in R&D funding in the FY2020 budget compared to the FY2018 actual levels are the Department of Energy ($2.8 billion, 15.8%), the National Science Foundation ($567 million, 9.0%), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration ($475 million, 4.0%).", "The President's FY2020 budget request would reduce funding for basic research by $1.5 billion (4.0%), applied research by $4.3 billion (10.5%), and facilities and equipment by $0.5 billion (12.8%), while increasing funding for development by $4.5 billion (8.3%).", "President Trump's FY2020 budget is largely silent on funding levels for multiagency R&D initiatives.

In recent years, widespread concerns about the federal debt, recent and projected federal budget deficits, and federal budget caps have driven difficult decisions about the prioritization of R&D, both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal R&D portfolio.

There is no single, centralized source of R&D funds. Agency R&D budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process. R&D funding may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to R&D or in accounts that include funding for non-R&D activities. Agency budgets are subjected to review, revision, and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and become part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress. The federal R&D budget is then calculated by aggregating the R&D activities of each federal agency.

In recent years, some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending (for R&D and for other purposes) in light of the federal deficit and debt. Other Members of Congress have expressed support for increased federal spending for R&D as an investment in the nation's future competitiveness. As Congress acts to complete the FY2020 appropriations process, it faces two overarching issues: the amount of the federal budget to be spent on federal R&D and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding.", "This report begins with a discussion of the overall level of R&D in President Trump's FY2020 budget request, followed by analyses of R&D funding in the request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency R&D initiatives.

In the past, these have included the Iraqi Freedom Fund (IFF), the Iraqi Security Forces Fund, the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Congress typically has made a single appropriation into each such fund and authorized the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts, including RDT&E, at his discretion. These transfers are eventually reflected in Title IV prior-year funding figures. ", "For FY2020, the Trump Administration is requesting $104.294 billion for DOD's Title IV RDT&E PEs (base plus OCO), $8.334 billion (8.7%) above the enacted FY2019 level. (See Table 8 .) In addition, the request includes $732.3 million in RDT&E through the Defense Health Program (DHP; down $1.447 billion, 66.4% from FY2019), $875.9 million in RDT&E through the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program (down $10.8 million, 1.2% from FY2019), and $3.0 million for the Inspector General for RDT&E-related activities (down $1.0 million, 25.4% from FY2019). The FY2020 budget included no RDT&E funding via the National Defense Sealift Fund, the same as the FY2019 enacted level. ", "RDT&E funding can be analyzed in different ways. RDT&E funding can be characterized organizationally. Each of military department requests and receives its own RDT&E funding. So, too, do various DOD agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), collectively aggregated within the Defense-Wide account. RDT&E funding also can be characterized by budget activity (i.e., the type of RDT&E supported). Those budget activities designated as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development, respectively) constitute what is called DOD's Science and Technology program (S&T) and represent the more research-oriented part of the RDT&E program. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including support for test and evaluation facilities. Budget activity 6.7 supports the development of system improvements in existing operational systems.", "Many congressional policymakers are particularly interested in DOD S&T program funding since these funds support the development of new technologies and the underlying science. Some in the defense community see ensuring adequate support for S&T activities as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority into the future. The knowledge generated at this stage of development may also contribute to advances in commercial technologies. The FY2020 request for Title IV S&T funding (base plus OCO) is $14.135 billion, $1.524 billion (9.7%) below the FY2019 enacted level. Within the S&T program, basic research (6.1) receives special attention, particularly by the nation's universities. DOD is not a large supporter of basic research when compared to NIH or NSF. However, over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities. The Trump Administration is requesting $2.320 billion for DOD basic research for FY2020, $208.4 million (8.2%) below the FY2019 enacted level. DOD is a substantial source of federal funds for university R&D in certain fields, such as aerospace, aeronautical, and astronautical engineering (40%); electrical, electronic, and communications engineering (39%); mechanical engineering (28%); computer and information sciences (28%); and materials science (25%).

Historically, over 50% of the NIH budget is used to support RPGs, which include salaries for investigators and research staff. The FY2020 budget proposes to reduce the average cost of RPGs by capping the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds to 90%.

For this proposal, Congress and the President would need to enact legislation to extend the special diabetes program funding, because under current law, no new funding will be available for this program after September 30, 2019. Additionally, the FY2020 program level request includes $741 million in funding transferred to NIH by the PHS evaluation tap. Discretionary funding for certain programs at NIH and other HHS agencies that are authorized under the PHS Act can be subject to an assessment under Section 241 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7238j). This provision authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to study the effectiveness of federal health programs and to identify improvements. Although the PHS Act limits the tap to no more than 1% of eligible appropriations, in recent years, annual LHHS appropriations acts have specified a higher amount (2.5% in FY2019) and have also typically directed specific amounts of funding from the tap for transfer to a number of HHS programs. The assessment has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds for specific purposes among PHS and other HHS agencies. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, has historically been the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds; until recently, it had been a relatively minor recipient. Provisions in recent LHHS appropriations acts have directed specific tap transfers to NIH, making NIH a net recipient of tap funds.

A large portion of the S&T account funds EPA R&D activities managed by ORD, including research grants. Programs implemented by other offices within EPA also may have a research component, but the research component is not necessarily the primary focus of the program.", "As with the President's FY2019 budget request, the FY2020 request proposes reductions and eliminations of funding for FY2020 across a number of EPA programs and activities. The President's FY2020 request includes a total of $6.07 billion for EPA, $2.78 billion (31%) less than the total $8.85 billion FY2019 enacted appropriations for EPA (after rescissions) provided in Titles II and IV of Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), and $123.4 million (2%) less than the FY2019 request of $6.19 billion for EPA. The reductions proposed in the FY2020 request are distributed across EPA operational functions and activities as well as grants for states, tribes, and local governments. With the exception of the Building and Facilities account, the President's FY2020 request proposes funding reductions below FY2019 enacted levels for the nine other EPA appropriations accounts, although funding for some program areas within the accounts would remain constant or increase. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns regarding proposed reductions of funding for EPA scientific research programs during hearings on the President's FY2020 budget request.", "Including a $17.8 million transfer from the Superfund account, the President's FY2020 budget request proposes $480.8 million for EPA's S&T account, $241.1 million (33.4%) less than the FY2019 enacted $722.0 million which includes a $15.5 million transfer and $11.3 million account specific rescissions. The FY2020 request would provide an increase (3.1%) compared to the FY2019 request of $466.4 million, which includes a $17.4 million transfer. The President's FY2020 request proposes a rescission for EPA but does not specify a rescission within the S&T or other appropriations accounts. This accounting difference does not allow for direct comparisons of funding within EPA's S&T account including specific rescissions. ", " Table 21 at the end of this section includes the President's FY2020 request for program areas and activities within EPA's S&T account as presented in EPA's FY20 20 Congressional Budget Justification compared to the FY2019 enacted appropriations as reported in the Conference Report ( H.Rept. 116-9 ) accompanying the FY2019 consolidated appropriations that includes the Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations. ", "Consistent with other recent House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports and explanatory statements, the conference report H.Rept. 116-9 accompanying the FY2019 enacted appropriations did not specify funding for all subprogram areas reported in EPA's budget justification. S&T subprogram areas not reported in congressional reports and statements are noted in the Table 21 as \"NR\" (not reported). Additionally, the President's FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020 requests and EPA's congressional budget justifications have modified the titles for some of the program areas relative to previous Administrations' budget requests and congressional committee reports' presentations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have generally adopted the modified program area titles as presented in the recent budget requests.", "During House and Senate Committee hearings regarding the President's FY2020 budget request for EPA, Members generally did not support a number of the proposed reductions and eliminations of funding for EPA, including proposed reductions in funding for scientific research programs. Reductions proposed in the FY2020 budget request below the FY2019 enacted levels were distributed across EPA operational functions and activities as well as grants for states, tribes, and local governments.", "As shown in Table 21 , with few exceptions the requested FY2020 amount for the S&T account for individual EPA program area and activity line items would be less than the FY2019 enacted appropriations. The FY2020 request did not propose to completely eliminate funding for the broader program areas; however, eliminations (no funding is requested for FY2020) are proposed for line-item activities below the program areas as indicated in Table 21 . These program areas include", "Atmospheric Protection Program (formerly GHG [greenhouse gas] Reporting Program and Climate Protection Program), Indoor Air Radon Program, and Reduce Risks from Indoor Air. ", "For other program areas, proposed reductions in funding included eliminations of certain programs. For example, the proposed reduction in funding for Research: Air and Energy, Research: Safe and Sustainable Water Resources, Research: Sustainable and Healthy Communities, and Research: Chemical Safety and Sustainability program areas for FY2020 included the proposed elimination of funding for the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program.", "P.L. 116-6 included $5.0 million for Research: National Priorities within the S&T account for FY2019, an increase compared to $4.1 million included for FY2018.

Workforce reshaping was introduced in the FY2018 request and described as agency-wide organizational restructuring, \"reprioritization of agency activities,\" and reallocation of resources. The FY2020 request for the Operations and Administration program area within the S&T account includes $6.0 million for agency workforce reshaping and efforts to improve the management of EPA's laboratories.
