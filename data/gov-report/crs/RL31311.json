In countries where USAID is or is scheduled to beco-located with the U.S. embassy, the State Department's Foreign BuildingsOperations office had been responsible for financing USAID secure facilities.

As a result, security upgrades for some USAID missions have been deferreddue to funding shortfalls. For FY2003, USAID requested $7 million for securityneeds out of its operations account, a slight increase over the $6.9 million level inFY2002.

Nevertheless, since the accounts out of which these funds are drawn arefunded near or above the President's request, the Administration has been able tofollow much of its original request. Of the roughly $4 billion requested for FY2003in aid for the \"front-line\" states, the Administration has allocated $4.1 billion to these26 countries.

Population Fund(UNFPA) if the organization maintains a program in China where allegations ofcoercive family planning have been widespread for many years.", "UNFPA Funding. The most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question, but recentattention has been focused on UNFPA and a White House decision in July 2002 toblock the $34 million U.S. contribution to the organization. During the Reagan andBush Administrations, the United States did not contribute to UNFPA because ofconcerns over practices of forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations in Chinawhere UNFPA maintains programs. In 1985, Congress passed the so-calledKemp-Kasten amendment which has been made part of every Foreign Operationsappropriation since, barring U.S. funds to any organization that supported orparticipated \"in the management\" of a program of coercive abortion or involuntarysterilization. In 1993, President Clinton determined that UNFPA, despite itspresence in China, was not involved in the management of a coercive program. Inmost years since 1993, Congress has appropriated about $25 million for UNFPA, butadded a directive that required that amount reduced by however much UNFPA spentin China. Consequently, the U.S. contribution has fluctuated between $21.5 millionand $25 million.", "For FY2002, President Bush requested $25 million for UNFPA. As part of a larger package concerning various international family planning issues, Congressprovided in the FY2002 Foreign Operations bill \"not more than\" $34 million forUNFPA. While members of the Appropriations Committees say it was their intentto provide the full $34 million, the language allowed the President to allocatehowever much he chose, up to a $34 million ceiling. According to February 27testimony by Arthur Dewey, Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees,and Migration before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the White Houseplaced a hold on UNFPA funds in January because of new evidence that coercivepractices continue in Chinese counties where UNFPA concentrates its programs. ASeptember 2001 investigation team, sponsored by the Population Research Institute,concluded that a consistent pattern of coercion continues in \"model\" UNFPAcounties, including forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations. Refuting thesefindings, a UNFPA-commissioned review team found in October 2001 \"absolutelyno evidence that the UN Population Fund supports coercive family planning practicesin China or violates the human rights of Chinese people in any way.\" (14)", "While most observers agree that coercive family planning practices continue in China, differences remain over the extent to which, if any, UNFPA is involved ininvoluntary activities and whether UNFPA should operate at all in a country wheresuch conditions exist. Given the conflicting reports, the State Department sent itsown investigative team to China for a two-week review of UNFPA programs on May13, 2002. The team, which was led by former Ambassador William Brown, andincluded Bonnie Glick, a former State Department official, and Dr. Theodore Tong,a public health professor at the University of Arizona, made three findings andrecommendations in its report dated May 31:", "Findings: ", "There is no evidence that UNFPA knowingly supported orparticipated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntarysterilization in China;", "China maintains coercive elements in its populationprograms;", "Chinese leaders view \"population control as a high priority\"and remain concerned over implications for socioeconomicchange.", "Recommendations: ", "The United States should release not more than $34 millionof previously appropriated funds to UNFPA;", "Until China ends all forms of coercion in law and practice, noU.S. Government funds should be allocated to population programs inChina;", "Appropriate resources, possibly from the United States, shouldbe allocated to monitor and evaluate Chinese population controlprograms.", "Despite the team's recommendation to release the $34 million, Secretary of State Powell determined on July 22 to withhold funds to UNFPA and to recommendthat they be re-directed to other international family planning and reproductive healthactivities. (The authority to make this decision has been delegated by the Presidentto the Secretary of State.) The State Department's analysis of the Secretary'sdetermination found that even though UNFPA did not \"knowingly\" support orparticipate in a coercive practice, that alone would not preclude the application ofKemp-Kasten. Instead, a finding that the recipient of U.S. funds -- in this caseUNFPA -- simply supports or participates in such a program, whether knowingly orunknowingly, would trigger the restriction. The team found that the Chinesegovernment imposes fines and penalties on families that have children exceeding thenumber approved by the government, a practice that in some cases coerces womento have abortions they would not otherwise undergo. The State Department analysisconcluded that UNFPA's involvement in China's family planning program \"allowsthe Chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coerciveabortion.\" (15)", "Critics of the Administration's decision oppose it not only because of the negative impact it may have on access to voluntary family planning programs bypersons in around 140 countries where UNFPA operates, but also because of thepossible application of the determination for other international organizations thatoperate in China and to which the U.S. contributes.", "For FY2003, the President proposed no funding for UNFPA, although $25 million was requested in \"reserve\" for the account from which UNFPA receives itsfunding.

The debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decadesago, in 1973, when Congress added a provision to the Foreign Assistance Act of1961 prohibiting the use of U.S. appropriated funds for abortion-related activitiesand coercive family planning programs. During the mid-1980s, in what has becomeknown as the \"Mexico City\" policy (because it was first announced at the 1984Mexico City Population Conference), the Reagan Administration, and later theGeorge H. W. Bush Administration restricted funds for foreign non-governmentalorganizations (NGOs) that were involved in performing or promoting abortions incountries where they worked, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S.funds . Several groups, including International Planned ParenthoodFederation-London (IPPF-London), became ineligible for U.S. financial support. Insome years, Congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition, butWhite House vetoes kept the policy in place. President Clinton in 1993 reversed theposition of his two predecessors, allowing the United States to resume funding forall family planning organizations so long as no U.S. money was used by thoseinvolved in abortion-related work.", "During the past six years, the House and Senate have taken opposing positions on the Mexico City issue, and thus have repeatedly held up enactment of the finalForeign Operations spending measure. The House position, articulated byRepresentative Chris Smith (N.J.) and others, supported reinstatement of the MexicoCity policy restricting U.S. aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performingabortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries. TheSenate, on the other hand, has rejected in most cases House provisions dealing withMexico City policy, favoring a position that leaves these decisions in the hands of theAdministration. ", "Unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides, Congress adopted interim arrangements for FY1996-FY1999 that did not resolve the broad populationprogram controversy, but permitted the stalled Foreign Operations measure to moveforward. The annual \"compromise\" removed House-added Mexico City restrictions,but reduced population assistance to $385 million, and in several years, \"metered\"the availability of the funds at a rate of one-twelfth of the $385 million per month.", "In FY2000, when the issue became linked with the un-related foreign policy matter of paying U.S. arrears owed to the United Nations, a reluctant PresidentClinton agreed to a modified version of abortion restrictions, marking the first timethat Mexico City conditions had been included in legislation signed by the President (enacted in the Foreign Operations Act for FY2000, H.R. 3422 ,incorporated into H.R. 3194 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act forFY2000, P.L. 106-113 ). Because the President could waive the restrictions for $15million in grants to organizations that refused to certify, there was no major impacton USAID family planning programs in FY2000, other than the reduction of $12.5million in population assistance that the legislation required if the White Houseexercised the waiver authority.", "When Congress again came to an impasse in FY2001, lawmakers agreed to allow the new President to set policy. Under the FY2001 Foreign Operationsmeasure, none of the $425 million appropriation could be obligated until afterFebruary 15, 2001. Subsequently, on January 22, 2001, two days after taking office,President Bush issued a Memorandum to the USAID Administrator rescinding the1993 memorandum from President Clinton and directing the Administrator to\"reinstate in full all of the requirements of the Mexico City Policy in effect onJanuary 19, 1993.\" The President further said that it was his \"conviction thattaxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or activelypromote abortion, either here or abroad.\" (16) Aseparate statement from the President'spress secretary stated that President Bush was \"committed to maintaining the $425million funding level\" for population assistance \"because he knows that one of thebest ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planningservices.\" The press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that anyrestrictions \"do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused bylegal or illegal abortions, for example, post abortion care.\" (17) On February 15, 2001,the day on which FY2001 population aid funds became available for obligation,USAID issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement thePresident's directive. The guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980sand early 1990s when the Mexico City policy applied. (18) For FY2003, President Bushseeks $425 million for USAID population assistance, the same as requested forFY2002, but less than the $446.5 million appropriated for FY2002.

They believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they areunsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losingeligibility for USAID funding. This, they contend, will lead to higher numbers ofunwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortions. Opponents also believe the newconditions undermine relations between the U.S. Government and foreign NGOs andmultilateral groups, creating a situation in which the United States challenges theirdecisions on how to spend their own money. They further argue that U.S. policyimposes a so-called \"gag\" order on the ability of NGOs and multilateral groups topromote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations. This wouldbe unconstitutional if applied to American groups working in the United States,critics note.

(21)", "During consideration by the Congress in 2001,critics of the initiative argued that it overemphasized military and counter-drugassistance, and provided inadequate support for human rights and the peace processin Colombia. Supporters argued that it continued needed assistance to Colombia,while providing more support for regional neighbors and social and economicprograms.", "By the end of 2001, Congress approved, in the Foreign OperationsAppropriations Act ( H.R. 2506 / P.L. 107-115 ), $625 million for the ACI,$106 million less than the President's ACI request. Also included were a series ofconditions and certification requirements relating to human rights and to thecontroversial aerial eradication spraying (also known as aerial fumigation) programto destroy illicit coca crops, and an alteration of the cap on military and civiliancontractors serving in Colombia.", "For FY2003, President Bush requested about $980 million for the ARI, including $731 million in counternarcotics assistance under the ACI, with some ACIfunds being used for social and economic programs ($291 million). (See table 8below.) Over half -- $537 million -- was targeted on Colombia, with othersignificant amounts proposed for Bolivia and Peru. The FY2003 request was similarto the FY2002 request, except that the Administration proposed $98 million inForeign Military Financing (FMF) for Colombia to train and equip a Colombian armybrigade to protect the Cano-Limon oil pipeline in northeastern Colombia. Therequest marked a sharp break with previous policy towards Colombia, as it was thefirst request for military assistance provided specifically for a purpose other thancounternarcotics operations. The Administration also requested $1 million each forBolivia, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru in FY2003 FMF funding.", " Table 8. Andean RegionalInitiative ($s millions)", "a ACI amounts do not differentiate between interdiction and alternative development. ", "Proponents of the Administration's request argued in the context of the post-September 2001 war on terrorism that Colombia and the region should besupported, and they urged the Administration to seek expanded authority to providesupport for an expansion of activities. (22)", "On March 6, 2002, the House passed H.Res. 358 expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that\"the President, without undue delay, should transmit to Congress for its considerationproposed legislation, consistent with United States law regarding the protection ofhuman rights, to assist the Government of Colombia protect its democracy fromUnited States-designated foreign terrorist organizations and the scourge of illicitnarcotics.\" Two weeks later, as part of the Administration's FY2002 supplementalappropriation request, the executive branch specifically requested broader authorityfor the Departments of State and Defense in supporting Colombia's bothcounternarcotics and counterterrorism activities. This issue became a major focusof congressional debate on both the FY2002 supplemental and the FY2003 regularappropriation request. (For a full discussion of this particular issue, see above underthe FY2002 supplemental overview.)", "Critics argued that the new request would expand the U.S. military role in Colombia, at the time strictly limited to counternarcotics, into a problematiccounterinsurgency one. Critics who emphasize human rights considerations arguedthat such a role would inevitably involve tolerance of the linkages between theColombian military and paramilitary groups which are responsible for grossviolations of human rights. (A particular concern was the lifting of human rightsconditions concerning paramilitary groups in the FY2002 supplemental request, seebelow.) Others, who believe U.S. military power should not be committed unless itcan be effective, warned that the proposed assistance fell far short of that required tohave any significant effect on the situation in Colombia. Many also worried that theUnited States was slowly being drawn into a Vietnam-like morass, providingassistance to a government that did not have the credibility and political will to payfor and successfully wage its own war, and conclude a just peace. ", "In addition to the request for FY2003, on March 21, 2002, the Bush Administration requested $27.1 billion in Emergency FY2002 SupplementalAssistance, which was mostly to support Department of Defense and HomelandSecurity counter-terrorism efforts, but would also provide $38 million in additionalfunding and authorities relating to Colombia and the Andean Region. Included inthis submission was a request for $4 million of International Narcotics Control (INC)funding for Colombia police post support, $6 million of FMF funding for Colombiafor infrastructure security and $3 million for Ecuador for counter-terrorismequipment and training, and $25 million of Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism andDemining funding for a counter-kidnaping program for members of Colombia'spolice and armed forces. As noted above, the supplemental submission proposed tobroaden the authorities of the Defense and State Departments to utilize FY2002 andFY2003 assistance and unexpended Plan Colombia assistance to support theColombian government's \"unified campaign against narcotics trafficking, terroristactivities, and other threats to its national security.\" According to theAdministration's explanation, these provisions \"would allow broader authority toprovide assistance to Colombia to counter the unified 'cross-cutting' threat posed bygroups that use narcotics trafficking to fund their terrorist and other activities thatthreaten the national security of Colombia.\"", "Such a change would allow the Administration to expand the scope of U.S. assistance, particularly military assistance, to Colombia, allowing State and Defensedepartment funds to assist the Colombian government to counter any threat to itsnational security. The immediate, and widely discussed, effect of this change wouldbe to allow the U.S. government to broaden the circumstances under which itcurrently shares intelligence with Colombian security forces, providing intelligencenot only for counterdrug operations, but also for military operations against theColombian guerrillas and paramilitaries. The change would also permit the PlanColombia helicopters and other equipment that the United States has provided to beused for such purposes.", "The Administration's proposal would continue the \"Leahy Amendment\" -- a provision in the foreign operations and defense appropriations legislation forbiddingassistance to military and police units credibly alleged to engage in gross violationsof human rights -- as well as the current caps of 400 each on the number of U.S.civilian contractors and U.S. military personnel supporting \"Plan Colombia\"activities in Colombia. (The new proposed military activities, i.e., infrastructureprotection and anti-kidnaping assistance, are not, however, \"Plan Colombia\"activities.) Except for those two specifically mentioned conditions, however, theAdministration's proposal stated that funding would be provided \"notwithstandingany provision of law.\" That statement would lift conditions like those of Section 567of P.L. 107-115 , the FY2002 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, which hasstiffer provisions regarding human rights violations by security forces, and alsorequires the armed forces to address the continuing links of some of its members withillegal rightist paramilitary groups. It would also lift P.L. 107-115 conditionsregarding aerial fumigation spraying and alternative development.", "Congressional Action. Both House ( H.R. 5410 ) and Senate ( S. 2779 ) FY2003 ForeignOperations bills, as reported in 2002, expired with the end of the 107th Congress. Inlate January 2003, the Senate adopted a revised FY2003 Foreign Operations measureas part of H.J.Res. 2 , a continuing appropriation bill to which the Senateadded the full text of the 11 funding measures that had not been enacted for this fiscalyear. House and Senate conferees worked out a common Foreign Operationsmeasure for FY2003 in February, and after passing Congress on February 13,President Bush signed the joint resolution a week later ( P.L. 108-7 ).", "As enacted, the Foreign Operations appropriation for FY2003 provides $933 million for the Andean Regional Initiative, with $700 million of that total allocateddirectly for the Andean Counternarcotics Initiative. The ACI funding level is $31million below the President's request, although the conference agreement allows theAdministration to transfer $31 million from regular narcotics programs for the ACI. As shown in Table 8 above, Colombia receives about $11 million less than proposed,although Administration allocations increased the level of interdiction funding andcut amounts for alternative development. Conferees further permit up to $93 millionof military aid for the security of the Cano-Limon oil pipeline, $5 million less thanrequested but higher than the $88 million recommended by the Senate.", "The enacted legislation bill specifies that not less than $250 million of the ACI account is to be apportioned directly to USAID for social and economic programs,$25 million higher than proposed by the Senate. It also adds earmarks similar tothose recommended in the Senate-passed bill: (1) not less than $5 million for trainingand equipping a Colombian Armed Forces unit dedicated to apprehending the leadersof paramilitary organizations; (2) not less than $3.5 million for assistance to theColombian National Park Service for training, equipment, and other assistance toprotect Colombia's national parks and reserves, which according to the report arethreatened by illegal drug cultivation and illegal logging; (3) not less than $3 millionfor web monitoring software for use by the Colombian National Police; and (4) notless than $1.5 million for vehicles, equipment, and other assistance for the humanrights unit of the Procurador General.", "On policy issues and aid conditions, the enacted measure specifies, as requested, that FY2003 funds are available in Colombia for a unified campaign against narcoticstrafficking, against terrorist organizations such as the FARC, ELN, and AUC, and toprotect the health and welfare in emergency circumstances. Conferees included thisbroadened authority in recognition that \"the narcotics industry is linked to theterrorist groups, including the paramilitary organizations, in Colombia,\" althoughthey expressed their expectation that counternarcotics, development, and judicialreform would remain the main emphasis of U.S. policy in Colombia. The conferenceagreement, however, would remove this expanded authority if the Secretary of Statehas evidence that the Colombian military is not attempting to restore governmentauthority and human rights in areas under the control of paramilitary and guerillaorganizations. ", "The enacted appropriation (section 564) further allows for the distribution of only 75% of the funds for Colombia's military, after which the Secretary of Statemust certify that Colombian members of the armed forces alleged to have committedhuman rights violations are being suspended, prosecuted, and punished, and that theColombian military is severing ties with and apprehending leaders of paramilitaryorganizations. Such a certification by the Secretary would release 12.5% ofassistance to the Colombian military. The remaining 12.5% would be available afterJuly 31, 2003, if the Secretary certifies that Colombian military is continuing to meetits obligations required in the first certification and trying to gain authority andprotect human rights in areas under control of paramilitary and guerilla organizations. These certification requirements are similar to provisions contained in both Houseand Senate bills, although the House measure ( H.R. 5410 ) would haverequired only a single certification to release all funds. ", "Other Colombian aid conditions provided in the enacted appropriation include: the continuation, as proposed in both House and Senate bills, of the cap of 400 on thenumber of U.S. civilian contractors and on the number of U.S. military personnel thatcan be funded during FY2003; requirement for the return of any helicopter procuredwith funding from this bill if it is used to aid or abet the operations of any illegalself-defense groups or illegal security cooperatives; and the requirement, similar tothe Senate-passed joint resolution, that the Secretary of State and the EPAAdministrator submit a report on the usage and safety of chemicals used in the aerialcoca fumigation program in Colombia before FY2003 funds can be used to purchasethose chemicals. A new requirement for FY2003 is the completion of anenvironmental impact statement.", "Regarding other conditions, the enacted bill, as proposed by the House, prohibits the use of funds to support a Peruvian air interdiction program unless the Secretaryof State and Director of Central Intelligence certify to Congress, 30 days before theresumption of U.S. involvement in such a program, that effective safeguards andprocedures are in place to prevent a shoot down similar to that of April 20, 2001, inPeru.", "Earlier, in the FY2002 supplemental ( P.L. 107-206 ; H.R. 4775 ), Congress endorsed the unified campaign policy proposed by the Administration,thereby allowing funds to be used both for counter-narcotics and to fight terrorism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Millennium Challenge Account", "paragraphs": ["In a speech on March 14, 2002, at the Inter-American Development Bank, President Bush outlined a proposal for the United States to increase foreign economicassistance beginning in FY2004 so that by FY2006 American aid would be $5 billionhigher than three years earlier. If the aid budget rises in three equal installments of$1.67 billion each year, the initiative could provide as much as a cumulative $10billion in additional economic assistance above what might be assumed for the threeyear period without the President's initiative.

", "The concept is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to free market economic and democratic principals and policies. Conditioning assistance on policy performance and accountability by recipientnations is not new to U.S. aid programs. Since the late 1980s at least, portions ofAmerican development assistance have been allocated to some degree on aperformance-based system. What is different about the MCA is the size of thecommitment; the competitive process that will reward countries for what they havealready achieved not just what is promised for the future; the pledge to segregate thefunds from U.S. strategic foreign policy objectives that often strongly influencewhere U.S. aid is spent; and to solicit program proposals developed solely byqualifying countries.", "Assuming that Congress fully funds the President's aid request for next year and that FY2003 will be the baseline from which to compare growth in foreign aidspending during implementation of the MCA, a $5 billion dollar increase by FY2006would result in a $17.2 billion foreign aid budget. In real terms (constant FY2003dollars), taking into the account the estimated effects of inflation, U.S. economicassistance in FY2006 would be $16.14 billion, the highest amount since FY1979 andthe signing of the Camp David Middle East peace accords and FY1985, an unusualyear in which the United States responded to special Middle East economicstabilization and African famine requirements. But using FY2003 as a baselinerather than FY2000, the percentage of increase, especially in real terms (countinginflation), between FY2003 and FY2006 will be less than the 50% figure used bysome Administration officials. The nominal increase would be about 41% while inreal terms, FY2006 funding would be nearly 32% more. Because of the size of theU.S. economy and continued growth projected over the next several years, the MCAincreases will have little impact on the amount of U.S. aid as a percent of GDP. According to current projections, assistance would rise from the current 0.11% ofGDP to 0.13%.", "During the first year of the MCA, participants will be limited to the 74 poorest nations that are eligible to borrow from the World Bank's International DevelopmentAssociation and have per capita incomes below $1,435. The list will expand toinclude all lower-middle income countries by FY2006 with per capita incomes below$2,975. Participants will be selected largely based on 16 performance indicatorsrelated to the three categories of good governance, economic freedom, and investingin people. Countries that score above the median on half of the indicators in each ofthe three areas will qualify.
