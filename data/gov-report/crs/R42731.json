Unlike a tax on the energy content of each fuel (e.g., Btu tax), a carbon tax would vary with a fuel's carbon content, as there is a direct correlation between a fuel's carbon content and its CO2 emissions.", "Carbon taxes have been proposed for many years by economists and some Members of Congress, including in the 113th Congress.

Although the point of taxation does not necessarily reveal who ultimately bears the cost of the tax, this decision involves trade-offs, such as comprehensiveness versus administrative complexity.", "Several economic approaches could inform the debate over the tax rate. Congress could set a tax rate designed to accrue a specific amount of revenues. Some would recommend setting the tax rate based on estimated benefits associated with avoiding climate change impacts. Alternatively, Congress could set a tax rate based on the carbon prices estimated to meet a specific GHG emissions target.", "Carbon tax revenues would vary greatly depending on the design features of the tax, as well as market factors that are difficult to predict. A study from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a tax rate of $20 per metric ton of CO2 would generate approximately $88 billion in 2012, rising to $144 billion by 2020. The impact such an amount would have on budget deficits depends on which budget deficit projection is used.", "When deciding how to allocate revenues, policymakers would encounter key trade-offs, such as minimizing the costs of the carbon tax to \"society\" overall versus alleviating the costs borne by subgroups in the U.S. population or specific domestic industries. Economic studies indicate that using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in existing taxes\u2014labor, income, and investment\u2014could yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall. However, the approaches that yield the largest overall benefit often impose disproportionate costs on lower-income households.", "In addition, carbon-intensive, trade-exposed industries may face a disproportionate impact within a unilateral carbon tax system. Policymakers could alleviate this burden through carbon tax revenue distribution or through a border adjustment mechanism. Both approaches may entail challenges in implementation.", "Moreover, other stakeholders may advocate tax revenues be used to further other goals, including energy efficiency efforts or technology development.

Under CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, which assumes continuation of many current policies, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline to 3.7% by 2016, before again increasing to exceed 5% by 2022. Over time, unsustainable deficits can have negative macroeconomic consequences, including reduced savings for investment, higher interest rates, and higher levels of inflation. Restoring fiscal balance will require spending reductions, revenue increases, or some combination of the two.", "Policymakers have considered a number of options for raising additional federal revenues (see the text box below). One potential option is a carbon tax. Several economists and policy analysts from across the political spectrum have expressed interest in a carbon tax mechanism in recent years. Other stakeholders have expressed strong opposition to carbon tax proposals.", "In the 113 th Congress, Senators Sanders and Boxer have introduced legislation ( S. 332 ) that would apply carbon tax (a \"carbon pollution fee\") on fossil fuels and other materials, starting at $20 per ton of CO 2 emissions, rising 5.6% per year over a 10-year period. In addition, Representative Waxman and Senator Whitehouse, among others, released a carbon tax discussion draft. Their proposal would also impose a carbon pollution fee, requiring certain carbon emitters to purchase \"carbon pollution permits\" from the Department of the Treasury. The discussion draft requests comment on the level of the tax and on how the revenues should be used.", "In addition, Members proposed several carbon price systems in previous Congresses\u2014as identified in Appendix C \u2014most frequently as an efficient means to stimulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. In addition, some countries have levied carbon taxes (or something similar) for over 20 years.", "Several Members of the 113 th Congress have expressed opposition to a carbon tax. Two concurrent resolutions introduced in the House ( H.Con.Res. 8 and H.Con.Res. 24 ) propose to express the opposition of Congress to a federal carbon tax, citing concerns about the potential negative economic impact. A similar concurrent resolution has been introduced in the Senate ( S.Con.Res. 4 ).", "Other policy considerations, including environmental concerns, may also lead to consideration of a carbon tax. GHG in the atmosphere trap radiation as heat, warming the Earth's surface and oceans. The key human-related GHG is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), primarily generated through the combustion of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Although fossil fuels have facilitated economic growth in the United States and around the world, fossil fuel combustion has inadvertently raised the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 by about 40% over the past 150 years. Almost all climate scientists agree that these CO 2 increases have contributed to a warmer climate today, and that, if they continue, will contribute to future climate change.", "Many economists have argued that current fossil fuel prices reflect a market failure , because GHG emissions from fossil fuels contribute to current and future climate change, yet fossil fuel prices do not reflect climate change-related costs. Market failures distort economic efficiency by affecting consumer behavior. For example, energy consumers may make choices that are not in society's best interest, consuming more than the optimal amount of GHG emitting fuels, if prices do not reflect climate change-related costs. ", "Carbon taxes, or GHG fees, have been proposed as one means to correct such a market failure. Another option is a cap-and-trade program, which would attach a price to GHG emissions by limiting their generation. To some extent, a carbon tax and cap-and-trade program would produce similar effects: Both would place a price on carbon, and both are estimated to increase the price of fossil fuels. Preference between the two approaches ultimately depends on which variable one prefers to control\u2014GHG emissions or costs. ", "A tax based on carbon content of fuels is different from a tax based on energy content, such as a Btu tax (see the text box below). Placing an emissions fee on CO 2 (and possibly other GHG emissions) could stimulate lower emissions and spur innovation in new lower-emitting technologies. A tax or fee based approach would allow markets to determine the level of investment in lower-emissions technologies. In addition, carbon tax revenues could be used to support multiple objectives, such as deficit reduction, or to replace existing taxes (e.g., payroll, income).", "The first section of this report examines carbon tax design and implementation issues, including the point of taxation, the rate of taxation, and the distribution of tax revenue.

The point of taxation does not necessarily reveal who bears the cost of the tax, as the cost may be passed on to intermediate producers or consumers. (This will be discussed in a later section.) ", "GHG emissions are generated throughout the economy by millions of discrete sources: smokestacks, vehicle exhaust pipes, households, commercial buildings, livestock, etc. Although CO 2 is the primary GHG at many sources, some sources predominantly emit non-CO 2 GHGs, such as methane. When determining which sources and which GHG gases to control through a tax, policymakers would need to balance the benefits of comprehensiveness with administrative complexity and costs. Applying a carbon tax at the points of emissions from all GHG sources would present enormous logistical challenges. ", "CO 2 emissions are fairly easy to verify from large stationary sources, such as power plants. For almost 20 years, measurement devices have been installed in smokestacks of large facilities, reporting electronic information to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. For smaller sources, CO 2 emissions are a straightforward and accurate calculation based on the carbon content of fossil fuels consumed. Other GHG emissions, such as methane, nitrous oxides, sulfur hexafluoride, and others, could be more difficult or less reliable to verify. Thus, administrative costs and non-compliance risks would likely increase with a broader scope of an emissions tax. However, limiting the tax scope could result in perverse effects, with sources potentially shifting processes, facility size, or location to avoid taxes.", "Policymakers may consider limiting the tax to sectors or sources that emit large percentages of the total U.S. GHG emissions or those that are relatively easy to measure. Or, the tax could be applied to reliable proxies for emissions in the production-to-emission chain. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 , potential emissions could be taxed at \"upstream\" (e.g., wells) or \"midstream\" (e.g., refineries) stages in that process, taking advantage of specific chokepoints in the fossil fuel market. ", "Alternatively, policymakers could employ a \"downstream\" approach, applying a carbon tax at the point where the gas is released to the atmosphere. For example, a carbon tax could be applied at sources required to report GHG emissions to EPA. In 2011, EPA collected emissions data from approximately 8,000 facilities, covering between 85% and 90% of all U.S. GHG emissions.", "Table A-1 (in Appendix A ) lists the top emission sources of six principal GHGs in the United States. These sources combine to account for approximately 95% of these gases (based on 2011 data). Table A-1 also provides potential points of taxation that could cover some percentage of emissions from these sources. For example, fossil fuel combustion accounts for almost 80% of total U.S. GHG emissions. To attach a price to these emissions, policymakers could apply a carbon tax to a relatively small number of entities, including", "petroleum refineries (115) and petroleum importers (235); coal mines (1,296) and coal-fired generators using imported coal (19); and some combination of natural gas sector entities (discussed below).", "Table A-1 (in Appendix A ) provides several options of points in the natural gas production-consumption chain at which a carbon tax could be applied. See Figure B-1 (in Appendix B ) for an illustration of the natural gas production-consumption chain. For example, policymakers could apply a carbon tax at natural gas wellheads and points of import. This should cover 100% of the CO 2 combustion emissions from end-users as well as emissions downstream of the extraction process (e.g., fugitive emissions, pipeline operations). Although this option would involve a large universe of entities (over 500,000), a relatively small number of operators control a large percentage of domestic production. In addition, most of the natural gas producing states levy some type of tax or fee on natural gas, many of which apply at the point of production. Some of these taxes are based on volume (i.e., cubic feet); others are based on value of the resource. One potential challenge of applying the tax at the wellhead would be that the CO 2 content of the extracted gas may vary to some degree. In contrast, pipeline quality natural gas is more uniform. ", "Employing another option, policymakers could apply the tax at (1) entities who report natural gas deliveries to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Form EIA-176 and (2) natural gas processors, in sum, about 2,200 entities. This would likely cover nearly 100% of the CO 2 emissions from combustion as well as some of the CH 4 emissions from natural gas systems ( Table A-1 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rate of Taxation", "paragraphs": ["Although setting the carbon tax rate would likely involve political considerations, several economic approaches could be used to inform the debate. As a public finance instrument, the tax rate could be based on the estimated revenues needed to reduce or eliminate projected budget deficits. This approach would be challenging, because estimates of future budget deficits (and thus the revenues needed to address them) are \"inherently uncertain.\" Moreover, a carbon tax would have some impact on the overall economy (and thus the overall tax base) that would make such a calculation more difficult. ", "Alternatively, the tax rate could be tied to climate change objectives. For example, Congress could set a tax rate based on the estimated benefits associated with avoiding climate change impacts. Some economists would say that the optimal level of a carbon tax would be at the \"marginal cost of climate change,\" which is the incremental cost of damages of one more ton of emissions. This is sometimes called the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The rate could include, as well, the cost of incremental damages of ocean acidification and other possible effects associated with carbon emissions (e.g., related air pollution).", "Estimates of the risks of GHG emissions are uncertain and cover a wide range. Analysts must place monetary values on goods and services that may be difficult or controversial to estimate, such as human health/life, water supplies, agricultural production, or recreational activities. In addition, the element of time particularly complicates the valuation. The factor of time would demand a consideration of what global society should be willing to pay now to avoid future damages due to additional emissions generated today . In short, basing the tax rate on a precise estimate of GHG emission-related risks would present extraordinary challenges.", "An alternative climate change approach would involve basing the tax rate on an estimate of the carbon price needed to meet a specific GHG emissions target. Such estimates, though relatively more certain than the SCC, are similarly based on multiple assumptions. Accordingly, estimates of carbon prices in hypothetical carbon reduction schemes have varied dramatically. For example, multiple parties prepared such estimates during the development of H.R. 2454 (in the 111 th Congress), which intended to reduce GHG emissions to 17% below their 2005 levels by 2020. The emission allowance price estimates ranged from $16/metric tons of CO 2 equivalent (mtCO 2 e) to $49/tCO 2 e in 2015, with the estimated range increasing over time. Moreover, it could be challenging to reach political agreement on the GHG emissions target sought as well as the tax rate that would achieve it.", "Given the uncertainty in the above estimates and a desire to avoid \"shocking\" the economy with a sudden change in tax policy, some have proposed starting a carbon tax with a rate that is initially set at a low rate, with that rate rising annually as announced for a fixed period or indefinitely. This approach would have several potential advantages: it is simple to explain and understand; it provides predictability to investors and consumers; and it allows policymakers to hedge against the risks of carbon emissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carbon Tax Effects on Fossil Fuel Prices", "paragraphs": ["Different fossil fuels generate different amounts of CO 2 emissions per unit of energy. Therefore, a carbon tax, which is based on CO 2 emissions, would levy a higher charge (per unit of energy) on some fuels than others. As indicated in Table 1 , coal generates approximately 80% more CO 2 emissions per unit of energy than natural gas, and approximately 28% more emissions per energy than crude oil. These differences in emissions intensity would lead to different tax rates per unit of energy across different fuels in a carbon tax regime.", " Table 2 includes estimates of the tax levied on fossil fuels and motor gasoline at different carbon tax rates. The change in price that consumers would see would likely not be the same as the carbon tax. Carbon taxes could affect fuel prices in complex ways. For example, energy consumers, to the extent possible, would likely shift their preferences to less expensive fuels, and the underlying prices of the fuels would change. Actual price increases that result from the illustrative carbon taxes in Table 2 would depend on whether", "a carbon tax is applied at the beginning of the production process (\"upstream\") to fossil fuels ( Figure 1 ); the price impacts are passed through to end-users and not absorbed by upstream energy producers or midstream entities (such as retailers); and consumers modify their behavior in the marketplace\u2014energy conservation, fuel substitution, etc."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Framework for Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Policymakers may consider a carbon tax based on a number of policy motivations and potential benefits, including", "increased federal revenues, reduced federal budget deficits, reduced GHG emissions, climate change, and ocean acidification, enhanced energy security, improved economic efficiency, and/or reduced tax rates from other revenue sources.", "In recent years in the United States, most carbon tax proposals have aimed primarily to discourage GHG emissions. In these proposals, a tax or fee would be levied on GHG emissions or the inputs (i.e., fossil fuels) that lead to emissions. The tax or fee raises the price of the emission-generating products, and therefore can, on the one hand, motivate suppliers to reduce the emissions involved in making the product and, on the other hand, encourage consumers to buy less of the product. This policy instrument sets the tax (cost) per unit of emissions and relies on private decision-makers to find the most efficient means to reduce the emissions. A carbon tax is one of several \"market mechanisms\" that relies on the efficiencies of markets to maximize cost-effectiveness.", "Though this policy instrument is commonly called a \"carbon tax,\" its application could be broader than this term suggests. First, the policy may apply not just to CO 2 emissions, but also to multiple GHGs (e.g., methane or sulfur hexafluoride), including some that may have no molecular carbon. Second, if the levy's primary purpose were to charge those who use the atmosphere to absorb the full cost of their GHG emissions, the levy might instead be considered a \"user fee.\" Regardless, this report uses the term \"carbon tax,\" because this report focuses on the policy instrument's potential to raise revenues and reduce the federal budget deficit.", "There are a number of issues to be considered when evaluating tax policy proposals.

The auction revenues generated in this program would be analogous to tax revenues under a carbon tax system. CBO estimated the allowance price, which, under an actual program, would be determined by market forces, would begin at $20 per metric ton of CO 2 (mtCO 2 ) in 2012 and increase 5.6% annually. This allowance price estimate, and its projected annual increase, is akin to a prescribed carbon tax rate. CBO estimated that such a regime would raise $1.2 trillion over the 2012 to 2021 budget window ( Table 3 ). ", "As a point of reference for the above carbon tax revenue estimates, Figure 2 identifies the major sources of federal receipts in FY2011. As the figure illustrates, the range of potential carbon tax revenues is comparable (at least in the early years of the carbon tax system) to the revenues collected from current federal excise taxes. Nearly half of all federal excise tax receipts come from taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels.", "Legislation introduced in the 112 th Congress, the Save Our Climate Act of 2011 ( H.R. 3242 ), would have established a carbon tax on domestic and imported fossil fuels, as well as the carbon content of biomass, municipal solid waste, and any organic material used as fuel. The tax rate would have begun at $10 per short ton of CO 2 emissions (tCO 2 ), increasing by $10 annually until total U.S. CO 2 emissions are 20% or less of CO 2 emissions in 1990. The bill states that it would reduce the federal budget deficit by $480 billion over 10 years.", "Other revenue estimates have been made in recent years of carbon taxes considered or included in a number of deficit and debt reduction proposals. As one example, in 2010, the bipartisan Debt Reduction Task Force (Domenici-Rivlin) considered, but did not ultimately recommend, a tax on CO 2 emissions. The report estimated that a tax of $23 per ton of CO 2 emissions starting in 2018, increasing 5.8% annually, would raise approximately $1.1 trillion in cumulative revenues through 2025.", "In addition to a carbon tax design, a 2012 Resources for the Future (RFF) study identified several factors\u2014electricity demand and natural gas prices\u2014that could influence carbon tax revenue. The study found that the magnitude of these factors' influence increases as the tax rate increases. Figure 3 illustrates the RFF study findings. ", "In Figure 3 , RFF compares tax revenue estimates using assumptions from EIA's 2009 and 2011 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) publications. According to the study, the AEO assumptions regarding future electricity demand and fuel prices, namely natural gas, varied dramatically between the 2009 and 2011 versions. These variances lead to different estimates of potential carbon tax revenue. For example, as illustrated in Figure 3 , estimated revenues in 2020 from a tax rate of $25/mtCO 2 would vary across scenarios by about $10 billion. A $40/mtCO 2 tax rate would generate an estimated revenue range across scenarios of almost $20 billion in 2020.", "Further, Figure 3 highlights a key result of a carbon tax that may affect its ability to provide a reliable source of revenue. Note that the tax revenues in the electricity sector begin to decline around 2030 with the $40/mtCO 2 tax rate. The study concluded this decline is due to a diminishing reliance on fossil fuels and relatively greater reliance on low-carbon energy sources, such as renewables and nuclear. ", "The projected scenario in Figure 3 highlights a fundamental revenue adequacy concern associated with a carbon tax approach: if a primary goal of a carbon tax is to reduce its own tax base (i.e., carbon emissions), would this tax provide a reliable stream of revenues over time? With revenue reliability as a primary goal, governments impose taxes on activities to which producers and consumers are not very price-sensitive. In other words, the imposed taxes lead to minimal changes in market behavior. Researchers debate how much producers and consumers would respond to a tax on GHG emissions by reducing emissions or switching to goods and services that generate fewer emissions (because they embody lower taxes). With a higher degree of responsiveness, either revenues would decline or the tax rate per ton of emissions would need to increase over time to maintain the revenue stream (assuming that maintaining certain revenue stream is determined to be a policy objective).

Further, a stand-alone carbon tax (e.g., one where revenues were not used to offset other taxes) could have efficiency costs, as a carbon tax would increase existing distortions on inputs in the production process.

Many economists consider that taxes take money away from people and change the relative prices of goods and services compared to what they would be without taxes; thus, taxes are considered \"distortionary\" by altering free market decisions. To minimize distortions (and generate a reliable stream of revenues), governments often prefer to tax products or activities for which consumer demands are relatively insensitive to price increases. Some of these taxed items are recognized as essential or socially desirable, such as income, employment, and investment. Taxes may also be \"distortionary\" because they discourage a taxed but beneficial activity. For example, many economists argue that payroll and income taxes are distortionary because they discourage employment and investment. If these taxes were reduced, the incentives to hire/work and invest, they argue, would be greater.", "Also, as tax rates (i.e., the tax per unit of a product or service) increase, they become more distortionary. That is, higher tax rates have greater potential to shift choices away from optimal \"free market\" outcomes. As an example, consumers may respond proportionately more strongly to a $1.00 tax per gallon on gasoline than a $0.20 tax per gallon (in other words, the efficiency losses associated with a tax increase exponentially with the tax rate).

An alternative approach is to look at the distribution of the carbon tax, assuming that the carbon tax reduces returns to factors of production: labor, capital, and fossil fuel resources. Under this approach, the regressivity of a carbon tax is reduced. If the burden of the carbon tax falls more heavily on owners of capital, as opposed to labor, the carbon tax affects higher income households that tend to derive more of their income from capital. Further, lower income households that receive a larger share of their income from transfer payments (e.g., social security), would be less affected by a carbon tax. While the \"baseline\" distribution of a carbon tax (i.e., the distribution of a carbon tax absent revenue recycling) differs under various modeling assumptions, the general conclusions regarding different policy choices for uses of carbon tax revenues often remain the same.
