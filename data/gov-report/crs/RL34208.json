The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health held a hearing on June 12, 2007, that discussed the creation of a public-private body that would oversee comparative clinical effectiveness research. The director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) concluded at the hearing that comparative clinical effectiveness research, combined with changes in payment incentives, \"offers a promising mechanism for reducing health care costs to a significant degree over the long term while maintaining or improving the health of Americans,\" while emphasizing that significant cost savings from such research would not been seen for many years. The executive director of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) stated that \"there is not enough credible, empirically based comparative-effectiveness information available to patients, providers, and payers to make informed treatment decisions.\" AARP, an advocacy group for persons aged 50 and older, mentioned the need for comparative effectiveness studies for pharmaceuticals as early as 2005 in their Solutions Statement to the White House Conference on Aging. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a trade association representing health insurance plans, has urged Congress to give the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the authority to use comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness information in its coverage and reimbursement decisions. Jack Rowe, the former chief executive officer of Aetna, has stated that employers are \"dying\" to have information on the comparative effectiveness of treatments. On the other hand, some have expressed reservations about funding increased comparative clinical effectiveness research. Scott Gottlieb, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (AEI), articulated problems he perceived with government-sponsored prescription drug research, including poor study design, lack of access to full study results, and bias in interpreting the results.

Representatives Tom Allen (D-ME) and Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO) co-sponsored H.R. 2184 , which would establish a public-private funding mechanism for comparative clinical effectiveness research, overseen by an independent advisory board. The Act would establish a trust fund for the research that would receive $100 million in FY2008, $200 million in FY2009, and $900 million per year for FY2010-FY2012. Similarly, H.R. 3162 , the Children's Health and Medicare Protection (CHAMP) Act of 2007, would establish a public-private funding mechanism for comparative clinical effectiveness research, overseen by an independent commission, and a trust fund that would be appropriated at least $90 million in FY2008, $100 million in FY2009, $110 million in 2010, and no more than $90 million in years thereafter. CBO has stated that the information produced by the comparative effectiveness portion of the CHAMP Act would reduce total spending by public and private purchasers by $0.5 billion over 5 years and $6 billion over 10 years. Direct spending by the federal government was estimated to be reduced by $0.1 billion over 5 years and $1.3 billion over 10 years. Thus, the majority of the savings from the research would be realized by private purchasers rather than by the federal government. The net federal expenditures from the comparative effectiveness portion of the CHAMP Act were estimated to be $0.5 billion over 5 years and $1.1 billion over 10 years. CBO assumed the savings would primarily be realized through changes in physicians' practice patterns and, to a lesser extent, changes in coverage rules. The Healthy Americans Act, S. 334 and H.R. 3163 , includes tax deduction, patent extension, and market exclusivity incentives for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research. The Josephine Butler United States Health Service Act, H.R. 3000 , would create a National Health Board that includes a new institute\u2014the National Institute of Evaluative Clinical Research.

More specifically, how should the benefits observed in a clinical trial be extrapolated to the rest of the population?

For example, randomized clinical trials conducted for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing approval typically aim to assess the relative safety and efficacy of a treatment so as to best determine the sole effect of the treatment, absent any other influential factors. Clinical trials for FDA approval also typically compare the efficacy of an investigational treatment to a placebo, rather than another treatment. Effectiveness research relaxes the strict exclusionary criteria that are typically required in such trials, in order to assess the treatment in the wide range of patients and environments in which the product is actually used.", "Efficacy and effectiveness research results may differ because often in clinical practice, patients may have more than one illness, doses may vary, methods of administering the treatment may vary, and patients may simultaneously take treatments for multiple illnesses. Moreover, large segments of the potential patient population are often excluded from efficacy trials in order to achieve a more uniform study population. An often cited example is that many patients with high blood pressure also have diabetes; yet, efficacy clinical trials for high blood pressure treatments may not include patients with diabetes. As a result, any interaction between blood pressure and diabetes medications may not be known until the treatment is approved by the FDA and used in clinical practice. Also, different patients may respond to treatments differently due to physiologic differences, such as different metabolic rates of drugs and safety of anesthesia in surgical options.", "Although conducted after FDA approval, post-marketing (also known as phase IV) studies are not necessarily effectiveness studies, and only rarely could be classified as comparative effectiveness studies. Post-marketing studies most often assess any ongoing safety concerns of one drug or device rather than the effectiveness of a product.

Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit differ in how the health benefits are measured. In cost-benefit analysis, the health benefits are monetarized, and the results are stated either in the form of a ratio or monetary difference between costs and benefits. In cost-effectiveness analyses, the health benefits are commonly measured in non-monetary units, such as life years (i.e., the additional years of life gained) or life years adjusted for quality (i.e., quality-adjusted life years\u2014QALYs), and the end product is usually a ratio of the costs and benefits (e.g., dollars/QALY).

AHRQ designated and funded the TEC as one of its first Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) in 1997, and renewed the designation for an additional five years in 2002. The TEC relies upon medical and research employees to conduct the evaluations, under the guidance of their Medical Advisory Panel of clinical experts. The Center produced 17 evaluations in 2005, 14 in 2006, and 4 between January and August 2007. The Center's evaluations focus on the relative effectiveness of technologies, particularly with regard to the effect upon health outcomes, such as length of life, quality of life, and functional abilities. The TEC compares the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and health services. Cost-effectiveness analyses are mentioned by the TEC as a potential type of special technology assessment the Center may undertake; however, since 2005, none of the publicly available assessments have analyzed the cost-effectiveness of technologies. All evaluations use the same criteria, approach for reviewing the evidence, and format for reporting the results. The evaluations are intended to be for informational purposes only and are not characterized as recommendations or guidelines. All completed evaluations are available for free on the center's website, along with the list of technology evaluations in process.", "Consumer Reports' Best Buy Drugs Project", "Consumer Reports' Best Buy Drugs is a non-profit project of Consumer Reports that is primarily supported by educational grants. The project synthesizes DERP findings in order to provide comparative effectiveness information about drugs to health care consumers and providers, and selects \"Best Buy picks\" within drug classes; the most influential factor in the selection process is the drug's effectiveness. The summaries include information on effectiveness, safety, and price. The drug prices are national average cash prices. The summaries are available for free on the project's website, and are updated as new information becomes available.", "DOD PharmacoEconomic Center", "The Department of Defense (DOD) PharmacoEconomic Center (PEC) was established in 1992 in response to rising DOD pharmaceutical expenditures. Its mission is to \"improve the clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of drug therapy in support of the readiness and managed healthcare missions of the Military Health System.\" The center performs cost-effectiveness analyses, works with the DOD P&T committee to establish the Tri-Service Drug Formulary list and the National Mail Order Pharmacy formulary list, provides drug treatment guidelines with the VHA, and monitors drugs' use, cost, and pharmacoeconomics within the Military Health System. Some of the evaluations by the PEC are publicly available. The PEC publishes a monthly newsletter called the PEC Update \"to educate health care providers and other pharmacy benefit stakeholders about cost-effective drug therapy.\" PEC analyses have shown that the center has improved patient safety and decreased costs for the Military Health System.", "Drug Effectiveness Review Project", "In 2001, the Oregon state legislature began commissioning, through the Oregon Medicaid program, the Oregon Health Science University (OHSU) to assess the comparative clinical effectiveness and safety of drugs in clinical practice. The initiative was named the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP). OHSU was a logical location for the initiative since, at the time, it was an AHRQ funded EPC; as such, it completed systematic literature reviews to produce evidence reports and technology assessments. The reviews were viewed as a way to equalize buyers' and sellers' information about heterogeneous products. Credibility and transparency of the research were viewed as crucial to the success of the project, and DERP's conflict of interest policy forbids its reviewers from having financial ties with the companies whose products they are evaluating.", "Currently, a team of researchers at OHSU coordinate the reviews with experts in the clinical area. The reviews incorporate a scientific literature review as well as assessments of the evidence on the effectiveness, safety and adverse effects of the drugs nationwide, as well as in sub-populations. Cost information is explicitly excluded from the reviews. The reviews only compare drugs within a class, and do not compare the effectiveness of medical devices or health services. The primary audience for the DERP reviews is the state Medicaid programs, which use them to help inform Medicaid drug coverage decisions. Topics are chosen at biannual public meetings with the state pharmacy directors and medical directors from the funding Medicaid programs; the selection is based upon Medicaid expenditures, the potential usefulness of a review, and availability of data. Once a drug class is chosen, a solicitation for information is sent to all pharmaceutical manufacturers with products in the class of interest. Any information provided to DERP by manufacturers is disclosed on request to any interested party. DERP also draws upon information from the published and unpublished scientific literature. DERP does not conduct new comparative effectiveness studies and only uses existing information. The possible outcomes of a DERP report are (1) no evidence of differences between drugs, (2) some differences under some circumstances, (3) unclear whether drugs differ, and (4) significant differences between drugs. The final reports do not make coverage, payment, or formulary recommendations. Rather, state decision making groups in the funding Medicaid programs use the DERP reports to help reach conclusions about coverage, payment, and formulary status; notably, states may not necessarily reach the same conclusion after reviewing the same DERP report. All DERP reports are available for free on the website. As of August 2007, 13 states (plus the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health) were participating in and financially supporting DERP, which has produced more than 30 reports since October 1, 2003.", "ECRI Institute", "Some non-profit organizations, such as ECRI Institute, also perform health care technology assessments and comparative effectiveness analyses. The clients of these organizations may range from private insurers to government agencies. For example, ECRI is one of AHRQ's EPCs and provides health technology assessments to the DOD TRICARE program, but also counts the World Health Organization, hospitals and private insurers as clients.", "For-Profit Firms", "Many for-profit firms also perform technology assessments, including comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, or pharmaceutical outcomes research, for their clients, such as pharmaceutical manufacturers and health insurers. Examples of such firms are Hayes Inc., and United Biosource Corporation (formerly known as MEDTAP). Other firms, such as McKesson's InterQual, produce clinical guidelines and decision support criteria for clients. Many pharmaceutical and private health insurance plans also perform technology assessments in-house. Much of the information produced by such firms may be considered confidential client information and would not be available to the public.", "Medicare", "As dictated by statute, Medicare pays for medically needed and necessary services provided to elderly and disabled individuals. Fundamental questions concern what constitutes medically reasonable and necessary care and under what circumstances should the care be covered by the program? These determinations happen through two mechanisms: national coverage determinations (NCDs) and local coverage determinations (LCDs). As the terms imply, NCDs are coverage determinations that are made by CMS and applied across the nation, whereas LCDs are coverage determinations made by local contractors for the Medicare program and applied to limited geographic areas.", "Medicare has had an uneven history of incorporating the cost-effectiveness of treatments when establishing coverage determinations. In 1989, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the predecessor to CMS, issued a Federal Register notice proposing that cost-effectiveness information be included as a component of Medicare coverage decisions. This was the first time that HCFA had ever proposed to include cost-effectiveness as a factor in coverage decisions. The 1989 proposal met substantial opposition by professional and industry groups, and as a result was never implemented and instead was withdrawn in 1999. In 2000, Medicare issued new guidelines for determination of coverage that included demonstrable medical benefit and \"added value.\" The medical benefit was to be determined using \"evidence-based medicine,\" which weighs the risks and benefits of a treatment by considering the reliability of the source of the evidence. Evidence could include experimental studies, expert opinion, informal studies, logical reasoning from biological knowledge, or clinical guidelines. The term \"added value\" was defined as adding greater benefit; if two technologies provided equal benefit, then only the lower cost technology would be covered. Due to opposition to the notion of \"added value,\" the 2000 notice of intent for determination of coverage was withdrawn in 2003 and never implemented.", "Since January 2006, CMS has explicitly excluded treatment costs from its NCDs. In a 2006 coverage guidance, CMS stated \"cost effectiveness is not a factor CMS considers in making national coverage determinations.\" On the same day, CMS issued a guidance on technology assessments that included the statement \"cost is not a factor in our review or determination to cover a particular technology.\"", "In June 2006, a chapter in the MedPAC report explored the methodological advantages and disadvantages of using cost-effectiveness analysis in Medicare. The chapter notes that the results (and conclusions) of cost-effectiveness studies may vary due to differences in studies' methods, differences in the clinical characteristics of patients, and the timing of the study. Moreover, the report noted that some studies' methods were opaque. The report states that considering the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments might increase the return on society's investment in health care, but doing so will be most useful when results are comparable across studies and treatments.", "CMS continues to use the \"evidence-based medicine\" approach to evaluate a treatment's health benefit, and studies from AHRQ's EPCs may be included as evidence. CMS also is gathering information about the effectiveness of treatments through its Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) program. Under CED, CMS may cover a treatment with the condition that providers and patients who use the treatment allow data to be collected about the patient, treatment, and health outcomes. This information would then be evaluated to ensure that the medical care is reasonable and necessary. CED may be required for treatments that (1) are in new drug classes with new mechanisms; (2) may be effective only for subpopulations; (3) may provide clinical benefit for off-label uses; or (4) may have substantial consequences for treating the wrong patients.", "In contrast to NCDs, CMS believes their contractors have the authority to use cost and cost-effectiveness for LCDs, specifically with regard to \"least costly alternative\" policies. Least costly alternative policies state that a Medicare contractor will not pay the additional cost of a more expensive item if a clinically comparable item costs less. Such policies have been proposed for nebulizers used for respiratory conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis, and implemented for Lupron and Zoladex, treatments for advanced prostate cancer.", "Office of Technology Assessment", "Although charged with being a nonpartisan source of information about scientific and technical issues for the legislative branch, the analyses of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) were, at times, controversial. Part of the reason for the controversy was its explicit inclusion of costs and cost-effectiveness in health technology assessments. Another part of the reason for controversy was the work was perceived by some as not timely enough, duplicative of other agencies, and not necessarily useful to public programs. As a result of the controversy, the agency was disbanded in 1995, 23 years after its inception, as part of budget reductions in the 104 th Congress. Prior to its disbandment, the OTA was the smallest Congressional agency, with less than 200 employees and an annual budget of $22 million. The agency released approximately 50 reports each year.", "In creating the agency, great care had been taken to ensure and protect the agency's nonpartisanship and scientific integrity. The OTA was governed by the Technology Assessment Board (TAB), which was composed of six Senators and six Representatives with equal representation from each party. The TAB appointed the Director of OTA, for a six-year term, as well as an advisory council of 10 experts, including the Comptroller General and the Director of the Congressional Research Service, to advise the Agency. The TAB also reviewed all proposed studies as well as the final reports prior to release. The agency's studies did not recommend a single policy option, but rather laid out different options and projected the possible consequences of each.", "The Chairman of any congressional committee, the TAB, and the Director of OTA had the authority to request any technology assessment from OTA; the assessments generally took 1-2 years to complete. Relevant stakeholders and experts were consulted on the reports to provide a diversity of viewpoints and to help shape and critique interim reports. Once they were approved by TAB, the final reports were publicly released.", "Oregon Health Plan", "An objective of the Oregon Basic Health Services Act of 1989 was to expand the population covered by Medicaid, to all Oregonians with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level. The additional costs would be managed by covering fewer services. In order to expand the program in this manner, the Oregon Medicaid program was required to receive a federal waiver of Medicaid statutes. Even though increasing the income limits for Medicaid eligibility in this manner is credited with helping to reduce the percentage of uninsured in Oregon from 18% in 1992 to 11% in 1996, controversy surrounded the Oregon Medicaid program's process of selecting which services to cover. The Oregon Health Plan was the first large-scale public attempt to apply cost-effectiveness analysis to set priorities for medical services. The struggles of the program had ripple effects on the use of cost-effectiveness analysis in other settings.", "The Act created the Oregon Health Services Commission and charged it with developing a list that ranked medical services by priority. The program initially used cost-effectiveness analysis to develop the prioritized list. The value of the health benefits was determined by assessing (1) Oregonians' community values of different treatments in town meetings; (2) Oregonians' ratings of the desirability of health states (i.e., health-related quality of life); and (3) medical professionals' judgment of the efficacy of different treatments. The resulting cost-effectiveness ratios were criticized by some as not being reflective of societal values. Critics noted that capping teeth would have been ranked as a higher priority than life-saving surgery for appendicitis. Some researchers concluded that cost should not be considered in determining treatment priorities, while others blamed what they saw as counterintuitive rankings on the methods for measuring benefits. As a result of the controversy, the Oregon health commissioners' re-ranked the treatments, which resulted in rankings that were not necessarily related to treatments' relative costs and benefits, and were perceived to be more subjective. The revised list included 709 disease-treatment combinations, and the state Medicaid budget allowed the program to cover the costs of combinations 1 through 587.", "In August 1992, the Department of HHS rejected Oregon's waiver application due to concerns about possible discrimination against disabled people through the use of Oregonians' ratings of the desirability of health states; these concerns were supported by an analysis by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). In November 1992, the Oregon Medicaid program submitted a new list that did not use ratings of health states. As a result, the new list was not based on cost-effectiveness ratios and instead was perceived by some observers to be more the result of pressure from advocacy groups and the commissioners' judgments. The revised plan was approved in March 1993 and implemented in 1994.", "The Oregon program's analysis was very different from many other cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and comparative effectiveness analyses because treatments for each disease were compared to treatments for entirely different diseases. Most other cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses compare like-to-like\u2014that is, only treatments for the same disease are compared to each other. For example, the costs and benefits of a treatment for colorectal cancer would not typically be compared to a treatment for heart disease, but the Oregon program explicitly compared treatments in this manner.", "U.S. Preventive Services Task Force", "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) was established in 1984 as an independent federal advisory committee, under the U.S. Public Health Service, and given the responsibility of developing clinical practice guidelines for primary care physicians. The USPSTF took what was perceived to be a novel approach at the time by basing the guidelines upon quality and strength of clinical evidence, rather than simply \"expert consensus.\" The task force published its first set of guidelines in 1989, and was reconvened in 1990 and 1998, the latter of which incorporated cost-effectiveness analysis in its reviews and was financially supported by AHRQ. The USPSTF has also sponsored some cost-effectiveness studies to better inform the USPSTF clinical practice guidelines. The guidelines, in general, focus on the prevention of diseases, and compare the preventative methods. They do not explicitly compare different drugs or technologies, but rather they compare screening to taking preventative medications to surgical options for a disease.", "Veterans Health Administration", "The Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Healthcare Group (PBMSHG) was established within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in 1995 to improve the health status of veterans by encouraging the appropriate use of medications. To this end, the group compares and publishes analyses of the effectiveness of drugs in the same class, produces clinical practice guidelines, and drug monographs, in addition to establishing the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) formulary, drug pricing, and contracts. Twenty-five drug class reviews were available on the group's website. However, the group does not publish the guidelines that are used in the internally generated economic assessments.", "Other Governments' Initiatives", "Australia", "The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is the Australian health care system's program of subsidizing the cost of outpatient prescription medicines for all Australian citizens who are residents. The objective of the PBS is \"to provide timely access to medicines that Australians need, at a cost individuals and the community can afford.\" Approximately 80% of all prescription medicines in Australia are subsidized under the PBS and more than 90% of outpatient drugs. Drugs may be sold in Australia if they pass the Australian regulatory review, which is similar to the FDA, but patients pay the full cost of the drugs unless they are listed on the PBS. The PBS has more than 650 drugs (more than 2500 items) on the formulary, which includes at least one drug for most medical conditions for which drug therapy is appropriate. To be included in the formulary, a drug must be evaluated by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), which is an independent panel of experts that recommends to the Minister of Health and Ageing whether a drug should be included. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority (PBPA) then provides advice to the Minister on negotiating an appropriate price for formulary drugs.", "The PBAC is required to consider the comparative clinical effectiveness, and comparative cost-effectiveness of a drug relative to the therapy most likely to be replaced in practice, which may be another drug and non-drug therapy. The existence of one drug on the formulary does not preclude the addition of a similar drug to the formulary; the number of drugs available to treat a particular condition is not limited. A positive recommendation from PBAC is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for inclusion on the formulary. In other words, the Minister can only add drugs to the formulary that have received a positive recommendation but not all drugs that receive a positive recommendation are automatically added. The only circumstance in which a Minister has exercised the right to not add a positively recommended drug occurred in 2002 when the Minister elected to not include Viagra. This decision was reportedly made due to concern about the impact of erectile dysfunction treatments on the PBS budget. Accordingly, the Minister simultaneously removed Caverject, the only drug at the time that was included on the PBS for the treatment of impotence.", "To make a submission to the PBAC, sponsors (usually pharmaceutical manufacturers) are required to undertake a literature review, identify relevant trials, assess the quality of the trials, and aggregate the trial data. They are also required to perform a cost-minimization or cost-effectiveness analysis (which may include modeled analyses), the selection of which would follow PBAC's guidelines. The sponsor selects the initial price of their drug for the economic analysis and nominates a comparator drug. If PBAC does not agree that the nominated comparator is appropriate, then it may instruct the sponsor to use a different comparator drug.", "The submitted trials may evaluate either the efficacy or effectiveness of the drug. Head-to-head randomized clinical trials, while preferred, are not mandatory. If such direct comparisons are not available, sponsors may submit two sets of randomized trials, or even non-randomized trials, that use the same reference drug. However, the guidelines note that non-randomized studies often over-estimate the benefit of an intervention, and \"claims about the comparative clinical performance that are based solely on data from such sources will be treated with some scepticism.\" Applicant sponsors are required to demonstrate that differences between the comparison treatments are statistically significant as well as clinically important.", "If a drug does not receive a positive recommendation by the PBAC, then the manufacturer may resubmit the application and provide additional data for the committee's consideration. If no additional data are available, the sponsor may seek an independent review. The independent review may only consider specific issues in dispute and cannot review the PBAC's overall recommendation.", "Canada", "The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) provides assessments of the effectiveness and efficiency of drugs and health technologies to Canadian health decision makers. It is a non-profit organization that was established by the Canadian government on a trial-basis in 1990; it became a permanent entity in 1993. The agency is funded on an annual basis by the Canadian government.", "One of CADTH's programs is the Canadian Expert Drug Advisory Committee (CEDAC), which makes recommendations to participating publicly financed drug insurance plans regarding inclusion of a new drug in formularies. CEDAC is an independent advisory committee that is accountable to the CADTH Board of Directors. Its recommendations are informed by drug evaluations from the Common Drug Review (CDR), which is an intergovernmental body established in 2003 to evaluate new chemical entities (NCEs) and drug combinations. A CDR evaluation includes the safety, clinical efficacy, therapeutic advantages and disadvantages, and the relative cost-effectiveness of a drug; it does not consider the net cost or budgetary impact of the drug.", "Another of CADTH's programs is the Canadian Optimal Medication Prescribing and Utilization Service (COMPUS), which was launched in 2004 and is charged with identifying and promoting best clinical practices. COMPUS does not create new guidelines, but rather critiques and rates the evidence of guidelines produced by others. The most influential factors in determining COMPUS's research priorities are variations in practice, affected patient population size, availability of data on outcomes, and approval by Canadian deputy ministers of health.", "United Kingdom", "The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was established in April 1999 and expanded its responsibilities, to include guidance on the prevention of ill health and the promotion of good health, and became the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in April 2005. Its mission is to advise health care providers in England and Wales on how to use resources effectively and deliver the highest quality of care to National Health Service (NHS) patients. NICE is an independent organization that is funded by the Department of Health in England (with contributions from Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), and accountable to the British Parliament. It was established as one of several \"arm's-length bodies\" within the NHS so as to politically insulate the organization and help to produce intellectually honest, high quality guidance. The total CY2007 budget was \u00a331 million for recurring programs, \u00a34 million for non-recurring programs, and a separate \u00a33.5 million for guidance on technologies.", "Among other types of guidelines, NICE produces guidance on new and existing technology and treatments based on their clinical and cost-effectiveness, the latter of which is required to be included. The cost, utilization, uncertainty, and variation in use of the product are considered to be critical factors in selecting topics for the guidelines. As of May 2007, NICE had published 119 guidelines for new and existing technologies and 46 for treatments. The guidelines play a large role in drug cost reimbursement by the NHS, and as such are important to pharmaceutical manufacturers. For example, some manufacturers have recently cut the price of their products due to concern about potentially negative NICE guidelines. Investors and Wall Street analysts also tend to be concerned about negative NICE guidelines because of their potential impact on NHS coverage and manufacturers' revenues.", "NICE does not fund new primary research. Rather, the analysis is produced by academics who use existing research, gathered through systematic literature reviews, and statistical modeling to answer the questions poised by NICE. These academics are affiliated with either universities or professional organizations (Royal Colleges). Multidiscliplinary committees review the technology and clinical assessments and consult with relevant stakeholders to produce determinations, guidelines, and public health guidance. Determinations can be appealed before NICE releases its final determination guidance directly to the NHS.", "The process and methods are publicly available and accessible, and all guidance is subject to public consultation. Draft recommendations are subject to public appeals from stakeholders. The evidence on which the recommendations are made is publicly available, with the exception of companies' confidential information. NHS managers are expected to fund the mandatory implementation of technology appraisals no later than three months after the guidance is issued. It is recognized that the implementation of other types of guidelines may take longer than three months due to their greater scope.", "The cost-effectiveness analysis includes only the costs from the perspective of the public decision maker, and the comparison treatment is the most commonly used alternative treatment. The analyses segment the patient populations by the value and clinical benefit added by the drug. As a result, the majority of the guidelines state whether a technology or treatment is effective, and specify the population in which the product is most cost-effective.", "NICE does not account for the budget impact or affordability of a new technology. Some researchers disagree with this separation and feel that NICE should prioritize its guidance within a fixed budget, or use some other method that helps contain NHS costs. Researchers and policymakers have also disagreed about the role cost-effectiveness should play in the NICE appraisal process."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
