The program is funded by HUD, but administered at the local level by quasi-governmental local public housing authorities (PHAs). This account funds the annual renewal of the roughly 2 million vouchers authorized by Congress, as well as their associated administrative costs, and, in some years, new vouchers.

In recent years, it has also been the source of the most contention in HUD's budget. Primarily, attention has been focused on whether the amount of funding provided for voucher renewals is sufficient to fund all of the vouchers authorized by Congress and/or in use by families, and how that renewal funding is to be allocated to PHAs. (While there is a statutory formula for allocating voucher funds to PHAs, it has been overridden in recent years by formulas adopted by Congress in the appropriations acts.)", "The amount available for voucher renewals each year is made up of two parts: current year appropriations, and advance appropriations provided in the prior year that become available in the current year.

This represents an increase from the $15,703 million available in FY2008, but a decrease from the $16,391 million provided in FY2008.

Specifically, it requested that PHAs be provided funding based on the amount of funding they received in the previous year. This would be a change from the FY2008 funding formula, which funded PHAs based on their costs and voucher usage (referred to as utilization) over the prior year. This debate\u2014over whether to fund PHAs based on the budget they received in the prior year or based on their expenses\u2014has gone back and forth since FY2003.
