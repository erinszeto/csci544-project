The term \"unfunded mandates\" generally refers to requirements that a unit of government imposes without providing funds to pay for costs of compliance. UMRA establishes mechanisms to limit federal imposition of unfunded mandates on other levels of government (intergovernmental mandates) and on the private sector. The act establishes points of order against proposed legislation containing an unfunded intergovernmental mandate, requires executive agencies to seek comment on regulations that would constitute a mandate, and establishes a means for judicial enforcement. This report will be updated if the act is amended."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of UMRA", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of the Act", "paragraphs": ["Enactment of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) culminated years of effort by nonfederal government officials and their advocates to control, if not eliminate, the federal imposition of unfunded mandates. Supporters contend that the statute is needed to forestall federal legislation and regulations that impose questionable or unnecessary burdens and have resulted in high costs and inefficiencies. Opponents argue that mandates may be necessary to achieve results in areas in which voluntary action may be insufficient or state actions have not achieved intended goals.", "Since the mid-1980s, Congress debated legislation to slow or prohibit the enactment of unfunded federal mandates. The inclusion of the issue in the Contract with America, the blueprint of legislative action developed by the House Republican leadership when it gained the majority, practically guaranteed that action would be taken. UMRA was signed into law early in the 104 th Congress, on March 22, 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coverage of the Act", "paragraphs": ["Under UMRA, federal mandates include provisions of law or regulation that impose enforceable duties, including taxes. They also include provisions that reduce or eliminate federal financial assistance available for carrying out an existing duty. UMRA distinguishes between \"intergovernmental mandates,\" imposed on state, local, or tribal governments, and \"private sector mandates.\" Intergovernmental mandates include legislation or regulations that would (1) reduce certain federal services to state, local, and tribal governments (such as border control or reimbursement for services to illegal aliens); and (2) tighten conditions of assistance or reduce federal funding for existing intergovernmental assistance programs with entitlement authority of $500 million or more. Exclusions and exemptions outside the reach of the statute are discussed later in this report.", "Under UMRA, an intergovernmental mandate is considered unfunded unless the legislation authorizing the mandate meets its costs by either (1) providing new budget authority (direct spending authority or entitlement authority) or (2) authorizing appropriations. If appropriations are authorized, the mandate is considered unfunded unless the legislation ensures that in any fiscal year (1) the actual costs of the mandate will not exceed the appropriations actually provided; (2) the terms of the mandate will be revised so that it can be carried out with the funds appropriated; (3) the mandate will be abolished; or (4) Congress will enact new legislation to continue the mandate as an unfunded mandate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contents of the Act", "paragraphs": ["The act consists of five prefatory sections and four titles. The prefatory sections address matters such as the purpose, short title, and exclusions from coverage of the act. Title I amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, as amended, to permit Congress to (1) identify legislation proposing mandates, and (2) decline to consider legislation proposing unfunded intergovernmental mandates. Title I also sets forth thresholds for action, authorizations, and definitions. Title II requires that federal agencies assess the financial impact of proposed rules on nonfederal entities, determine whether federal resources exist to pay those costs, solicit and consider input from affected entities, and generally select the least costly or burdensome regulatory option. Title III called for a review of federal mandates to be completed within 18 months of enactment. This statutory requirement was not completed. UMRA assigned the study to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), which no longer exists. The ACIR completed a preliminary report in January, 1996, but the final report was not released. Title IV authorizes judicial review of federal agency compliance with Title II provisions.

Also, committee chairs and ranking minority members may have CBO study any legislation containing a federal mandate.", "When an authorizing committee orders reported a public bill or joint resolution containing a federal mandate, it must provide the measure to CBO. CBO must report to the committee an estimate of mandate costs. The office must prepare full quantitative estimates if costs are estimated to exceed $59 million (for intergovernmental mandates) or $117 million (for private sector mandates) in any of the first five fiscal years the legislation would be in effect. Below these thresholds, CBO must prepare brief statements of cost estimates. For each reported measure with costs over the thresholds, CBO is to submit to the committee an estimate of", "the direct costs of federal mandates contained in it, or in any necessary implementing regulations; and the amount of new or existing federal funding the legislation authorizes to pay these costs.", "If reported legislation authorizes appropriations to meet the estimated costs of an intergovernmental mandate, the CBO report must include a statement on the new budget authority needed, for up to 10 years, to meet these costs. For a measure that reauthorizes or amends an existing statute, the direct costs of any mandate it contains are to be measured by the projected increase over those costs required by existing law. The calculation of increased costs must include any projected decrease in existing federal aid that provides assistance to nonfederal entities.", "The committee is to include the CBO estimate in its report or publish it in the Congressional Record .

The point of order may also be raised if CBO reported that no reasonable estimate of the cost of intergovernmental mandates was feasible.

This point of order applies to both intergovernmental and private sector mandates.", "In the Senate, either point of order may be waived by majority vote. Otherwise, if the chair sustains the point of order, the measure may not be considered. In ruling on these points of order, the chair is to consult with the Committee on Governmental Affairs on whether the measure contains intergovernmental mandates. Also, the unfunded costs of the mandate are to be determined based on estimates by the Committee on the Budget (which may draw for this purpose on the CBO estimate).", "For the House, UMRA provides that if either point of order is raised, the chair does not rule on it. Instead, the House votes on whether to consider the measure despite the point of order. To prevent dilatory use of the point of order, the chair need not put the question of consideration to a vote unless the Member making the point of order meets the \"threshold burden\" of identifying specific language that is claimed to contain the unfunded mandate. Also, if several points of order could be raised against the same measure, House practices under UMRA afford means for all to be consolidated in a single vote on consideration. Finally, if the Committee on Rules proposes a special rule for considering the measure that waives the point of order, UMRA subjects the special rule itself to a point of order, which is disposed of by the same mechanism.", "These procedures are intended to insure that the House, like the Senate, will always have an opportunity to determine, by vote, whether to consider a measure that may contain an unfunded mandate.

UMRA does not require amendments or motions to be accompanied by CBO mandate cost estimates, but a Senator may request CBO to estimate the costs of mandates in an amendment he or she prepares. If an amended bill or resolution or a conference report contains a new mandate or other new increases in mandate costs, the conferees are to request a supplemental estimate, which CBO is to attempt to provide.
