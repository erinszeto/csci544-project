Funding for Foreign Operations and State Department/Broadcasting programs has been steadily rising since FY2002, after a period of decline in the 1980s and 1990s. Amounts approved for FY2004 in regular and supplemental bills reached an unprecedented level compared with the previous 40 years, largely due to Iraq reconstruction funding. Ongoing assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as large new global health programs, has kept the international affairs budget at historically high levels in recent years. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget proposal indicated that this trend would continue.", "On May 7, 2009, President Obama submitted a budget proposal for FY2010 that requests $53.9 billion for the international affairs budget, a 2% increase over the enacted FY2009 funding level, including supplementals. Within that amount, $52.2 billion is for programs and activities funded through the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The Administration requested significant increases to support additional foreign service officers at USAID and the Department of State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, food security and agricultural development, counter-terrorism and law enforcement activities, and meeting U.S. commitments to international organizations. Among programs and regions for which the Administration recommended reduced funding, compared with estimated FY2009 levels, are economic assistance to Iraq; aid to Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia; international peacekeeping; and foreign military financing. These comparisons, however, are in relation to unusually high FY2009 total funding levels in some accounts, and do not necessarily reflect shifts in policy or priorities.", "Key policy issues addressed in the Administration's request include enhancing the capacity of civilian diplomatic and development agencies, promoting U.S. leadership in multilateral development banks, and improving fiscal transparency by funding ongoing programs through the regular appropriations process rather than through supplemental appropriations. The proposal also seeks funding for at least two activities that have been rejected by Congress in the past\u2014multilateral clean investment funds managed by the World Bank and the U.N.

The request proposed to increase FY2010 hiring by 565 people under the HRI. Earlier, in FY2009, and additional 520 positions were filled under HRI.

Many studies indicated that the United States was becoming mistrusted and disliked among many around the world, which had implications on U.S. interests from its ability to achieve diplomatic and military objectives to negatively impacting U.S. trade and economic interests. Many analysts believed that traditional diplomacy needed to be enhanced with new methods of supporting U.S. relations including public diplomacy (PD), which reached beyond governments to talk with the populations and opinion leaders of other countries. Again, shortages were found in the number of PD Foreign Service Officers and public diplomacy programs.

During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs also pursued a number of other U.S. policy interests, such as promoting economic development, advancing U.S. trade, expanding access to basic education and health care, promoting human rights, and protecting the environment. In the 1990s, other objectives included stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, establishing nuclear arms control regimes, curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, expanding peace efforts in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting religious freedom, and countering trafficking in persons.", "A defining change in focus came following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. Since then, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have taken on a more strategic sense of importance and have been frequently cast in terms of contributing to the war on terrorism. In 2002, President Bush released a National Security Strategy that for the first time established global development as the third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. Development was again underscored in the Administration's re-statement of the National Security Strategy released on March 16, 2006.", "Also in 2002, foreign assistance budget justifications began to highlight the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority, emphasizing amounts of U.S. assistance to 28 \"front-line\" states\u2014countries that cooperate with the United States in the war on terrorism or face terrorist threats themselves. During the Bush years, the Administration implemented several new aid initiatives. Large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq exemplified the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism. State Department efforts focused extensively on diplomatic security and finding new and more effective ways of presenting American views and culture through public diplomacy.", "It appears that the Obama Administration will carry some Bush foreign aid initiatives forward. A transformational diplomacy initiative, announced in 2006, repositioned diplomats to global trouble spots, created regional public diplomacy centers, established small posts outside of foreign capitals, and trained diplomats in new skills. (See CRS Report RL34141, Diplomacy for the 21 st Century: Transformational Diplomacy , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed], for background information.) At the same time, a new position was created at the State Department, a Deputy Secretary of State-level Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA), which was filled during the Bush Administration by the USAID Administrator. To date, the Obama Administration has not nominated a USAID Administrator and separate individuals are acting as DFA and USAID Administrator. The DFA created a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance with the ultimate goal of promoting democracy and providing more coordination, coherence, transparency, and accountability for aid programs. The Obama Administration's first international affairs budget proposal continues to use this framework. ", "Other Bush initiatives that the Obama Administration request continues address development and global health concerns. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an aid delivery concept, proposed by President Bush in 2002, authorized by Congress (Title VI, Division D of P.L. 108-199 ) and established in early 2004. It is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of U.S. resources in a few low- and low-middle income countries that have demonstrated a strong commitment to political, economic, and social reforms. President Bush initially promised $5 billion annually by FY2006, although funds requested and appropriated have never reached this level. The Obama Administration requested $1.43 billion for MCC in FY2010, which is 64% above estimated FY2009 appropriations, but the smallest request for MCC since its first year.
