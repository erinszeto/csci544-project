Another set of provisions additionally prohibited the District from providing any assistance to implement or fund particular initiatives and referenda approved by the city's voters or legislation passed by the city council.

(This transmission may occur when the law is enacted or at a later point.) The law in question will take effect upon the expiration of a specified \"layover\" (congressional review) period following the date the law was transmitted to Congress unless it is first overturned by a joint resolution of disapproval. The act establishes special \"fast track\" procedures that the House and Senate might use to consider such a disapproval resolution. ", "The length of the congressional layover period for District of Columbia laws differs based on the type of law the District has enacted. Any law codified in Title 22 (Criminal Offenses and Penalties), 23 (Criminal Procedure), or 24 (Prisoners and Their Treatment) of the District of Columbia Code must lie over for 60 days before going into force. All other District laws become effective upon the expiration of a layover/congressional review period of 30 calendar days or upon the date prescribed by the act itself, whichever is later. In calculating this 30-calendar-day layover period, Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and days on which neither the House nor the Senate is in session because of an adjournment sine die or pursuant to an adjournment resolution are excluded.

There is no limit on the number of resolutions that may be introduced. All joint resolutions, when introduced, are referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the House and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the Senate. ", "Once a joint disapproval resolution is referred, a committee may choose to mark it up but may not report amendments to it. For those joint resolutions aimed at District of Columbia laws codified in the District of Columbia criminal code, a discharge mechanism is potentially available. For such acts, if a committee to which a disapproval resolution has been referred has not reported it within 20 calendar days after its introduction, a privileged motion to discharge the committee from the further consideration of it or any joint resolution aimed at the same District of Columbia law is in order. The motion to discharge is debatable for one hour, equally divided, and can be made only by an individual favoring the legislation. The motion is no longer available after the committee has reported a disapproval resolution with respect to the same District law. For enactments not affecting the District of Columbia criminal code, the committees would presumably have to report a joint resolution for it to reach the calendar. ", "In both the House and Senate, once a committee has reported or (within the limits described above) been discharged from further consideration of a joint resolution, a non-debatable motion to proceed to consider the measure is in order and may be made by any Member. This motion to proceed may be made even if a previous motion to the same effect has been defeated. The motion to proceed may not be amended, nor may a vote on it be reconsidered. A motion to postpone the motion to proceed is in order but is not debatable. Should the House or Senate agree to consider by simple majority vote, the joint resolution would be pending before the respective chamber and debatable for up to 10 hours, equally divided. A non-debatable motion to limit debate below 10 hours is in order. The joint disapproval resolution may not be amended or recommitted, and a vote thereon may not be reconsidered. All appeals from decisions of the chair made during consideration of the joint resolution are to be decided without debate. Passage of a joint resolution is by simple majority vote. It appears that passage and presentment of a joint resolution of disapproval to the President must occur before the expiration of the layover period in order to invalidate that District law.", "Perhaps because the Home Rule Act mechanism was originally structured as a one- or two-house legislative veto, it does not include separate parliamentary procedures governing consideration of a joint resolution of approval or disapproval after its initial passage in its chamber of origin.

In the Senate, vetoed measures are privileged for consideration (as they are in the House) but are fully debatable and thus potentially subject to a filibuster and the cloture process. ", "It is worth noting that the Home Rule Act disapproval procedure has been used infrequently, and should the House or Senate choose to consider a disapproval resolution under its terms, the chambers will likely have to interpret for themselves how some of its facets operate in current parliamentary practice, a decision each will no doubt make in close consultation with that chamber's Parliamentarian. ", "It bears further mention that the Home Rule Act disapproval procedure is one expedited parliamentary method that Congress might use to invalidate a proposed District law. It is not, however, the only way Congress might undertake such disapproval.

District leaders often have complained that frequent delays in the appropriations process that lead to the approval of the District's annual budget well after the start of the District's fiscal year have become routine. These delays hinder the ability of District officials to manage the city's financial affairs and negatively affect the delivery of public services. During the past 18 years, as documented in Table 2 , FY1997 was the only year for which the District of Columbia appropriations act was enacted before the start of the fiscal year on October 1. To mitigate the impact of congressional delays in the approval of the District's appropriation before the beginning of a fiscal year, Congress has routinely included language in continuing budget resolutions allowing the District to expend local funds on programs and activities included in its General Fund budget.

", "The mayor's FY2016 budget request, which was modified and approved by the Council on May 27, 2015, includes provisions that would provide the District with some level of autonomy over locally raised revenues. Specifically, the budget request would", "allow the District to decouple its fiscal year from the federal fiscal year, permitting the District to establish when its local fiscal year would start; permit District officials to obligate and expend local funds upon enactment by the District of its local annual budget; and grant the District the authority to spend local funds if Congress does not enact a federal appropriation authorizing the expenditure of local funds before the start of the District's fiscal year.", "In addition, the District Delegate to Congress has introduced legislation, H.R. 552 , a bill that would grant the District budget autonomy over locally raised revenues by eliminating the requirement for congressional approval of the District's General Fund budget. This bill is one in a line of budget autonomy bills that have been introduced in successive Congresses starting in 1981 when then District of Columbia Delegate to Congress Walter Fauntroy introduced a budget autonomy measure.

On December 19, 2012, the District of Columbia Council passed the Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012, B19-993. The mayor signed the measure as A19-0632, on January 18, 2013. Subject to voter approval through the referendum process, the bill purportedly amended the District's home rule charter by eliminating the requirement for congressional approval of the District of Columbia budget as part of the federal appropriations process. Instead, the charter amendment would subject the District local budget (General Fund Budget) to a 30-day congressional review/layover period like all other laws passed by the District. Despite objections raised by the District's Attorney General in a letter, dated January 4, 2013, the District of Board of Elections placed the proposed charter amendment on an April 23, 2013, ballot. District of Columbia voters approved the local budget autonomy charter amendment with 83% of the vote in support of the amendment. ", "Although supportive of budget autonomy, the mayor informed the Council, in an April 11, 2014, letter, of his intent not to enforce the law based on the opinion of the District's Attorney General that the charter amendment was unlawful. According to the mayor, the opinion of the District's Attorney General is legally \"binding on Executive branch of the District government absent a controlling court opinion to the contrary.\" The essential legal objection to the proposed charter amendment is captured in this excerpt from the Attorney General's letter to the District's Board of Elections urging the Board of Elections not to place the referendum of the ballot:", "\u2026, the OAG has serious reservations about the legality of the amendment, whether it would be sustained if challenged in court and most pertinently, whether the Board has the authority to place this amendment on a ballot referendum in light of the clear prohibition under Section 303(d) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (\"Home Rule Act\"), approved December 24, 1973, 87 Stat. 790, P.L. 93-198 , D.C.

The statute is phrased in clear mandatory terms: a proposed amendment is precluded by law from going on the ballot through the Charter-amending procedure of Section 303 if the proposed amendment would \"enact any law or affect any law with respect to which the Council may not enact ... under the limitation specified in \"Sections 206.01-03. For reasons we detail below it is precisely these limitations, reserving to Congress, among other things, the authority to change the laws governing the role played by Congress and the President in the District's budget that in the considered judgment of this office, preclude using the charter amendment procedures, including the placement on a ballot for the electorate for the proposed amendment. Likewise, it is our view that under those express limitations, Congress or a court reviewing the merits of the legal issue would find the amendment to be outside the scope of the Charter amending process in Section 303 and also contrary to other federal laws, those found in Title 31 of the U.S. Code.", "These objections were reiterated and expanded upon in an April 8, 2014 legal analysis by the Office of Attorney General. The GAO analysis articulated the following objections to the proposed charter amendment: ", "The Act is null and void because the Council exceeded its authority in enacting it and because it violates federal law .", "The act violates the limitations of Section 602(a)(3) because it changes the functions of the United States and because it is not restricted in its application exclusively or to the District. ", "The Act violates the limitations of Section 603(a) because it changes the longstanding roles and procedures of Congress, the President, and other federal entities in the formation of the District's total budget.

", "On April 17, 2014, the District of Columbia Council filed a suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to compel the mayor to execute the charter amendment changes. On May 19, 2014, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an opinion concluding that the Local Budget Autonomy Act was unlawful and that District officials were permanently enjoined from enforcing it. The Council appealed the decision and on October 18, 2014, presented its case before a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Before the panel issued a ruling, a new mayor was elected, Muriel Bowser, who reversed Mayor Gray's decision not to enforce the Budget Autonomy Act. On March 23, 2015, a Suggestion of Mootness and Motion to Dismiss was filed with United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on behalf of the newly elected mayor. The motion claimed that since there was no dispute or disagreement between the Council and the newly elected mayor, the judgment rendered by the District Court for the District of Columbia in April 2014 should be vacated, the appeal dismissed, and the case remanded to the D.C. Superior Court. On May 27, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted the motion for dismissal of the case and sent it back to the District of Columbia Superior Court.

In a joint statement on the budget autonomy decision, issued on May 27, 2015, the CFO and AG articulated the following position: ", "The D.C. Circuit's decision in the Budget Autonomy Act case did not validate the legislation. In fact, the appellate court did not address the legality of the Budget Autonomy Act.
