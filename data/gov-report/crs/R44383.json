However, interest payments made on publicly held debt represent new federal spending, and are recorded in the budget as outlays when payments are made. The government incurs interest costs when it opts to finance spending through borrowing rather than through increased revenues. Net interest payments represent the amount paid from the government to debt holders in a given time period , less interest payments received for federal loan programs .", "For investors, purchasing a debt issuance represents both a loss of liquidity relative to currency holdings (money paid for the debt holding can be used immediately, while the debt issuance may only be resold on the secondary market or held until the date of maturity) and an opportunity cost (the money used for the purchase could have been spent on other items, invested elsewhere, or saved). Debt holders are compensated for those costs by receiving interest payments from Treasury on their issuances. ", "From FY1969 to FY2018 net interest payments averaged 2.0% of annual GDP, equivalent to about $407 billion annually in 2018 dollars. High interest rates and increasing debt levels caused the net interest burden to peak in the 1980s and 1990s. Recent net interest payments have been lower than their long-term averages; in FY2018, net interest payments were $325 billion, or 1.6% of GDP. FY2018 payments were the product of real low interest rates and relatively high levels of real debt. Unless the federal debt is reduced, net interest payments will likely increase if interest rates shift toward their long-term averages. In its most recent forecast, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that real net interest payments will increase to 3.0% of GDP by FY2029.", "One way to measure the effect of debt on future deficits is to examine the relationship between total federal deficits and the primary deficit , which measures the balance of revenues and expenditures with net interest payments excluded. Figure 2 shows total and primary budget outcomes from FY1969 through FY2018. The gap between the total and primary outcomes in a given year is explained by net interest payments. The primary deficit averaged 0.9% of GDP from FY1969 to FY2018, as compared to the average total budget deficit of 2.9% of GDP recorded over the same time period.

", "Increased government borrowing that reduces net exports (generated by borrowing from foreign sources) represents an expansion of the short-term money supply, as money is being brought into the economy now at the expense of the future stock of money (as foreign borrowing is repaid). Such a fiscal expansion increases the quantity of money demanded, which drives up interest rates (or cost of borrowing). ", "The federal government may choose to generate short-run budget deficits for a few reasons. Deficit financing, or payment for federal government activity at least partly through debt increases, increases the total level of spending in the economy. Most economists believe that the implementation of deficit financing can be used to generate a short-term stimulus effect, either for a particular industry or for the entire economy. In this view, increases in expenditures and tax reductions can be used to generate employment opportunities and consumer spending and reduce the intensity of stagnant economic periods. ", "Deficit financing is a less effective countercyclical strategy when it leads to \"crowding out,\" or when government financing merely replaces private-sector funding instead of inducing new economic activity, and is more likely to occur in periods of robust economic growth. Deficit reduction when the economy is operating near or at full potential can help prevent the economy from overheating and avoid \"crowding out\" of private investment, which could have positive implications for intergenerational equity and long-term growth.", "Deficit financing may also be used as part of a structurally balanced budget strategy, which alters government tax and spending levels to smooth the effect of business cycles. Smoothing budgetary changes may reduce the economic shocks deficits induce among businesses and households. Governments may also use federal deficits or surpluses to spread the payment burden of long-term projects across generations.

As shown in equation (3), economic growth, or the change ( \u0394 ) in output ( Y ), is a function ( f ) of the stock of labor ( L , or the number of people working and hours that they work), the stock of capital ( K , which includes equipment, machines, and all other nonlabor factors), and the knowledge and technological capability (A) that determines the productivity of labor and capital.", "(3) \u0394Y= f(\u0394L, \u0394K, \u0394A)", "Assuming that the stock of labor is insensitive to fiscal policy choices, the effect of federal debt on economic growth depends on how the additional government activity affects the capital stock and productivity of labor and capital relative to what would have happened had amounts borrowed been invested privately or increased net exports.

Alternatively, if such activity contributes less to those factors than the replaced private investment and net exports, it will reduce long-term economic potential.", "Changes in federal debt levels shift economic resources across time periods, a process sometimes described as an intertemporal transfer . Federal debt issuances represent an increase in the current level of federal resources and a decrease in future federal resources. Net interest payments, or the total interest payments made by the federal government (to creditors) on borrowed money less interest payments received (from individuals and institutions borrowing from the federal government or debtors), may be thought of as the total expense associated with past federal borrowing. Those resources cannot be allocated to other government services. ", "Total borrowing is constrained by the money available for investment (savings in dollars) at a given point in time. This limit means that the amount of federal debt relative to output cannot increase indefinitely. The trajectory of federal debt is therefore thought to be unsustainable if debt taken as a share of output (measured in this report with gross domestic product, or GDP) rises continuously in long-term projections. This happens when growth in the stock of debt outpaces total economic growth, which can cause a variety of adverse outcomes, including reduced output, increased unemployment, higher inflation, higher private interest rates, and currency devaluation.

A loss in market confidence in Greek debt led to a severe recession, with GDP contracting by 9 percentage points in 2011 and long-term interest rates reaching 22% in 2012. Japanese borrowing was viewed to be more sustainable despite being higher, with relatively flat GDP levels and long-term interest rates close to zero in recent years.

More robust economic periods generally produce lower net deficits (or higher net surpluses), due to increases in receipts (from greater tax revenues) and reduced expenditures (from decreased demand for public assistance). The opposite effect occurs during recessions: as incomes and employment fall, the existing structure of the federal tax system automatically collects less revenue, and spending on mandatory income security programs, such as unemployment insurance, automatically rises. CBO estimates that the share of the deficit attributable to automatic stabilizers fell from 1.9% of GDP in FY2010 to 0.0% of GDP in FY2018. In other words, the budget deficit recorded in FY2018 (3.8% of GDP) is nearly identical to the \"structural deficit\" that economists would expect with automatic stabilizer effects removed from the budget.", " Figure 3 shows the real economic growth (as a percentage on the horizontal axis) and the federal budget outcome (as a percentage of GDP, on the vertical axis) in each fiscal year from FY1969 through FY2018.

Maintaining this debt-to-GDP ratio beyond FY2047 would require additional deficit reduction.

For example, in order to bring debt as a percentage of GDP in FY2048 down to its historical average over the past 50 years (40% of GDP), spending reductions or revenue increases or some combination of the two would need to generate net savings of roughly 3.0% of GDP (or $630 billion in FY2018 alone) in each year."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
