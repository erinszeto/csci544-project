Administration officials argued that U.S. participation with ground forces wasnecessary for two main reasons: 1) the Bosnian, Croatian, and Serb negotiators all made U.S. groundforce participation a condition of their accepting any peace settlement; and 2) U.S. participation wasnecessary for the United States to maintain a leadership position in NATO.

That forcedesignation lasted until December 20, 1996, when it was changed to Stabilization Force (SFOR). This reflected the decision by NATO's members that the Bosnia deployment should not have aspecified end-date, but rather that its duration would be tied to successful accomplishment of DaytonPeace Accord provisions. Though the SFOR operations have U.N. Security Council authorization,there is no \"dual-key\" command relationship with the United Nations.", "SFOR's mission, as defined by NATO HQ, is \"to provide a continued military presence in order to deter renewed hostilities, stabilize and consolidate the peace, and thus contribute to a secureenvironment and provide and maintain broad support for civil implementation plans.\" Toaccomplish this mission, NATO has identified key military and supporting tasks, as follows. Keymilitary tasks are:", "Maintain a deterrent military presence.", "Prevent major hostilities or removal of weapons fromcantonment.", "Operate the Joint Military Committees.

The International War Crimes Tribunalrequested and received protection for its investigators and for suspected war crimes sites. SFOR alsoagreed to detain suspected war criminals, if encountered, but until late 1997 declined to participatein pursuit operations. This refusal to take more effective action to apprehend suspected warcriminals led to continued criticism from the War Crimes Tribunal and human rights advocates. Those who favored greater action stressed the importance of supporting the International War CrimesTribunal and the destabilizing influence of Karadzic and other Serb and Croat extremists. Since1997, SFOR has played a more active role in detaining indicted suspects. Additional detentions andvoluntary surrenders, perhaps encouraged by NATO's greater involvement, have resulted in over halfof those indicted for war crimes currently being in custody. Former Bosnian Serb leaders Karadzicand Mladic, however, remain at large. ", "Duration of NATO Bosnia Operations. In late 1996, the lack of progress in civilian reconstruction and continued friction among the ethnic factions,including within the Muslim-Croat Federation, led to the widespread belief that some NATOmilitary force would be required beyond IFOR's December 20, 1996 mandate. These concerns ledNATO's political leaders to authorize the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in December, 1996, to lastuntil June 1998. By the end of 1997, there was little optimism that Bosnia would have a viablenational state or economy by that time. (1) Fragilegovernment institutions and continued ethnicantagonisms lead most observers to believe that an international military force of substantial size willbe necessary in Bosnia for perhaps years, if further internecine warfare is to be averted. Some, suchthe former High Representative Carl Bildt, have suggested the permanent stationing of NATO troopsin Bosnia because they believe the region's conflict to be the single greatest threat to contemporaryEuropean security, and hence should be a long-term NATO concern. While not accepting thisposition, in March 1998, NATO foreign ministers re-authorized SFOR, and tied the duration of itsdeployment to the achievement of specified benchmarks of success in implementing the DaytonAccords.", "NATO leaders hope that tying withdrawal to demonstrable political and administrative progress will encourage more widespread cooperation in implementing the Accords. Those who endorse anextended SFOR believe that a return to ethnic warfare in Bosnia holds greater dangers for U.S.security interests than the prospect of continued U.S. deployments in the region. They also point outthat Bosnia is the type of mission for which NATO is supposedly shaping its forces after the collapseof the Warsaw Pact, and the inability or unwillingness to bring a lasting peace to Bosnia would bringNATO's credibility into question.", "Some of those opposing extended operations in Bosnia question whether the Dayton Accords are, in fact, a workable basis for Bosnia's future, and suggest they are rather a settlementinternationally imposed with inadequate indigenous support. There has been a concern in Congressabout the United States being drawn into a military commitment without a foreseeable end.Reflecting this, the FY1999 DOD Authorization Act ( P.L. 105-261 ) contained several \"sense of theCongress\" provisions, and established extensive reporting requirements for both the President andthe Secretary of Defense regarding Bosnia operations. Among these provisions are:", "1)U.S. ground forces should not remain in Bosnia indefinitely, and that the President should work with SFOR nations to allow the U.S. to withdraw its ground forces; 2) aNATO-led force, without U.S. ground troops, might be suitable for continued operations, and theUnited States might supply intelligence and logistical support, and a \"ready reserve force in theregion\".

Each nation contributing to IFOR/SFOR bears the cost of its own deployment and operations. Prior to IFOR/SFOR, DOD carried out airsupport and maritime intercept operations in conjunction with U.N. peace-keeping efforts and theU.N. arms embargo. FY1996 saw the introduction of U.S. ground forces into Bosnia, and theconsequent increase in incremental costs reflected in Table 1. The term \"incremental costs\" refersto those costs over and above those of normal day-to-day DOD peacetime operations.", "These costs have been covered through a combination of DOD annual budget appropriations, supplemental appropriations, transfers between budget accounts, and re-programmings within DODOperations & Maintenance and Military Personnel accounts. To remain within the limits of thebalanced budget agreement, the supplemental appropriations have been sometimes offset byreductions in other elements of the DOD budget. The Administration requested that theFY1998/FY1999 funding for Bosnia be \"emergency\" appropriations, which under the balancedbudget agreement raised the cap on both defense spending and total discretionary spending. TheAdministration justified this on the grounds that Bosnia costs were not included in the calculationsfor the balanced budget agreement. For the previous three years, however, Congress had directedthat the costs of military operations in Bosnia be provided within the annual caps for defensespending. Departing from this position, the FY1999 DOD Authorization Act granted the emergencyappropriations status. It capped spending of FY1999 funds for Bosnia operations at $1,858,600,000,thus prohibiting DOD from exceeding Administration-projected expenditures without congressionalaction. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-277 ) provided the Administration's fullsupplemental request for Bosnia operations as an emergency appropriation.

Press reports indicated that NATO politicalleaders were cautioned of an air campaign's potential shortfalls, but believed that their domesticpublic opinion would not support a ground invasion of Kosovo. It was then perceived as a choicebetween \"do nothing\" or proceed with air strikes. Some also suggested that in the wake of the 1991Persian Gulf War, some advocates have overemphasized the capabilities of air power, encouragingthe belief that ground forces are no longer as crucial to achieving military objectives.", "There was also criticism that \"command by committee\" hampered NATO military leaders' ability to wage an effective, rapidly responsive campaign. Target lists, weapons used, and forcesdeployed were all subject to prior approval by all NATO governments. This slowed decision-making, constrainedoperations, and sometimes emphasized political over military considerations. However, NATO officials maintain that SACEUR received all resources requested, and emphasizedthat this consensual process was critical to ensuring the cohesion of the alliance. A morefundamental criticism is that the air campaign's actual objective from the start was political, notmilitary -- i.e., to bring President Milosevic back to the bargaining table. This, in turn, contributedto a constrained, incremental approach to targeting. ", "After the air operation, U.S. Secretary of Defense Cohen, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe Gen.

However, within an alliance of democracies which maintains full consensus as a fundamentalprinciple, this approach has not achieved acceptance. In addressing this issue, Gen.

Upon receiving writtennotice from President Clinton stating that if military readiness were to be harmed by on-goingoperational requirements, he would submit a FY2000 budget amendment request, the House agreed(270-155) to remove the funding prohibition. A $2 billion supplemental appropriation for Kosovowas subsequently included in the FY2001 Military Construction Act ( P.L. 106-246 ). From FY2002-FY2004,Congress has appropriated approximately $2.8 billion for Kosovo operations.", "Beginning with the FY2002 budget, both the Bosnia and Kosovo operations are no longer funded through the Overseas Contingency Fund, but rather through the individual service budgets. Consequently, published DOD budget documents do not provide a separate accounting for theseoperations.

With that withdrawal, a close monitoring of the EU's mission performanceand Bosnia's political stability would appear to be the primary remaining concerns.", "While NATO troops may withdraw from Bosnia, there appears to be no time line for a withdrawal from Kosovo. A continued NATO military presence in Kosovo will probably remainuntil the province's political future is determined, and perhaps for a period thereafter. Whether theNATO contingent need continue to include U.S. troops is, however, open to question. Thepossibility remains that the European Union could eventually assume peace-keeping responsibilitiesin Kosovo also; however, that is unlikely to occur until its performance in Bosnia is evaluated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Legislation", "paragraphs": ["P.L. 108-384", "To authorize appropriations for FY2004 for military activities of the Department of Defense,and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for fiscal year 2004, and forother purposes.
