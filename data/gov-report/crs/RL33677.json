Under present conditions, any meeting of Congress after election day in November, but before the following January 3, is a lame duck session. Prior to 1933, when the Twentieth Amendment changed the dates of the congressional term, the last regular session of Congress was always a lame duck session. Today, however, the expression is used not only for a separate session of Congress that convenes after a sine die adjournment, but also for any portion of a regular session that falls after an election.", "A lame duck session can occur in several ways. (1) Congress has usually provided for its existing session to resume after a recess spanning the election. (In 1954, only the Senate returned in this way, while the House adjourned sine die.) (2) In 1940, 1942, and also most recently in 2008, 2010, and 2012, at least one house continued meeting in intermittent, or pro forma, sessions during the period spanning the election (in these most recent years, the Senate used this means to forestall recess appointments). (3) Congress can reconvene after an election pursuant to contingent authority granted to the leadership in a recess or adjournment resolution (the House followed this course in 1998 and 2008). Two other possibilities have not been realized: (4) Congress could set a statutory date for a new session to convene after the election, then adjourn its existing session sine die. (5) While Congress is in recess or sine die adjournment, the President could call it into extraordinary session at a date after the election.", "Congress has held 19 lame duck sessions from 1940 through 2012. In these years, election breaks usually have begun by mid-October, and typically lasted between one and two months. Congress has typically reconvened in mid-November and adjourned before Christmas, so that the lame duck session lasted about a month. Yet election breaks have begun as early as August 7 or as late as November 3, and ended as early as November 7 or as late as December 31. Lame duck sessions have ended as early as November 22 and as late as January 3, and have extended over as few as one, and as many as 145, calendar days. Usually, however, each house has actually met on 8-24 days during these lame duck sessions (including pro forma sessions). Although between 1994 and 2006, each house met in session for fewer than 12 days, the three most recent lame duck sessions were considerably longer, lasting an average of 17 days in the House and 27 days in the Senate.", "Some lame duck sessions were held largely for pro forma reasons (e.g., 1948), on a standby basis (1940, 1942), or to deal with a single specific matter (1954, 1994, 1998, 2008). Some deferred major matters to the next Congress (e.g., 1944, 1982, 2004), especially when the same party would have an increased majority. The President has sometimes presented an extensive agenda to a lame duck session, often with success when it was controlled by his own party (e.g., 1950, 2002, 2004), but less so under conditions of divided government, when he has often vetoed measures (e.g., 1970, 1974, 1982). In recent years, as well, most lame duck sessions have had to complete action on appropriations and the budget. In 1974, 1980, 1982, 2000, and 2004, this effort was at least partially successful, but in 1970, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2012, a final resolution was largely left to the next Congress.

As a result, any meeting of Congress that occurs between the congressional election in November of an even-numbered year and the following January 3 is a lame duck session.

By the 1830s, the usage had been extended to officeholders whose service already had a known termination date. In current American usage, for instance, a President is considered a \"lame duck\" not only after his successor has been elected, but also whenever he cannot be, or is known not to be, a candidate for reelection.", "Members of Congress in similar circumstances are also considered \"lame ducks.\" The expression may accordingly be applied to Members who are known not to be seeking re-election as well as to those who have been defeated. In particular, however, after an election of Congress, all the Members who did not gain reelection can be described as lame ducks until the term of the new Congress starts.

Congress convenes in a regular session on January 3 of each year, unless in the previous session it passes a law changing the date. Under these arrangements, any meeting of Congress after election day (in November of even-numbered years), but before the following January 3, is a lame duck session.", "From 1935 through 2012, there were 19 lame duck sessions.

In the process of initiating the government under the Constitution, it was established that the term of Congress would begin and end of March 4 of odd-numbered years. As today, however, congressional elections were generally held in November of even-numbered years.", "The result was that after being elected in (an even-numbered) November, a new Congress did not begin its term until the following (odd-numbered) March, and normally did not even convene its first session until the following December, 13 months after it was first elected. This session of Congress typically continued until sometime in the summer of the following (even-numbered) year. Congress would then adjourn until the time for the next regular session prescribed by the Constitution, the following (even-numbered) December.", "When this session convened, however, the next Congress would already have been elected, in the intervening (even-numbered) November. Yet the term of this newly elected Congress would not begin until the following March. The Congress that convened in an even-numbered December, accordingly, could not be the newly elected one, but could only be the one already sitting. Under these arrangements, as a result, the last session of every Congress was always a lame duck session. One purpose of the Twentieth Amendment was to change these arrangements that routinely required every Congress to hold its last session as a lame duck session.", "Sometimes a Congress would convene its first session earlier, even as early as the March commencement of its constitutional term, especially when a new President was concurrently entering office. As described in following sections, this extra session could occur pursuant either to a presidential call or a law passed by the previous Congress. This extra session would normally adjourn some time before the following (odd-numbered) December, and in that case Congress would normally reconvene, in a new session, pursuant to the constitutional mandate, when December arrived. Under these conditions the extra session became the first session of a Congress, and the first regular (December) session became its second session. The final session of the Congress, beginning in the following December, then became the third session.

Formally, a session of Congress ends when Congress adjourns sine die . The Latin phrase, literally translated as \"without day,\" is used to mean that Congress has adjourned without setting a day for its next meeting. An adjournment sine die, therefore, means that Congress is not scheduled to meet again until the day set by the Constitution (or by law) for its next session to convene. When Congress adjourns sine die in an election year, it is not scheduled to meet again before the term of the new Congress begins. The next meeting, instead, will be that of the new Congress, convening pursuant to the Constitution (or to a law altering the constitutional date, if the previous Congress passed one). This meeting will therefore begin the first session of the new Congress.", "The Constitution authorizes Congress to set its own adjournment date without the involvement of the President, unless the two houses cannot agree. Congress therefore authorizes a sine die adjournment by concurrent resolution. Inasmuch as this form of measure requires adoption by both houses, but no action by the President, it permits Congress to act without involving the executive branch in the prerogatives of the legislative. ", "Previous to 1935, Congress would normally adjourn its previous session sine die sometime in advance of the November elections. When it returned for its prescribed meeting in December, accordingly, a new session began. Under these conditions, the \"lame duck session\" of each Congress was actually a session in its own right, numerically distinct from the previous session (or sessions) of the same Congress. Accordingly, each of the lame duck sessions that occurred routinely before 1935 was convened as a separate session of the Congress already sitting.", "Congress today could achieve an equivalent result by adjourning its session sine die before an election, after first providing by law that an additional session of the old Congress convene on a date after the election. This additional, post-election session (probably the third session of the old Congress) would be a lame duck session in the same sense as those that occurred routinely before 1935. It would be a new, separately numbered session of the old Congress.

This form of authorization is appropriate for the purpose because the Constitution provides that \"Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days.... \" Inasmuch as the concurrent resolution requires action by both houses, it permits each to consent to the adjournment of the other.", "Unlike a sine die adjournment, however, a recess of the session does not terminate the existing session of Congress; it is, instead, technically an adjournment within a session. When Congress reconvenes at the conclusion of a session recess, no new session begins; instead, the previously existing session resumes. Under these conditions, the post-election meeting of Congress is not a separate, new session of the old Congress, but a continuation of its existing session (probably its second session). Nevertheless, the phrase \"lame duck session\" has persisted as a way of referring to any post-election meeting of the old Congress, even though it now normally does not designate a separate session of Congress, but rather refers simply to the post-election portion of an ongoing existing session."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contingent Authority to Reconvene", "paragraphs": ["The two sequences of events just discussed (a recess of an existing session and an adjournment sine die after providing for a new session) are not the only ones that can lead to a lame duck session.

It might do so either before or after the election itself, but in either case, any portion of the reconvened session that occurred after the election would be considered a lame duck session. During the time since the Twentieth Amendment took effect, however, this course of action has not been taken.", "If Congress adjourns sine die with contingent reconvening authority, on the other hand, the sine die character of the adjournment becomes final only if the leadership does not exercise this authority by the time the next session of Congress is slated to convene, pursuant to either the Constitution or law. If the authority is exercised, the existing session of the old Congress resumes, and the previous adjournment turns out not to have been sine die .

In the absence of a formal recess, each house must convene at least intermittently in order to satisfy the constitutional requirement that neither house adjourn for more than three consecutive days without the consent of the other. Inasmuch as it is known that little business will occur during these intermittent sessions, however, this arrangement permits most Members to remain in their constituencies during the campaign period preceding the election.", "Sessions held under these conditions are often called pro forma sessions, meaning that they are held only \"for the sake of formality.\" In this case, the formality being satisfied is the constitutional prohibition on adjourning for more than three days without consent. The question is sometimes raised whether pro forma sessions during which no business occurs count as meeting this constitutional requirement. The answer is that they do; the Constitution sets no conditions about the occurrence of business, but only about the occurrence of the session itself. Indeed, the reason for holding pro forma sessions at all is precisely that they do satisfy the formal requirement.", "As Table 1 and the accompanying discussion show, there have been six occasions since 1935 on which at least one house of Congress has implemented a break spanning the election by meeting in pro forma sessions rather than taking a recess. On four other occasions, at least one house recessed for a period spanning the election, but also used pro forma sessions to extend the effective length of the election break."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sessions Called by the President", "paragraphs": ["A final means by which a lame duck session could occur arises from the constitutional authorization for the President to convene Congress, \"on extraordinary occasions,\" by calling a special session.

This course of events has not occurred since 1935. On the other hand, if the President calls Congress back during a recess of an existing session, the existing session resumes. This course of events occurred in both 1947 and 1948, when President Harry Truman called Congress back for an extraordinary session in the middle of a recess, in the latter case a recess for the national political conventions.", "These extraordinary sessions called by President Truman did not constitute lame duck sessions, because they both convened and recessed before the election for the following Congress. By the same means, however, a President might call an extraordinary session to convene at a date after the election and before the term of the sitting Congress ends. He could do so whether Congress had only recessed its previous session or had adjourned it sine die . In either case, the post-election meeting of Congress would be considered a lame duck session. No lame duck session since 1935 has occurred through this means.", "In the past few years, as noted in the following sections, Congress has sometimes provided for breaks in its session by using pro forma sessions rather than recesses. It appears to be an unsettled question whether the President could use his power to call extraordinary sessions to call Congress back during a period when it was recessing only for three or fewer days at a time between pro forma sessions.

In these discussions, all averages for a chamber exclude from consideration the year in which the respective chamber did not return after the election (1954 for the House; 1998 for the Senate)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defining \"Pro Forma\" Sessions", "paragraphs": ["In years when Congress either (1) takes an election recess or (2) reconvenes subject to call after a conditional sine die adjournment, the dates on which each house begins its recess or adjournment, and the dates on which each reconvenes, are explicitly specified. Under these conditions, consequently, the beginning, end, and length of both the election recess (or conditional adjournment) and the lame duck session can be readily and unambiguously determined. When either house implements a break spanning the election by holding pro forma sessions, on the other hand, it is not always clear which sessions should be counted as occurring pro forma rather than as part of the regular session, especially because business is sometimes transacted in the course of the intermittent sessions that span the period of the election. The same ambiguity arises even more acutely when either house extends the effective length of an election break by holding one or more pro forma sessions, either leading up to a recess or adjournment or at the end of it.", "To make meaningful comparisons among election breaks implemented in whole or part through pro forma sessions and those implemented solely through a recess or adjournment, some appropriate way must be found of distinguishing between sessions held for the purpose of conducting business and those held with the intent of providing an equivalent of a recess. Absent such a distinction, for example, the longest possible election break in a year with pro forma sessions would be given as three days, even if the pro forma sessions were evidently being held in order to permit Members to return to their constituencies for the same length of time as a recess would have allowed. Under these conditions, also, the time between the start of the lame duck session and the sine die adjournment would appear comparably longer than in years with the same adjournment date, but in which a recess was taken.", "Resolving these difficulties of comparison requires adopting some means for identifying pro forma sessions that permits specifying the beginning and end of election-spanning break (and therefore also the beginning of the lame duck session) in a way best comparable with the figures given for recesses and conditional sine die adjournments. For this purpose, the most straightforward approach seems to be to count any session of a chamber as pro forma if there is no session of that chamber on either the preceding or following day. Conversely, under this criterion, all daily sessions are counted as part of the regular schedule of a chamber if another session of the same chamber occurs on the day either immediately preceding or following it. It proved necessary to modify this criterion only when the day of a sine die adjournment is consecutive with no other sessions, in which case it is counted as a day of regular session.", "This approach provides a simple way of bringing a common perspective to the wide variety of schedules Congress has followed. It may be supported by the presumption that even if substantial business occurs during a daily session, under normal circumstances it may be difficult to ascertain why it should be isolated by at least a day from every other daily session, unless its purpose is at least in part to meet constitutional restrictions on recesses.

If Congress only recesses for the election, on the other hand, a lame duck session is certain to take place even if the recess resolution provides no authority to reconvene. In 5 of the 13 years in which election recesses occurred (1950, 1954, 1970, 1980, and 1982), Congress authorized the recess without providing authority for the leadership to reconvene before the recess was to end. In the remaining eight recess years (1944, 1948, 1974, 1994, 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2010), the recess resolution provided this authority, but it was not exercised.", "Since 1935, recesses of both chambers spanning the election have preceded lame duck sessions in 11 instances (1944, 1948, 1950, 1970, 1974, 1980, 1982, 1994, 2000, 2004, and 2006). In one additional instance (2010), although both the House and Senate participated in a lame duck session, only the House opted to recess before the election, while the Senate engaged in pro forma sessions until the post election session began. Another election-spanning recess, as well, involved a lame duck session of only one chamber.

In addition, the House alone engaged in pro forma sessions during the election break preceding the lame duck session on one occasion shortly after World War II (1950).

This degree of consistency in the length of election breaks indicates that normally, when Congress left later for the break, it also tended to return later after the election, and conversely, when it left earlier it typically returned earlier.", "In most years, in addition, the two chambers followed generally similar schedules. Only in the three years in which both houses spanned the election with pro forma sessions did the length of the break differ between the two houses by more than four days, and the differences occurred largely because of the points at which consecutive sessions occurred in the two chambers. In 1940 the break for the House was 16 days longer, in 1942 the Senate break was 6 days longer, and in 2000 the Senate break was 23 days longer.", "For similar reasons, the years in which only pro forma sessions spanned the election are also those in which most of the shortest breaks occurred. For these years, the mean interval between periods of consecutive sessions was 30 days in the House and 33 days in the Senate. For years with recesses or conditional sine die adjournments, by contrast, the mean was 49 days in the House and 59 in the Senate. Specifically, the interval between periods of consecutive sessions in 1940 (76 th Congress) was 22 days in the Senate (but 38 in the House); in 1942 (77 th Congress), it was 12 days in the House and 18 in the Senate; and in 2002 (107 th Congress), it was 20 days in both chambers. In 2008, only the Senate made use of pro forma sessions to span its break of 42 days, while the House reconvened 46 days after a contingent sine die adjournment. The only other notably short break occurred in 2000 (106 th Congress), in this case apparently because Congress did not recess for the election until early November, so that the House could return after 9 days, although the Senate did not come back until after 32 days, in early December.", "For the House, the median length of the election break has been 44 days; for the Senate, it has been 42 days. The mean length is greater for both chambers (House: 47 days; Senate: 48 days), because it is affected by the unusually long recess of 145 days between August 7 and the sine die adjournment on December 31 in 1948 (80 th Congress). Excluding this instance, nearly twice as long as any other, the mean length of election breaks is 41 days for the House and 42 for the Senate. The only two other election breaks longer than 60 days also occurred in earlier years.

In 1940 (76 th Congress), the Senate remained in session for 58 days, but the House adjourned sine die after 46 days. In this instance, however, both houses remained in pro forma sessions throughout much of the post-election period, so that the difference in length depends largely on when each house held its first consecutive sessions after the election. In 2000 (106 th Congress), the House returned earlier than the Senate from its election recess and remained in session for 37 days, whereas the Senate adjourned sine die after but 11 days. In this case the major task of the session was the completion of action on appropriations bills, and the House was the focus of the major conflicts over the matter.", "Lame duck sessions between 1980 and 2006 tended to be shorter than those that occurred either before or since. Among the nine lame duck sessions from 1940 through 1980, only two were shorter than 30 days: the one-day session of the 80 th Congress (1948) and the session of the Senate alone to address the censure of Senator McCarthy in the 83 rd Congress (1948), which lasted 25 days. Among the seven lame duck sessions from 1982 through 2006, by contrast, only one exceeded 27 days in length. The three most recent lame duck sessions, however, may indicate an emerging trend toward greater length. In 2008 (110 th Congress), the House remained in session for 46 calendar days and the Senate for 45; in 2010 (111 th Congress), both chambers remained in session for 38 days; and in 2012 (112 th Congress), the House remained in session for 52 days, while the Senate remained in session for 51 days.

Inasmuch as this session included essentially the entire time between election day and the expiration of the constitutional term of the Congress, it approaches the theoretical maximum length. A longer lame duck session could occur only in a year when election day was earlier.", "Only three other lame duck sessions have lasted more than 38 days.

In some respects, however, comparisons in terms of calendar days counted in this way may be misleading. Part of the reason is that some Congresses have used pro forma sessions not only to effect the break spanning the election, but also in the course of the lame duck session itself. In addition, some lame duck sessions have contained internal recesses, authorized by concurrent resolution. The two houses have used both these means, for example, to create breaks in session for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.", "In some respects, as a result, the extent of activity of a lame duck session may be better stated in terms of the number of actual daily sessions held after the election, rather than in calendar days between convening and adjourning. This way of counting includes not only those pro forma sessions that occurred after each chamber resumed consecutive sessions after the election, but all sessions held between the election day and the sine die adjournment, whether consecutive or not.

From this perspective the 2008 lame duck session might be viewed as another example of a lame duck session with a limited agenda (of addressing dislocations in the financial system) that was consequently unusually brief.", "During the 2010 lame duck session, the House convened on 19 days and the Senate on 29.

Bush's legislative agenda. A bill to create the DHS had passed the House in late July 2002, but the Senate did not act until after the election. The Senate passed a similar version of the measure on November 19, and the House agreed to the Senate amendment on November 22. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on November 25.", "Congress, however, was unable to resolve its appropriations differences. The House passed the fifth in a series of continuing resolutions on November 13, and the Senate agreed to the measure on November 19.

The Administration also sought the elimination of many authorizing provisions. Congress initially cleared the omnibus measure on November 20, but, because it subsequently had to direct corrections in the enrollment of the bill, President Bush was able to sign it only on December 8, the day of the sine die adjournment. Similarly, although Congress could reach no final agreement on a congressional budget resolution, which would have advanced action to increase the debt limit, post-election conditions enabled the increase to be enacted as a freestanding measure.", "During the lame duck period, the Administration intensified efforts to persuade House conferees on the intelligence bill to accept modifications in provisions to (1) maintain military control over its own intelligence, (2) keep intelligence funding confidential, and (3) control immigration. The conference report cleared Congress on December 8 and was signed into law on December 17.", "Post-election conditions also permitted the resolution of conference deadlocks over several other reauthorizations, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a moratorium on Internet taxation, and authority for satellite television systems to carry network programming. The last of these was enacted as one of the few legislative riders to be included in the omnibus appropriation bill. Failure to resolve policy disagreements, however, doomed several other reauthorizations, including the 1996 welfare reform and a highway bill, although the latter had been delayed also by demands in the Senate for assurances about the role to be played by minority conferees.

Democrats had gained control of both houses in the November election, and the President and Democratic party leaders expressed hopes of cooperation and bi-partisanship leading into the lame duck session.", "Despite this optimism and several instances of cooperation, the Congress ultimately did not achieve its primary goal of passing further appropriations measures. Congress opted to fund the government through two successive extensions of the continuing resolution, with H.J.Res. 100 continuing funding through December 8 and H.J.Res. 102 continuing funding through February 15, 2007. Congress also cleared a package of tax benefit extensions, including those for research and development and for education, which was paired with a trade package that included benefits for undeveloped countries and agreements with Vietnam.", "Other notable legislation included a bill that allowed President George W.

In the final week of the session, a compromise was enacted ( H.R. 4853 ) that extended these revenue provisions for two years, instituted a temporary payroll tax reduction, and provided jobless benefits for 13 additional months.
