In July 2007, an unclassified summary of the National Intelligence Estimate on \"The Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland\" was released. It expressed the judgment, in part, that the U/S. Homeland will face a persistent and evolving threat over the next three years, the main threat coming from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, particularly Al Qaeda. On August 2, 2007, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) released a statement on \"Modernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\" In his statement, Admiral McConnell viewed such modernization as necessary to respond to technological changes and to meet the Nation's current intelligence collection needs. He deemed it essential for the Intelligence Community to provide warning of threats to the United States. He perceived two critically needed changes. First, he stated that a court order should not be required for gathering foreign intelligence from foreign targets located overseas, although he did agree to court review of related procedures after commencement of the needed collection. Second, he contended that liability protection was needed for those who furnished aid to the government in carrying out its foreign intelligence collection efforts.", "On August 5, 2007, the Protect America Act of 2007, P.L. 110-55 , was enacted into law with a 180 day sunset provision, providing a temporary solution to concerns raised by the Director of National Intelligence. Both the House and the Senate have considered or are considering possible legislation to provide a longer-term statutory approach to these concerns. On November 15, 2007, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3773 , the Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseen, Reviewed, and Effective Act of 2007 or the RESTORE Act of 2007.

Senator Reid introduced two additional FISA bills on December 10, 2007, S. 2440 and S. 2441 , which were read twice the following day and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar as Numbers 529 and 530, respectively. S. 2402 was introduced by Senator Specter on December 3, 2007, and referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In Committee markup on December 13, 2007, an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2402 was adopted by unanimous consent. Then, by a vote of 5-13, the Committee rejected S. 2402 , as amended.
