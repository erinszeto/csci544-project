Although it has been part of U.S. law since 1789, the ATS was rarely used for nearly two centuries. In 1980, that long dormancy came to an end when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rendered a landmark decision, Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala, which held that the ATS permits claims for violations of modern international human rights law.", "Fil\u00e1rtiga caused an explosion of ATS litigation in the decades that followed, but the Supreme Court has placed limits on ATS jurisdiction in its recent jurisprudence. In a 2004 case, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Court held that the ATS allows federal courts to hear only a \"narrow set\" of claims for violations of international law. And in 2013, the Supreme Court held in Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. that the statute does not provide jurisdiction for claims between foreign plaintiffs and defendants involving matters arising entirely outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Lower courts' interpretations of these decisions are still evolving and, in some cases, conflicting, but many observers agree that Sosa and Kiobel have significantly narrowed the scope of the ATS.", "In its most recent ATS case, Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, the Supreme Court further limited the scope of viable claims by holding that foreign corporations may not be defendants in suits brought under the ATS. Jesner involved claims by approximately 6,000 foreign nationals (or their families or estate representatives) who were injured, killed, or captured by terrorist groups in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank\u2014the largest bank in Jordan\u2014aided and abetted the terrorist organizations allegedly responsible for the attacks by maintaining bank accounts that Arab Bank knew would be used to fund terrorism and by identifying the relatives of suicide bombers so that they could be compensated with so-called \"martyrdom payments.\"", "A divided Supreme Court held in Jesner that the claims must be dismissed because ATS jurisdiction does not extend to claims against foreign corporations, including Arab Bank. Separation-of-powers and foreign policy concerns led the Court to conclude that it would be \"inappropriate\" to permit ATS liability against foreign corporations. The High Court's narrowing of the available avenues to raise an ATS claim in Sosa, Kiobel, and Jesner has led commentators to debate whether the statute remains a viable mechanism to provide redress for human rights abuses in U.S. courts."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["O riginally enacted by the First Congress as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) has been described as a provision that is \"u nlike any other in American law\" and \"unknown to any other legal system in the world.\" In its current form, the complete text of the ATS provides that \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\" Although it is only a single sentence long, the ATS has been the subject of intense interest in recent decades, as it evolved from a rarely used jurisdictional statute to a prominent vehicle for foreign nationals to seek redress in U.S. courts for human rights offenses and acts of terrorism .

The ATS does not provide jurisdiction for suits alleging torts in violation of the law of nations by U.S. nationals \u2014although other statutes may allow for such claims. 3. For a tort : As a general matter, a tort is \"a civil wrong, other than breach of contract, for which a remedy may be obtained, [usually] in the form of damages[.]\" 4. In violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States : The ATS requires that the tort asserted be considered a violation of either the \"law of nations\" or a treaty ratified by the United States. The term \"law of nations\" is now often understood to refer to \"customary international law.\" As a general matter, customary international law is international law that is derived from \"a general and consistent practice of States followed by them from a sense of legal obligation.\" State practices that form the basis for customary international law are often referred to as international \"norms.\" But the process of identifying what norms are actionable under the ATS is a complex judicial function that was the subject of much debate and was addressed by the Supreme Court in Sosa v .

Under the Articles of Confederation, the federal government had little ability to provide redress to foreign citizens for violations of international law. Instead, the Confederation Congress passed a resolution recommending that each state create judicial tribunals to hear civil and criminal claims arising out of violations of the law of nations, and that state legislatures criminalize treaty infractions and other breaches of international law. But only one state, Connecticut, passed legislation creating penalties for violations of the law of nations.", "At the same time, international law during the founding era was understood to place an affirmative obligation on the United States to redress certain violations of the law of nations, even when those violations were perpetrated by private individuals. The Framers expressed concern that the state governments did not fully understand or appreciate the duties that arose under international law by virtue of the United States' new position as a sovereign nation. These concerns led the Framers and the First Congress to provide jurisdiction to federal courts in a number of circumstances that may implicate foreign relations concerns\u2014such as suits involving foreign diplomats, admiralty and maritime cases, and disputes between U.S. citizens and citizens of foreign nations.

Concerned that Pennsylvania officials may not adequately address the incident\u2014especially after Longchamps briefly escaped following his arrest \u2014the chief French diplomat in the United States lodged a protest with the Confederation Congress and threatened to leave the country unless an adequate remedy were provided. Longchamps was eventually recaptured, convicted, and sentenced to two years in jail by a Pennsylvania court. But Pennsylvania officials declined French requests to deliver Longchamps to French authorities, and the Confederation Congress passed a resolution directing the Secretary of Foreign Affairs to apologize to Marbois for its limited ability to provide redress at the federal level.", "Three years later, similar tensions arose when a New York constable entered the home of the Dutch Ambassador and arrested one of his domestic servants. When the Ambassador, Pieter J. Van Berckel, protested that his servant should have been afforded diplomatic immunity, U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay reported to Congress that the federal government was not \"vested with any Judicial Powers competent\" to adjudicate the propriety of the constable's actions.", "The United States was \"embarrassed\" by these incidents and by \"its inability to provide judicial relief to the foreign officials injured in the United States[.]\" Moreover, such incidents were not seen as low-level diplomatic quarrels. During the founding era, assaults on ambassadors (among other violations of international law) were considered \"just causes of war\" if not adequately redressed.

The defendant, Americo Norberto Pe\u00f1a-Irala, was also a Paraguayan citizen who was discovered to be living in New York on an expired visa. Relying on the ATS for jurisdiction, the Fil\u00e1rtigas contended that Pe\u00f1a-Irala's actions constituted a tort in violation of the law of nations, but the district court initially dismissed the case on the ground that the law of nations actionable under the ATS did not include modern provisions in international law that govern how a nation (in this case, Paraguay) treats its own citizens.", "In a first-of-its-kind decision, the Second Circuit reversed and concluded that torture by a state official against its own citizen violates \"established norms of the international law of human rights\" and therefore provides an actionable claim under the ATS.

In one prominent 1984 decision, Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic , the D.C. Circuit framed one of the chief, conceptual questions related to the ATS: Is the statute solely jurisdictional in nature, or does it also create a cause of action for plaintiffs? As a general matter, plaintiffs pursuing a civil claim in federal court must both (1) identify a court that possesses jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case and (2) have a cause of action that allows them to seek the relief requested, such as compensatory relief for monetary damages. In Tel-Oren , the D.C.

Circuit unanimously agreed to dismiss the case, but each judge issued a separate opinion relying on a different rationale for dismissal.", "In a widely discussed concurring opinion, Judge Bork concluded that the ATS is a purely jurisdictional statute that does not create a cause of action for damages. To hold otherwise, Judge Bork reasoned, would violate separation-of-powers principles by allowing judges, rather than Congress, to create causes of action that could affect U.S. foreign relations. Judge Edwards disagreed, and argued that the ATS itself creates a statutory cause of action. However, Judge Edwards still concurred in the dismissal under the rationale that the case lacked official state action, and that the claim for terrorism was not sufficiently recognized as a violation of international law. In addition, Judge Robb found the case to raise nonjusticiable political questions\u2014meaning it raised disputes more appropriately addressed by the legislative and executive branches. But it was the broader, doctrinal disagreement between Judge Bork and Judge Edwards over the cause-of-action question that would eventually become the subject of a landmark Supreme Court decision, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain , discussed below. However, Sosa was not decided until 20 years later.

Legislative history of the TVPA suggests the act was designed to establish an \"unambiguous basis\" for the causes of action recognized in Fil\u00e1rtiga and to respond to Judge Bork's argument in Tel-Oren that there must be a separate and explicit \"grant by Congress of a private right of action\" in order to assert a tort claim for a violation of international law. However, there are important distinctions between the TVPA and ATS.", "Whereas the TVPA expressly creates a civil cause of action for torture and extrajudicial killing, the ATS refers only to the jurisdiction of federal courts. Moreover, while the ATS applies only to civil actions brought by aliens, the TVPA allows a cause of action to be brought by and against \"individuals.\" Courts have interpreted this term as extending a cause of action to both U.S. and foreign nationals, but excluding liability against corporations. At the same time, the TVPA places limitations on civil actions that are not present in the ATS. Most notably, the TVPA requires that plaintiffs exhaust all \"adequate and available remedies in the place in which the conduct giving rise to the claim occurred.\"", "The relationship between the TVPA and the ATS is not clearly defined. Some courts concluded that the TVPA supplements (but does not displace) the ATS, and therefore plaintiffs can choose whether to bring claims for torture or extrajudicial killing under either statute. Others courts reasoned that the TVPA was intended to \"occupy the field,\" and that plaintiffs cannot avoid its exhaustion-of-remedies requirement merely by pleading their claims under the ATS.

Rather, under Sosa , federal courts can recognize common law claims for violations of the \"present-day law of nations,\" provided the claims satisfy an important and overarching limitation: only those claims that \"rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century paradigms\" of international law are actionable under the ATS. Thus, while Sosa allows federal courts to recognize some tort claims for violations of modern customary international law, the Court emphasized the need for \"judicial caution\" and \"restraint\" in identifying new causes of action.

Thus, it remains to be seen whether RJR Nabisco will streamline lower courts' interpretive frameworks for analyzing extraterritoriality under the ATS.", "Moreover, even if the \"focus\" test becomes part of all the circuits' analyses, RJR Nabisco may still leave room for courts to disagree on precisely what the \"focus\" of the ATS is. But if courts follow the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of RJR Nabisco in ATS cases, they appear more likely to create a bright-line rule that ATS plaintiffs can overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality only if the specific conduct constituting a violation of the law of nations occurred within the United States. Regardless of which interpretation courts adopt, the Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v.

Arab Bank, PLC: Barring Foreign Corporate Liability", "paragraphs": ["In the Supreme Court's most recent ATS case, Jesner v.

Jesner was the second time the Supreme Court took up the issue of corporate liability under the ATS. Although it ultimately decided Kiobel on extraterritoriality grounds, the Court originally granted certiorari in that case to review a holding in the Second Circuit that the law of nations does not recognize corporate liability. At the time certiorari was granted in Je s n er , however, the Second Circuit was the only circuit to reach this conclusion.

The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank\u2014one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East \u2014aided and abetted four terrorist organizations allegedly responsible for the attacks. Among other things, the plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank maintained accounts for the organizations knowing that they would be used for terrorist actions, and played an active role in identifying the families of victims of suicide bombing so that they could be compensated in so-called \"martyrdom payments.\" As one court described the allegations, Arab Bank allegedly served as a \"paymaster\" for terrorist groups through its branch offices in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.", "Jesner was a consolidation of five cases filed in the Eastern District of New York, all of which assert similar allegations of facilitating and financing terrorism against Arab Bank. Relying on its prior circuit precedent, both the district court and Second Circuit dismissed the ATS claims on the ground that the ATS does not permit any form of corporate liability. Although the Second Circuit acknowledged there is a \"growing consensus among [its] sister circuits\" that the ATS allows for corporate liability, it nevertheless declined to overturn its prior circuit precedent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Jesner Decision", "paragraphs": ["After granting certiorari in Jesner , the Supreme Court sided with the Second Circuit's minority approach regarding corporate liability under the ATS, with one modification: the Court held that foreign corporations are not subject to liability under the ATS. The Court left open the possibility that U.S. corporations could face claims under the ATS.", "Writing for a 5-4 majority, Justice Kennedy (joined, in relevant part, by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch) placed the decision in the context of the second step of the two-part inquiry described in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain for evaluating whether violations of international norms are actionable under the ATS. In Sosa step two, courts consider whether circumstances make it \"appropriate\" to deem a violation of an international norm cognizable under the ATS. Although Sosa described federal courts' ability to recognize claims under the ATS as within judicial discretion, the Sosa Court instructed federal courts to exercise \"great caution\" and to act with \"restraint in judicially applying internationally generated norms.\" In Jesner , the Court reasoned that the same restrained approach applies when evaluating the question of whether artificial entities like corporations can be defendants in ATS suits. Against this backdrop of judicial caution, the Jesner Court concluded that it would be \"inappropriate for courts to extend ATS liability to foreign corporations.\"", "The Court's decision arose, in part, from separation-of-powers and foreign affairs concerns. Congress is in \"the better position to consider if the public interest would be served by imposing\" ATS liability on foreign corporations, the majority in Jesner reasoned. And ATS claims against foreign corporations often impact the United States' foreign relations, according to the Jesner Court. In fact, the Court noted, the claims against Arab Bank had already caused diplomatic tensions with Jordan, which filed an amicus brief describing the case as a \"direct affront to its sovereignty.\" Because the \"political branches, not the Judiciary, have the responsibility and institutional capacity to weigh foreign policy concerns[,]\" the Jesner Court concluded that the judicial caution described in Sosa warranted the creation of a bright-line rule that \"foreign corporations may not be defendants in suits brought under the ATS.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plurality, Concurring, and Dissenting Opinions in Jesner", "paragraphs": ["Although a majority of the Jesner Court agreed to a categorical rule foreclosing ATS claims against foreign corporate entities, several Justices diverged in their rationale for the holding. A five-Justice majority joined portions of an opinion authored by Justice Kennedy, described above. But only Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas joined the remainder of Justice Kennedy's plurality opinion.", "In a separate opinion concurring in part with Justice Kennedy and concurring in the judgment, Justice Alito expressed the view that courts should decline to recognize ATS claims \"whenever doing so would not materially advance the ATS's objective of avoiding diplomatic strife.\" Justice Gorsuch also wrote separately to describe \"two more fundamental reasons\" why he believed Jesner should be dismissed. According to Justice Gorsuch, (1) separation-of-powers principles dictate that courts should never recognize new causes of action under the ATS; (2) and a reexamination of the history of the ATS shows that the statute was intended to apply only to claims against U.S. defendants\u2014regardless of whether they are corporations or natural persons. Justice Thomas also wrote a one-paragraph concurring opinion in which he stated that, although he joined Justice Kennedy's opinion because he believed it \"correctly applies\" the Court's precedents, he also agreed with the concurrences of Justices Alito and Gorsuch.", "Justice Sotomayor, writing in dissent and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, argued that nothing in the \"corporate form in itself raises\" foreign policy concerns that require the Court to \"immunize all foreign corporations from liability under ATS,\" regardless of the specific claim alleged.

Some observers have suggested that, when Jesner is combined with Kiobel 's presumption against extraterritoriality and the limitations of Sosa 's two-step framework, very few cases will satisfy the Supreme Court's requirements for ATS jurisdiction. Others see the ATS as retaining at least some significance because the Jesner Court did not foreclose suits against U.S. corporations , and the Court's holding allows for claims against the individual employees of foreign companies.", "Although not resolved in the Jesner Court's opinion, several Justices expressed a desire to revisit Sosa 's conclusion that federal courts have discretion under the ATS to recognize new causes of action for violations of modern international norms. If the Supreme Court were, in a future case, to hold that federal courts do not possess such discretion, ATS jurisdiction potentially could be limited to three types of claims that were generally recognized as actionable violations of international law at the time of the ATS's enactment: (1) piracy; (2) interference with the rights of ambassadors; and (3) violations of safe conducts. Such a holding could cabin the scope of ATS jurisdiction so significantly that it potentially could relegate the statute to its status during the long dormancy in which it was a rarely invoked jurisdictional provision."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["After nearly two centuries of relative obscurity, the ATS emerged as a prominent legal mechanism for human rights and terrorism-related litigation after the Second Circuit's decision in Fil\u00e1rtiga . But while numerous suits premised on the ATS were filed by foreign nationals in the aftermath of Fil\u00e1rtiga , the Supreme Court has never ruled in the plaintiff's favor in an ATS case. Instead, the High Court placed significant limitations on the scope of viable ATS claims through decisions in Sosa , Kiobel , and, most recently, Jesner . Some commentators see the Supreme Court's ATS jurisprudence as having limited the statute's jurisdictional reach so significantly as to result in the end of the ATS's era of importance. Others interpret the High Court's rulings as having left the door open for certain limited categories of cases against natural persons or U.S. corporate defendants. Ultimately, the Jesner Court emphasized the need for \"further action from Congress\" before recognizing an expansion of ATS jurisdiction beyond its 18th century roots, and therefore the future of ATS litigation may be dictated by the legislative branch rather than the courts."], "subsections": []}]}}
