In 2009, Congress enacted the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-81 ) authorizing advance appropriations for three of the four accounts that comprise VHA: medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities. The fourth account, the medical and prosthetic research account, is not funded with an advance appropriation. P.L. 111-81 also required the Department of Veterans Affairs to submit a request for advance appropriations for VHA with its budget request each year. Congress first provided advance appropriations for the three VHA accounts in the FY2010 appropriations cycle; the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ), provided advance appropriations for FY2011. Subsequently, each successive appropriation measure has provided advance appropriations for the VHA accounts: the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ), provided advance appropriations for FY2012; the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ), provided advance appropriations for FY2013; the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ), provided advance appropriations for FY2014; and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ) provided advance appropriations for FY2015. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( H.R. 83 ; P.L. 113-235 ) provides advance appropriations for FY2016. Additionally, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( H.R. 83 ; P.L. 113-235 ), amended 38 U.S.C \u00a7117 and included three more accounts to the Advance Appropriations list of accounts. This authorizes advance appropriations for three mandatory VA programs within the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA): compensation and pensions, readjustment benefits, and veterans insurance and indemnities. Beginning with the FY2016 MILCON-VA Appropriations bill, those accounts would receive advance appropriations for FY2017 in addition to the three VHA accounts that are already authorized to receive advance appropriations.

Therefore, throughout the funding tables of this report, advance appropriations numbers are shown under the label \"memorandum\" and in the corresponding fiscal year column. For example, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( H.R. 83 ; P.L. 113-235 ) provides advance appropriations for the medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities accounts for FY2016. Funding shown for FY2015 does not include advance appropriations provided in FY2015 by P.L. 113-235 for use in FY2016.

VHA's budget request to Congress begins with the formulations of the budget based on the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM), and the Civilian Health and Medical Program Veterans Administration (CHAMPVA) Model. The two models collectively estimate the amount of budgetary resources VHA will need to meet the expected demand for most of the health care services it provides. ", "The EHCPM's estimates are based on three basic components: the projected number of veterans who will be enrolled in VA health care, the projected utilization of VA's health care services\u2014that is, the quantity of health care services enrollees are expected to use\u2014and the projected unit cost of providing these services. Each component is subject to a number of adjustments to account for the characteristics of VA health care and the veterans who access VA's health care services. The EHCPM makes projections three or four years into the future. Each year, VHA updates the EHCPM estimates to \"incorporate the most recent data on health care utilization rates, actual program experience, and other factors, such as economic trends in unemployment and inflation.\" For instance, in 2013, VHA used data from FY2012 to develop its health care budget estimate for the FY2015 request, including the advance appropriations request for FY2016. ", "The CHAMPVA Model is a more recent model adopted by VHA in 2010. The CHAMPVA model projects the cost of providing medical coverage to CHAMPVA eligible beneficiaries. The CHAMPVA Model is composed of two major components: the enrollment model and the claims cost model. The enrollment model projects the number of beneficiaries enrolled in CHAMPVA, and the claims cost model projects expenditures for providing care to beneficiaries. According to the VHA, the \"2013 CHAMPVA Model was developed using data from fiscal years 2005 to 2012, publically available research, and input from a development team (including subject matter experts from VHA and VHA's CHAMPVA program).\"", " Table 3 provides a detailed timeline for formulating the FY2015 budget request and the FY2016 advance appropriations request.

The pilot program will be titled the ''Physician Ambassadors Helping Veterans Program.'' According to the Explanatory Statement: ", "In some communities non-VA physicians have encountered difficulties when seeking to volunteer time at VA medical facilities. Under existing authority, Section 7405(a)(1) of title 38, United States Code, the Secretary may appoint on a without compensation basis such personnel found necessary for the provision of healthcare for veterans. At medical facilities exhibiting staffing shortages and appointment backlogs due to waiting time issues, the VA is urged to utilize this existing authority to appoint physicians on a volunteer basis to serve veterans' healthcare needs at VA medical facilities. To further understand the benefit to the Department of the utilization of volunteer physicians the VA is directed to establish [the] three-year pilot program.", "Under the Physician Ambassadors Helping Veterans Program, the Secretary is required to establish this pilot program in no fewer than two VA medical facilities in two distinct Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). Furthermore, the Explanatory Statement language urges the Secretary to select \"medical facilities for this pilot program that have a demonstrated need for additional physicians in any practice area or specialty, yet have been unable to expeditiously fill such vacancies and/or continue to exceed VA's appointment waiting time goals in any area of practice.\" ", "Furthermore, each pilot location must have a volunteer coordinator who will develop relationships with local medical associations to educate non-VA physicians in the area about the program. The volunteer coordinator will be the initial point of contact for physicians seeking to volunteer at the medical facility. Additionally, due to the cost and effort exerted to credential and educate physicians about volunteer opportunities, the VA is required establish a requisite number of hours per year physician ambassadors must commit to serving at a facility that is cost beneficial to the VA. The Explanatory Statement further stipulates that this metric should be no fewer than 60 hours a year and no more than 100 hours a year, though there is no limit to the total number of hours a physician ambassador may volunteer a year. The VA medical facility is required to enter into agreement with the physician ambassadors regarding the minimum number of hours required before beginning the credentialing or privilege granting process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Appendix A.
