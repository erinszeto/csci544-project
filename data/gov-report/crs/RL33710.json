Summaries of the relevant leave statutes and regulations are organized in alphabetical order."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") to \"balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families.\" Recognizing that many employees had to choose between parenting or caregiving and job security, Congress sought to enable employees to take \"reasonable leave\" for medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and for the care of a child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition.", "When the FMLA was enacted, it supplemented approximately 30 state statutes that provided some form of family and medical leave to employees who worked in those states. Congress did not intend to preempt these laws. Rather, Congress wanted to establish minimum standards for the availability of family and medical leave, particularly in states that did not have statutes extending such leave to their employees. Congress understood that more favorable leave benefits could be available under some state laws. Thus, section 401(b) of the FMLA indicates that nothing in the federal law \"shall be construed to supersede any provision of any State or local law that provides greater family or medical leave rights than the rights established under [the FMLA].\"", "Although the FMLA and state family and medical leave laws are generally similar with regard to the availability of leave, they differ both in terms of coverage and scope. For example, under the FMLA and many of the state family and medical leave statutes and regulations, only certain employers are required to provide leave to their employees. The FMLA applies only to employers engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce that have at least 50 employees who are employed for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year. In contrast, the state family and medical leave laws vary with regard to the number of employees who must be employed by an employer before it becomes subject to a law.", "The FMLA and state family and medical leave laws also differ with regard to scope. Section 102(a)(1) of the FMLA provides for a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons:", "(1) Because of the birth of a son or daughter of the employee and in order to care for such son or daughter;", "(2) Because of the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care;", "(3) In order to care for the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent, of the employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition;", "(4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.", "In contrast, some state laws permit leave for reasons other than pregnancy, adoption, or a serious health condition.", "Forty-five states and the District of Columbia now appear to have family and medical leave laws. The following section provides citations and brief descriptions of the relevant laws. Many of the laws identified in this section govern state government employers. Title II of the FMLA amended the U. S. Code to add family and medical leave provisions to title 5 of the Code, the title that governs employees in the federal government. Under the Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act, federal employees are also entitled to use sick leave to care for a family member with an illness or injury, to make funeral arrangements for a family member, and to attend the funeral of a family member."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Family and Medical Leave Laws", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Alabama", "paragraphs": ["Ala.
