In recent years, dairy producers have argued that a simple price-based system fails to reflect the sharp increases in milk production costs, especially feed costs, which have occurred since the mid-2000s.", "In response to producer concerns and to the volatile dairy price and margin developments of the past decade, the 112 th Congress spent substantial time and effort during 2012 reviewing existing farm programs, consulting with stakeholders, and preparing new legislation to serve as the next five-year version of an omnibus farm bill. The Senate passed its version of the farm bill, S. 3240 , in June 2012, and the House Agriculture Committee approved its version, H.R. 6083 , in July. Both bills proposed replacing the current U.S. dairy programs that rely on a simple price trigger (DPPSP and MILC) with two programs\u2014the Dairy Production Margin Protection Program (DPMPP), a new income support program based on the monthly difference (i.e., the margin) between the national average farm all-milk price and a formula-derived estimate of feed costs, and the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP), which, under certain conditions, would reduce payments to participating producers for their milk when the margin falls below proposed statutory thresholds. The DMSP proposal has generated considerable debate among dairy producer groups, which generally support it, and dairy processors who oppose it. The producer groups view the proposal as a means to reduce margin volatility through temporary production adjustments. Dairy processors argue that the proposal would raise dairy product prices compared with international prices and hurt export competitiveness.

The Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) compensates ranchers at a rate of 75% of market value for livestock mortality caused by a disaster. The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) compensates producers for disaster losses not covered under other disaster programs.

USDA's projected corn and soybean prices for marketing year 2012/2013 are record-high and 16% and 14% above the previous marketing year. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts a record corn crop of 14.5 billion bushels for 2013, but that forecast is based on normal weather, and yield uncertainty remains. USDA reported that hay production in 2012 was about 9% lower than 2011, and increased use of hay during the dry summer and fall months resulted in December 1, 2012, hay stocks falling 16% below a year earlier.

Furthermore, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) seasonal outlook is for persistent drought in these areas through April 2013. These conditions contribute to uncertainty about 2013 crop prospects and adversely affect livestock producers who already have been hit with poor forage and pasture conditions over the past two years.", "Livestock and poultry producers are concerned about agricultural policies that can raise feed prices. These may include conservation programs that take cropland out of production, or ethanol incentives that can bid up the price of corn. Incentives such as tax credits and Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) mandates have already helped to boost significantly the portion of the total U.S. corn crop processed into ethanol. Proponents argue that the RFS reduces investment risk for renewable fuels, which support U.S. energy security and provide environmental benefits over fossil fuels. However, livestock and poultry industries have intently focused on repealing or revising the RFS, which they say has harmed the livestock and poultry sectors by driving up feed costs. During the 112 th Congress, several bills were introduced to eliminate tax incentives and prevent the expansion of the ethanol blend beyond 10%. Several bills were introduced that would have waived the RFS when corn inventories were low ( H.R. 3097 and S. 3428 ); another would have eliminated the RFS ( H.R. 3098 ). The RFS remains a primary concern of livestock and poultry producers, and they likely will continue to advocate for curtailing or eliminating it in the 113 th Congress. Two bills already introduced in the 113 th Congress ( H.R. 550 and S. 251 ) would require that cellulosic biofuel mandates be based on actual cellulosic production levels.

The section also provided that contract disputes shall be heard in the federal judicial district where the contract is performed and that contracts may specify which state laws govern the contract. Lastly, contract growers have the right to participate in meaningful arbitration, and the right to decline an arbitration clause if included in contracts.

The proposed rule was controversial among the livestock and poultry industries, and some Members of Congress expressed concerns about it during the comment period in letters to USDA. USDA issued the final rule on December 9, 2011, and it was substantially different than the proposed rule because Section 721 of the FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-55 ) prohibited USDA from using funds to implement most of the proposed provisions. The final rule included criteria to determine violations of the P&S Act for four provisions from the proposed rule: (1) suspension of the delivery of birds, (2) additional capital investment requirements, (3) breach of contract conditions, and (4) arbitration. The final rule became effective on February 7, 2012.", "Like the FY2012 appropriations act, the FY2013 House Agriculture appropriations bill ( H.R. 5973 ) would have prohibited USDA from implementing the GIPSA rule provisions.

Antibiotics are added to feed for some types of food-producing animals not only to treat and prevent diseases, but also to improve growth and efficient use of feed rations. Some public health advocates argue that non-medical uses in food animals should be limited to drugs that are not useful in human medicine. Others oppose this approach, arguing that animal production may not be commercially viable without the drugs' routine use, and that the linkage between such use and antimicrobial resistance in humans lacks a strong scientific basis.

In November 2009, Canada and Mexico requested that the World Trade Organization (WTO) establish a dispute resolution panel to consider their case. In November 2011, the WTO's dispute settlement panel ruled that COOL violates WTO trade standards by discriminating against imported cattle and hogs.

Other than saying the United States would fulfill its WTO obligations, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has not announced how the United States will comply.
