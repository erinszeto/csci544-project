Since then, vaccinating children against VPDs has been a major U.S. foreign policy effort.", "Vaccinations are one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent infectious disease and associated morbidity and mortality. According to UNICEF, immunizations save around 3 million lives per year. As of 2019, VPDs continue to cause high levels of morbidity (illness) and mortality (death), and the World Health Organization (WHO) notes that the adoption of new vaccines by low- and middle-income countries (which often have the highest disease burdens) has been slower than in high-income countries. Receiving a vaccination during childhood can protect the recipient from VPDs, decrease the spread of related diseases, and improve child survival prospects (as children, particularly those under five years old, are more likely than adults to die from VPDs).", "Recently, a global resurgence of certain VPDs has caused concern among public health officials and drawn attention to the challenges of vaccine hesitancy and stigma. For example, polio continues to elude global eradication and remains endemic in three countries. In 2019 measles has seen a resurgence in some middle- and high-income countries due to a variety of factors, including reluctance among some individuals and religious communities to vaccinate their children. In April 2019, the WHO reported a n increase in global measles cases compared to the same period in 2018, with the greatest surges in cases in the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. A number of European countries are at risk of or have lost their measles eradication certificate from the WHO, raising questions about global consensus on the use of vaccines, participation in and support for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI, now called GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance) and other global immunization efforts. Prompted in part by this global resurgence, the WHO has listed \"vaccine hesitancy\" as one of the 10 biggest global public health threats.", "The U.S. government is the second-leading government donor to global vaccination campaigns.

According to GAVI, full vaccination coverage could prevent one in seven deaths in under-5 children. Over 1.5 million children die every year from VPDs. Nearly 60% of these children live in 10 countries: Angola, Brazil, DRC, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Vietnam.", "From 1990 to 2017, overall child deaths fell from 12.7 million to 5.8 million, largely due to gains made by global immunization campaigns and expanded national immunization programs. For example, from 2000 to 2017, scaled-up measles vaccination coverage averted an estimated 15.6 million deaths from the disease. ", "Global coverage for several recommended vaccines has continued to climb over the past decade (see Figure 1 ); however, progress in expanding the number of children vaccinated with DTP3 (a three-dose diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine) has stagnated in recent years, though its coverage remains higher than coverage for other required vaccinations (see Figure 2 ). GAVI reports recent stagnation in coverage is due to \"acute problems that a small number of previously high performing countries have faced.\" Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis are particularly fatal to neonates, new mothers, and pregnant women. Maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNTE) has been almost eliminated globally, and since 2000 there has been an 85% reduction in newborn deaths from tetanus. As of March 2019, MNTE remains present in 14 countries. In 2018, 86% of children under the age of one received all three doses of the DTP3 vaccine.

For example, polio continues to elude global eradication, and in 2019 some middle- and high-income countries experienced a resurgence of measles, due to a variety of factors, including reluctance among some individuals and religious communities to vaccinate their children. In April 2019, the WHO reported a 300% increase in global measles cases compared to the same period in 2018, with the greatest surges in cases in the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. ", "Prompted in part by this resurgence, the WHO listed \"vaccine hesitancy\" as one of the 10 biggest global public health threats. Corruption, authoritarian governance, and social or political discrimination can fuel vaccine hesitancy by undermining citizens' trust in authority figures (including government officials and health workers involved in vaccine campaigns). For example, Nigeria was close to eliminating polio for many years but did not do so until recently. Vaccination campaign efforts were hampered in part by conspiracy theories, \"vaccine stigma,\" as well as by ethical concerns about government regulations and pharmaceutical industry practices. Vaccine stigma, for its part, arises when a community normalizes vaccine denial. ", "Geographic location . Geographical distance from health centers negatively impacts vaccination coverage. Underserved populations within any given country often shoulder a heavier burden of disease, and they may lack access to basic medical care. Notably, vaccine coverage disparities between children in urban and rural areas persist throughout the world, and commonly exacerbate disease spread within a certain geographical area. For example, according to the WHO, in some countries (e.g., Nigeria and Indonesia), coverage of the measles vaccine in rural areas is 33% lower than in urban areas. ", "Poverty, s ocioeconomic status , and social determinants of health. Vaccination coverage in low-income countries (41%) lags behind coverage in high-income countries (90%). Medical systems in many low-income countries are often underfunded and unable to vaccinate enough children to stop a virus's spread even with donor aid. In addition, researchers have found that inequities in vaccination coverage are associated with individual socioeconomic determinants, such as a family's income level and the educational status of a child's mother. Children born into poverty are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from wealthier families, and researchers suggest that unequal access to vaccines is a key factor. Vaccine coverage for the richest fifth of the population in some countries is up to 58% higher than for the poorest fifth.", "Fragile and conflict settings . UNICEF reports that 40% of unvaccinated children live in countries affected by armed conflict or other humanitarian challenges. Often, already fragile health care infrastructure is further crippled by armed conflict, which can hinder health workers in carrying out vaccinations and interfere with proper disease treatment and containment. Humanitarian settings such as refugee and internal displacement camps can also foster conditions (e.g., poor nutrition, overcrowding, and unsanitary conditions) conducive to the rapid spread of infectious diseases. According to UNICEF estimates, as of 2015, half of the 10 countries that had under 50% diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine coverage\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Central African Republic, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0094had experienced conflicts or other humanitarian emergencies. Other conflict-affected countries have seen spikes in VPD cases, such as a 2019 surge in measles cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has killed more people than the ongoing Ebola outbreak in that country.
