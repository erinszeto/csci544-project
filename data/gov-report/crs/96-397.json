Canada's Liberal Party government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has prioritized multilateral efforts to renew and strengthen the rules-based international order since coming to power in November 2015. It has expressed disappointment with President Donald Trump's decisions to withdraw from international accords, such as the Paris Agreement on climate change, and has questioned whether the United States is abandoning its global leadership role.

Canadian officials have been particularly frustrated by the Trump Administration's approach to renegotiating NAFTA and other trade disputes, such as the Administration's decision to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. U.S. policy shifts also have affected the opinions of Canadian citizens, 76% of whom disapproved of the \"job performance of the leadership of the United States\" in 2017.

Harper and the Conservatives campaigned on their management of the economy following the 2008 financial crisis and their enactment of antiterrorism legislation following the 2014 Parliament Hill shootings. Many of Harper's initiatives were controversial outside of his political base, however, and the contraction of the Canadian economy during the first half of 2015 as a result of the decline in the price of oil further eroded support for the Conservatives.", "Given fatigue with Harper and unease about the economy, many voters reportedly based their decision on which party had the best chance to defeat the Conservatives.

Most prominently, they pledged that the 2015 election would be the last to be conducted under the first-past-the-post electoral system. Although Trudeau established an all-party committee to examine the issue, he abandoned the electoral reform effort in early 2017. The Liberals have followed through on other changes to the political system, including the establishment of a nonpartisan, merit-based process to advise the prime minister on appointments to the Canadian Senate. The change was intended to transform the upper house, which had faced a series of ethics scandals, into a more reputable and collaborative body. Some observers have warned, however, that the growing independence of the unelected Senate could thwart the democratic process. ", "On a number of other issues, the Liberals' attempts to balance competing policy priorities appear to have taken a toll on the party's support. For example, Trudeau has worked with Canada's provinces and territories to develop a national climate change plan that imposes a price on carbon emissions while also supporting the construction of new pipelines intended to link Canada's oil sands to overseas markets (see \" Climate Change \" and \" Energy \"). The Liberals' approach has drawn criticism from Canadian energy producers and other businesses as well as environmentalists and indigenous groups. In the coming months, the Liberals are expected to enact measures to legalize cannabis consumption and amend Canada's antiterrorism legal framework to clarify and expand agencies' authorities, increase transparency and oversight, and enhance civil liberties protections. Although the Liberals have carried out extensive consultations regarding the proposed changes, the tradeoffs involved could disappoint some Canadians who supported the party in the last election.", "Trudeau enjoyed high levels of public support during his first year in office, but his approval rating has declined substantially since early 2017, averaging about 41% in recent polls. In addition to the policy disagreements discussed above, a series of Liberal Party ethics scandals appear to have tarnished Trudeau's image as someone who would bring a fresh approach to politics. In December 2017, for example, Canada's Ethics Commissioner ruled that Trudeau had contravened the country's Conflict of Interest Act by accepting two paid family vacations from a wealthy philanthropist whose foundation had received funding from the Canadian government. Trudeau also has begun to face more scrutiny from the political opposition. The Conservative Party elected Andrew Scheer, a 39-year-old Member of Parliament from Saskatchewan, as its new leader in May 2017, and the NDP elected Jagmeet Singh, a 39-year-old former Member of Ontario's Provincial Parliament, as its new leader in October 2017.

Realizing this course was unsustainable, the Liberal government of then-Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien and his Finance Minister Paul Martin embarked on a financial austerity plan in 1995 using such politically risky measures as cutting federal funding for health and education transfers, applying a means test to those eligible for Seniors Benefits, and cuts in defense. Modest tax increases were also employed, mostly through closing loopholes. Under this budget discipline, the government submitted a balanced budget in 1998 and a political consensus emerged not to resort to deficit spending. However, in the face of the global financial crisis in 2009, the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper introduced a budget package of stimulus spending and tax cuts, producing a fiscal deficit for the first time in a decade.", "From 2009 to 2015, the Conservative government ran deficits; the deficit reached 5% of GDP in 2010, but through austerity and improved economic conditions was steadily whittled down to 1.9% of GDP by 2015.

The second phase is to include broad measures to reduce urban congestion, expand trade corridors, and launch a low-carbon national energy system. It provided additional funds for indigenous communities, a consolidation of child and family tax benefits, new cultural and arts funding, and a \"revitalization\" of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Funds will also be available to finance an \"innovation agenda,\" including increased fundamental research and a \"Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund\" to promote on-campus research, commercialization opportunities, and training facilities for the nation's universities. As noted above, the government is funding these measures through additional deficits estimated by the government to be C$113.2 billion through FY2021, using a relatively conservative 0.4% annual growth estimate. It also seeks to offset some of this increased spending through a 4% increase in the top tax rate (from 29% to 33%) and a reduction in the annual tax-free savings account (TFSA) contribution from C$10,000 to C$5,500.

The two countries were leaders in the creation of the open, rules-based multilateral trading system characterized by mutual concessions on market access for goods and services, disciplines on trade restrictions and binding dispute settlement mechanisms. Both countries were founding members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the genesis of the postwar multilateral trading system, and in 1994 were founding members of the World Trade Organization.

Two-way trade with the United States represented nearly 32% of Canadian GDP that year.", "U.S.-Canada trade relations have taken on a different tone during the Trump Administration. Whether it has been the reemergence of old irritants such as trade in softwood lumber and dairy restrictions, new disputes such as commercial aviation, or the contentious NAFTA negotiations, the commercial relationship between the two nations is facing new challenges.

Initially, much of the discussion revolved around revising and modernizing the nearly 25-year-old accord.

The Administration has also tabled some proposals that are considered unacceptable or unworkable by Canada and Mexico and have become sticking points in the negotiations. The overall gist of U.S. proposals appears to be aimed at reducing the bilateral trade deficits with Canada and Mexico and returning manufacturing jobs to the United States. If those goals are not achievable, they may be used as a pretense to withdraw from the talks. Economists, in general, contend that trade deficits and job creation are more a function of macroeconomic conditions and not of free trade agreements (FTAs). On most issues, the negotiating dynamic generally has pitted the United States against Canada and Mexico, which are more interested in modernizing the agreement and oppose proposals that would restrict trade.", "President Trump reportedly also favors negotiating separate deals with Canada and Mexico. On June 5, 2018, Larry Kudlow, an economic adviser to the President, restated the President's support for negotiating bilateral deals. According to Kudlow, \"When you have to compromise with a whole bunch of countries, you get the worst of the deals. Why not get the best? ... Canada is a whole lot different from Mexico.\" In the past, Canada and Mexico have opposed negotiating separate agreements.", "Sunset Clause. The United States has proposed that a revised NAFTA expire after five years, unless affirmed by all parties. According to the Administration, this would ensure that the agreement would continue to work for all parties. This proposal is opposed by Canada and Mexico, which claim that it would adversely affect investor confidence and long-term investment in the region. On May 31, 2018, Prime Minister Trudeau stated that Vice President Pence told him that the sunset clause was a precondition for a possible summit to conclude a deal. Trudeau reportedly told Pence that \"there was no possibility of any Canadian prime minister signing a NAFTA deal that included a five-year sunset clause.\"", "Rules of Origin (ROO). Automotive rules of origin have become a major sticking point in the negotiations. ROOs play an important part in determining the supply chain for a product, and, over the years, NAFTA has created an integrated North American supply chain for vehicles. The United States originally proposed to increase to 85% the current rules of origin of 62.5% for cars, light trucks, engines, and transmissions, and to 60% for parts, and to introduce a 50% U.S. domestic content requirement. The latter has been a point of contention with Canada and Mexico since NAFTA does not distinguish between U.S. and North American content. U.S. auto companies fear that these additional content requirements threaten to disrupt their supply chains. The United States reportedly has scaled back its original proposal now to require 75% regional content on NAFTA cars, and a three-tiered ROO on components of 75% for critical components such as engines and transmissions, and 70% and 65% for other components. The United States reportedly also replaced its domestic content proposal with a content demand tied to wages; 40% of a car and 45% of a truck would be made by workers making $16 an hour. In addition, the U.S. proposal would require 70% of a vehicle to be manufactured with North American steel and aluminum. Mexico has thus far rejected tying wages to ROO levels. Canada has not publicly commented, but the proposal has been seen in some quarters as a way of attracting Canadian support, as Canadian auto wages are comparable with those of the United States and Canada may stand to gain from the proposal.", "Government Procurement. The Trump Administration has promoted \"Buy American, Hire American\" policies and seeks greater restrictions on the ability of Canadian and Mexican firms to access the U.S. procurement market. The U.S. proposal reportedly would cap procurement access to the U.S. market at the dollar value of procurement access available in Canada and Mexico. Given that the procurement markets in Canada and Mexico are substantially smaller than that of the United States, this proposal, in effect, would reduce the amount of procurement available to be bid on by Canadian and Mexican firms. The United States is also seeking to exclude state and local government procurement from NAFTA, as it did in the TPP. Meanwhile, Canada has been dissatisfied with the application of Buy American policies, especially their exclusion from so-called \"pass-through\" government procurements\u2014state-tendered contracts using federal funds. It seeks greater procurement opportunities, claiming that the integrated cross-border supply chain that NAFTA has created would be negatively affected by additional buy-local policies.

The United States is seeking to disband the binational dispute settlement mechanism that provides disciplines for settling disputes arising from a NAFTA party's statutory amendment of its antidumping (AD) or countervailing duty (CVD) laws, or as a result of a NAFTA party's AD or CVD final determination on the goods of an exporting NAFTA party. Chapter 19 provides for binational panel review of final determinations in AD/CVD investigations conducted by NAFTA parties in lieu of judicial review in domestic courts. This provision was placed in NAFTA at Canada's insistence, and Canada reportedly considers removing it a red line.", "Dairy . Canada administers a restrictive supply management system for dairy, poultry, and eggs, a program that was specifically excluded from NAFTA (see box below). The Trump Administration seeks to have Canada dismantle the system, while Canada has pledged to uphold the system. Previous agreements Canada has entered into, such as the TPP, have allowed for greater market access without dismantling the system. For its part, Canada maintains that any discussion on supply management should include U.S. dairy subsidies as well. U.S. dairy producers are also concerned about restrictions on exports of ultra-filtered milk. This high-protein product, not developed at the time of NAFTA, and with no tariff line attached to it, has been one of the only dairy products freely exported into Canada. However, a new Canadian ingredient pricing strategy has imperiled that access by incentivizing Canadian dairy product processors to use domestic ingredients over imported. ", "Investment. The Trump Administration reportedly favors scrapping the controversial investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism in the investment chapter of the agreement. NAFTA was the first U.S. FTA to include an investment chapter, modeled after U.S. bilateral investment treaties. ISDS is a form of binding arbitration that allows private investors to pursue claims against sovereign nations for alleged violations of the investment provisions in trade agreements. The United States reportedly has proposed to make ISDS an opt-in, opt-out system, with each party determining whether to accept cases from the other. The United States reportedly also has proposed to limit eligibility to claims involving direct expropriation. Complainants could no longer seek arbitration for indirect expropriation\u2014enactment of laws or regulations that compromise the value of the investment. ", "Given the reported U.S. desire to opt out of ISDS, Canadian negotiators reportedly have proposed to eliminate ISDS provisions altogether or to maintain them only with Mexico if the United States opts out. The U.S. business community strongly opposes U.S. proposals to scale back or eliminate the ISDS provisions, while U.S. labor and civil society groups have welcomed the Administration's more skeptical approach to ISDS. United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert E. Lighthizer reportedly maintains that ISDS incentivizes outsourcing. The 2015 TPA called for \"providing meaningful procedures for resolving investment disputes,\" which may affect congressional consideration of an agreement. In a March 20, 2018, letter to USTR Lighthizer, over 100 Members of Congress \"insist that ISDS provisions at least as strong as those contained in the existing NAFTA must be included in a modernized agreement to win Congressional support.\" Other Members of Congress who oppose ISDS presumably would welcome the move.

The provinces allocate timber to producers under long-term tenure agreements, and charge a \"stumpage fee,\" which U.S. producers maintain is not determined by market forces, but rather acts as a subsidy to promote the Canadian industry, sectoral employment, or regional development.

As part of a complicated formula, the United States allowed unlimited imports of Canadian timber when market prices remained above a specified level; when prices fell below that level, Canada imposed export taxes and/or quotas. In addition, the United States returned to Canada a large majority of the duties it had collected from previous trade remedy cases.", "The current dispute (Lumber V) started when the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) expired. After a year-long grace period, a coalition of U.S. lumber producers filed trade remedy petitions on November 25, 2016, which claimed that Canadian firms dump lumber in the U.S. market and that Canadian provincial forestry policies subsidize Canadian lumber production. These petitions subsequently were accepted by the two agencies that administer the trade remedy process: the International Trade Commission (ITC) and the International Trade Administration (ITA). ", "On December 7, 2017, the ITC determined that imports of softwood lumber, previously determined to be dumped and subsidized by ITA, caused material injury to U.S. producers. This means that ITA's final duties in the antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) proceedings, announced on November 2, 2017, can be imposed on affected Canadian lumber. ITA found subsidization of the Canadian industry and determined a subsidy margin of 3.34%-18.19% on Canadian lumber, depending on the firm. ITA found dumping margins of 3.20% to 8.89%, also firm dependent. The AD and CVD duties were imposed on January 3, 2018.

British Columbia has sought a court reference to its Supreme Court of Appeal for a clarification of its legal ability to restrict transportation of oil sands through the province. The Alberta government, in turn, has voted to enact legislation to permit the government to create a licensing system to regulate the export of natural resources through pipeline, truck, or rail.

A core element of the framework is for each province to price carbon emissions by 2018, either through a fee on carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions, an emissions cap-and-trade system, or a hybrid approach of the two. Under the PCF, the carbon price of pollution is to start at a minimum of C$10 (about $7.70) per ton this year (2018), and rise to C$50 (about $38) per ton in 2022. If a province does not place a price on carbon, the federal government will impose a backstop carbon price and return any revenue to the province.
