However, in response to a trade dispute with Brazil, the 2014 farm bill permanently removed upland cotton from eligibility for the ARC and PLC programs. Instead, the remaining cotton-specific support programs were supplemented by offering the U.S. cotton sector new transitional payments and, in 2015, a new shallow-loss revenue insurance product: the Stacked Income Protection Program (STAX).", "Since early 2014, U.S. cotton producers have been largely unsatisfied with their economic situation due to falling cotton prices and the perceived lack of revenue support offered under STAX. In early 2015, the U.S. cotton sector began advocating to be made eligible for payments under the ARC and PLC programs. Several Members of the House Agriculture Committee (including both its chairman and ranking member) were supportive of this effort and actively sought a legislative opportunity to reintegrate either cottonseed or seed cotton\u2014the harvested but un-ginned cotton boll that includes both lint and cottonseed\u2014back into the revenue support programs in the 2014 farm bill.

In particular, in 2002, Brazil\u2014a major cotton export competitor\u2014initiated a long-running WTO dispute settlement case against U.S. cotton support programs. Brazil charged that these programs were depressing international cotton prices and thus artificially and unfairly reducing the quantity and value of Brazil's cotton exports, causing economic harm to its cotton sector. In 2004, a WTO panel ruled against the United States in the cotton case. As a result of the ruling and the potential for WTO-sanctioned retaliation, the United States made several policy changes\u2014including both legislative action and administrative adjustments\u2014in an attempt to bring the related cotton support programs into WTO compliance. Despite these efforts, Brazil successfully argued that the United States had failed to fully comply with the WTO panel's ruling.

The decoupled payment feature was added in earlier farm bills to comply with WTO rules governing domestic support programs. Instead, payments are made on historical program acres (known as base acres) for a select list of program crops referred to as covered commodities.

The MAL program provides both a floor price and interim financing for so-called loan commodities. A participating producer may put a harvested \"loan\" crop under a nine-month, nonrecourse loan valued at a statutory commodity loan rate. The loan uses the crop as collateral, and the loan rate, in effect, establishes a price guarantee. Special benefits are available if the adjusted world price\u2014announced weekly by USDA\u2014falls below the cotton loan rate. The 2014 farm bill changed the loan rate for upland cotton from $0.52 per pound to the simple average of the adjusted prevailing world price for the immediately preceding two market years but not less than $0.45 per pound or more than $0.52 per pound. During the first two years of the 2014 farm bill, cotton producers received $700 million in payments under the MAL program\u2014$372 million in 2014 and $328 million in 2015. More recent data are not yet available. CTAP . The 2014 farm bill also established CTAP as an offset for the loss of ARC and PLC program eligibility. Upland cotton producers were eligible for CTAP payments on a percentage of former cotton base acres for crop years 2014 and 2015\u201460% of base received payments in 2014, 36.5% of base in 2015. CTAP outlays were a combined $484 million during 2014 and 2015. Transition payments ended after the 2015 crop. CGCS . In 2016, USDA used its administrative authority under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act to offer U.S. upland cotton producers CGCS payments valued at $328 million. The CGCS program provided cost-share payments for cotton producers' cotton ginning costs based on their 2015 cotton plantings multiplied by 40% of average regional ginning costs. The CGCS program was offered again in 2018 with similar payment terms but at a reduced 20% share of average regional ginning costs based on their 2016 cotton plantings. This second round is projected to result in $227 million in CGCS payments in 2018. Economic Adjustment Assistance for Domestic Users ( EAAU ) Program ( P.L. 113-79 , \u00a71207(c)). EAAU payments are made to domestic users for all documented use of upland cotton on a monthly basis regardless of the origin of the upland cotton. The payment rate is $0.03 per pound and results in CCC outlays of about $49 million per year. Although the payments are made to cotton users, at least a portion of the payment is likely returned to producers in the form of higher prices associated with the increased demand from domestic users. Cotton Storage Cost Reimbursements. Under Section 1204(g) of the 2014 farm bill, USDA cotton storage subsidies are available to U.S. cotton producers whose cotton production is being held under the MAL program. STAX . STAX was offered as a shallow-loss, area-wide revenue insurance product that could indemnify losses in county revenue of greater than 10% of expected revenue depending on the coverage level selected by a producer. To encourage participation, USDA pays 80% of the policy premium for STAX. In contrast to the revenue guarantees available under ARC and PLC, which have a statutorily fixed lower price bound (equal to the PLC reference price), the revenue guarantee under STAX is recalculated each year and has decreased significantly following several years of cotton market declines since 2014. As a result, participation in STAX has been low and has declined each year that it has been available (29.3% in 2015, 25.3% in 2016, and 23.3% in 2017)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Industry Push for Cotton Reintegration into ARC/PLC Programs", "paragraphs": ["Economic conditions in the U.S. farm economy steadily declined from mid-2014 into 2018, including both lower farm commodity prices and income.

However, cotton producers could only indirectly benefit via coupled ARC and PLC payments made to program crops planted on generic base acres. Meanwhile, net indemnity payments (indemnities minus producer-paid premium) under the new cotton revenue insurance program, STAX, were relatively small at $20.2 million in 2015 and $37.3 million in 2016, and they turned negative (i.e., premiums paid exceeded indemnities received) at -$26.1 million in 2017. The National Cotton Council (NCC), in 2014, claim ed that lower per-acre cotton revenues coincided with elevated costs of production and that additional economic relief was needed. The U.S. cotton sector was also concerned about having resources redirected to other program crops planted on generic base. In response to its exclusion from PLC program eligibility, the U.S. cotton sector actively sought to regain cotton's former status as a \"covered commodity\" but on the basis of cottonseed rather than cotton lint.

", "In response, Vilsack contend ed that he did not have such authority because Congress had explicitly removed cotton from the list of eligible \"covered commodities\" and given it two special programs\u2014STAX and CTAP, although CTAP expired in 2015. Furthermore, Vilsack argue d that Congress could amend the farm bill to explicitly allow upland cotton producers to participate in ARC or PLC, or, alternatively, it could remove a provision that has appeared since FY2012 in annual appropriations acts (e.g., \u00a7715 of P.L. 115-31 , the FY2017 agriculture appropriation) that effectively prohibits USDA from providing emergency assistance through the CCC."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Seed Cotton as Program Crop: Legislative Evolution", "paragraphs": ["Cotton's proponents then determined that the path forward would be through an act of Congress.

House negotiators identified two potential budget offsets for the cottonseed proposal: (1) declaring producers who participate in the cottonseed ARC or PLC program ineligible for STAX and (2) reallocating generic acres back to cottonseed base and away from other program crops. During the first three years of the 2014 farm bill, over $1 billion in ARC and PLC payments had been made to crops planted on generic base ( Table 1 ).
