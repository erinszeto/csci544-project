The National Cemetery Administration's (NCA) responsibilities include maintaining national veterans cemeteries.", "VHA operates the nation's largest integrated health care system. Unlike most other federal health programs, VHA is a direct service provider rather than a health insurer or payer for health care. VA health care services are generally available to all honorably discharged veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces who are enrolled in VA's health care system. VA has a priority enrollment system that places veterans in priority groups based on various criteria. Under the priority system, VA decides each year whether its appropriations are adequate to serve all enrolled veterans. If not, VA could stop enrolling those in the lowest-priority groups.", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. Armed Forces have been deployed in two major theaters of operation. Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) constitute the largest sustained ground combat mission undertaken by the United States since the Vietnam War. Veterans from these conflicts and from previous wars are exerting tremendous stress on the VA health care system. With increased patient workload and rising health care costs, the 110th Congress is focused on such issues as how to contain costs and at the same time maintain high-quality health care services to veterans who need them. Among other things, Congress may address the best method of funding for veterans' health care, while continuing to focus on ensuring a \"seamless transition\" process for servicemembers moving from the military health system into the VA health care system, improving mental health care services for veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and improving rehabilitation and mental health services for those with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI).", "In recent years, VA has made an effort to realign its capital assets, primarily its buildings, to better serve veterans' needs. VA established the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) initiative to identify how well the geographic distribution of VA health care resources matches the projected needs of veterans. Given the tremendous interest in the implementation of the CARES initiative in the previous Congress, the 110th Congress will likely continue to monitor the CARES implementation. H.R. 327 was enacted into law (P.L. 110-110) on November 5. The House has passed several measures to improve and expand health care services to veterans: H.R. 327, H.R. 612, H.R. 1315, H.R. 1470, H.R. 2199, H.R. 2623, and H.R. 2874.

The report's primary focus is on veterans and not military retirees . While any person who has served in the armed forces of the United States is regarded as a veteran, a military retiree is someone who has generally completed a full active duty military career (almost always at least 20 years of service), or who is disabled in the line of military duty and meets certain length of service and extent of disability criteria, and who is eligible for retired pay and a broad range of nonmonetary benefits from the Department of Defense (DOD) after retirement. A veteran is someone who has served in the armed forces (in most, but not all, cases for a few years in early adulthood), but may not have either sufficient service or disability to be entitled to post-service retired pay and nonmonetary benefits from DOD. Generally, all military retirees are veterans, but not all veterans are military retirees. For the purposes of veterans' benefits, a veteran is defined as a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable.", "Currently, there are two health care systems that care for servicemembers and veterans. The Defense Health Program (DHP) in the DOD provides for worldwide medical and dental services to active duty military personnel, and other eligible beneficiaries. Once they are discharged from their respective service branches, servicemembers become eligible for care and treatment provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Prior to discussing major health care issues, this report provides a brief overview of the VA, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) within the VA which oversees the largest integrated health care system in the country, and the veteran population it serves. To provide context to the issues discussed in the second part of this report, a basic overview of eligibility for health care under the veterans health care system is presented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Background", "paragraphs": ["Beginning with the early colonial settlements of America, the nation has provided benefits in varying degrees to those who have worn the uniform and suffered physical disabilities in service to the nation. For instance, in 1718, the colony of Rhode Island enacted legislation that provided benefits not only to every officer, soldier or sailor who served in the colony's armed services, but also to the wives, children, parents, and other relations who had been dependent upon a slain servicemember. \"The physically disabled were to have their wound carefully tended and healed at the colony's expense, while at the same time an annual pension was provided to him out of the general treasury sufficient for the maintenance of himself and family, or other dependent relatives.\"", "While pension and disability benefits provided to veterans were gradually increased and in some cases decreased since the early colonial period, hospital and medical care for veterans on a level similar to the care provided today was not available until World War I. The VA health care system has evolved and expanded since World War I. Congress has enlarged the scope of the VA's health care mission, and has enacted legislation requiring the establishment of new programs and services. Through numerous laws, some narrowly focused, and others more comprehensive, Congress has also extended to additional categories of veterans eligibility for the many levels of care the VA now provides. No longer a health care system focused only on service-connected veterans, the VA has become a \"safety net\" for the many lower-income veterans who have come to depend upon it. Furthermore, with the fragmented private-sector health care system, the lack of universal access to health care services, and the growing number of people joining the ranks of the uninsured, many veterans\u2014even some with private health insurance\u2014have chosen to receive care through the VA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)", "paragraphs": ["The history of the present-day VA can be traced back to July 21, 1930, when President Hoover issued Executive Order 5398, creating an independent federal agency known as the Veterans Administration by consolidating many separate veterans' programs.

VA carries out its veterans' programs nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for veterans' health care programs. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is responsible for compensation, pension, vocational rehabilitation, education assistance, home loan guaranty and insurance among other things.

VA's health care system is organized into 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) (see Figure 1 ). While policies and guidelines are developed at VA headquarters and applied throughout the VA health care system, management authority for basic decision making and budgetary responsibilities are delegated to the VISNs. Congressionally appropriated medical care funds are allocated to the VISNs based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system, which generally bases funding on patient workload. Prior to the implementation of the VERA system, resources were allocated to facilities primarily on the basis of their historical expenditures. Unlike Medicare, which administers medical care through the private sector, the VA provides care directly to veterans.", "In FY2007, VHA operated 155 medical centers, 135 nursing homes, 717 ambulatory care and community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), 45 residential rehabilitation treatment programs, and 209 Vet Centers (generally these are community-based, non-medical facilities that offer counseling services). VHA also pays for care provided to veterans by independent providers and practitioners on a fee basis under certain circumstances. Inpatient and outpatient care is provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). In addition, VHA provides grants for construction of state-owned nursing homes and domiciliary facilities, and collaborates with the Department of Defense (DOD) in sharing health care resources and services. Today, VHA has been commended by peer reviewed journals and independent studies as an outstanding health care system whose \"performance now surpasses that of other health systems on standardized quality measures.\" The journal Neurology in its November 2006 issue noted that \"The VA has achieved remarkable improvements in patient care and health outcomes, and is a cost-effective and efficient organization. Its enrollees are provided comprehensive coverage ... and the system is especially suited to manage chronic disease.\" In 2005, Health Care Papers dedicated a complete issue to examining the transformation of VHA, and the lessons that could be learned by other countries struggling to use their healthcare resources appropriately.

Since 1985, VHA has had an automated information system with extensive clinical and administrative capabilities which supports ambulatory, inpatient, and long-term care. VistA is the single, integrated health information system used throughout VA in all health care settings. VistA applications are comprised of three types of packages: the clinical package, the administration and financial package, and the infrastructure package. The clinical package includes applications such as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). In addition to CPRS, VistA includes VistA Imaging and Bar-Code Medication Administration.", "The CPRS is a single integrated system for VA health care providers. All aspects of a patient's medical record are integrated, including active problems, allergies, current medications, laboratory results, vital signs, hospitalizations and outpatient clinic history, alerts of abnormal results, among other things. It is used in about 1,300 VHA facilities around the country. CPRS also incorporates data from scheduling, laboratory, radiology, consults and clinic notes into a single integrated patient record. Remote data view allows clinicians to see health data from any other VA facility where the veteran has received care. Also as a complement to CPRS, VistA includes VistA Imaging. This application provides a multimedia, online patient record that integrates traditional medical chart information with medical images including X-rays, pathology slides, video views, scanned documents, and cardiology exam results, among other images.", "The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) is an application that validates the administration of medications, including intravenous medications, in real time for inpatients in all VA medical centers. This ensures that the patient receives the correct medication, at the correct dosage and at the right time. BCMA also provides visual alerts. For instance, if the software detects a potential medical error, it alerts the nurse administering the medication. These alerts require the nurse to review and correct the reason for the alert before actually administering the drug to the patient. The overall cost of maintaining the VistA system is $87 per patient annually.", "In 2006, Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government awarded the VA the Innovations in American Government Award for its electronic health records system. In presenting this award the Kennedy School stated that", "VistA saves lives and ensures continuity of care even under the most extreme circumstances. Many of the thousands of residents who fled the Gulf Coast because of Hurricane Katrina left behind vital health records. Records for the 40,000 veterans in the area were almost immediately available to clinicians across the country, even though the VA Medical Center in Gulfport, Mississippi, was destroyed and New Orleans VA Medical Center was closed and evacuated.

According to the VA, the total veteran population is expected to decline to 21.7 million by 2011, and 18.1 million by 2020. VA attributes this decline to the number of veteran deaths exceeding the number of new separations from the military. The largest population of veterans are living in California, followed by Florida and Texas ( Figure 2 ). In FY2005 there were approximately 7.7 million veterans enrolled in the VA health care system ( Figure 3 ). Most VISNs showed enrollments between 26%-30% of the total eligible veteran population in those VISNs; two VISNs (VISN 5 and VISN 11) showed enrollments below 25%. The total number of veterans enrolled in VA's health care system is estimated to increase to almost 8.0 million veterans in FY2008. It should be noted that in any given year not all veterans seek care from VA, either because they are not ill or because they have other sources of care such as private health insurance.", "In FY2005, VHA provided care to approximately 4.9 million unique patients. The greatest number of patients were in VISNs 4, 8 and 16. Each of these VISNs had more than 265,000 patients ( Figure 4 ). The overall patient population reflects where the total veteran population is the largest. During FY2007, VHA provided health care to about 5.2 million unique veteran patients. These patients generated 64.4 million outpatients visits and almost 800,000 inpatient episodes of care. According to VHA estimates, the number of unique veteran patients is estimated to increase by approximately 109,000 between FY2007 and FY2008.

These veterans are generally known as \"higher priority\" or \"core\" veterans. The other category of veterans are those with no service-connected disabilities and with attributable incomes above an established \"means test.\"", "P.L. 104-262 also authorized VA to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care.

At the same time, it would vest discretion in the Secretary to determine the manner in which such enrollment system would operate.", "Furthermore, P.L. 104-262 was clear in its intent that the provision of health care to veterans was dependent upon the available resources. The Committee report accompanying P.L. 104-262 states that the provision of hospital care and medical services would be provided to \"the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts for these purposes.

Under current law, VA programs are funded through both mandatory and discretionary spending authorities. The following programs are among mandatory spending programs: cash benefit programs, that is, compensation and pensions (and benefits for eligible survivors); readjustment benefits (education and training, special assistance for disabled veterans); home loan guarantees; and veterans' insurance and indemnities. Each of these programs is an appropriated entitlement that is funded through annual appropriations. With any entitlement program, because of the underlying law, the government is required to provide eligible recipients with the benefits to which they are entitled, whatever the cost. Congress is obliged to appropriate the money necessary to fund the obligation. If the amount Congress provides in the annual appropriations act is not enough, it is obliged to make up the difference in a supplemental appropriation. Like other entitlement programs, spending automatically increases or decreases over time as the number of recipients eligible for benefits varies. Certain of these VA entitlement benefits are indexed for inflation; the benefit amount will increase automatically based on the measured increase in the cost-of-living adjustment.", "The remaining VA programs, primarily health care, medical facility construction, medical research, and VA administration, are funded through annual discretionary appropriations. Each year, Congress takes up the matter of providing budget authority for discretionary programs. As such, the amount of funds VHA can spend on discretionary programs is determined by the amount of its appropriation.", "Generally, the mandatory funding proposals that have been suggested by veterans' advocates are based on a formula that takes into account the number of enrolled and nonenrolled veterans eligible for VA medical care, and the rate of medical care inflation. Proponents believe that mandatory funding will eliminate the year-to-year uncertainty about funding levels and close the gap between funding and demand for veterans' health care. Opponents believe that with these proposals spending for VHA will increase significantly as enrollment in the VA health care system soars; in most of the proposed funding formulas, automatic funding increases are primarily based on enrollment figures. Furthermore, critics believe that a static funding formula cannot adequately take into consideration the changing needs of veterans, which could affect the funding level necessary to provide a different mix of services, and that Congress is better able to evaluate the funding needs through the current annual appropriation process. For instance, not all enrolled veterans use the VA health care system in a given year. Should the number of users grow in one year and the number of enrollees remain stagnant, no additional funding would be available for the additional patients with increased utilization of health care services.", "During a hearing in the 109 th Congress, Chairman Buyer of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee stated that \"[a]ccording to the Congressional Budget Office [CBO], mandatory funding would cost nearly half-a-trillion dollars over ten years. That would be a costly experiment. In contrast, the strong discretionary budgets of the past decade have proven responsive to change\" However, CBO stated that \"although the bill would primarily affect funding for health care services provided by VHA, it also would result in some savings in direct spending for other government programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid.\"", "As highlighted by some budget analysts, changing veterans' medical care into a mandatory budget authority may not solve the issue of closing the gap between funding and demand for veterans' health care. Congress can place caps on spending for mandatory programs through budget reconciliation language, which would limit spending on veterans' health programs. Since Congress can act to change the formula or cap the spending amounts, the issue of uncertainty in funding amounts may not be resolved either. In recent testimony before the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Henry J.

The DNCP, among other things, recommended that seven VA health care facilities be closed and duplicative clinical and administrative services delivered at over 30 other VHA facilities be eliminated. The sites slated to be closed were in: Canandaigua, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Highland Drive Division); Lexington, Kentucky (Leestown Division); Cleveland, Ohio (Brecksville Unit); Gulfport, Mississippi; Waco, Texas; and Livermore, California. Patients currently provided services at these VHA facilities would be provided care at other nearby sites. The DNCP recommended that new major medical facilities be built in Las Vegas, Nevada, and in East Central Florida. Furthermore, the DNCP recommended significant infrastructure upgrades at numerous sites, including at or near locations where VA proposed to close facilities. In addition, the draft plan called for the establishment of 48 new high-priority CBOCs.", "Following the release of the DNCP, the VA Secretary appointed a 16-member independent commission to study the draft plan. The commission was composed of individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds outside of the federal government. The CARES Commission developed and applied six factors in the review of each proposal in the DNCP: (1) impact on veterans' access to health care; (2) impact on health care quality; (3) veteran and stakeholder views; (4) economic impact on the community; (5) impact on VA missions and goals; and (6) cost to the government. The commission conducted 38 public hearings and 81 site visits throughout 2003, and submitted its recommendations to the Secretary in February 2004. After reviewing the recommendations, the Secretary announced the final details of the CARES plan in May 2004 (Secretary's CARES Decision). Table 5 provides a time-line of major activities under the CARES process.", "The final plan included consolidating the following facilities: (1) Highland Drive campus in Pennsylvania with University Drive and Heinz campuses in Pennsylvania; (2) Brecksville campus in Ohio with Wade Park campus in Cleveland, Ohio; and (3) Gulfport campus with Biloxi campus in Mississippi. The following facilities were to be partially realigned: (1) Knoxville campus in Iowa; (2) Canandaigua campus in New York; (3) Dublin campus in Georgia; (4) Livermore campus in California; (5) Montrose campus in New York; (6) Butler campus in Pennsylvania; (7) Saginaw campus in Michigan; (8) Ft. Wayne campus in Indiana; and (9) Kerrville campus in Texas.", "The final plan also called for building new hospitals in Orlando and Las Vegas; adding 156 new CBOCs, four new spinal cord injury centers, and two blind rehabilitation centers; and expanding mental health outpatient services nationwide. By opening health care access to more veterans, VA expects to increase the percentage of enrolled veterans from 28% of the veterans' population today, to 30% in 2012 and 33% in 2022. This percentage increase can be attributed in part to a projected decline in the overall veteran population. Nationally, the number of veteran enrollees is projected to increase 6% by 2012 and decrease 5% by 2022 from the number of veteran enrollees reported in 2001. VA asserts that the CARES plan will reduce the cost of maintaining vacant space over the period 2006 to 2022 from an estimated $3.4 billion to $750 million and allow VA to redirect those funds to patient care.", "Critics of the CARES plan contend that closures are being considered without assessing what kind of facilities will be needed for long-term care and mental health care in the future. For instance, at the time of the release of the DNCP, projections for outpatient and acute psychiatric inpatient care contained data inconsistencies on future needs. VA asserted that it would improve its forecasting models to ensure that projections adequately reflect future need. Also, some believe that the CARES plan does not focus enough on future nursing home needs, and would leave VA short of beds in a few decades. In this view, VA would not have any choice but to privatize some parts of the health care system. Moreover, some veterans' groups believe that CARES is only about closing \"surplus\" hospitals and do not believe that CARES will result in the building of new and modern facilities. Finally, the closure of some VA medical facilities raised serious concern among some Members of Congress who felt that they had little input into the CARES process.", "The Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-422 ), signed into law on November 30, 2004, required VA to notify Congress of the impact of actions that may result in a facility closure, consolidation, or administrative reorganization. The law also prohibits such actions from occurring until 60 days following the notification.", "The Secretary's CARES Decision identified implementation issues that required further study, including additional stakeholder input at selected sites. On September 29, 2004, the Secretary of VA established an Advisory Committee for CARES Business Plan Studies. The committee and its subcommittees generally consist of representatives from veterans' service organizations, governmental agencies, health care providers, planning agencies, and community organizations with a direct interest in the CARES process. This committee is to consult with stakeholders during implementation of the Secretary's CARES Decision. The committee is to ensure that the full range of stakeholder interests and concerns are assembled, publicly articulated, accurately documented, and considered in the development of site-level business plans.", "In January 2005, VA awarded a contract to PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete studies at 18 sites throughout the country during a 13-month period, as required by the Secretary's CARES Decision. Local Advisory Panels (LAPs) gathered views of stakeholders regarding the range of potential options provided by the contractor and made recommendations to the Secretary. In 2006 VA announced the Secretary's decision for some of the 18 sites. For some sites decisions have not yet been announced.", "VA has begun implementing some of the projects under the CARES decisions. Specifically, as of February 2007, VA was in the process of implementing 32 of more than 100 major capital projects that were identified in the CARES process. Given below in Table 6 is a summary of the final decisions announced thus far."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary Travel Program", "paragraphs": ["In general, the beneficiary travel program reimburses certain veterans for the cost of travel to VA medical facilities when seeking health care. P.L. 76-432, passed by Congress on March 14, 1940, mandated VA to pay either the actual travel expenses, or an allowance based upon the mileage traveled by any veteran traveling to and from a VA facility or other place for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care. P.L. 85-857, signed into law on September 2, 1958, authorized VA to pay necessary travel expenses to any veteran traveling to or from a VA facility or other place in connection with vocational rehabilitation counseling or for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care. However, this law changed VA's travel reimbursement into a discretionary authority by stating that VA \"may pay\" expenses of travel.", "Due to rapidly increasing costs of the beneficiary travel program, on March 12, 1987, VA published final regulations that sharply curtailed eligibility for the beneficiary travel program. Under these regulations beneficiary travel payments to eligible veterans were paid when specialized modes of transportation, such as ambulance or wheelchair van, were medically required. In addition, payment was authorized for travel in conjunction with compensation and pension examinations, as well as travel beyond a 100-mile radius from the nearest VA medical care facility. It also authorized the VA to provide transportation costs, when necessary, to transfer any veteran from one health care facility (either a VA or contract care facility) to another in order to continue care paid for by the VA. The following transportation costs were not authorized under these regulations:", "Cost of travel by privately owned vehicle in any amount in excess of the cost of such travel by public transportation unless public transportation was not reasonably accessible or was medically inadvisable. Cost of travel in excess of the actual expense incurred by any person as certified by that person in writing. Cost of routine travel in conjunction with admission for domiciliary care, or travel for family members of veterans receiving mental health services from the VA except for such travel performed beyond a 100-mile radius from the nearest VA medical care facility.", "Travel expenses of all other veterans were not authorized unless the veterans were able to present clear and convincing evidence to show the inability to pay the cost of transportation; or except when medically-indicated ambulance transportation was claimed and an administrative determination was made regarding the veteran's ability to bear the cost of such transportation.", "The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-322 , section 108), in large part restored VA travel reimbursement benefits. It required that if VA provides any beneficiary travel reimbursement under Section 111 of Title 38 U.S.C. in any given fiscal year, then payments must be provided in that year in the case of travel for health care services for all the categories of beneficiaries specified in the statute. In order to limit the overall cost of this program, the law imposed a $3 one-way deductible applicable to all travel, except for veterans otherwise eligible for beneficiary travel reimbursement who are traveling by special modes of transportation such as ambulance, air ambulance, wheelchair van, or to receive a compensation and pension examination. In order to limit the overall impact on veterans whose clinical needs dictate frequent travel for VA medical care, an $18-per-calendar-month cap on the deductible was imposed for those veterans who are pre-approved as needing to travel on a frequent basis. At present, eligible veterans are reimbursed at the rate of 11 cents a mile for routine visits and 17 cents a mile for compensation and pension exams. Although the deductible rates are set in statute, the mileage rates are left to the discretion of the Secretary. Table 7 provides details on veterans who are currently eligible to receive travel benefits.", "With the rise in gasoline prices Congress has shown interest in changing the method of determining the mileage reimbursement rate and/or eliminating the current deductible amount.
