In September 2004, a WTO dispute settlement panel found that certain U.S. agricultural support payments and guarantees\u2014including (1) payments to cotton producers under the marketing loan and counter-cyclical programs, and (2) export credit guarantees under the GSM-102 program\u2014were inconsistent with WTO commitments. In 2005, the United States made several changes to both its cotton and GSM-102 programs in an attempt to bring them into compliance with WTO recommendations. However, Brazil argued that the U.S. response was inadequate. A WTO compliance panel ruled in favor of Brazil's non-compliance charge against the United States in December 2007, and the ruling was upheld on appeal in June 2008.", "In August 2009, a WTO arbitration panel\u2014assigned to determine the appropriate level of retaliation\u2014announced that Brazil's trade countermeasures against U.S. goods and services could include two components: (1) a fixed amount of $147.3 million in response to U.S. cotton program payments, and (2) a variable amount based on U.S. GSM-102 program spending. In response to Brazil's argument that insufficient trade in goods occurred between the two countries, the arbitrators also ruled that Brazil would be entitled to cross-retaliation if the overall retaliation amount exceeded a formula-based variable annual threshold. Cross-retaliation involves countermeasures in sectors outside of the trade in goods, most notably in the area of U.S. copyrights and patents. Based on the arbitrators' formulas, using 2008 data, Brazil announced in December 2009 that it would impose trade retaliation starting on April 6, 2010, against up to $829.3 million in U.S. goods, including $268.3 million in eligible cross-retaliatory countermeasures.", "The threat of sanctions led to intense negotiations between Brazil and the United States to find a mutual agreement and avoid the trade retaliation. In April 2010, the two parties reached a preliminary memorandum of understanding (MOU) spelling out certain actions which, if undertaken by the United States, would lead to suspension of Brazil's threatened retaliation. Then, on June 17, 2010, U.S. and Brazilian trade negotiators concluded the Framework for a Mutually Agreed Solution to the Cotton Dispute in the WTO (WT/DS267). The framework agreement\u2014which lays out a number of \"steps and discussions\"\u2014represents a path forward toward the ultimate goal of reaching a negotiated solution to the dispute, while avoiding WTO-sanctioned trade retaliation by Brazil against U.S. goods and services. As a result, Brazil has suspended trade retaliation pending U.S. compliance with the framework agreement measures. Key aspects of the framework agreement include (1) payment by the United States of a $147.3 million annual fund to a newly created \"Brazilian Cotton Institute\" to provide technical assistance and capacity-building for Brazil's cotton sector, (2) quarterly discussions on potential limits of trade-distorting U.S. cotton subsidies (recognizing that actual changes will not occur prior to the 2012 farm bill), and (3) near-term modifications to the operation of the GSM-102 program coupled with a semi-annual review of whether U.S. GSM-102 program implementation satisfies certain performance benchmarks.", "These U.S. commitments are intended to delay any trade retaliation until after the 2012 farm bill, when potential changes to U.S. cotton programs will be evaluated.

From 1991 to 2010 U.S. cash receipts from cotton production averaged $4.3 billion per year, while export sales averaged nearly $3 billion. Cotton is grown across the southern tier of states stretching from Virginia down through the Carolinas and into Georgia, then westward through a belt of contiguous states to California. Texas is the largest cotton-producing state, accounting for an average of 26% of U.S. production since 1990. In 2002, when Brazil first originated its WTO dispute settlement case against U.S. cotton programs, 17 states reported cotton production valued at over $20 million.", "The United States is the third-largest producer of cotton in the world, behind China and India, and the world's largest cotton exporter. In the 1990s, U.S. exports accounted for 25% of world trade in cotton. However, since 2000 the United States has accounted for an increasing share of world trade (averaging over 37%). U.S. exports as a share of domestic production have averaged over 70% since 2000, up from a 40% average during the early 1990s, due in large part to a decline in domestic mill use. (See Figure 1 .) The expanding U.S. prominence in global markets since 2000, coupled with large U.S. subsidy levels directed considerable international attention to U.S. cotton program outlays."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Domestic Program Support", "paragraphs": ["Cotton is one of the principal U.S. program crops, along with wheat, rice, feed grains, soybeans, and peanuts. Traditionally, qualifying U.S. cotton producers were eligible for direct payments, counter-cyclical program (CCP) payments, marketing loan benefits, Step 2 payments, and other program benefits. Since 2000, U.S. farm subsidies for cotton production have averaged $3.4 billion per year, while the harvest-time value of production has averaged $4.3 billion ( Table 1 ).", "Marketing loan program benefits and CCP payments are price-contingent in the sense that payments are determined by market prices falling below their respective price triggers (i.e., the loan rate and the adjusted target price). For upland cotton, the loan rate is set at $0.52 per pound and the target price is set at $0.71 per pound for calendar years 2010 through 2012 by the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ). The target price is adjusted by subtracting the direct payment for upland cotton of $0.0667 per pound for calculating any CCP payment.", "If the price triggers are set too far above market prices, they act as an incentive to encourage greater production (and exports) than what the market would otherwise demand. This results in lower domestic and international prices than would exist in the absence of these programs. It is this \"price effect\" that was found by the WTO to cause adverse effects and serious prejudice in the international cotton market, as described below. Indeed, a comparison of relative support prices versus market prices for major U.S. program crops reveals that cotton producers receive payments under these programs far more routinely than do other crops. This would suggest that cotton support prices are set too high relative to general cotton market conditions, as well as to other crop prices.

Typically, 98% of principal and a portion of interest are covered by a guarantee. To obtain a guarantee, an exporter has to pay a fee (or \"premium\") calculated on the basis of guaranteed value, according to a schedule of rates applicable to different credit terms and repayment intervals.

(See Table 2 .) As a result, U.S. domestic cotton support measures lost the protection afforded by the \"Peace Clause,\" which had shielded them from substantive challenges in the past.

This payment appears similar to the WTO-illegal Step 2 payment except that cotton from all origins (not just domestic sources) is eligible for the payment. Since the United States imports very little cotton, most payments would still likely go to domestically sourced cotton.

Instead, direct payments are extended with no change to the current planting restriction, except for a small pilot program on 75,000 acres in seven states (\u00a71107). This retention of the status quo has important WTO implications for the AMS case being brought against the United States by both Canada and Brazil.
