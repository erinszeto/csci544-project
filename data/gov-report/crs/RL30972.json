(4) Theyrange in size from a corner gas station to abandoned factories and mill sites. Estimates of thenumber of sites range from 500,000 to a million; (5) they are often in economically distressed areas.

In 2001, the Senate passed S. 350 ( S.Rept.107-2 ), which would provide the statutory authority for the program, $250 million per year forvarious brownfield initiatives, and relief from Superfund liability for some property owners, amongother things.", "Support for the brownfields program as it has been operating comes from a wide array ofstates and localities, environmental groups, business associations, developers, and communityactivists. Proponents argue that the program has the potential to leverage federal, state, local andprivate funds to improve the environment by addressing low-level, low-risk contamination thatotherwise might not be remediated. Once the environmental problems are remedied, the economicpotential of (previous) brownfield sites can be realized, they argue. This might include a wide rangeof economic uses, possibly creating jobs, recreational opportunities, and local tax revenues. Fromthis, there may be positive social benefits for communities negatively affected by environmentalcontamination and economic decline. ", "There are, of course, a variety of federal programs that target urban renewal, (7) and the brownfields programis designed to supplement, not duplicate them. The program itself, as it presently exists, does notaim to perform the cleanups. It generally provides grants which are to serve as catalysts to bringtogether other resources in the communities to provide the environmental cleanup component ofredevelopment efforts. Overall, the brownfields program is intended to fill a previously unmet needand to offer hope for a cleaner environment, new jobs, a stronger tax base, and economic recovery.", "Voluntary Cleanups vs. Brownfields. One waystates are dealing with contaminated sites is through voluntary cleanup programs, which had beenadopted by 44 states as of the end of 1997. These programs encourage the owners or developers towork cooperatively with the state outside of the state's enforcement-driven cleanup program, therebyavoiding some of the costs and delays associated with that approach. Cleanup standards are usuallyidentical to those the states enforce at other hazardous waste sites, according to the EnvironmentalLaw Institute (ELI). (8) Most states provide incentives for participating in the program -- most commonly some form ofliability release. Other incentives include a streamlined process, financial or tax incentives, andtechnical assistance. States created voluntary cleanup programs in the absence of federal legislationor standards, and these programs vary considerably.", "States define brownfield sites in different ways, but they usually echo EPA's definition,encompassing \"urban industrial or commercial facilities that are abandoned or underutilized due, inpart, to environmental contamination or fear of contamination.\" (9) ELI noted that a few stateshave different standards or cleanup approaches for brownfields than they do for voluntary cleanupsites. For brownfield sites, Florida provides for site-specific cleanup levels based on risk, allowinginstitutional or engineering controls instead of the state-wide remediation levels otherwise required. North Carolina allows for alternative cleanup strategies focusing on removal of exposure pathwaysat certain brownfield sites. And Mississippi did not set specific standards -- the statute requires thatrisk assessment be used. (10) The difference between brownfields and voluntary programs inthe states is often a matter of semantics. The Environmental Law Institute distinguished them thus:", "Typically, ... voluntary programs do not focuson redevelopment nor do they target urban sites specifically. Rather voluntary programs are moreoften aimed at getting simple, less contaminated sites cleaned up regardless of whether they arereused. Brownfield programs, on the other hand, are more likely to focus on redevelopment and bepart of a broader State strategy or set of social policies aimed at improving distressed urbanareas.

The authorized uses ofSuperfund monies are specified in section 111, and cleanup of brownfield sites is not among them.

The funds are used to hire contractors to identify the extent of contamination at a site when thisappears preferable to making an assessment pilot award. Targeted assessments might be used in thecase of a small town that does not intend to establish a brownfields program, for example, but doeshave a site that is ripe for renewal.

Recapture mandates that the gain realized from the value of the property when it islater sold be taxed as ordinary income (rather than at the generally lower capital gainsrate) to the extent of the expensing allowance previously claimed. In effect, the taxincentive helps to encourage development of brownfield sites by postponing a certainamount of the developer's tax liability in the early days of a project when thedeveloper is spending money to clean up the property. When the developed propertyis later sold, the deferred tax \"comes due\" by reason of the recapture provision.
