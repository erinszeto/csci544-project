Estimates from CBO on the Senate bill indicate that net reductions in Medicare direct spending would be approximately $400 billion from FY2010 to 2019. Major savings are expected from constraining Medicare's annual payment increases for certain providers, basing payment rates in the Medicare Advantage program on average bids, reducing payments to hospitals that serve a large number of low-income patients, creating an independent Medicare Advisory Board to make changes in Medicare payment rates, and modifying the high-income threshold adjustment for Part B premiums. A new Hospital Insurance tax for high wage earners would also raise approximately $87 billion over 10 years.", "Other provisions in the bill address more systemic issues such as increasing the efficiency and quality of Medicare services, and strengthening program integrity. For example, the bill would establish a national, voluntary pilot program that would bundle payments for physician, hospital and post-acute care services with the goal of improving patient care and reducing spending. Another provision would adjust payments to hospitals for readmissions related to certain potentially preventable conditions. Additionally, the bill would increase funding for anti-fraud activities, and subject providers and suppliers to enhanced screening before allowing them to participate in the Medicare program.", "The Senate bill would also improve some benefits provided to Medicare beneficiaries. For instance, Medicare prescription drug program enrollees would receive a 50% discount off the price of brand name drugs during the coverage gap (the \"doughnut hole\") and the coverage gap would be reduced by $500 in 2010.

Under current law, the market basket component of the physician update or the Medicare economic index (MEI) is adjusted to exclude productivity gains. This provision uses the same measure of productivity improvement, the 10-year moving average of all-factory productivity, which is included in the MEI.

The justification for this subsidy has changed over time. Originally, the DSH adjustment was intended to compensate hospitals for their higher Medicare costs associated with the provision of services to a large proportion of low-income patients. Now, the adjustment is considered as a way to protect access to care for Medicare beneficiaries. The bill would reduce hospitals' DSH payments starting in FY2015 equal to 25% of what otherwise be made, a payment that represents the empirically justified amount as determined by MedPAC in its March 2007 Report to Congress. Acute care hospitals would be paid additional amounts which would depend on the difference in the hospital's DSH payments under this legislation; the difference in the percentage change in the uninsured under-65 population from 2012; and the percentage of uncompensated care provided by the hospital (relative to all acute care hospitals).

Any profits are retained by the SNF, and any losses must be absorbed by the SNF. The daily base payment is based on 1995 costs that have been increased for inflation and vary by urban or rural location.

To better account for SNF stays with exceptionally high ancillary care needs, MedPAC recommends, in a June 2009 letter to the Secretary and its March 2009 Report , that the Secretary revise the PPS by separating payments for NTA from the bundled PPS rate and by establishing an outlier policy for stays with exceptionally high NTA costs. In addition, MedPAC explains that the current reimbursement system for therapy costs encourages the under provision of therapy services to patients. To improve payments for therapy, MedPAC recommends that the Secretary recalibrate the payment category for therapy costs so as to better match such payments to the actual amount of therapy services needed by patients. MedPAC also recommends that the market basket update for 2010 be eliminated.", "On another note, as Medicare beneficiaries with complex health conditions and multiple co-morbidities can experience multiple hospital readmissions, moving between hospital stays and a range of post-acute care providers, including SNFs, In addition, some policy makers, analysts, and health care practitioners consider relatively high readmission rates for persons with chronic illnesses to be a symptom of a payment system under Medicare that works less well for the management of chronically ill patients who leave the hospital and enter other care settings. MedPAC, among others, has suggested that Medicare test new incentives and payment models to encourage providers to better coordinate across patients' episodes of care and to evaluate the full spectrum of care a patient may receive during these episodes within a hospital, during a patient's discharge, and post-hospitalization.", "The provisions contained in the Senate bill would make all SNF market-basket annual updates subject to a productivity adjustment starting in FY2012.

Payments to MA plans are determined by comparing a plan's cost of providing required Medicare benefits ( bid ) to the maximum amount Medicare will pay for those benefits in each area ( benchmark ). Historically, Congress has increased the benchmark amounts through statutorily specified formulas, in part, to encourage plan participation in all areas of the country. As a result, the benchmark amounts in some areas are higher than the average cost of original fee-for-service Medicare. The bill would require the benchmark to be determined based on the weighted average of MA plan bids, rather than the statutorily determined formulas. This requirement would be phased-in starting in 2012. By 2015, MA benchmarks would only be based on a weighted average of plan bids. This change in the calculation of MA benchmarks could lead to reductions in benchmarks that in turn could result in (1) reductions in the extra benefits not otherwise covered under original Medicare, (2) increased cost sharing, or (3) increased supplemental premiums. It may also impact access to MA plans in some areas. ", "Several provisions in the bill would also increase payments to qualifying plans in qualifying areas of the country. Starting 2014, the bill would provide bonus payments for plans that provided care coordination and management activities. MA plans were required to have quality improvement programs before January 1, 2010; however, payments to MA plans are not contingent on the quality of care provided to plan enrollees. Starting in 2014, a provision would create a second bonus payment for achievement or improvement in plan quality performance. Other provisions in the bill would mitigate the reduction in extra benefits that result from competitive bidding in specified areas or for specified enrollees. Taken together, the provision to base benchmarks on the bids of MA plans (which may reduce payments to plans) and the provisions designed to increase payments are estimated to save $34.4 billion over the FY2010-2014 period and $118.1 billion over the FY2010-2019 period.", "In addition, the bill would extend the Secretary's authority to adjust payments to plans for differences in the way diagnosis coding of patients differs between MA plans and original Medicare. In general, MA plan payments are risk-adjusted to account for the variation in the cost of providing care. Risk adjustment is designed to compensate plans for the increased cost of treating older and sicker beneficiaries, and thus discourage plans from preferential enrollment of healthier individuals. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 , DRA) required the Secretary to adjust for patterns of diagnosis coding differences between MA plans and providers under parts A and B of Medicare for plan payments in 2008, 2009, and 2010. The bill would require the Secretary to conduct further analyses on the differences in coding patterns and adjust MA plan payments based on the results for 2011, 2012, and 2013.

At that time, Medicare replaced Medicaid as the primary source of drug coverage for beneficiaries covered under both programs (called dual eligibles ). Prescription drug coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans (PDPs), which offer only prescription drug coverage, or through Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA-PDs), which offer prescription drug coverage that is integrated with the health care coverage they provide to Medicare beneficiaries under Part C. Medicare's payments to plans are determined through a competitive bidding process, and enrollee premiums are tied to plan bids. Plans bear some risk for their enrollees' drug spending.", "Medicare law sets out a defined standard benefit structure under the Part D benefit. In 2010, the standard benefit includes a $310 deductible and a 25% coinsurance until the enrollee reaches $2,830 in total covered drug spending. After this initial coverage limit is reached, there is a gap in coverage in which the enrollee is responsible for the full cost of the drugs (often called the doughnut hole ) until total costs hit the catastrophic threshold, $6,440 in 2010. A major focus of the drug benefit is the enhanced coverage provided to low-income individuals who enroll in Part D. Individuals with incomes below 150% of the federal poverty limit and with limited assets are eligible for the low-income subsidy (LIS). The LIS reduces beneficiaries' out-of-pocket spending by paying for all or some of the Part D monthly premium and annual deductible, and limits drug copayments to a nominal amount.", "The Senate bill would make several changes to the Medicare Part D program that would impact beneficiary premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Specifically, the bill would increase Part D premiums for higher income enrollees; the income thresholds would be set at the same level and in the same manner as those currently used to establish Part B premiums. Additionally, during the coverage gap, consistent with a voluntary agreement with the pharmaceutical industry, Part D enrollees would be provided discounts of 50% for brand name drugs. However, the full drug price (the amount paid by the beneficiary plus the discount) would be used to calculate a beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs. Although this provision would help reduce the out-of-pocket expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries, CBO scored this provision as a 10-year cost of $17.8 billion to the federal government. This projected cost increase is, in part, based on the expectation that under this provision a larger number of enrollees would reach the catastrophic phase when Medicare bears most of the costs, and on the possibility that enrollees who switch from generic to brand name drugs to take advantage of discounts during the coverage gap may stay on the more expensive brand name drugs during the catastrophic period. ", "The bill also contains several provisions designed to improve access to and availability of LIS plans. For example, the redetermination of LIS eligibility subsequent to the death of a spouse would be postponed for a year, and cost sharing would be eliminated for individuals receiving care under a Medicaid home and community based waiver who would otherwise require care in a medical institution or a facility. The bill would also make changes to the methodology used to determine which plans are eligible to enroll low-income beneficiaries so that more plans could qualify and thus reduce the number of low-income beneficiaries who need to change plans from year to year. Additional funding would also be provided for outreach and assistance for low-income programs. The CBO cost estimate for the changes to the low-income subsidy program in the bill is $2.4 billion over 10 years.

Several provisions in the Senate bill are consistent with MedPAC recommendations to provide adequate incentives to produce appropriate, high-quality care at an efficient price. For example, a provision included in the bill would establish a national, voluntary pilot program that would bundle payments for physician and hospital as well as post-acute care services with the goal of improving patient care and reducing spending. Another provision would establish rewards for accountable care organizations that meet quality-of-care targets, and reduce costs per patient relative to a spending benchmark, with a share of the savings they achieve for the Medicare program.

CBO estimates that this provision would save $7.1 billion over FY2010-2019.

If the HI trust fund becomes insolvent, Congress would face a decision of whether to ensure the continued funding of Medicare Part A, as there is currently no statutory mechanism that would allow for general fund transfers to cover HI expenditures that exceed payroll tax income.", "Medicare Parts B and D are financed primarily through a combination of monthly premiums paid by current enrollees and general revenues. Income from these sources is credited to the SMI trust fund. Because the SMI trust fund is funded by annually-adjusted premiums and general revenue transfers, it is kept in balance and does not face depletion. Growth in SMI expenditures will, however, require significant increases in beneficiary premiums and general revenue over time. ", "In addition to provisions that would reduce annual updates to certain Medicare fee-for-service payment rates, the Senate bill contains several other provisions to address Medicare's financial challenges. For example, the bill includes a provision to establish an Independent Medicare Advisory Board to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending. Beginning in 2013, if the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (OACT) makes a determination that the projected per capita growth rate under Medicare exceeds certain spending targets in the second year following the determination, the Board is required to develop a proposal containing recommendations to reduce that per capita growth rate for submission the following year. The Board would be subject to strict fiscal and policy criteria in developing its recommendations, including limitations on the types of providers it could target between years 2015 through 2019. Recommendations made by the Board would be implemented automatically absent Congressional action. CBO estimates that this provision would save $28.0 billion between 2015 and 2019. ", "The Senate bill would also impose an additional tax of 0.9% on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers effective for taxable years after December 31, 2012. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this provision would raise $86.8 billion between 2013 and 2019. Another provision in the bill would freeze the income thresholds used to determine which beneficiaries are subject to higher Part B premium rates at 2010 levels through 2019. Over time, this would result in a larger number of beneficiaries paying the higher premiums. CBO estimates that this provision would save the Medicare program $25\u00a0billion over 10 years. Additionally, as previously noted, the Senate bill would require high-income Part D prescription drug program enrollees to pay higher premiums. CBO estimates that this would lead to savings of close to $11 billion over 10 years.", "CBO estimates that the Senate bill, including the manager's amendment (i.e., Title X), would reduce net Part A outlays by $245 billion over FY2010-2019. As a result of cost reductions and additional revenues raised through increased payroll taxes, CBO estimates that the HI trust fund would increase by $385 billion over the 2010-2019 period, and would have a balance of about $170\u00a0billion at the end of FY2019. CBO notes, however, that the trust fund balance would still be declining, and the HI trust fund would become insolvent a few years after 2019. CBO also cautions against combining trust fund accounting conventions with budget accounting rules. Reductions in Medicare expenditures can be used to extend the solvency of the HI trust fund or used to offset costs associated with expansion of health insurance coverage; using both accounting methods at the same time would result in double-counting a large share of those savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to Address Fraud, Waste, and Abuse", "paragraphs": ["Health care fraud costs the nation billions of dollars annually.

These activities are referred to as program integrity activities. CMS shares responsibility for combating health care fraud with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The OIG is an independent unit within HHS that has the primary responsibility for detecting health care fraud and abuse in federal health care programs. The FBI conducts complex fraud investigations related to both private and public health care programs, and the OIG, FBI, and CMS refer suspected cases of fraud to the DOJ for prosecution.", "In general, the anti-fraud provisions contained in the bill target CMS's program integrity activities, the HHS OIG and DOJ enforcement efforts, and funding for anti-fraud activities. Certain provisions would also apply to the CHIP program. In the area of program integrity, the legislation would provide the Secretary with the authority to impose certain enhanced oversight and screening measures (i.e. licensure checks, background checks, and site visits) on providers and suppliers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. To pay for these screening measures, the legislation would require that certain providers pay an enrollment fee. Other program integrity measures include requiring Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP providers to implement compliance programs, providing the Secretary with enhanced authority to suspend provider payments, clarifying access to payment and claims data by law enforcement agencies, and expanding Medicare's Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program to Medicaid and Medicare Parts C and D.", "In the area of enforcement, the legislation introduces new Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) for certain types of infractions, including falsifying information on provider enrollment applications and delaying investigations and audits by the OIG. The legislation would also enhance the Secretary's authority to impose penalties on MA plans for violating the terms of their contract. Practices such as enrolling individuals into new MA plans or transferring individuals from one plan to another without consent would be subject to sanctions imposed by the Secretary.

Studies by CBO, MedPAC and others attribute most of the cost growth to the development and increasing utilization of new treatments and other forms of medical technology. Although Medicare will have the additional challenge of higher enrollment associated with aging baby boomers, CBO estimates that most of the expected increase will result from growth in per capita costs rather than from the aging of the population. The Medicare trustees note that, over time, the program will require major new sources of financing and impose a significant financial liability on taxpayers if Medicare benefits and payment systems remain as they are today. Additionally, Medicare beneficiaries will be responsible for paying for a portion of these rising expenditures through higher premiums and higher cost sharing. ", "The Senate bill contains provisions designed to reduce Medicare program costs by approximately $400 billion over the next 10 years through adjustments in payments to certain types of providers, by equalizing payment rates between Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare, and by increasing efficiencies in the way that health services are paid for and delivered. There are differing views, however, about whether and to what extent Medicare savings should be considered as offsets to fund the expansion of health care coverage or, whether these funds are more appropriately directed at strengthening the program's future financial standing.

These services include physician services, health practitioners (physician assistants, nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives, clinical social workers, clinical psychologists, and registered dietitians or nutrition professionals) and outpatient physical therapy services provided by physical or occupational therapists. Section 630 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ) instituted a five-year expansion of the items and services covered under Medicare Part B when furnished in, or at the direction of, IHS, IT, or TO hospitals or ambulatory care clinics, applying to items and services furnished on or after January 1, 2005.

There are 46 quality measures collected in the RHQDAPU program that impact the FY2011 payment update. Individual hospital performance on specific quality measures and on certain conditions is available on Hospital Compare available on the CMS website. In November, 2007, CMS released a mandated report on the implementation of a Medicare hospital value-based purchasing (VBP) program, which recommends expanding the RQHDAPU program in order to financially reward hospitals differentially for performance; public reporting of performance would be a key component as well.", "Under the bill, starting for discharges on October 1, 2012, hospitals would receive value-based incentive payments from Medicare. The first year of the VBP program would be a data collection/performance year. Beginning in FY2013, hospital payments would be adjusted based on performance under the VBP program. Certain hospitals would be excluded in a fiscal year: those that are subject to payment reductions associated with reporting required quality data in that fiscal year; those that have been cited for deficiencies that pose immediate jeopardy to their patients; and those for which there are not sufficient number of measures or cases that apply to the hospital for a performance period. Acute-care hospitals in Maryland paid under their state specific Medicare system would be exempt if an annual report documents that a similar state program achieves at least comparable patient outcomes and cost savings. The Secretary would select measures other than measures of readmissions for the hospital VBP program from those used in the RHQDAPU program. In FY2013, the measures would cover at least five specified conditions. For discharges occurring during FY2014 and subsequently, the Secretary would ensure that measures would include appropriate efficiency measures, such as adjusted Medicare spending per beneficiary.", "The Secretary would establish VBP performance standards, including levels of achievement and improvement, and a methodology for assessing the total performance of each hospital. The performance standards would be announced no later than 60 days prior to the beginning of the period. Hospitals with the highest scores would receive the largest VBP payments. There would not be a minimum performance standard in determining the performance score for any hospital. Hospitals that meet or exceed the established standards for a performance period would receive an increased base operating diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment for each discharge in the fiscal year. Starting in FY2013, the Secretary would fund the VBP incentive payments by reducing the base operating DRG payments for each hospital's discharges in a fiscal year by an applicable percentage. These reductions would apply to all hospitals. The applicable percentage would be 1.0% in FY2013; 1.25% in FY2014; 1.5% in FY2015; 1.75% in FY2016; and 2.0% in FY2017 and in subsequent years. Certain adjustments within Medicare's inpatient hospital payment system, such as those for outliers, indirect medical education, disproportionate share hospital and low volume, would not be affected. Certain payments to sole community hospitals and Medicare dependent hospitals (for FY2012 and FY2013) would also not be affected. ", "Individual hospital performance on each specific quality measure, on each condition or procedure, and on total performance would all be publicly reported. A process would be established that allows hospitals to appeal their performance assessment and score; these appeals would be resolved in a timely manner. There would be no judicial or administrative review of certain aspects of the VBP program. The Secretary would consult with small rural and urban hospitals on the application of the VBP program to such hospitals. The RHAQDPU program would be modified. The Secretary would be able to require hospitals to submit data on measures that are not used for the determination of VBP payments. Effective for FY2013 payments, the Secretary would be required to provide for appropriate risk adjustment for quality measures for outcomes of care. These measures would be validated appropriately.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) would conduct a study of the VBP program with an interim report to Congress due by October 1, 2015 and a final report due by July 1, 2017.

CMS named this program the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI). The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA, P.L. 110-275 ) made this program permanent and extended the bonuses through 2010; the incentive payment was increased from 1.5% of total allowable charges under the physician fee schedule in 2007 and 2008 to 2% in 2009 and 2010.

The MOCP would submit information to the Secretary on behalf of the eligible professional that the professional has successfully met the program criteria and on the survey of patient experience with care, if requested. The provision would authorize the Secretary to incorporate participation and successful completion in a MCOP into the composite of measure of quality of care furnished pursuant to the physician fee schedule payment modifier.", "Subsequently, eligible professionals who failed to participate successfully in the program would face a 1.5% payment penalty in 2015, and a 2% payment penalty in 2016 and in subsequent years. The incentive payments and adjustments in payment would be based on the allowed charges for all covered services furnished by the eligible professional, based on the applicable percentage of the fee schedule amount. The proposal would require CMS to develop a plan to integrate the PQRI program with the standards for meaningful use of certified electronic health records as created in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

Improvements to t he Physician Feedback Program. MedPAC, GAO and others have recently recommended providing information to physicians on their resource use. MedPAC asserts that physicians would be able to assess their practice styles, evaluate whether they tend to use more resources than their peers or what evidence-based research (if available) recommends, and revise practice styles as appropriate. MedPAC notes that in certain instances, the private sector use of feedback has led to a small downward trend in resource use. The GAO noted that certain public and private health care purchasers routinely evaluate physicians in their networks using measures of efficiency and other factors and that the purchasers it studied linked their evaluation results to a range of incentives to encourage efficiency. ", "MIPPA established a physician feedback program with the intent to improve efficiency and to control costs. Under the Physician Feedback Program, the Secretary will use Medicare claims data to provide confidential reports to physicians that measure the resources involved in furnishing care to Medicare beneficiaries. The resources to be considered in this program may be measured on an episode basis, on a per capita basis, or on both an episode and a per capita basis. The GAO will conduct a study of the Physician Feedback Program, including the implementation of the Program, and will submit a report to Congress by March 1, 2011 containing the results of the study, together with recommendations for such legislation and administrative action as the Comptroller General determines appropriate.", "The proposal would require new types of reports and data analysis under the physician feedback program. Not later than January 1, 2012, the Secretary would develop an episode grouper that combines separate but clinically related items and services into an episode of care for an individual, as appropriate. Beginning with 2012, the Secretary would provide reports to physicians that compare patterns of resource use of the individual physician to such patterns of other physicians.

Quality Reporting for Long-term Care Hospitals, Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals and Hospice Programs. Under current law, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), long term care hospitals (LTCHs) and hospices are not required to report quality data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Medicare pays for inpatient care provided by IRFs and LTCHs, and for hospices, using different prospective payment systems (PPS). Each PPS is updated annually using a market basket (MB) index which measures the estimated change in the price of goods and services purchased by the provider to produce a unit of output. The Secretary would be directed to establish quality reporting programs for LTCHs, IRFs, and hospices. Starting in rate year 2014, LTCHs would be required to submit data on specified quality measures. This requirement would start in FY2014 for IRFs and hospices. Entities that did not comply would have a reduction in their annual update of 2 percentage points. The reduction would be able to result in an annual update that is less than 0.0 which would result in a basis of payment that is lower than in the preceding year. Any reduction would not affect payments in subsequent years. The required measures affecting these payments would be published no later than October 1, 2012.

Quality of care would be evaluated on a composite of risk-adjusted measures of quality established by the Secretary, such as measures that reflect health outcomes. Costs, defined as expenditures per individual, would be evaluated based on a composite of appropriate measures of costs established by the Secretary that eliminate the effect of geographic adjustments in payment rates and take into account risk factors (such as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, ethnicity, and health status of individuals) and other factors determined appropriate by the Secretary.", "By January 1, 2012, the Secretary would publish the specific measures of quality and cost, the specific dates for implementation of the payment adjustment, and the proposed prospective performance period.

CBO estimates that this provision would have no effect on spending over the 5-year or 10-year budget window.", "Sec. 3008. Payment Adjustment for Conditions Acquired in Hospitals. Medicare pays acute care hospitals using the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), where each patient is classified into a Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis-related group (MS-DRG). Generally, except for outlier cases, a hospital receives a predetermined amount for a given MS-DRG regardless of the services provided to a patient. In some instances, Medicare patients may be assigned to a different MS-DRG with a higher payment rate based on secondary diagnoses. Starting October 1, 2008, hospitals did not receive additional Medicare payment for complications that were acquired during a patient's hospital stay for certain select conditions. These hospital acquired conditions (HACs) are: (1) high cost, high volume, or both; (2) identified though a secondary diagnosis that will result in the assignment to a different, higher paid MS-DRG; and (3) reasonably preventable through the application of evidence-based guidelines. Starting for discharges during FY2015, acute care hospitals in the top quartile of national, risk-adjusted hospital acquired condition (HAC) rates for an applicable period in a fiscal year would receive 99% of their otherwise applicable payment. Acute care hospitals in Maryland paid under their state specific Medicare system would be exempt if an annual report documents that a similar state program achieves at least comparable quality outcomes and cost savings. Prior to FY2015, the hospitals would receive confidential reports with respect to their HAC conditions which would be made publicly available on the Hospital Compare Internet website after the hospital has the opportunity to review and correct the data. There would be no administrative or judicial review of certain aspects of the program. The Secretary would submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2012, with recommendations with respect to expanding Medicare's HAC payment policy to other facilities, including IRFs, LTCHs, hospital outpatient departments, inpatient psychiatric facilities, cancer hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ambulatory surgery centers and health clinics.

Accountable care organizations (ACOs) would go beyond the PGP model, which is based on physician groups, to include additional providers.", "The provision would allow groups of providers who voluntarily meet certain statutory criteria, including quality measurements, to be recognized as ACOs and be eligible to share in the cost-savings they achieve for the Medicare program. Beginning no later than Jan. 1, 2012, this shared savings program would enable eligible ACOs to qualify for an annual incentive bonus if they achieve a threshold savings amount, established by the Secretary, for total per beneficiary spending under Medicare parts A and B for those beneficiaries assigned to the ACO. An eligible ACO would be defined as a group of providers and suppliers who have an established mechanism for joint decision making, and would be required to participate in the shared savings program for a minimum of three years, among other requirements. An ACO would include practitioners (physicians, regardless of specialty; nurse practitioners; physician assistants; and clinical nurse specialists) in group practice arrangements; networks of practices; and partnerships or joint-venture arrangements between hospitals and practitioners, among others.", "In each year of the three-year agreement period, an ACO would be eligible for a shared savings payment only if the estimated average per capita Medicare expenditures for Parts A and B services, adjusted for beneficiary characteristics is at least the specified percentage below the applicable benchmark. This appropriate percentage would account for the normal variation in expenditures based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the ACO. The ACO's benchmark for each agreement period would be based on the most recent available three years of per beneficiary Part A and B spending for its assigned beneficiaries. This benchmark would be adjusted for beneficiary characteristics and updated by the projected absolute growth in national per capital expenditures for Part A and B FFS Medicare services, as estimated by the Secretary. The benchmark would be reset at the start of each agreement period. Subject to attaining quality performance standards, an ACO would receive a percentage of the difference between the estimated average per capita Medicare expenditures in a year, adjusted for beneficiary characteristics, under the ACO and the ACO's benchmark. The remainder of the difference would be retained by the program. The Secretary would establish limits on the total amount of shared savings that may be paid to an ACO.

The Secretary would enter into agreements with qualifying independence at home medical practices, legal entities comprised of an individual physician or nurse practitioner or group of physicians and nurse practitioners that provide care as part of a team that includes physicians, nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists, and other health and social services staff, as appropriate. These practice staff would have experience providing home-based primary care services to applicable beneficiaries. Practice staff would make in-home visits, and be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to implement care plans tailored to the individual beneficiary's chronic conditions and designed to reduce expenditures and improve health outcomes in the provision of items and services to applicable beneficiaries.", "The Secretary would establish a methodology for sharing savings with independence at home medical practices that have expenditures below an annual target spending level. The annual spending target (established by the Secretary) would be the amount the Secretary estimates would have been spent in the absence of the demonstration, for items and services covered under Medicare parts A and B provided to applicable beneficiaries. Subject to performance on quality measures, qualifying practices would be eligible to receive incentive payments if actual annual expenditures for applicable beneficiaries are less than the estimated spending target.

Medicare pays for inpatient care provided by acute care hospitals using an inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) where each patient is assigned to a MS-DRG and paid based on an estimate of the average resources needed to care for a patient with specific diagnoses. Certain atypical cases may qualify for additional outlier payments. Certain hospitals receive additional indirect medical education (IME) payments because of their status as a teaching hospital, because they qualify for disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments or because they treat a small number (or low volume) of Medicare patients. Certain types of hospitals that qualify as sole community hospitals (SCHs) or Medicare dependent hospitals (MDHs) receive additional hospital specific payments. Medicare pays for inpatient services provided by acute care hospitals in Maryland using a state specific reimbursement system established under a waiver. Medicare pays for inpatient services in other types of hospitals such as inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs), children's hospitals, and long-term care hospitals using different reimbursement systems. ", "According to Medicare Payment Advisory Commission's (MedPAC), in 2005, 6.2% of acute care hospitalizations of Medicare beneficiaries resulted in readmission within 7 days and 17.6% of hospitalizations resulted in readmission within 30 days. The 17.6% of hospital readmission accounted for $15 billion in Medicare spending.", "Starting for discharges on October 1, 2012, the Secretary would establish a hospital readmissions reduction program for certain potentially preventable Medicare inpatient hospital readmissions covering 3 conditions with high volume or high rate (or both). Medicare's base operating DRG payment amounts would be reduced by an adjustment factor. Certain components of Medicare hospital payments would be exempt from these payment reductions, including outlier, IME, DSH, and low volume payments. Hospital specific payments made to SCHs and MDHs would be exempt in FY2012 and FY2012 as well. Acute care hospitals in Maryland would be exempt from these payment adjustments if a comparable state program achieves the same or higher patient outcomes and cost savings. ", "The adjustment factor for a hospital in a fiscal year would be the greater of (1) a floor adjustment factor equal to a reduced percentage of the discharge payment or (2) the excess readmissions ratio for the applicable fiscal year. The floor adjustment factor would be 0.99 of the discharge payments in FY2013, 0.98 of the discharge in FY2014, 0.97 in FY2015 and in subsequent fiscal years. The excess readmissions ratio would equal 1 minus the ratio of the aggregate payments for excess readmissions for the hospital divided by the aggregate payments for all discharges. (Each component of this formula is specified in the provision.) Excess readmissions would include readmissions over an established minimum number for the specific applicable condition within a certain period for a hospital.", "An applicable condition would be defined as a condition or procedure that represents high volume (above a minimum threshold) or high expenditures for Medicare or meets other specified criteria that also satisfies certain measures of readmissions (that have been endorsed by a consensus-based entity with a performance measurement contract under Section 1890 of the Social Security Act). Readmissions would not include those readmissions that are unrelated to the prior discharge, such as a planned readmission or a transfer to another hospital. Beginning in FY2015, the number of applicable conditions would be expanded beyond the initial 3 conditions to 4 additional conditions that were identified by MedPAC in its June, 2007, Report to Congress and other appropriate conditions. These additional conditions would not necessarily need to be endorsed by a consensus based organization as long as due consideration has been given to such endorsed or adopted measures. ", "Readmission information for acute care hospitals would be made publically available after a hospital has the opportunity to review and correct the data prior to being made public. No judicial and administrative review would be permitted for certain aspects of the readmission program.

The required data would be able to be submitted by a state or other appropriate entity rather than by each hospital.", "No later than two years after enactment, a program to improve readmission rates through the use of patient safety organizations would be established for eligible hospitals. An eligible hospital would be those with historically high rates of risk adjusted readmissions that have not taken appropriate steps to reduce readmissions and improve patient safety.

Under this program, the Secretary would fund eligible hospitals (with high admission rates, as defined under section 3025 of this bill) and certain community-based organizations (that provide transition services across a continuum of care through arrangements with certain hospitals and whose governing body includes sufficient representation of multiple health care stakeholders) that furnish improved care transition services to high-risk Medicare beneficiaries. High-risk Medicare beneficiaries would refer to beneficiaries who have attained a minimum hierarchical condition category score, as determined by the Secretary, based on a diagnosis of multiple chronic conditions or other risk factors associated with a hospital readmission or substandard transition into post-hospitalizations. Such diagnoses or risk factors could include cognitive impairment, depression, or a history of multiple readmissions.", "Applications by community-based organizations and hospitals to participate in this program would be required to propose at least one care transition intervention, other than discharge planning, such as initiating care transition services for targeted high-risk beneficiaries no later than 24 hours prior to the hospital discharge; arranging timely post-discharge follow-up to educate patients and, as appropriate, the primary caregiver, about responding to health symptoms that may indicate additional health problems or a deteriorating condition; among others. In selecting participating entities, the Secretary would be required to prioritize those entities that participate in a program administered by the Administration on Aging or provide services to medically underserved populations, small communities, and rural areas.", "A total of $500 million would be transferred by the Secretary from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for this program.

The geographic adjustments are indices\u2014known as Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs)\u2014that reflect how each area compares to the national average in a \"market basket\" of goods. A value of 1.00 represents an average across all areas. A series of bills set a temporary floor value of 1.00 on the physician work index beginning January 2004; most recently, Section 134 of the MIPPA extended the application of this floor when calculating Medicare physician reimbursement through December, 2009. The other geographic indices (for practice expense and medical malpractice) were not modified by these acts.", "The proposal would provide a short extension of the floor and introduce a new methodology to determine the practice expense GPCI. First, the proposal would extend the 1.00 floor for the geographic index for physician work for an additional year through December 31, 2010. Second, the proposal would direct the Secretary to adjust the practice expense GPCI for 2010 to reflect 3/4 of the difference between the relative costs of employee wages and rents in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national averages (i.e., a blend of 3/4 local and 1/4 national) instead of the full difference under current law. For 2011, the adjustment would reflect 1/2 of the difference between the relative costs of employee wages and rents in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national averages (i.e., a blend of 1/2 local and 1/2 national). Relief would apply only to areas with a practice expense GPCI less than 1.0. The proposal would hold-harmless any areas negatively impacted by the adjustment.", "The proposal would direct the Secretary to analyze current methods of establishing practice expense geographic adjustments under the physician fee schedule (PE GPCI) and evaluate data that fairly and reliably establishes distinctions in the costs of operating a medical practice in the different Medicare payment localities.

For 2009, the annual limit on the allowed amount for outpatient physical therapy and speech-language pathology combined is $1,840, and there is a separate limit for occupational therapy of $1,840. The Secretary was required to implement an exceptions process for 2006, 2007, and the first half of 2008 for cases in which the provision of additional therapy services was determined to be medically necessary. Section 141 of MIPPA extended the exceptions process for therapy caps through December 31, 2009.

Extension of Certain Payment Rules for Long-term Care Hospital Services and of Moratorium on the Establishment of Certain Hospitals and Facilities. Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are designed to provide extended medical and rehabilitative care for patients who are clinically complex and have multiple acute or chronic conditions. LTCHs that are distinct part units of other hospitals are not explicitly permitted by the Medicare statute. Over time, however, the LTCH industry has evolved to include co-located hospitals-within-hospitals (HwHs) or satellite facilities in addition to traditional freestanding facilities. CMS has implemented additional organizational requirements on these LTCHs, in an attempt to ensure that these are separate entities. Certain LTCHs (grandfathered HwHs) have been exempted from the requirements. Starting October 1, 2004, CMS established limits on the number of discharged Medicare patients that an HwHs and satellite LTCHs (except grandfathered LTCHs) can admit and be paid as independent LTCHs; after that threshold has been reached, generally, the LTCH will receive a substantially lower payment for subsequent patient admissions who have been discharged from the host hospital. Starting July 1, 2007, CMS extended this payment policy to other types of LTCHs, including grandfathered entities. Congress provided for a three-year moratorium on the application of this payment policy for certain LTCHs starting December 29, 2007.", "Effective for the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2002, LTCHs are paid according to a prospective payment system (PPS), subject to a five-year transition period. By statute, total payments under LTCH-PPS must be equal to the amount that would have been paid if the PPS had not been implemented in the initial year of implementation. CMS proposed to review LTCH payments and make a one-time prospective adjustment to the LTCH PPS to correct for any errors in the original budget neutrality calculations. The same moratorium was applied to this policy.", "The LTCH-PPS includes certain case level adjustments for short stay and interrupted stay cases. CMS adopted a very short-stay outlier payment policy starting July 1, 2007 to reduce payments for patients who have lengths of stay that are less than or equal to one standard deviation from the geometric average length-of-stay of the same MS-DRG under the IPPS The same moratorium was applied to this policy.

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171 ) capped reimbursement of the technical component for x-ray and imaging services at the lesser rate of the hospital outpatient rate or the physician fee schedule. Additionally, CMS implemented a new methodology for determining resource-based practice expense payments for all services that has led to reductions in the professional component reimbursement. It is estimated that reimbursement rates for DXA services have been reduced by more than half since 2006. This provision would set payments for DXA at 70% of the 2006 reimbursement rates for these services in 2010 and 2011. The provision would also direct the Secretary to arrange with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to study and report to the Secretary and Congress on the ramifications of Medicare reimbursement reductions for DXA on beneficiary access to bone mass measurement benefits. CBO estimates that this provision would cost $0.1 billion in each of FY 2010 and FY 2011.", "Sec. 3112. Revision to the Medicare Improvement Fund. Section 188 of MIPPA established the Medicare Improvement Fund (MIF), available to the Secretary to make improvements under the original fee-for-service program under Parts A and B for Medicare beneficiaries. Under current law, $22.4 billion is available for services furnished during FY2014. The provision would eliminate the funding in the MIF. The CBO score is -$ 15.6 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and is - $ 20.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3113. Treatment o f Certain Complex Diagnostic Laboratory Tests. Currently, Medicare reimbursement for diagnostic laboratory tests performed on specimens collected from a hospital patient is included in the hospital payment (DRG or outpatient PPS). The proposal would establish a demonstration project under Medicare part B that would make separate payments to laboratories for complex diagnostic laboratory tests provided to Medicare beneficiaries. ", "The term ''complex diagnostic laboratory test'' would mean a diagnostic laboratory test that is (a) an analysis of gene protein expression, topographic genotyping, or a cancer chemotherapy sensitivity assay, (b) determined by the Secretary to be a laboratory test for which there is not an alternative test having equivalent performance characteristics, (c) billed using a Health Care Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code other than a not otherwise classified code, (d) approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration or is covered under the Medicare program; and (e) described in section 1861(s)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(3)). The term \"separate payment\" would mean direct payment to a laboratory (including a hospital-based or independent laboratory) that performs a complex diagnostic laboratory test on a specimen collected from a hospital patient if the test is performed after the hospitalization and if a separate Medicare payment would not otherwise be made.", "The demonstration project would run for a two-year period beginning on July 1, 2011, so long as the cost of the demonstration program does not exceed $100 million. Not later than two years after the completion of the demonstration project, the Secretary would submit a report to Congress that would include (1) an assessment of the impact of the demonstration project on access to care, quality of care, health outcomes, and expenditures or savings to the Medicare program, and (2) such recommendations as the Secretary would determine to be appropriate. CBO estimates that this provision would co st a total of $100 million over the next 5 years with no additional impact over the remaining years of the 10-year budget window.", "Sec. 3114. Improved Access for Certified Nurse-Midwife Services . Section 1833 of the SSA provides for Medicare payments for services received by covered individuals. For certified nurse-midwife services, the amount required to be paid is 80% of the lesser of either (1) the actual charge for the services, or (2) the amount determined by a fee schedule established by the Secretary. The fee schedule is not allowed to exceed 65% of the prevailing charge that would be allowed for the same services performed by a physician. This provision would amend Section 1833 by adding that for services provided on or after January 1, 2011, the fee schedule for certified-midwife services would not be allowed to exceed 100% of the fee schedule amount provided under Section 1848 for the same service performed by a physician.

To be eligible for Medicare, one must be (1) 65 years or older and eligible to receive Social Security; or (2) under 65, permanently disabled, and have received Social Security disability insurance payments for at least two years; or (3) have Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS-Lou Gehrig's disease); or (4) have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This provision would provide Medicare coverage and medical screening services to certain individuals exposed to environmental health hazards. An individual with one or more specified lung diseases or types of cancer who lived for 6 months during a specified period prior to diagnosis in an area subject to a public health emergency declaration by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as of June 17, 2009, would be deemed entitled to benefits under Part A and eligible to enroll in Part B. The Secretary would be required to establish a pilot program, with appropriate reimbursement methodologies, to provide comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective care to such individuals who enroll in Part B. Further, the Secretary would have the authority to so deem any other individual diagnosed with an illness caused by an environmental hazard to which an EPA emergency declaration applies who lived for 6 months in the affected area during a period determined by the Secretary. There would be appropriated $23 million for the period FY2010 through FY2014, and $20 million for each 5-fiscal year period thereafter, to carry out the screening and public information dissemination program.

The bundled payment will include (1) items and services included in the composite rate as of December 31, 2010; (2) erythropoiesis stimulating agents for the treatment of ESRD; (3) injectable biologicals and medications that were paid for separately under Part B, (before bundling) and any oral equivalent to such medications; and (4) diagnostic laboratory tests and other items and services furnished to individuals for the treatment of ESRD. This provision would require the Comptroller General to conduct a study and submit a report, within a year of enactment, on the impact on Medicare beneficiary access to high-quality dialysis services of including specified oral drugs that are furnished to beneficiaries for the treatment of ESRD and included in the ESRD bundled prospective payment system. The study would include an analysis of (1) the ability of providers of services and renal dialysis facilities to furnish specified oral drugs; (2) the ability of providers of services and renal dialysis facilities to comply with applicable State laws, such as State pharmacy licensure requirements in order to furnish such drugs; (3) whether appropriate quality measures exist to safeguard care for Medicare beneficiaries being furnished specified oral drugs by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities; and (4) other areas determined appropriate by the Comptroller General.

Small rural hospitals (with no more than 100 beds) that are not sole community hospitals (SCHs) can receive additional Medicare payments if their outpatient payments under the prospective payment system are less than under the prior hospital outpatient department (HOPD) reimbursement system. For calendar year (CY) 2006, these hospitals received 95% of the difference between payments under the prospective payment system and those that would have been made under the prior reimbursement system. The hospitals receive 90% of the difference in CY2007 and 85% of the difference in CY2008 and CY2009. Sole community hospitals with not more than 100 beds receive 85% of the payment difference for covered HOPD services furnished on or after January 1, 2009, and before January 1, 2010. The provision would establish that small rural hospitals would receive 85% of the payment difference in CY2010. SCHs with not more than 100 beds would receive 85% of the payment difference in CY2010. The 100-bed limitation for SCHs would be removed so that all SCHs would receive 85% of the payment difference in CY2010.

No more than 15 hospitals can participate in the demonstration. Currently, there are 10 hospitals participating in the program. This provision would extend the demonstration program for an additional five years, expand the maximum number of participating hospitals to 30 for that period, and specify that the 20 states with low population densities would participate in the demonstration project. The Secretary would provide for the continued participation for those hospitals that are in the demonstration at the end of the initial five-year period during the five-year extension unless the hospital elects to discontinue such participation. Participants would receive the reasonable cost for discharges occurring in the first cost reporting period beginning on or after the first day of the five-year extension.

Temporary Improvements to the Medicare Inpatient Hospital Payment Adjustment for Low-Volume Hospitals. Under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), certain low-volume hospitals receive a payment adjustment to account for their higher costs per discharge. A low-volume hospital is defined as an acute care hospital that is located more than 25 road miles from another comparable hospital and that has less than 800 total discharges during the fiscal year. Under current law, the Secretary is required to determine an appropriate percentage increase for these low-volume hospitals based on the empirical relationship between the standardized cost-per-case for such hospitals and their total discharges to account for the additional incremental costs (if any) that are associated with such number of discharges. The low-volume adjustment is limited to no more than 25%. Accordingly, under regulations, qualifying hospitals (those located more than 25 road miles from another comparable hospital) with less than 200 total discharges receive a 25% payment increase for every Medicare discharge. A temporary adjustment that would increase payment in FY2011 and FY2012 for certain low-volume hospitals would be created. A low volume hospital could be located more than 15 road miles from another comparable hospital and have 1,600 discharges of individuals entitled to or enrolled for Medicare Part A benefits. The Secretary would determine the applicable percentage increase using a continuous linear sliding scale ranging from 25% for low-volume hospitals with 200 or fewer discharges of individuals with Medicare Part A benefits to no adjustment for hospitals with greater than 1,600 discharges of individuals with Medicare Part A benefits.

Those eligible to participate in the demonstration project are limited to certain entities in States with at least 65% of its counties in the State with 6 or fewer residents per square mile. Based on these criteria, the Secretary is instructed to select up to 4 states to participate in the demonstration program, and within those states, up to 6 counties. For a county to be eligible to participate, it must have 6 or fewer residents per square mile and contain a critical access hospital (CAH) that furnished one or more of specified services (home health, hospice, or rural health clinic) and had a daily inpatient census of 5 or less as of date of enactment; skilled nursing facility services must be available in the eligible county. The three-year demonstration project is to begin on October 1, 2009, and be done in a budget neutral manner.

Generally, a rural hospital designated as a CAH receives 101% reasonable, cost based reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient care rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. A CAH may elect an all-inclusive outpatient payment which is equal to a 101% of reasonable costs for facility services plus 115% of the Medicare physician fee schedule payment for professional services when the physician or practitioner has reassigned his or her billing rights to the CAH.

Improvement to Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments. Medicare's disproportionate share hospital (DSH) adjustment was included in the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) in 1986 on the premise that low-income patients are more costly to treat and those acute care hospitals serving a large number of such patients would be likely to have higher costs for their Medicare patients than would otherwise similar institutions. Over time, as the formulas for Medicare's DSH adjustment have been changed, the justification for the higher payments has evolved and the adjustment is viewed as a way to insure access to hospital care. Medicare's DSH payments are distributed through a hospital-specific percentage increase to its prospective payment rate. In most instances, the size of a hospital's DSH adjustment would depend upon the number of patient days provided to poor Medicare patients or Medicaid patients. In its March 2007 Report to Congress , MedPAC found that about three-quarters of the Medicare DSH payments (accounting for about $5.5 billion in FY2004) was not empirically justified in terms of higher patient care costs. Also, Medicare's DSH payments were poorly targeted to hospitals' shares of uncompensated care", "Starting in FY2015 and for subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary would make DSH payments equal to 25% of what otherwise would be made, a payment that represents the empirically justified amount as determined by MedPAC in its March 2007 Report to Congress. In addition to this amount, starting in FY2015, the Secretary would pay to such acute care hospitals an additional amount using a formula that is the product of 3 factors: the difference in the hospital's DSH payments because of this legislation: factor ( 1) the difference in the hospital's DSH payments because of this legislation; factor (2) for FY2015, FY2016 and FY2017, the difference in the percentage change in the uninsured under-65 population from 2013 (as calculated from current estimates from CBO data before the vote to enroll the Act in the House) and those who are uninsured in the most recent period for which data is available minus 1.5 percentage points; and in FY2018 and subsequently, the same calculation based on data from the Census Bureau or other appropriate sources as certified by the Chief Actuary of CMS. The 1.5 percentage point subtraction would occur in FY2018 and FY2019; and factor (3) the percentage of uncompensated care provided by the hospital (relative to all acute care hospitals) for a selected period based on appropriate data.

The Medicare physician fee schedule is based on assigning relative weights to each of the more than 7,000 physician service codes used to bill Medicare. The relative value for a service compares the relative work involved in performing one service with the work involved in providing other physicians' services. The scale used to compare the value of one service with another is known as a resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS). CMS is responsible for maintaining and updating the fee schedule, including the modification and refinement of the methodology for estimating relative value units (RVUs). CMS relies on advice and recommendations from the American Medical Association/Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC) in its assessments. In general, as currently implemented, increases in RVUs for a service or number of services lowers the resultant fees for other physician services because of the budget neutrality condition. One consequence has been that the payments for evaluation and management codes, whose RVUs typically are not increased over time, have fallen relative to other codes whose RVUs have increased and as a consequence of new technologies that have been introduced into coverage with relatively high RVUs. CMS is required to review the RVUs no less than every five years.", "The Secretary would be required to periodically identify physician services as being potentially misvalued, and make appropriate adjustments to the relative values of such services under the Medicare physician fee schedule. To identify potentially misvalued services, the Secretary would examine codes (and families of codes as appropriate) with the fastest growth, that have experienced substantial changes in practice expenses, for new technologies or services, that are frequently billed in conjunction with furnishing a single service, with low relative values, particularly those that are often billed multiple times for a single treatment, that have not been subject to review since the implementation of the RBRVS (the so-called 'Harvard-valued codes'), and other codes the Secretary determined to be appropriate. The Secretary would review and make appropriate adjustments to the work relative value units under the fee schedule.", "The provision would repeal Section 4505(d) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which established requirements for developing new resource-based practice expense relative value units, as well as Section 1868(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ee(a)), which established the Practicing Physicians Advisory Council, a group of physicians who meet quarterly to discuss proposed changes in regulations and carrier manual instructions related to physician services. CBO estimates that this provision would have no impact on spending over the 5-year or 10-year budget window.", "Sec. 3135. Modification of Equipment Utilization Factor f or Advanced Imaging Services. Under the Medicare fee schedule, some services have separate payments for the technical component and the professional component. For example, imaging procedures generally have two parts: the actual taking of the image (the technical component), and the interpretation of the image (the professional component). Medicare pays for each of these components separately when the technical component is furnished by one provider and the professional component by another. When both components are furnished by one provider, Medicare makes a single global payment that is equal to the sum of the payment for each of the components. ", "CMS's method for calculating the Medicare fee schedule reimbursement rate for advanced imaging services assumed that imaging machines are operated 25 hours per week, or 50% of the time that practices are open for business. Setting the equipment use factor at a lower rate has led to higher payment for these services. Citing evidence showing that the utilization rate is 90%, rather than the 50% previously assumed, MedPAC is urging CMS to use the higher utilization rate in the calculation of fee schedule payments for advanced imaging services.", "The proposal would change the utilization rate assumption for calculating the payment for advanced imaging equipment from 50% to 65% for 2010 through 2012. The rate would be further increased to 70% for services provided in 2013 and 75% for services provided in 2014.", "According to MedPAC and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), there are opportunities to improve the efficiency of the Medicare fee schedule. In 2005, MedPAC recommended reducing certain fees to account for efficiencies and savings from the technical preparation and supplies achieved when multiple imaging services are furnished sequentially on contiguous body parts during the same visit. Starting January 1, 2006, physicians receive the full technical component fee for the highest paid imaging service in a visit, but technical component fees for additional imaging services are reduced by 25%. The proposal would increase the technical component payment reduction for sequential imaging services on contiguous body parts during the same visit from 25% to 50%.

Rental payments for wheelchairs are statutorily determined as 10% of the purchase price of the chair for each of the first 3 months and 7.5% of the purchase price for each of the remaining 10 months of the rental period. Medicare pays for most DME on the basis of a fee schedule, except in Competitive Acquisition Areas where payments are to be determined based on supplier bids. Starting January 1, 2011, the provision would restrict the lump-sum payment option for new or replacement chairs to only the complex, rehabilitative power wheelchairs. The lump-sum payment option would be eliminated for all other wheelchairs. The provision would not apply to competitive acquisition areas prior to January 1, 2011. Also starting January 1, 2011, the rental payment for power-driven wheelchairs would be 15% of the purchase price for each of the first three months (instead of 10%), and 6% of the purchase price for each of the remaining 10 months of the rental period (instead of 7.5%).

A hospital wage index is used to adjust the standardized amount to account for the local wage variation or cost of labor in the hospital's area. Starting in FY2005, CMS has adjusted this data to account for the relative skill mix of the hospitals in the area. This occupationally mix adjusted average hourly wage is then divided by the same measure calculated using data from all hospitals in the nation to establish the area's adjusted wage index.

To reclassify, a hospital had to meet certain standards, establishing that its average hourly wage (AHW) was within a certain threshold of the AHW of the area where it wanted to reclassify. Starting in FY2010, CMS raised the reclassification threshold. MGCRB hospital reclassifications are established on a budget neutral basis so aggregate inpatient payments will not increase as a result of the reclassified hospitals' higher payments.", "Section 508 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ) provided $900 million for a one-time, three year geographic reclassification of certain hospitals who were otherwise unable to qualify for administrative reclassification to areas with higher wage index values. These reclassifications were extended legislatively at various points until September 30, 2009", "This provision would extend the Section 508 reclassifications until September 30, 2010. The Secretary would be required to use the FY2010 wage index data (promulgated in the August 27, 2009, Federal Register and subsequent corrections). Beginning on April 1, 2010, the average hourly wage data of these hospitals would be included in the reclassified area only if including the data results in a higher wage index. Certain hospitals that had a lower wage index from October 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010, than from April 1, 2010, through September 30, 2010, would be paid an additional amount to reflect such difference by December 31, 2010.", "By December 31, 2011, the Secretary would be required to provide a plan to Congress on how to comprehensively reform the Medicare wage index system; this plan would take into account MedPAC recommendations included in its June 2007 Report to Congress.

These hospitals are also held harmless under the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and will not receive less from Medicare under this payment system than under the prior outpatient payment system. Under OPPS, Medicare pays for outpatient services using ambulatory payment classification (APC) groups. This provision would require the Secretary to conduct a study which would consider the cost of drugs and biologics to determine if the outpatient costs incurred by IPPS-exempt cancer hospitals with respect to Medicare's APCs exceed those costs incurred by other hospitals reimbursed under OPPS.

Medicare Part B pays for a limited number of drugs and therapeutic products, including biologics, administered to patients in physician offices and hospital outpatient departments, or those administered through durable medical equipment (DME) and billed by pharmacy suppliers. CMS assigns a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code to each drug, and Medicare payments for Part B drugs are based on the average sales price (ASP) for each HCPCS code. CMS uses the same HCPCS code for all drug products listed as therapeutically equivalent in FDA's Orange Book . Therefore, a brand-name drug and any generic versions of the same drug would have the same HCPCS code and the prices would be averaged together for ASP determinations. The provision would allow a Part B biosimilar product approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be reimbursed at the ASP of the biosimilar plus 6% of the ASP of the reference product. (The term reference biological product means the licensed biological product that is referred to in the application for the biosimilar product.)

Application of Budget Neutrality on a National Basis in the Calculation of the Medicare Hospital Wage Index Floor for Each All-U rban and Rural State. A hospital wage index is used to adjust the standardized amount to account for the local wage variation or cost of labor in the hospital's area. As required by statute, the wage index for any urban area in a state cannot be less than the rural wage index of that state (often referred to as the rural floor). The effect of the rural floor (that is, raising the wage index for urban areas in a state to that state's rural wage index) is required to be implemented on a budget neutral basis by adjusting the wage index of all hospitals not affected by the rural floor. Until FY2009, CMS funded the budget neutrality requirement associated with the impact of the rural floor though a nationwide adjustment. Starting in FY2009, CMS began a transition to fund the budget neutrality requirement through a state-specific adjustment; the statewide adjustment would be fully implemented in FY2011. States with no hospitals receiving the rural floor wage index would not have a reduced payment; those hospitals within each state with urban areas paid at the higher rural wage index would fund the higher payments for the affected hospitals. The proposal would require application of budget neutrality requirement associated with the effect of the imputed rural and rural floor on a national basis (through a uniform, national adjustment to the area wage index) for discharges starting October 1, 2010.

MDHs receive special treatment, including higher payments, under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS). Certain other hospitals, such as rural referral centers (RRC) and sole community hospitals (SCHs) receive special treatment under IPPS. Other small, limited service critical access hospitals (CAHs) are exempt from IPPS and paid 101% of their reasonable costs. IPPS includes certain payment adjustments, such as the indirect medical education (IME) adjustment for teaching hospitals, to compensate hospitals for higher average costs which might not be in their control. The disproportionate share hospital (DSH) adjustment increases payments for hospitals that serve a relatively high proportion of poor Medicare and Medicaid patients. This provision would require the Secretary to conduct a study within 9 months of enactment on the need for an additional Medicare payments for urban Medicare-dependent hospitals paid under IPPS which receive no additional IPPS payments (have an IME or DSH adjustment) or receive special treatment (as an RRC, SCH, or MDH).

SNFs are paid through a PPS which is composed of a daily (\"per-diem\") urban or rural base payment amount that is then adjusted for case mix and area wages. The base payment is adjusted for treatment type and care needs of the beneficiary based on 53 payment-adjusted resource utilization groups (RUGs). In January 2006, CMS implemented a refined SNF PPS (using FY2001 claims data), including a parity adjustment to ensure that estimated total payments under the 53-group RUG model would maintain parity to the formerly used 44-group RUG model in a budget neutral manner.", "In the final rule published on August 11, 2009, CMS describes how it will establish a revised case-mix classification methodology (RUG-IV) and implementation schedule for FY2011, reflecting updated staff time measurement data derived from the recently completed Staff Time and Resource Intensity Verification (STRIVE) project, among other things. According to CMS, the rule is intended to correct for changes made for FY2006 in which changes that were intended to better account for the resources used in the care of medically complex patients resulted in payments exceeding budget neutrality estimates. Among the changes described in the final rule are changes to the billing method for concurrent therapy. According to CMS, concurrent therapy is defined as the practice of one professional therapist treating multiple patients at the same time, each of whom can be receiving different therapy treatments. There are currently no MDS coding restrictions regarding the number of patients that may be treated concurrently, among other things. The final rule specifies that concurrent therapy time provided in a Part A SNF setting would no longer be counted as individual therapy time for each of the patients involved; rather, for each discipline, CMS would require allocating concurrent therapy minutes among the individual patients receiving it before reporting total therapy minutes on the MDS 3.0. According to CMS, the total impact of the recalibration for FY2010, as described in the final rule and accounting for a MB increase of 2.2 percentage points, would be a decrease in Medicare payments to SNFs of 1.1% (or $360 million) below FY2009 payments. Some individual providers could experience larger decreases in payments than others due to case-mix utilization.", "Under the provision, the Secretary would be prohibited from implementing the RUG-IV system described in the final rule prior to October 1, 2011.

Medicare Advantage Payment. Medicare Advantage (MA) is an alternative way for Medicare beneficiaries to receive covered benefits. Under MA, private plans are paid a per-person amount to provide all Medicare-covered benefits (except hospice) to beneficiaries who enroll in their plan. Payments to MA plans are determined by comparing plan bids to a benchmark. Each bid represents the plan's estimated revenue requirement for providing required Medicare services to an average Medicare beneficiary. The benchmark is the maximum amount Medicare will pay a plan. If the plan bid is below the benchmark, the plan payment is the bid plus a rebate equal to 75% of the difference between the bid and the benchmark. If the bid is above the benchmark, the plan is paid the benchmark and each plan enrollee must pay a premium equal to the difference between the bid and the benchmark. MA benchmarks are based, in part, on historical Medicare private plan payment rates. (MA benchmarks for Regional MA plans are based in part on historical MA plan payments, and in part on Regional MA plan bids.) Benchmark amounts are increased each year by the growth in Medicare spending (the national MA per capita growth percentage), or in certain years, the benchmark may be set at the greater of the previous year's rate increased by the growth in Medicare or average spending in original Medicare in that area, with adjustments. Local MA plans choose the counties they wish to serve. Regional plans must serve an entire region defined by the Secretary, and may choose to serve more than one region. Regions are made up of states or groups of states. Though all MA organizations are required to have a quality improvement program by January 1, 2010, payments to MA plans are not contingent on the quality of care provided to plan enrollees. ", "Under the proposal: ", "MA Benchmarks and Rebates. In 2011, the national MA per capita growth percentage used to increase benchmarks would be reduced by three percentage points. Starting in 2012, the bill would phase-in MA benchmarks based on a weighted average of plan bids. In 2012, local MA benchmarks would be based on 33% of the enrollment weighted average of plan bids for each payment area and 67% of the current law MA benchmarks. By 2015, the MA local benchmarks would be determined by the enrollment weighted average of MA bids in each payment area. Local benchmarks would be prohibited from exceeding the levels that would have existed under current law. Regional plan benchmarks would continue to be calculated as a weighted blend of the regional bids and local MA benchmarks. However, the local benchmark portion of the regional benchmark would be based on the new competitively bid MA benchmarks. Beginning in 2014, the MA plan rebates would be increased from 75% of the difference between the bid and the benchmark, to 100% of the difference. For bids submitted on or after January 1, 2012, the bill would require bid information to be certified by a member of the American Academy of Actuaries, in addition to other specified requirements.", "Payment Areas. Beginning in 2012, the Secretary would establish new MA payment areas for urban areas based on Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA). CBSAs that crossed state boundaries would be divided into separate payment areas. The Secretary would have authority to adjust CBSA-based payment areas and exempt certain plans from the requirements. MA plans would be allowed to choose which payment areas to serve, but would be required to bid and serve the entire payment area, and would no longer be allowed to apply different premiums to different segments within their service area. ", "Bonus Payments. Starting in 2014, the bill would establish two new bonus payments for local and regional MA plans\u2014a care coordination and management bonus and a quality bonus. The value of the bonuses would be based on specified percentages of the national per capita monthly cost for individuals enrolled under the original Medicare program (hereafter \"national expenditures\"). Under the care coordination and management bonus, plans would be able to earn 0.5% of \"national expenditures\" for each of 8 specified programs with a maximum of 2.0% of \"national expenditures\" possible. The quality bonus program would be based on a plan's absolute quality or improvement in quality. Quality would be measured using a 5-star rating system, or a similar system. Plans that receive at least a 3-star rating would receive 2% of \"national expenditures\"; plans that receive a 4- or 5-star rating would receive 4% of \"national expenditures.\" Plans that did not achieve at least a three-star rating would be eligible for a 1% quality bonus if their ratings improve over a prior year. Additional quality bonuses would be available for new plans, and low-enrollment plans.", "Grandfather Policy. MA plans would be allowed to grandfather extra benefits for their current enrollees (as of enactment) in certain areas of the country where average bids were not greater than 75% of local fee-for-service costs in 2009. Plans would be able to grandfather enrollees beginning in 2012. The amount of extra benefits would be reduced by 5% each year beginning in 2013. ", "Transitional benefits. Starting in 2012, the Secretary would provide for transitional rebates for extra benefits to specified enrollees. This provision would apply to beneficiaries who enroll in an MA local plan and experiences a significant reduction of benefits as a result of competitive bidding. The policy would apply to (1) the two largest metropolitan statistical areas if the total amount of extra benefits for each enrollee for the month in those areas was greater than $100 in 2009, or (2) a county where the MA benchmark amount in 2011 was equal to the legacy urban floor amount, the Medicare Advantage enrollment penetration was greater than 30% in 2011, and the average of MA plan bids was below local fee-for-service costs, with adjustments.

Cost sharing for a particular service may be greater than or less than the cost sharing under original Medicare, and may change from year to year. However, the total value of cost sharing required by an MA plan is constrained by the estimated actuarial value of total cost sharing under original Medicare. Under the bill, beginning in 2011, MA plans would be prohibited from charging cost sharing that is greater than the cost sharing under original Medicare for certain services including chemotherapy treatment, renal dialysis, skilled nursing care, and services identified by the Secretary. Beginning in 2012, the bill would restrict plans' authority to apportion their rebates and bonus payments between additional benefits, reduced cost sharing and reduced premiums. MA plans would have to apply the full amount of rebates, bonuses, and supplemental premiums according to the following priority order: (1) reduction of cost sharing, (2) coverage of preventive and wellness benefits, and (3) other benefits not covered under original Medicare.

Also beginning in 2011, the bill would prohibit beneficiaries from switching MA plans or enrolling in an MA plan from original Medicare after the start of the benefit year. The bill would, however, allow beneficiaries who had enrolled in Medicare Advantage during the annual, coordinated election period to disenroll and return to original Medicare during the first 45-day period of the new benefit year (January 1-February 15), and allow those beneficiaries to enroll in a Part D prescription drug plan.

Fully-integrated dual-eligible SNPs would be exempted from the IME payment phase-out applicable to all MA plans.", "In addition, the provision would temporarily extend authority through the end of 2012 for SNPs that do not have contracts with state Medicaid programs to continue to operate, but not to expand their service area. The proposal would require the Secretary to establish a process to transition SNP beneficiaries that do not qualify as special needs individuals, to fee-for-service Medicare and other MA plans. As part of the transition process, the Secretary would provide for an exception process for beneficiaries who lose Medicaid coverage to reapply for benefits. Beginning in 2012, SNPs would be required to have approval of the National Committee for Quality Assurance in order to serve targeted populations.

However, it is possible for an MA plan to receive a waiver of this requirement to be able to restrict enrollment to residents of a retirement community. Effective January 1, 2010, the bill would create a new type of MA plan called an MA Senior Housing Facility Plan, which would be allowed to limit its service area to a senior housing facility within a geographic area. An MA Senior Housing Facility Plan would be an MA plan that serves beneficiaries who reside in a continuing care retirement community, has a sufficient number of on-site primary care providers as determined by the Secretary, supplies transportation benefits to other providers, and were in existence under a demonstration for at least one year.

The CBO score (combined with Sec. 3315) is + $ 5.8 billion for FY2010 -FY2014 and + $1 7.8 billion for FY2010- FY2019 .", "Sec. 3302. Improvement in Determination of Part D Low-Income Benchmark Premium. The federal government pays up to 100% of the Part D premiums for low-income subsidy (LIS) beneficiaries who are enrolled in \"benchmark\" plans. A Part D plan qualifies as a benchmark plan if it offers basic Part D coverage with premiums equal to or lower than the regional low-income premium subsidy amount. MA plans offering prescription drug coverage submit a separate bid for the Part D portion. Payment for the portion of the premium attributable to basic prescription drug benefits is calculated in the same way as that for stand-alone PDPs, however an MA plan may choose to apply some of its Part C rebate payments to lower the Part D premium. If an MA plan uses rebate payments to reduce its Part D premium, this reduced amount is factored into the calculation of the regional low-income benchmark. This has the effect of lowering the benchmark and potentially of reducing the number of plans that qualify as low-income plans. MedPAC has noted that the number of plans that qualify as low-income benchmark plans has been decreasing in recent years, resulting in fewer options for LIS enrollees. This provision would exclude the Medicare Advantage rebate amounts from the MA-PDP premium bids when calculating the low-income regional benchmark for subsidy determinations made. The provision would take effect in 2011. The CBO score is +$0.3 billion for FY2010 -FY2014 and +$0 . 7 billion for FY2010- FY2019 .", "Sec. 3303. Voluntary De Minimus Policy for Subsidy Eligible Individuals Under Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans. To help maintain plans that wish to serve LIS beneficiaries at fully subsidized or $0 premiums, this provision would authorize a policy, beginning in 2011, through which plans that bid a nominal amount above the regional low-income subsidy (LIS) benchmark amount could choose to absorb the cost of the small difference between their bid and the LIS benchmark in order to qualify as a LIS-eligible plan. The Secretary would be given discretion to auto-enroll LIS beneficiaries into these plans in order to maintain adequate LIS plan choices. The de minimus threshold amount would be established by the Secretary. The CBO score is +$0.1 billion for FY2010 -FY2014 and +$0.4 billion for FY2010- FY2019 .", "Sec. 3304. Special Rule for Widows and Widowers Regarding Eligibility for Low-Income Assistance. To qualify for financial assistance under the Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) program, Medicare beneficiaries must have resources no greater than the income and resource limits established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ). Each year, the Secretary conducts a redeeming process to determine whether those who automatically qualified for the full subsidy in a given year continue to meet the criteria for eligibility in the following year. For those who have qualified for the full or partial subsidy through the application process, the agency that made the determination decision (SSA or an individual state) is responsible for monitoring a recipient's eligibility. For example, for cases in which eligibility has been established through an application with SSA, a report of a subsidy-changing event, such as marriage, divorce, or death of a spouse, will trigger a redetermination of subsidy eligibility during the calendar year. This can result in changes to the individual's deductible, premium and cost sharing subsidy, or even termination of his or her LIS eligibility status. In the case of the death of a spouse, it is possible that the surviving spouse, as the sole owner of the previously combined resources, may exceed the resource limit for an individual and may no longer qualify for the LIS program.", "The proposal would require that, beginning in 2011, the surviving spouse of an LIS-eligible couple undergo a redetermination of his or her eligibility status no earlier than one year from the next redetermination that would have occurred after the death of a spouse. Subsequently, the LIS widow/widower would be determined or redetermined, as appropriate, for LIS on the same basis as other LIS-eligible beneficiaries. The CBO score is +$0.1 billion for FY2010 -FY2014 and +$0.2 billion for FY2010- FY2019 .", "Sec. 3305. Improved Information for Subsidy Eligible Individuals Reassigned to Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans. According to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ), low-income subsidy (LIS) beneficiaries who are enrolled in plans with premiums below the low-income regional benchmark amount receive assistance with premiums and cost sharing. Those who are enrolled in LIS-eligible plans whose plan bids exceed the regional benchmark amount for the next benefit year are randomly reassigned by the Secretary of HHS to new plans whose bids are at or below the regional benchmark amount in order to ensure that these beneficiaries continue to receive a subsidy of plan premiums. It is possible that the new plan's exceptions, appeals and grievance mechanisms could differ from the old plan and that some covered drug(s) a beneficiary is currently taking would not be covered by the new plan.", "In the case of an LIS beneficiary who has been reassigned to another LIS plan, the provision would require the Secretary, beginning in 2011 to transmit within 30 days of the reassignment, information to the beneficiary about formulary differences between the former plan and the new plan with respect to the beneficiary's drug regimen, as well as a description of the beneficiary's rights to request a coverage determination, exception or reconsideration, or resolve a grievance. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3306. Funding Outreach and Assistance for Low-Income Programs. Section 119 of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA, P.L. 110-275 ) provided $25 million for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 for beneficiary outreach and education activities related to low-income programs related to the Medicare through State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Programs (SHIPs), Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs), and the Administration on Aging (AoA). This provision would extend MIPPA Section 119 and provide an additional $45 million for outreach and education activities related to Medicare low-income assistance programs, including the Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) program and the Medicare Savings Program (MSP). Funds would be allocated to SHIPs, AAAs, ADRCs, and the National Center for Benefits Outreach and Enrollment in the same proportion as under MIPPA and would be available for obligation through 2012. The Secretary would also be provided the authority to enlist the support of these entities to conduct outreach activities aimed at preventing disease and promoting wellness as an additional use of these funds. The CBO score is between -$50 million and +$50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3307. Improving Formulary Requirements for Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans with Respect to Certain Categories or Classes of Drugs. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ) requires Part D plans to operate formularies that cover drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all drugs within such categories and classes. The Secretary of HHS published a regulation (42 CFR Section 423.120) that requires Part D plans to have at least two drugs within each therapeutic category and class. However, through sub-regulatory guidance, the Secretary protected access to certain classes of drugs by requiring Part D plans to cover all, or substantially all, of the drugs in the following six drug classes: immunosuppressant, antidepressant, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, antiretroviral, and anti-neoplastic. Section 176 of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA, P.L. 110-275 ) codified that, beginning in plan year 2010, the Secretary would identify the classes and categories of drugs that should be protected, or covered entirely by Part D plans, to ensure that beneficiaries have access to certain therapies and to a wide variety of therapy options for certain conditions and established certain criteria the Secretary would use to identify such drugs.", "The proposal would give the Secretary authority to identify classes of clinical concern as defined by the Secretary and PDP sponsors would be required to include all drugs in these classes in their formularies. The proposal would also codify the current six classes of clinical concern as they are currently specified through sub-regulatory guidance until the Secretary issues a rule regarding classes of clinical concern to be protected on plan formularies. The bill would also remove the criteria specified in Section 176 of MIPPA that would have been used by the Secretary to identify protected classes of drugs. The provision would be effective for the 2011 plan year. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3308. Reducing Part D Premium Subsidy for High-Income Beneficiaries. Beginning in 2007, as required by the MMA, high-income beneficiaries are required to pay higher premiums for Part B benefits. Beneficiaries with modified adjusted gross income that exceeds a threshold amount are charged additional premiums based on a sliding scale that ranges from 35% to 80% of the value of Part B. In 2009, threshold levels started at $85,000 for an individual tax return and $170,000 for a joint return (based on 2007 returns). The threshold amounts are specified in the law, and are adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The income thresholds are tied to specific premium shares. Beneficiary premiums under Part D are not subject to income thresholds or means testing. This provision would require Part D enrollees who exceed certain income thresholds to pay higher premiums. The income thresholds would be set in a similar manner to those under Part B. The provision would also inflate the income thresholds by the CPI, except for the period between 2010 and 2019 when the income thresholds would not be updated. In addition, the provision would expand the current authority for IRS to disclose income information to SSA for purposes of adjusting the Part B subsidy to include the Part D subsidy adjustments. The CBO score is -$2.4 billion for FY2010 -FY2014 and - $10.7 billion for FY2010- FY2019 .", "Sec. 3309. Elimination of Cost Sharing for Certain Dual Eligible Individuals. Cost-sharing subsides for LIS enrollees are linked to the standard Part D prescription drug coverage. Full-subsidy eligibles have no deductible, minimal cost sharing during the initial coverage period and coverage gap, and no cost-sharing over the catastrophic threshold. Full-benefit dual eligibles who are residents of medical institutions or nursing facilities have no cost-sharing. This provision would eliminate cost sharing for drugs dispensed to beneficiaries receiving care under a home and community based waiver who would otherwise require institutional care. This provision would be effective on a date specified by the Secretary, but no earlier than January 1, 2012. The CBO score is +$0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$1.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3310. Reducing Wasteful Dispensing of Outpatient Prescription Drugs in Long-Term Care Facilities Under Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans. Part D plans are required to offer a contract to any pharmacy willing to participate in its long-term care (LTC) pharmacy network so long as the pharmacy is capable of meeting certain minimum performance and service criteria and any other standard terms and conditions established by the plan for its network pharmacies. Each LTC facility selects at least one eligible LTC pharmacy to provide Medicare drug benefits to its residents. Plan formularies must be structured so that they meet the needs of long-term care residents and provide coverage for all medically necessary medications at all levels of care. Both physician prescribing patterns and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) payment practices result in prescriptions commonly being dispensed in 30- or 90-day quantities. In situations when the full amount dispensed is not utilized by the patient, for example. due to discharge, death, adverse reactions, the remaining medication may become waste. This provision would require Part D sponsors, starting January 1, 2012, to employ utilization management techniques, determined by the Secretary in consultation with relevant stakeholders, to reduce the quantity dispensed per fill when dispensing medications to beneficiaries who reside in long-term care facilities in order to reduce waste associated with 30-day fills. These techniques could include such things as weekly, daily, or automated dose dispensing. The CBO score is -$1.0\u00a0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$5.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3311. Improved Medicare Prescription Drug Plan and MA-PD Complaint System. Part D and Medicare Advantage (MA) related complaints are tracked and resolved through a centralized complaints system within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), while complaints submitted directly to plan sponsors (grievances) are tracked and resolved by each plan sponsor using its own system. CMS maintains a central repository of MA and Part D-related complaints received by its Regional Offices, Central Office, or through 1-800-MEDICARE. This provision would require the Secretary to develop and maintain a system, which is widely known and easy to use, to handle complaints regarding MA and Part D plans or their sponsors. The system would have the ability to report and initiate appropriate interventions and monitoring based on substantial complaints and to guide quality improvement. A plan complaint would be defined as a complaint that is received (including by telephone, letter, e-mail, or any other means) by the Secretary (including by a regional office, the Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman, a sub-contractor, a carrier, a fiscal intermediary, or a Medicare Administrative Contractor). The Secretary would be required to develop a model electronic complaint form to be used for reporting complaints under the system that would be displayed on the Medicare.gov and Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman websites. The Secretary would also be required to conduct annual reports of the complaint system that would include an analysis of the numbers and types of complaints reported under the system; geographic variations in the complaints; the timeliness of agency or plan responses to the complaints; and the resolution of the complaints. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3312 . Uniform Exceptions and Appeals Process for Prescription Drug Plans and MA-PD Plans. Section 1852(g) of the Social Security Act outlines general requirements regarding Medicare Advantage exceptions and appeals processes. The Part D program adapted many of the existing rules for appeals that apply to Medicare Advantage program. The coverage and determination and appeals processes may vary among MA and Part D plans as long as these general requirements are met. This provision would require a prescription drug plan sponsor or a MA organization offering MA-PD plans to use a single, uniform exceptions and appeals process with respect to the determination of prescription drug coverage for an enrollee under the plan and to provide instant access to this process through a toll-free telephone number and an Internet website. This provision would apply to exceptions and appeals made on or after January 1, 2012. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3313 . Office of the Inspector General Studies and Reports. According to Section 1860D-14 of the SSA, full-benefit dual-eligible individuals who have not elected a Part D plan are to be auto-enrolled into one by CMS. Because plans vary in the formularies they offer, some dual eligibles could find that they have been auto-enrolled in a plan that may not best meet their needs. Additionally, when the Medicare prescription drug program was created, it was expected that drug plan sponsors would negotiate with drug manufacturers to obtain price concessions on drugs covered under Part D, and thus reduce total costs to the government and to beneficiaries. Some studies have suggested that Part D plans are not obtaining rebates equivalent to those required under Medicaid.", "The proposal would require the Office of Inspector General of HHS (OIG) to report annually, beginning July 1, 2011, on the extent to which formularies used by prescription drug plans and MA-PD plans under Part D include drugs commonly used by full-benefit dual eligible individuals. OIG would also be required to complete a study by October 1, 2011, that would compare covered prescription drug prices paid under the Medicare Part D program to those negotiated by state Medicaid plans for the top 200 drugs determined by both volume and expenditures including all rebates and discounts received by the Medicaid and Part D plans. The report would not disclose information that is deemed proprietary or likely to negatively impact a Medicaid program or Part D plans' ability to negotiate drug prices.

Including Costs Incurred By AIDS Drug Assistance Programs And Indian Health Service In Providing Prescription Drugs Toward The Annual Out Of Pocket Threshold Under Part D. Under a standard Medicare Part D plan design, beneficiaries must incur a certain level of out-of-pocket costs ($4,550 in 2010) before catastrophic protection begins. These include costs that are incurred for the deductible, cost-sharing, or benefits not paid because they fall in the coverage gap. Costs are counted as incurred, and thus treated as true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) costs only if they are paid by the individual (or by another family member on behalf of the individual), paid on behalf of a low-income individual under the subsidy provisions, or paid under a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program. Additional payments that do not count toward TrOOP include Part D premiums and coverage by other insurance, including group health plans, workers' compensation, Part D plans' supplemental or enhanced benefits, or other third parties. This provision would allow costs paid by the Indian Health Service or under an AIDS Drug Assistance Program to count toward the out-of-pocket threshold for costs incurred on or after January 1, 2011. The CBO score is +$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$0.6 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 3315. Immediate Reduction in Coverage Gap in 2010. Medicare law sets out a defined standard benefit structure under the Part D prescription drug benefit that includes a gap in coverage (the doughnut hole ). In 2010, the standard benefit includes a $310 deductible and a 25% coinsurance until the enrollee reaches $2,830 in total covered drug spending. After this initial coverage limit is reached, the enrollee is responsible for the full cost of the drugs until total costs hit the catastrophic threshold, $6,440 in 2010. This provision would increase the 2010 standard initial coverage limit of $2,830 by $500, thus decreasing the time that a Part D enrollee would need to be in the coverage gap. There would be no change in the premiums, bids, or any other parameters as a result of this increase. Additionally, the Secretary would be required to establish procedures to reimburse drug plan sponsors for the associated reduction in beneficiary cost sharing. The Secretary would also be required to develop an estimate of the additional increased costs for increased drug utilization and financing and administrative costs, and use such estimates to adjust payments to Part D sponsors. The initial coverage limit would only apply to 2010; the initial coverage limit for plan years beginning in 2011 would be determined as if this 2010 increase had not occurred.

Improvement in Part D Medication Therapy Management (MTM) Programs. S ection 1860-D-4(c) of the SSA requires Part D sponsors to incorporate a Medication Therapy Management Program (MTM) into their plan benefit structures. An MTM program is a program of drug therapy management that may be furnished by a pharmacist and is designed to assure, with respect to targeted beneficiaries, that covered Part D drugs are appropriately used to optimize therapeutic outcomes through improved medication use and to reduce the risk of adverse events. Targeted individuals are those who have multiple chronic diseases, are taking multiple covered part D drugs, and are identified to likely incur annual costs for covered Part D drugs that exceed a level specified by the Secretary. The MTM program may include elements that promote enrollee understanding of the appropriate use of medication and increased adherence with medication regimes, and must be developed in cooperation with licensed and practicing pharmacists and physicians. This provision would amend Section 1860D-4(c) to require Part D sponsors to include in their MTM programs an annual comprehensive medication review furnished in person or using telehealth technologies by a licensed pharmacist or other qualified provider, and follow-up interventions as warranted based on the findings of the annual review or the targeted medication enrollment. Additionally, the plan sponsor would be required to have in place a process to assess on a quarterly basis the medication use of individuals who are at risk but not enrolled in the MTM program, including individuals who have experienced a transition in care. The plan sponsor would also be required to have in place a process to automatically enroll targeted beneficiaries in the MTM program and permit such beneficiaries to opt out of enrollment in the program. The Secretary of HHS would have the authority to modify or broaden requirements for MTM programs and to study new MTM models through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (as added by Section 3021).

Revision of Certain Market Basket Updates and Incorporation of Productivity Improvements into Market Basket Updates That Do Not Already Incorporate Such Improvements . Currently, most fee-for-service Medicare providers receive predetermined payment amounts established under different, unique prospective payment systems. Each year, the base payment amounts in the different Medicare payment systems are increased by an update factor to reflect the increase in the unit costs associated with providing health care services. Generally, Medicare's annual updates are linked to either: (1) projected changes in specific market basket (MB) indices which are designed to measure the change in the price of goods and services (such as labor and equipment) that are purchased by the provider and intended to reflect the effect of inflation on providers' costs per service; or (2) the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Generally, the provision would provide for updates based on the MB or CPI minus full productivity estimates for all Parts A and B providers and suppliers who are subject to a MB or CPI update. The productivity offset would equal the percentage change in the 10-year moving average of annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity. The estimate used would be that published before the promulgation of the regulation establishing increases in the Medicare rates for the year or period.", "Specifically, this change would implement a full productivity adjustment for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, inpatient psychiatric facilities, inpatient rehabilitation, long term care hospital services and nursing homes beginning in FY2012. It would implement a full productivity adjustment for hospice providers beginning in FY2013. In addition, it would implement a full productivity adjustment for home health providers beginning in FY2015. For providers paid through the clinical laboratory test fee schedule, the proposal would replace the scheduled 0.5% payment reduction for calendar years 2011 through 2013 with a full productivity adjustment for calendar year (CY) 2011 and subsequent years. All other productivity adjustments for other Part B providers would begin in CY2011. Except where noted below, the application of the update adjustments would be able to result in a negative factor and a basis of payment that would be lower than in the preceding year. The update factors for Medicare providers and suppliers would be subject to the following adjustments :", "Acute care hospitals, long term care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, inpatient psychiatric facilities, and outpatient hospitals: Aside from the productivity factor beginning in FY2012, the MB update for acute care inpatient (IPPS) services and outpatient hospital services (OPPS) would be reduced 0.25 percentage points in FY2010 and FY2011. In FY2012 and FY2013, the MB update would be reduced 0.1 percentage points. For each of the fiscal years from FY2014 through FY2019, the 0.2 percentage point reduction to the MB would be contingent upon the level of the insured nonelderly population relative to the projection of insured population for the year preceding enactment (CBO's fiscal year estimate at time of enrollment of the bill in either House). Specifically, only if the level of non-elderly insured population is 5 or fewer percentage points above the projections, would the MB update be reduced by 0.2 percentage points. The IPF update would also be subject to a reduction on 0.2 percentage point for the failure to submit required quality data starting in RY2014. The LTCH update would be reduced 0.25 percentage point in RY2010 and 0.5 percentage point in RY2011. In RY2012 and RY2013, the MB update would be reduced 0.1 percentage point. For each of the fiscal years from RY2014 through RY2019, the 0.2 percentage point reduction to the LTCH MB would be contingent upon the level of the insured nonelderly population relative to the projection of insured population as is the IPPS update. Skilled nursing facilities: The SNF MB update would be subject to the productivity factor adjustment beginning in FY2012 . Home health agencies: Aside from the productivity factor adjustment beginning in 2015, the MB update for home health services would be reduced by 1.0 percentage point in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Hospice care: The hospice MB update would be subject to the productivity factor adjustment beginning in FY2013. Aside from the productivity factor adjustment, the MB update would be reduced by 0.3 percentage points in FY2013. For each of the fiscal years from FY2014 through FY2019, a 0.3 percentage point reduction to the MB would be contingent upon the level of the insured population relative to the projection of insured population the year preceding enactment. Dialysis: The ESRD MB would no longer be subject to a 1 percentage point reduction beginning in 2012, but would be subject to the productivity factor adjustments starting in 2012. Ambulance services: The productivity adjustment factor would be applied to the CPI-U used to increase the ambulance fee schedule starting in CY2011. Ambulatory surgical services: The productivity adjustment factor would be applied to the CPI-U used to update payments for ambulatory surgical services starting in CY2011. Laboratory services: The existing 0.5 percentage point reduction to the CPI-U update to the fee schedule in CY2009 and CY2010 would be retained. A 1.75 percentage point reduction to the update in CY2011 through CY2015 would be established; this reduction would be able to result in a negative update. The productivity adjustment factor would be applied to the CPI-U starting in CY2011, but in the application of the adjustment would not be able to reduce the increase to less than zero. Certain durable medical equipment: The productivity adjustment factor would be applied to the CPI-U used to increase the fee schedules for certain durable medical equipment (DME) beginning in CY2011. Certain DME would have received a payment increase of CPI-U plus 2 percentage points in CY2014. The 2 percentage point increase was eliminated. Prosthetic devices, orthotics, and prosthetics: The productivity adjustment factor would be applied to the CPI-U update for the applicable fee schedule for this DME category starting in CY2011 . Other items: The productivity adjustment factor would be applied to the CPI-U update for this DME category starting in CY2011.

Medicare Part B finances coverage for physicians' and other outpatient services, in part through premiums paid by beneficiaries who enroll in the voluntary program. Before January 2007, the Part B premium was set at 25% of the program's costs per aged enrollee (enrollees who were age 65 or older) and was applied universally to all enrollees. Since then, under a provision of the Medicare Modernization Act, approximately 1.7 million higher-income beneficiaries have faced progressively greater shares of those costs\u201435 percent, 50 percent, 65 percent, or 80 percent, depending on income. The income categories that those shares apply to are based on enrollees' modified adjusted gross income. In 2009, the income thresholds for those premium shares are $85,000, $107,000, $160,000, and $213,000, respectively. (For married couples, the corresponding income thresholds are twice those values.) The income thresholds rise each year with changes in the consumer price index. The provision would freeze the current income thresholds for the period of 2011 through 2019 at the 2010 levels.

The President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, would also be required to appoint a Chair for the Board. The Board would elect a Vice Chairman. Members could only be removed by the President for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. In addition to the 15 members of the Board, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) would serve as ex-officio, non-voting members of the Board. ", "Qualifications for membership would be similar to the qualifications required for members of the Medicare Payment Advisory Board (MedPAC). Individuals involved in the delivery or management of health care services could not constitute a majority of the Board. In addition to these qualifications, the President would be required to establish a system for publicly disclosing any financial or other conflicts of interests relating to members. Individuals that engage in any other business, vocation, or employment could not serve as appointed members of the Board. Members would be considered officers in the executive branch for purposes of applying Title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. After serving on the Board, former members would be barred from lobbying the Board and other relevant executive branch departments and agencies and relevant congressional committees for one year.

All requests for discretionary appropriations to fund the Board's activities must be approved by a majority vote. ", "Requirements for Proposal Submission. The provision would require that the Board submit proposals to the President for years in which the projected rate of growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary exceeds a target growth rate. Determinations of the projected and target growth rates would be made by the CMS Office of the Actuary (OACT) beginning in 2013. The Board would be required to submit its first proposal to the President by January 15, 2014, for implementation in 2015. If the Board fails to submit a proposal to the President by January 15, the Secretary would be required to submit a contingent proposal to Congress meeting the same requirements by January 25.

A rule of construction specifying that the Institute is not to be permitted to mandate coverage, reimbursement or other policies for any public or private payer nor to prevent the Secretary from covering the routine costs of clinical care received by Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP beneficiaries in the case where the individual is participating in a clinical trial where the costs would be covered by the program. in addition, the Secretary could only use evidence and findings from CCER research to make a Medicare coverage determination if the process is iterative and transparent and includes public comment and considers the effect on subpopulations. The Secretary would not use CCER evidence and findings in determining Medicare coverage, reimbursement, or incentive programs in a manner that would preclude or have the intent to discourage individuals from choosing health care treatments based on how the individual values the tradeoff between extending the length of life and the risk of disability. Nor would the Institute be allowed to develop or employ a dollars-per-quality adjusted life year or similar measure that discounts value of life because of disability as a threshold to establish what type of care is cost effective or recommended.", "The proposal would create a new trust fund, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (the 'PCORTF') in the U.S. Treasury to fund the Institute and its activities. Monies would be directed to this fund from the general fund of the Treasury as well as the Medicare Trust Funds and from fees imposed on health insurance and self-insured plans. For FY2013, the Secretary would transfer amounts from the Medicare Federal Hospital Insurance and the Federal Supplemental Medical Trust Funds to the PCORTF in proportion to total Medicare expenditures that come from each Fund for a given year. In FY2013, the amount would be equivalent to $1 multiplied by the average number of individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B of Medicare during the year. In FY2014 through FY2019, the amounts would be equivalent to $2, adjusted for increases in health care spending FY2014, multiplied by the average number of such individuals for the given year.", "In years 2010, 2011, and 2012, $10 million, $50 million, and $150 million would be appropriated from Treasury to the fund. In addition, beginning in 2013, the PCORTF would also be financed from fees on insured and self-insured health plans. For fiscal years 2014 through 2019, the proposal would require a transfer of $150 million from the Treasury as well as the net revenues from a fee of $1 in FY2013 and $2 (adjusted for health care spending increases) in FY2014 through FY2019, on each health insurance policy in the United States multiplied by the number of lives covered under that policy. Insurance policies that primarily provide non-health benefits would be exempt. This fee would sunset after FY2019 (plan years ending after September 30, 2019). The CBO score is an increase in $100 m illion for the five-year period from FY2010-FY2014 and a decrease of $ 3 00 m illion for the ten-year period FY2010-FY2019.", "Subtitle E\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Program Integrity Provisions", "Sec. 6401 as modified by Sec. 10603 . Provider Screening and Other Enrollment Requirements Under Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. The enrollment process for participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP is different across all three federal programs. This provision would require that the Secretary, in consultation with the OIG, establish procedures for screening providers and suppliers enrolling in the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs. Procedures would be required to include a process for screening, enhanced oversight measures, disclosure requirements, moratoriums on enrollment, and requirements for developing compliance programs. The Secretary would have six months from the date this legislation is enacted to develop the procedures, which would apply to both new and current providers. The Secretary would have three years to implement these requirements. The level of screening would be determined, with respect to a category of providers or suppliers, by the Secretary according to the risk of fraud. At a minimum, all providers and suppliers would be subject to licensure checks, including checks across states. The Secretary would have the authority to impose additional screening measures such as criminal background checks, fingerprinting, unannounced site visits, database checks, and periods of enhanced oversight if necessary. To cover the costs of the screening, certain providers would be subject to fees. Fees would start at $500 for institutional providers and would increase by the rate of inflation thereafter. The Secretary could exempt such fees if they impose a hardship. The Secretary would also have the authority to impose a temporary moratorium on enrolling new providers if necessary.", "The proposal would also impose new disclosure requirements on providers and suppliers enrolling or re-enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP. Applicants would be required to disclose current or previous affiliations with any provider or supplier that has uncollected debt, has had their payments suspended, has been excluded from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP, or has had their billing privileges revoked. The Secretary would be authorized to adjust payments or deny enrollment in these programs if these affiliations pose an undue risk to the program.", "Lastly, the provision would require Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP providers and suppliers, within a particular industry or category, to establish a compliance program. The requirements for the compliance program would be developed by the Secretary and the OIG. The Secretary would be required to consider the extent to which compliance programs have been adopted by providers when creating a timeline for implementation. The CBO score is between -$50 million and +$50\u00a0 million for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0. 1 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 6402. Enhanced Medicare and Medicaid Program Integrity Provisions.", "Data Matching . The provision would require CMS to include in the IDR claims and payment data from the following programs: Medicare (Parts A, B, C, and D), Medicaid, CHIP, health-related programs administered by the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Defense (DOD), Social Security, and the Indian Health Service (IHS). The priority would be the integration of Medicare and Medicaid claims and payment data. Data for the remaining programs would be integrated as appropriate. The Secretary would be required to enter into data sharing agreements with the federal agencies listed above for the purposes of identifying fraud, waste, and abuse. This provision would grant the OIG and the DOJ explicit access to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment and claims data for the purposes of conducting law enforcement and oversight activities. The provision would also grant the OIG the authority to obtain information (e.g., supporting documentation, medical records) from any individual that directly or indirectly provides medical services payable by a federal health care program.", "Access to Data. Inspectors General have substantial independence and powers to carry out their mandate to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, including relatively unlimited authority to access all records and information of an agency. This provision would grant the OIG and the DOJ explicit access to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment and claims data (including Medicare Part D data) for the purposes of conducting law enforcement and oversight activities. The provision would also grant the OIG the authority to obtain information (i.e., supporting documentation, medical records, etc.) from any individual that directly or indirectly provides medical services payable by a Federal health care program.", "Beneficiary Participation in Health Care Fraud Scheme. The provision would require the Secretary to impose penalties against beneficiaries entitled to or enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP that knowingly participate in a health care fraud offense.", "Overpayments. In accordance with CMS instructions, overpayments must be repaid to CMS within 30 days of receiving a demand letter. If the debt is not paid in full after 30 days, interest is assessed and CMS reserves the right to collect the overpayment by offset. Under this provision, individuals would be required to report and return an overpayment within 60 days. Overpayments reported after this date would be considered an obligation as defined in Title 31 of the USC.", "National Provider Identifier. Health care providers often have many different provider numbers, one for billing each private insurance plan or public health care program. The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA required the adoption and use of a standard unique identifier for health care providers or National Provider Identifier (NPI). All health care providers who are considered covered entities under HIPAA were required to obtain and submit claims using an NPI as of May 2007. This provision would require the Secretary to issue a regulation by January 1, 2011 mandating that all Medicare and Medicaid providers include their NPI on all claims and enrollment applications.", "Medicaid Statistical Information System. States are required to operate an automated claims processing or Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) to administer their state plans. MMISs must be capable of providing timely and accurate data, meet other specifications as required by the Secretary, and provide for electronic transmission of claims data as well as be consistent with Medicaid Statistical Information Systems data formats. This provision would provide the Secretary with the authority to withhold the federal matching payment to states for medical assistance expenditures when the state does not report enrollee encounter data (as defined by the Secretary) in a timely manner (as determined by the Secretary) to the state's MMIS.", "Permissive Exclusions. HHS OIG has the authority to exclude health care providers from participation in Federal health care programs. Exclusions are mandatory under certain circumstances, and permissive in others (i.e., HHS OIG has discretion in whether to exclude an entity or individual). This provision would subject any individual or entity that makes a false statement or misrepresentation on an application to enroll or participate in a Federal health care program to the OIG's permissive exclusion authority. The provision would explicitly apply to MA, PDP, and Medicaid managed care plans as well as their participating providers and suppliers. ", "Civil Monetary Penalties(CMPs). Section 1128A (a) of the SSA authorizes the imposition of CMPs on a person, organization, agency, or other entity that engages in various types of improper conduct with respect to federal health care programs. This section generally provides for CMPs of up to $10,000 for each false claim submitted, $15,000 or $50,000 under other circumstances, and an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed. This provision would add additional actions that would be subject to CMPs. Specifically, individuals that have been excluded from a Federal health care program who order or prescribe an item or service; individuals that make false statements on enrollment applications, bids, or contracts to participate in a federal health care program; or persons who know of an overpayment and do not return the overpayment could be subject to a CMPs of $50,000. ", "Testimonial Subpoena Authority. The testimonial subpoena authority grants the authority to issue subpoenas and require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any other evidence that relates to matters under investigation or in question. Under this provision, the Secretary would be able to issue subpoenas and require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any other evidence that relates to matters under investigation or in question by the Secretary. The Secretary would also have the ability to delegate this authority to the OIG and the Administrator of CMS for the purposes of a program exclusion investigation.", "Surety Bonds. To be eligible to receive a provider number from CMS and bill Medicare, DME suppliers are required to provide the Secretary with a surety bond in the amount of $50,000 or greater. A surety bond issued by a State would satisfy this requirement. The Secretary has the authority to impose these requirements on other Part A and B providers and suppliers, except physicians. Home health agencies are required to provide the Secretary with a surety bond equal to 10% of the aggregate Medicare and Medicaid payments made to the agency for that year or $50,000, whichever is smaller. A surety bond for a home health agency is effective for four years, with limited exceptions. This provision would give the Secretary the authority to require certain providers and suppliers to provide surety bonds commensurate with the volume of billing. The value of the bond, however, could not be less than $50,000. The Secretary would also have the authority to impose this requirement on other providers and suppliers considered to be at risk by the Secretary.", "Payment Suspensions. CMS and its contractors have the authority to withhold payment in whole or in part if there is reliable evidence of an overpayment or fraud. CMS regulations stipulate the procedures CMS and its contractors must follow when deciding to suspend payment. The Secretary would have the authority to suspend payments to a provider or supplier pending a fraud investigation, except when there is not good cause.", "Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) Account. Activities to fight health care fraud, waste, and abuse are funded by the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account. The HCFAC account funds two programs: (1) the HCFAC program, which finances the investigative and enforcement activities undertaken by HHS, the OIG, the DOJ, and the FBI, and (2) the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP), which finances the program integrity activities undertaken by CMS contractors. HCFAC was established by HIPAA, which sought to increase and stabilize Federal funding for health care anti-fraud activities. HIPAA appropriated funds to the HCFAC account for years 1997 through 2003. In December 2006, Congress passed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act, or TRHCA, which extended the mandatory annual appropriation for the HCFAC program by a CPI adjustment until 2010. TRHCA did not extend the annual appropriation for MIP. This provision would appropriate an additional $10 million annually to the HCFAC program for fiscal years 2011 through 2020. Funding would be appropriated to the HCFAC and MIP programs in the same proportion as is currently allocated in statute and would be available until expended. In addition to applying a CPI-adjustment to the MIP program beginning in 2011, the provision would also permanently apply the CPI adjustment mandated under TRHCA to the HCFAC program. The provision would also authorize the Secretary to promote the integrity of the Medicare program by entering into contracts with eligible entities or \"otherwise\" to carry out MIP activities. ", "Medicare and Medicaid Integrity Programs. Under the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP), CMS contracts with private entities to conduct a variety of activities designed to protect Medicare from fraud, waste, and abuse. Activities include auditing providers, identifying and recovering improper payments, educating providers about fraudulent providers, and instituting a Medicare-Medicaid data matching program. Established by DRA, the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) is modeled after Medicare's MIP program. Medicaid MIP provides HHS with dedicated resources to contract with entities to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse, and to add 100 full-time equivalent MIP staff. This provision would require both Medicare and Medicaid Integrity Program contractors to provide the Secretary and the OIG with performance statistics, including the number and amount of overpayments recovered, the number of fraud referrals, and the return on investment for such activities. The Secretary would also be required to conduct evaluations of eligible entities at least every three years. No later than six months after the end of the fiscal year, the Secretary would be required to submit a report to Congress describing the use and effectiveness of MIP funds.

The provision would require the Secretary to develop a plan along with a budget to modernize the computer and data systems of CMS. In developing the plan, the Secretary would be required to consider how such a system could make data available in a timely and reliable manner to providers and suppliers to support their efforts to better manage and coordinate care, and support consistent evaluations of payment and delivery system reforms. The Secretary would be required to post the plan on the CMS website within 9 months from the date this legislation is enacted.

Elimination of Duplication Between the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) and the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). The HIPAA of 1996 required the Secretary to develop and maintain a national health care fraud and abuse data collection program for the reporting of adverse actions taken against health care providers. This database is called the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB). Prior to the HIPDB, Congress established the National Practitioner Data Bank or NPDB with the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986. The NPDB collects data related to the professional competence of physicians, dentists, and other health care practitioners. The types of information included in the NPDB are medical malpractice payments, certain adverse licensure actions, adverse privilege actions, adverse professional society actions, and exclusions from Medicare and Medicaid. States are required to have a system for reporting adverse actions to the NPDB. This provision would require the Secretary to transfer the information collected in the HIPDB to the NPDB, thereby eliminating the HIPDB. Certain agencies and officials as well as health care providers that were subject to such adverse actions would have access to this information, at a reasonable fee established by the Secretary. The provision would also require States to have a system for reporting information with respect to any final adverse action taken against a health care provider, supplier, or practitioner. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019.", "Sec. 6404. Maximum Period of Submission of Medicare Claims Reduced to Not More Than 12 months. Medicare statute requires that payments only be made if a written request for payment is filed within three calendar years after the year in which the services were provided. The Secretary is authorized to reduce this period to no less than one year if it deems it necessary for the efficient administration of the program. As established by CMS regulations, the time limit on submitting a claim for payment is the close of the calendar year after the year in which the services were furnished. This provision would require that beginning January 2010, the maximum period for submission of Medicare claims be reduced to not more than 12 months.

Physicians Who Order Items and Services Required to be Medicare Enrolled Physicians or Eligible Professionals. In order to receive payment from Medicare, physicians are required to certify that specified services (i.e., inpatient psychiatric services, post-hospital extended care services, and home health services) meet certain conditions. In the case of home health services, physicians are required to certify that such services were required because the individual was confined to his home and needs skilled nursing care or physical, speech, or occupational therapy; a plan for furnishing services to the individual has been established; and such services were provided under the care of a physician. In the case of DME, the Secretary is authorized to require, for specified covered items, that payment be made for items and services only if a physician has communicated to the supplier a written order for the item. This provision would require that for written orders and certifications made on or after July 1, 2010, physicians or eligible professionals who order DME or HH services be enrolled in the Medicare program. The Secretary would have the authority to extend these requirements to physicians and eligible professionals that order other categories of Medicare items and services, including covered Part D drugs, if the Secretary determines that it would help reduce fraud, waste, and abuse.

Requirement for Physicians to Provide Documentation on Referrals to Programs at High Risk of Waste and Abuse. OIG has \"permissive\" authority to exclude an entity or an individual from a federal health program under numerous circumstances, including failing to supply documentation related to payment for items and services. Beginning January 1, 2010 the Secretary would have the authority to disenroll, for no more than one year, a Medicare enrolled physician or supplier that fails to maintain and provide access to written orders or requests for payment for DME, certification for home health services, or referrals for other items and services to the Secretary. The provision would also extend the OIG's permissive exclusion authority to include individuals or entities that order, refer, or certify the need for health care services that fail to provide adequate documentation to the Secretary to verify payment.

Face to Face Encounter with Patient Required Before Physicians May Certify Eligibility for Home Health Services or Durable Medical Equipment Under Medicare. Home health services are covered under Medicare Parts A and B. In order to receive payment from Medicare, physicians are required to certify and re-certify that specified services (i.e., inpatient psychiatric services, post-hospital extended care services, and home health services) meet certain conditions. In the case of home health services, physicians are required to certify that such services were required because the individual was confined to his home and needs skilled nursing care or physical, speech, or occupational therapy; a plan for furnishing services to the individual has been established; and such services were provided under the care of a physician. In the case of DME, the Secretary is authorized to require, for specified covered items, that payment be made for items and services only if a physician has communicated to the supplier a written order for the item. This provision would require that physicians have a face-to-face encounter (including through telehealth) with the individual prior to issuing a certification or re-certification for home health services or durable medical equipment. Physicians furnishing home health services under Part A would be required to document that they had a face-to-face encounter with the patient within a reasonable time frame. Physicians furnishing home health services under Part B would be required to document that they had a face-to-face encounter within the six-month period preceding the certification. In the case of DME, physicians would be required to document that a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist had a face-to-face encounter during the six-month period preceding the certification. The Secretary would be authorized to apply the face-to-face encounter requirement to other Medicare items and services based upon a finding that doing so would reduce the risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. The provision would also specify that eligible professionals include nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists who are collaborating with the physician, a certified nurse midwife, or physician assistant as defined in statute.

This section generally provides for CMPs of up to $10,000 for each false claim submitted, $15,000 or $50,000 under other circumstances, and an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed. This provision would mandate that persons who knowingly make, use, or cause to be made or used any false statement material to a fraudulent claim be subject to a civil monetary penalty of $50,000 for each violation. This provision would also add a new clause to the CMP statute, persons who fail to grant timely access, upon reasonable request (as defined by the Secretary in regulations), to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), for the purpose of audits, investigations, evaluations, or other statutory functions of the OIG, be subject to CMPs of $15,000 for each day of failure.", "Medicare Advantage and Part D Plans.

Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol. In 1998, the HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS OIG) issued a Self-Disclosure Protocol (SDP), which includes a process under which a health care provider can voluntarily self-disclose evidence of potential fraud, in an effort, to avoid the costs or disruptions that may be associated with an investigation or litigation. On March 24, 2009, HHS OIG issued an \"Open Letter to Health Care Providers\" that makes refinements to the SDP. In the Open Letter, HHS OIG announced that it would no longer accept disclosure of a matter that involves only liability under the physician self-referral law in \"the absence of a colorable anti-kickback statute violation.\" Further, for anti-kickback-related submissions accepted into the SDP following the date of the letter, HHS OIG requires a minimum $50,000 settlement amount to resolve the matter. This provision would require that the Secretary, in cooperation with the OIG, establish a self-referral disclosure protocol (SRDP) to enable health care providers and suppliers to disclose actual or potential violations of the physician self-referral law.

Recovery Audit Contractors, or RACs, are private organizations that contract with CMS to identify and collect improper payments made in Medicare Parts A and B. Congress originally required the Secretary to conduct a three-year demonstration program using RACs in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ). In December 2006, Congress passed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA, P.L. 109-432 ), which made the program permanent and mandated the expansion of RACs nationwide by January 1, 2010. Medicare pays RACs differently than it pays other administrative contractors. Historically, Medicare's administrative contractors have been paid a fixed annual budget for a defined scope of work. In contrast, Congress mandated that CMS pay RACs using contingency fees. A contingency fee is a negotiated payment, typically a percentage, for every overpayment recovered. This provision would require that the RAC program be expanded to Medicaid and Medicare Parts C and D by December 2010.
