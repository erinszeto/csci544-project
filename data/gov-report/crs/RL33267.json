{"id": "RL33267", "title": "The National Environmental Policy Act: Streamlining NEPA", "released_date": "2007-12-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["In recent years, the time needed to comply with various environmental laws has been the subject of public scrutiny and debate in Congress. As a result, numerous administrative and legislative efforts (both proposed and enacted) have intended to expedite or streamline the environmental compliance process. Although methods to do so vary, streamlining measures are often proposed or implemented when the participation of multiple local, state, tribal, or federal agencies is necessary to comply with various environmental requirements. Streamlining measures may be applied to various environmental compliance processes, such as federal permitting or approvals.", "A major focus of streamlining efforts has been the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321, et seq.), the implementation of which is overseen by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Among other provisions, NEPA requires federal agencies to analyze environmental impacts and involve the public before proceeding with any major federal action significantly affecting the human environment.", "Many agencies have implemented administrative and legislative streamlining actions, including the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of the Interior (DOI), Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps), Department of Energy (DOE), and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Streamlining efforts vary from agency to agency but usually involve one or more of the following elements: designating a specific agency as the lead agency responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable requirements, directing the lead agency to develop a coordinated environmental review process, specifying certain lead agency authority (e.g., to establish project deadlines or develop dispute resolution procedures), codifying existing regulations, delegating specific federal authority to states, designating specific activities as being categorically excluded or exempt from certain elements of NEPA, and establishing limits on judicial review.", "Streamlining proposals have generated a great deal of controversy. Proponents of such measures argue that streamlining efforts are needed to cut through the \"bureaucratic red tape\" often associated with federal project delivery. Others counter that such actions are an attempt to weaken environmental protection and lessen public participation in federal decision-making processes.", "This report discusses elements of NEPA relevant to streamlining, issues associated with determining project delays attributed to NEPA, common streamlining methods, and recently enacted legislative and administrative streamlining activities."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["A multitude of factors can affect the timing of federal project delivery. Factors that may contribute to delays in a federal project include changes in the planning and design process, changes in funding priorities, construction complexities, local controversy or community opposition to a project, and compliance with myriad local, state, tribal or federal laws. With regard to the latter, certain federal actions such as highway construction projects and permitting for mining operations, cattle grazing, forest thinning, and energy development projects may trigger compliance with literally dozens of statutory and regulatory requirements. These, in turn, may require the participation or input of possibly dozens of local, state, tribal, or federal agencies.", "In recent years, the time it takes to comply with various environmental laws has been the subject of public scrutiny and debate in Congress. One law that has been the subject of particular scrutiny has been the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321-4347).", "Signed into law by President Nixon on January 1, 1970, NEPA declared a national policy to protect the environment and created a Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in the Executive Office of the President. To implement the national policy, NEPA requires that environmental factors be considered when federal agencies make decisions and that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the human environment.", "The \"detailed statement\" referenced in the law is now known as an environmental impact statement (EIS). CEQ regulations for implementing NEPA, among other provisions, introduced additional levels of environmental review\u2014those for environmental assessments (EAs) and categorical exclusions. Generally, EAs are prepared to determine whether the impacts of a federal action will be \"significant\" under NEPA. An action is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or an EA if it is of a type or in a category known to have no significant environmental impacts. (For more detail on these requirements, see the discussion regarding \" The NEPA Process \" in the following section of this report; also see CRS Report RS20621, Overview of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Requirements , by [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report RL33152, The National Environmental Policy Act: Background and Implementation , by [author name scrubbed].)", "The preparation of EISs is probably the best-known requirement of NEPA. However, projects requiring an EIS represent a small fraction of all federal actions. For example, from 1986 to 2006, an average of 255 final EISs were filed with EPA each year. By comparison, in 1997, CEQ reported that federal agencies estimated that approximately 50,000 EAs were prepared annually.", "Determining the total number of federal actions subject to NEPA is difficult, as most agencies track only the number of actions requiring an EIS. One agency that tracks all its projects is the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). In 2005, FHWA reported that just over 84% of all highway projects were classified as categorical exclusions (representing just over 81.5% of FHWA project funding), 9% required an EA (5.5% of project funding), and approximately 7% required an EIS (13% of project funding). Although they may be small in number compared with all federal actions, projects requiring an EIS often include those with the greatest impacts and highest stakeholder interest.", "Stakeholders such as state and local project sponsors and industry representatives with an interest in the implementation of federal actions charge that meeting NEPA's environmental review requirements is sometimes done inefficiently and can be overly time-consuming. Such critics charge that the law creates a complicated array of regulations and logistical delays that stall agency action.", "Environmental organizations look at the NEPA process as an essential tool to help agencies plan and manage federal actions in a responsible way by requiring policymakers and project sponsors to consider the environmental implications of their actions before decisions are made. They also view the NEPA process as an important mechanism to provide the public with an opportunity to be involved in agency planning efforts. They argue that expediting what is supposed to be a deliberative process is not necessarily in the best interest of the public or the environment. Further, they argue that blaming the environmental compliance process for project delays is misplaced. They contend that if federal projects are, in fact, delayed by the NEPA process, it is because agencies required to participate in the process are overburdened and insufficiently funded, staffed, or equipped to meet the demand.", "As a result of the debate between stakeholders regarding NEPA's implementation, numerous administrative and legislative actions have been proposed to expedite compliance with NEPA. The activities associated with such proposals are often collectively referred to as streamlining . No regulatory or legislative definition of streamlining exists. It is defined differently by different stakeholders or agencies for different classes of projects. However, the term is often used to describe a process or procedures intended to accelerate decision making, especially when the input of multiple federal, state, tribal, or local agencies is required to comply with multiple environmental laws, regulations, or executive orders. For example, FHWA may propose a highway construction project that affects wetlands that are home to an endangered species. Within the context of conducting a review of the environmental impacts of the project under NEPA, FHWA may also be required to demonstrate compliance with elements of the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service would have statutory obligations to participate in the proposed project. These agencies, with potentially conflicting missions (e.g., protecting endangered species or sensitive wetlands versus building a highway), are then required to work together to review various aspects of FHWA's proposed project. Streamlining efforts may be implemented with the intent of expediting the requirement of having these agencies work together.", "Many of the issues leading to a call for streamlining, as well as challenges to implementing such actions, are summed up in the following excerpt from a report issued by the National Conference of State Legislatures:", "Regulators often lack guidance on how to successfully integrate the complicated requirements of state and federal environmental laws and regulations.... Depending on the complexity of the issue and the priority given the issue by decision makers, decisions can be slow in coming, thus delaying progress. Another barrier is the fact that individual regulators tend to be experts in only one set of laws and regulations. This tends to create some resistance to proposals that coordinate or integrate the provisions of different laws. Regulators tend to be cautious about integrating the requirements of different laws unless they can define all possible regulatory and technical impacts.", "This statement recognizes that barriers to efficient decision making arise not from NEPA alone, but from the challenges of integrating compliance with a multitude of laws and regulations that may apply to a given federal action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elements of NEPA Relevant to Streamlining", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NEPA has been interpreted by the courts to be a procedural statute with two primary aims. First, it obligates federal agencies to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of an action before proceeding with it. Second, it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decision-making process. In this capacity, NEPA has become one of the primary mechanisms through which the public is able to participate in the federal decision-making process.", "As a procedural statute, the courts have ruled that NEPA does not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns above others. Instead, NEPA requires only that the agency assess the environmental consequences of an action and its alternatives before proceeding. If the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated, the agency is not constrained by NEPA from deciding that other benefits outweigh the environmental costs and moving forward with the action.", "NEPA is a declaration of policy with action-forcing provisions, not a regulatory statute comparable to other environmental laws intended to protect air, water, wetlands, or endangered species. It establishes the basic framework for integrating environmental considerations into federal decision making. However, the law itself does not provide many details on how this process should be accomplished. For example, although NEPA gave CEQ a variety of duties, the authority to promulgate regulations implementing NEPA's environmental review requirements was not one. That authority was ultimately given to CEQ by executive order in 1977, but it did not include authority to enforce those regulations. A major impetus for CEQ's regulations was to reduce the time and paperwork required to prepare an EIS.", "The CEQ regulations were intended to be generic in nature. Each federal agency was required to develop its own NEPA procedures that would be specific to typical classes of actions undertaken by that agency. Separately, CEQ regulations directed federal agencies to review their existing policies, procedures, and regulations to ensure that they were in full compliance with the intent of NEPA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The NEPA Process", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Levels of NEPA Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA requires that all federal decisions include in \"every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on the environmental impact of the proposed action.\" The \"detailed statement\" is now referred to as an environmental impact statement (EIS).", "Projects for which it is not initially clear whether impacts will be significant require the preparation of an environmental assessment (EA). If, at any time during the EA preparation, it is determined that a project's impacts will be significant, an EIS must be prepared. However, if in preparing the EA the agency determines that the project will have no significant environmental impact, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will be issued by the lead agency. The FONSI must briefly present the reasons why the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.", "If a project is of a type or in a category known to have no significant environmental impacts, it is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare and EA or EIS. Individual agencies are required to specifically list, in their respective NEPA procedures, those projects that are likely to be considered categorical exclusions (CEs). For example, DOT has identified the construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes, landscaping, and the installation of traffic signals as actions that would generally be classified as categorical exclusions.", "Some agency NEPA procedures answer the question of whether or what types of documentation may be required to demonstrate that a project is categorically excluded, by focusing on whether the project involves \"extraordinary circumstances\" that may cause a normally excluded action to have a significant environmental effect.

The CEQ regulations, at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.18, specify that the term \"major\" in the phrase \"major federal action\" reinforces but does not have meaning independent of \"significantly.\" Therefore, in determining whether and how NEPA will apply to an action, it is necessary to determine whether an action is in fact a federal one and, if so, if its environmental impacts will be significant.", "\"Federal\" actions include those that are potentially subject to federal control and responsibility. Such actions include \"projects and programs entirely or partly funded, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies.\" Specifically, federal agency compliance with NEPA may be required for actions that require a federal permit or other regulatory decision to proceed.", "CEQ regulations require agencies to determine the significance of a project's impacts on a case-by-case basis, based on its context and intensity. Because degrees of impact must be evaluated, such an evaluation may be highly subjective. Although court decisions have been rendered regarding most elements of NEPA implementation, few federal courts have attempted to specifically define \"significance.\" Most often, a court will determine whether the evidence for a given project involved potentially significant environmental effects and then decide whether the agency's decision not to prepare an EIS was reasonable under circumstances specific to that project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elements of an EIS", "paragraphs": ["An EIS is a full-disclosure document that must include the following elements:", "Purpose and Need Statement.

Once the final EIS is approved and the agency decides to take action, the lead agency must prepare a public record of decision (ROD). CEQ regulations specify that the ROD must include a statement of the final decision, all alternatives considered by the agency in reaching its decision, and whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted and, if not, why they were not. Generally, a federal project cannot proceed (e.g., final design activities, property acquisition, or project construction) until a ROD for the final EIS is issued.

Relevant agencies obligated to provide comments are those with jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental issue associated with the project. For example, if a project alternative affects a historic site, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation may be required to participate in the NEPA process as a \"cooperating agency.\" If impacts to wetlands are identified, the Corps may need to provide comments or issue a permit before a project may proceed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NEPA as an \"Umbrella\" Statute", "paragraphs": ["To integrate the compliance process and avoid duplication of effort, NEPA regulations specify that, to the fullest extent possible, agencies must prepare the NEPA documentation concurrently with any other environmental requirements.

This means that compliance requirements of any additional environmental laws, regulations, or executive orders must be determined (but not necessarily completed) during the NEPA process. In this capacity, NEPA functions as an umbrella statute, meaning it is a framework to coordinate or demonstrate compliance with any studies, reviews, or consultations required by any other environmental laws. The use of NEPA in this capacity has led to confusion. The need to comply with another environmental law, such as the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act, may be identified within the framework of the NEPA process, but NEPA itself is not the source of the obligation. If, hypothetically, the requirement to comply with NEPA were removed, compliance with each applicable law would still be required.", "For additional information about NEPA's history and requirements, see CRS Report RL33152, The National Environmental Policy Act: Background and Implementation , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues in Attributing NEPA Implementation to Project Delays", "paragraphs": ["Debate regarding the need for streamlining measures originates from assertions that NEPA delays federal projects. The debate stems from disagreement among stakeholders regarding the degree to which, if any, the NEPA process itself is to blame for federal project delays. Delays attributed to the NEPA process generally fall into two broad categories: those related to the time needed to complete required documentation (primarily EISs) and delays resulting from NEPA-related litigation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Determining Delays Related to NEPA Document Preparation", "paragraphs": ["The research, data collection, analyses, and public participation necessary to prepare NEPA documentation takes time, in some cases years. The debate begins when stakeholders attempt to determine the extent to which the preparation of NEPA documentation alone adds to or delays the time to complete a federal project. Several unique aspects of NEPA make it difficult to determine the degree to which the NEPA process itself is the source of delays.", "First, other than the Department of Energy (DOE), and very recently DOT, federal and state agencies do not routinely maintain information on the time needed to complete the NEPA process. Therefore, gathering accurate data specific to the time needed to prepare NEPA documents is difficult. Also, for some classes of projects, document preparation under NEPA is generally done concurrently with other stages of a project, such as preliminary project design. If a project undergoes specification changes, those changes may necessitate changes in NEPA analysis and documentation. Consequently, the time to complete the NEPA process may be extended. However, determining if such delays are directly attributed to the NEPA process itself may be problematic.", "Another challenge related to gathering data deals with how one measures the time taken on a federal project that actually involves the NEPA process. When measuring the length of the NEPA process for a given project, an agency generally looks at the date of the notice of intent (NOI) to file an EIS and the date of the ROD. However, these dates do not necessarily reflect the time it take to prepare NEPA documentation for a given project. A federal project may stop and restart for any number of reasons that are unrelated to NEPA or any other environmental requirement. This may be the case particularly for costly or controversial projects. For example, filing an NOI in 1988 and subsequently issuing the ROD in 1998 does not necessarily mean that it took 10 years to complete the EIS; the time it took to complete the project may have been associated with funding issues, changes in agency priorities, community opposition to the project, or engineering requirements, to name a few.", "Second, a project having significant impacts on the environment is likely to require compliance with a number of environmental laws. The use of NEPA as an umbrella statute blurs the distinction between the time to complete the NEPA process and the time it takes to address other environmental requirements. The sometimes extensive reviews required under other environmental laws by agencies such as the Corps, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Coast Guard, or EPA, as well as various state regulatory agencies, are often attributed to the NEPA process. In fact, the NEPA process may be extended as a result of the need to complete a permitting process or other analysis required under separate statutory authority (e.g., the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act), over which the lead agency may have no authority. One agency, FHWA, observed that many delayed projects or failed processes can be traced back to a disintegrated and disconnected approach to meeting NEPA and other requirements. FHWA stated that experience in administering NEPA has shown that many practitioners do not fully understand or practice the approach of using the NEPA process as an umbrella for integrating all required studies, reviews, or consultations.", "Third, a project with significant impacts may be a large, high-profile, complex project costing millions of dollars. Depending on the impacts, such projects may generate local controversy and be opposed by certain stakeholders. Delays of such projects are well-known among agency officials and interested stakeholders. However, such projects make up a small percentage of all federal actions. Further, although examples of NEPA-related delays associated with such projects exist, few data suggest that delays associated with them are widely applicable to all federal projects subject to NEPA.", "Finally, it has been observed that it takes longer to complete necessary NEPA documentation today than it did in the 1970s. The NEPA process as it is implemented today is not comparable to the NEPA process soon after the law was enacted. Until November 1978, there were no binding CEQ regulations outlining EIS, EA, or CE requirements. While an EIS may have been completed relatively quickly during the 1970s, compared with today, it may not have withstood judicial review. Further, many agencies did not have their own NEPA procedures until well into the 1980s. Such procedures may make the process take longer today, but they may result in fewer overall project delays in situations where adherence to the procedures results in a more legally sound EIS. Also, there were fewer environmental laws and regulations in the 1970s (see reference to the use of NEPA as an umbrella statute, above), and the public is more involved in the NEPA process today than in the 1970s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Litigation in NEPA's Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Critics of NEPA often cite litigation as a significant cause of NEPA-related project delays. Such critics charge that individuals and groups who disapprove of a federal project will use NEPA as the basis for litigation to delay or halt that project. Others argue that litigation only results when an agency does not comply with its own NEPA procedures.", "Since 2001, plaintiffs have primarily cited two reasons for filing NEPA-related lawsuits. The first is that the required NEPA documentation (e.g., an EIS, EA, or FONSI) was inadequate. That may mean that they charge that, among other things, an EIS or EA did not include sufficient analysis of all project alternatives, did not consider all \"reasonable\" project alternatives, or did not adequately analyze the cumulative or indirect impacts of an action. The second is that an EA was prepared when an EIS should have been (i.e., a FONSI was issued when impacts were in fact significant).", "NEPA litigation began to decline in the mid 1970s, and has remained relatively constant since the late 1980s. This may be due in part to improved agency compliance after promulgation of CEQ and agency NEPA procedures, and improved agency expertise at preparing required documentation. For example, in 2005, a total of 118 NEPA-related cases were filed. The majority of suits were filed against two agencies: the Department of Agriculture, or USDA (specifically the U.S. Forest Service, with 50 cases filed against it) and the Department of the Interior (26 cases filed).", "Although litigation has decreased, agency concern regarding the threat of litigation still has an affect on the NEPA process, particularly for complex or controversial projects. A project sponsor may be mindful of previous judicial interpretation when preparing NEPA documentation in an attempt to prepare a \"litigation-proof\" EIS. Stakeholder opinions vary on this aspect of NEPA implementation. Some look at it positively, asserting that the fear of a lawsuit makes agencies more likely to adhere to NEPA's requirements. Others counter that the threat of litigation may lead to the generation of wasteful documentation and analysis that does not add value to, but can slow, the decision-making process.", "Like issues related to documentation, several unique elements to NEPA have led to litigation playing a prominent role in the law's implementation. For example, unlike other environment-related statutes, NEPA's requirements apply only to federal agency actions and no individual agency has enforcement authority over those requirements. The absence of government enforcement authority is sometimes cited as the reason that litigation has been chosen as an avenue by individuals and groups that disagree with how an agency meets NEPA's mandate or EIS requirements for a given project (e.g., they may charge that an EIS is inadequate or that the environmental impacts of an action will in fact be significant when an agency claims that they are not).", "Another unique element of NEPA is the role that public participation is intended to play in the process. In 1997, a CEQ study found that the extent to which the public is involved in the decision-making process has a bearing on the potential for litigation. The study found that some states, citizen groups, and businesses believe that certain EAs are prepared to avoid public involvement (i.e., because public participation requirements are not specified for EAs). As stated earlier, disagreement regarding the decision to prepare an EA, rather than an EIS, is the most common source of conflict and litigation under NEPA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Common Streamlining Provisions", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, numerous legislative and administrative proposals have been proffered to streamline compliance with NEPA's requirements.

In May 2003, the General Accounting Office (GAO, now the Government Accountability Office) reported that some transportation stakeholders identified state agency staff shortages as a significant cause of project delays. If a state or local agency does not have sufficient staff to accommodate its needs, the delegation of additional authority to that agency may serve to slow the compliance process instead of streamline it. Staff at the state or local level may have difficulty determining all environmental requirements applicable to their project, which could further slow the process if it takes longer to ensure that required documentation is complete.

According to CEQ, most agency CEs were approved 10 or more years ago. The regulatory process usually begins with a data request from an agency's headquarters to its field offices. The data gathered and submitted is used to develop the proposal for new and revised CEs. In developing CEs, most agencies use information from past actions to establish the basis for the \"no significant effect\" determination. New agency CEs are proposed through the public rule-making process; the proposed CEs are published in the Federal Register and open to public comment before final approval.", "In using the legislative process to designate new CEs, Congress may list specific actions undertaken by an agency that will be presumed to be categorically excluded under NEPA.

Numerous courts have said that laches is to be sparingly applied, however, out of concern that NEPA's environmental objectives may be frustrated.
