The conservation title continues to receive attention and interest from farmers and ranchers as well as environmental and conservation organizations. Contentious issues raised in the 2012 farm bill debate might continue in the 113th Congress, specifically calls to reduce overall funding levels, including conservation, and the addition of crop insurance as a benefit lost under conservation compliance. Other issues from the 2012 farm bill reauthorization debate include consolidating duplicative programs, using public-private partnerships to extend federal funding, and amending existing programs by adding new options to protect and restore resources on agricultural lands.", "Budgetary concerns continue to drive the farm bill reauthorization discussion, with additional emphasis placed on reducing mandatory spending. In the past 25 years, conservation has received an increasing level of mandatory funding authorized through farm bills. Nutrition, direct payments, crop insurance, and conservation make up 99% of the 10-year estimated baseline funding for farm bill programs. As a result, conservation is one of the four major sources of mandatory program spending that continues to be closely examined during reauthorization. Several conservation programs, provisions, and funding authorized in the 2008 farm bill expired at the end of FY2012 and were extended to the end of FY2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240). This extension did not include additional baseline funding for the 37 farm bill provisions that do not have baseline funding beyond FY2012, five of which are within the conservation title.", "The Senate-passed (S. 3240) and House-reported (H.R. 6083) farm bills in the 112th Congress included a number of program consolidations within the conservation title. The existing portfolio of conservation includes more than 20 programs, ranging in size and scope. The large number of programs has been cited as a source of confusion and redundancy, causing both the current and previous Administrations to request some form of consolidation. Other programmatic topics continue to be discussed and debated about conservation: (1) Should existing programs be amended, and if so, how? (2) How should funding be divided between programs for land retirement and for working lands? (3) Should conservation programs be subject to the same program limitations as other commodity support programs? (4) How will the debate be affected by new data that highlight the connection between conservation practices and positive environmental results? Various responses to these questions have been offered in extensive testimony at hearings, and are reflected in the policy options that Congress is considering.", "The federal response to environmental concerns related to agriculture is generally viewed as both supportive and restrictive. One of the primary means of support is provided through the voluntary conservation programs established in the farm bill. These conservation programs are increasingly called upon to support best management practices to meet federal environmental requirements; however, these programs are being considered for funding reductions. Other conservation efforts, such as conservation compliance on highly erodible lands and wetlands compliance, might be viewed as restrictive. Potential changes in commodity programs could reduce the effectiveness of compliance programs. This has caused some to advocate for reestablishing compliance requirements to other farm program benefits, such as crop insurance."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Agricultural conservation began in the 1930s with a focus on soil and water issues associated with production and environmental concerns on the farm. By the 1980s, agricultural conservation policies broadened to include environmental issues beyond soil and water, especially environmental issues related to production (off the farm). Many of the current agricultural conservation programs were enacted as part of the 1985 farm bill ( P.L. 99-198 , Food Security Act of 1985), which also included for the first time a conservation title.

Congress has continued to debate and address these concerns with each omnibus farm bill. The 2008 farm bill was no exception. While almost all existing conservation programs were reauthorized, several programs were modified to address concerns. The 2008 farm bill also created new programs, expanding the range of USDA conservation activities.", "Currently, more than 20 agricultural conservation programs are administered by USDA, mostly by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Starting in 1985, each succeeding farm bill has expanded the range of natural resource problems to be addressed as well as the number of conservation programs and level of funding. In some cases, the programs are subsets of overarching programs that apply to a specific place or a specific resource, but with unique provisions and eligibility requirements.

Others, such as the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP), Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA), and Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP), operate similarly to EQIP; however, they target specific resource concerns or geographic areas. The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) replaced the Conservation Security Program in the 2008 farm bill and is designed to encourage producers to address specific resource concerns in a comprehensive manner.

The largest land retirement program is the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which reimburses the landowner for removing land from production for up to 10 years at a time and is authorized to enroll up to 32 million acres. Other programs such as the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) use a combination of long-term and permanent easements as well as restoration contracts to protect wetlands and grasslands from production.

These programs prohibit producers from receiving many farm program benefits when certain compliance requirements are not met. Under Sodbuster, farmers who cultivate highly erodible lands must have fully implemented an approved conservation plan or risk losing eligibility for various farm support programs on all the land the producer cultivates. Similarly, under Swampbuster, producers who convert a wetland, making production of an agricultural commodity possible, after November 28, 1990, are ineligible for program benefits. The 2008 farm bill created a new compliance provision known as Sodsaver. Under Sodsaver, producers that plant an insurable crop (over 5 acres) on native sod are ineligible for crop insurance and the noninsured crop disaster assistance (NAP) program for the first five years of planting.

Mandatory spending can be thought of as multiyear appropriation in authorizing legislation (e.g., a farm bill). These authorizations do not require an annual appropriation. Mandatory conservation programs either receive a statutorily authorized level of funding (e.g., $1.75 billion available for a conservation program during a fiscal year) or an acreage allotment (e.g., enroll up to 32 million acres nationally). Mandatory funds from the authorizing law are assumed to be available unless they are expressly reduced to smaller amounts by a subsequent act of Congress, usually initiated in the appropriations process or by the authorizing committees.", "Historically, most conservation programs did not receive mandatory funding. The majority of conservation programs prior to the 1985 farm bill ( P.L. 99-198 ) had discretionary funding authority and were funded through the annual appropriations process. Since the 1985 farm bill, the number of programs receiving mandatory funding as well as the level of authorized funding has grown ( Figure 1 ). Most conservation program advocates view mandatory funding as a more desirable approach than the annual appropriations process. They believe that it is generally easier to protect authorized mandatory funding levels from reductions during the appropriations process than to secure appropriations each year. Congress has supported this by continuing to enact provisions that allow many conservation programs to receive mandatory funding. One of several concerns regarding conservation funding in the next farm bill centers on the possible reduction of mandatory program spending, without an increase in discretionary spending, thereby reducing the total level of conservation funding.", "During the 2008 farm bill debate conservation groups and producers found themselves competing with other agricultural interests for the necessary resources to expand or even continue many conservation programs. Upon passage of the 2008 farm bill, the conservation title was one of the few titles to have received an increase in mandatory funding levels, which was seen as a victory by many in the conservation and environmental communities. Conservation program funding was authorized to expand from approximately $4 billion total in FY2008 to $6.1 billion in FY2012.", "In an environment of pronounced domestic budget constraints, many mandatory conservation programs have faced reductions from the farm bill authorized levels, usually through the appropriations process. While other farm bill mandatory programs have experienced reductions in appropriations, the majority affect conservation programs. Conservation and environmental groups criticize these reductions, arguing that when appropriators reduce conservation funding they undercut many of the programs that generated political support for the farm bill's initial passage. Others point out that funding for mandatory conservation programs continues to increase despite these reductions (see Figure 1 ).

A \"baseline\" is an estimate at a particular point in time of what federal spending on mandatory programs likely will be under current law.

When new provisions are introduced that affect mandatory spending, their impact (or \"score\") is measured as a difference from the baseline. Increases in cost above the baseline may be subject to budget constraints such as pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) or cut-as-you-go (CUTGO).", "Conservation currently accounts for less than 7% of the overall farm bill baseline funding for the next 10 years ( Figure 2 ). The largest percentage of baseline funding is in the nutrition title (primarily the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps), which has long been considered to be difficult politically to reduce. If it is assumed that no additional money from outside the agriculture committees' jurisdiction is expected, then funding for any new programs or program growth will likely come from existing farm bill baseline. The three largest sources of funding after nutrition are crop insurance, conservation, and commodity support (namely direct payments). Authorizing committees are not restricted by the current division of the farm bill baseline\u2014only the total amount of baseline available during reauthorization.

There is no net cost to the extension because mandatory funding to continue most of the major farm bill programs was already in the budget baseline. A subset of the 2008 farm bill programs did not have a continuing mandatory baseline and did not receive any additional mandatory funding under the extension. This group includes certain conservation programs and is discussed further in the next section. Many of these programs would have been funded in the five-year farm bills that were developed in 2012 (both H.R. 6083 and S. 3240 ).

Many of these spending reductions were at the request of both the Bush and Obama Administrations. The mix of programs and amount of reduction has varied from year to year. Some programs, such as the CRP, have not been reduced by appropriators in recent years, while others, such as EQIP, have been repeatedly reduced below authorized levels. Total mandatory funding for conservation was reduced by over $5.3 billion from FY2003 through FY2013.

CSP is authorized to enroll a specific level of acres annually (12.769 million acres) and does not have a limited funding level. Similar to CRP, CSP pays prior year contracts out of current year funding. For example, a 10-year CSP contract signed in FY2009 will be paid annually using FY2009-FY2018 funding. Reductions in appropriations to CSP have not limited the number of authorized acres, but rather the total amount of annual funding available. This affects the program in two ways. First, because existing CSP contracts must be paid first using current year funding, it limits the amount of funding left to enroll new acres, thus indirectly reducing the number acres enrolled for a given year. Second, because the program is authorized to enroll acres each year and grow exponentially, the reductions in appropriations one year may delay the expected growth in baseline for the program.", "Just as the savings from conservation reductions in appropriations bills are not always redirected toward other conservation activities, the reestablishment of the farm bill baseline through expiring conservation programs does not guarantee that future farm bills or appropriations will extend the same level of support for conservation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Programmatic Issues", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Simplifying the Conservation Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["Before the 1985 farm bill, few conservation programs existed and only two would be considered large by today's standards.

The differences and number of programs can create some general confusion about the purpose, participation, and policies of the programs. Discussion about simplifying or consolidating conservation programs to reduce overlap, duplication, and generate savings frequently arises during farm bill reauthorization. Prior to the 2008 farm bill, USDA proposed a major consolidation of several conservation programs. While the 2008 farm bill did eliminate some conservation programs, it also created several more. Both the House-reported ( H.R. 6083 ) and Senate-passed ( S. 3240 ) farm bills in the 112 th Congress included several program consolidation measures. In light of continued funding constraints, program consolidation to generate potential savings may continue during reauthorization. ", "While many conservation groups supported the consolidation efforts in the 112 th Congress, other expressed concern that program consolidation would remove the geographic or issue-specific emphasis that was originally created by Congress to address identified priorities. The majority of conservation programs are administered nationwide. Some programs have sub-programs that address specific issues or are geographically defined in statute or report language (e.g., the Conservation Innovation Grants is a subprogram of EQIP). Other programs that are geographically specific or issue-specific are stand-alone programs and receive funds in addition to other nationwide programs (e.g., the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program). If program consolidation occurs, it could remove these previously identified priorities that allowed the number of programs to expand. Conversely, program consolidation could also lead to additional congressionally directed language or \"carve-outs\" within programs to ensure that identified priorities are still addressed. Efficiencies created by a reduction in the number of programs could be negated or reduced by additional carve-outs within remaining programs.

As the conservation effects of these programs were identified, the potential for generating multiple environmental benefits beyond soil conservation emerged and included benefits to wildlife habitat, air and water quality, and carbon sequestration. For producers, land retirement programs are attractive because they receive rental payments at acceptable levels. However, with high commodity prices and incentives to plant crops, producer interest in land retirement may be declining. Some forecasts are that these high commodity price levels may continue for the foreseeable future, thus shrinking farmer interest in land retirement for some time. Also, increased commodity prices can lead to increased land rental rates, which in turn increases the cost of land retirement programs. These factors could signal a shift in farm bill conservation policy away from the traditional land retirement programs toward an increased focus on conservation working lands programs\u2014programs that keep land in production while implementing conservation practices to address natural resource concerns. Some of this shift has already occurred in the last decade (see Figure 4 and Figure 5 ) as the percentage of mandatory program funding for land retirement programs (e.g., CRP) has declined relative to working lands programs (e.g., EQIP) and overall land use.

This leaves conservation program participation and direct payments as the remaining major benefits that could be affected by compliance. The current financial climate has caused direct payments under the farm commodity support programs to come under considerable scrutiny. Debate continues regarding their fate, and many believe that the program could be reduced or eliminated in farm bill reauthorization as a budget saving measure. Conservation advocates worry that without direct payments there will be little incentive for producers to meet conservation compliance and wetland conservation requirements. Environmental and conservation organizations are asking Congress to consider requiring conservation compliance for crop insurance benefits or any new revenue assurance programs.

Another federal policy for addressing environmental impacts is through regulation. Increasingly, conservation programs are called upon to prevent or reduce the need for environmental regulation. While the farm bill debate will likely not focus specifically on environmental regulations because most environmental law originates outside of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, debate could focus on strengthening the voluntary response to environmental issues through conservation programs. This, in turn, could influence the funding debate and how much of the overall farm bill budget is appropriate for conservation programs. ", "Another assistance mechanism recently discussed in relation to environmental regulation is referred to as \"certainty\" or \"assurance standards.\" Several states have in place or are developing certainty programs to encourage farmers to implement water quality improvement measures without the fear that those actions could lead to further regulation and enforcement under national environmental laws such as the Clean Water Act (CWA). While this is a somewhat new concept for addressing water quality concerns, similar certainty programs have been established in the past between state and federal agencies for the protection of wildlife habitat in private lands. ", "On January 17, 2012, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between EPA and USDA to establish a water quality certainty program in Minnesota. This is the first formal state-federal certainty program to be developed in the area of water quality. USDA officials continue to express interest in developing a \"safe harbor\"-type mechanism between USDA and EPA for water quality; however, no formal proposal has been released nationwide. Legislation was proposed in the 111 th Congress ( H.R. 5509 ), but not in the 112 th . It is possible that additional proposals for creating a national certainty program or pilot program in select watersheds (e.g., the Chesapeake Bay) could be included in the farm bill reauthorization debate.

The project is a multi-agency effort known as the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP). CEAP's stated purpose is to aid policymakers in developing new conservation programs and help existing conservation program managers implement programs more effectively and efficiently to meet the goals of Congress and the Administration. ", "CEAP does not quantify the environmental benefits of any single conservation program or approach; instead, it attempts to understand how conservation efforts are working and what future improvements are needed. CEAP assessments are being developed for cropland, grazing lands, wetlands, and wildlife. To date, five watershed cropland reports have been released: Upper Mississippi River Basin, Missouri River Basin, Ohio-Tennessee River Basin, Chesapeake Bay, and Great Lakes Basin. The reports have shown that conservation practices adopted on cropland have an effect in reducing sediment, nutrients, and pesticides from farm fields. Despite these gains, the reports also find that additional measures are needed within the watersheds studied.", "One of the recommended approaches is through targeting conservation programs resources to areas that have high need for additional treatment\u2014acres most prone to runoff or leaching. While a targeted approach could increase the effectiveness of conservation programs, it could also reduce the availability of funds in certain areas considered to be at a lower risk. As additional reports continue to be released, their potential outcomes could prove useful in shaping future policy debates surrounding environmental issues in the farm bill."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As Congress debates conservation provisions in the next farm bill the focus continues to be on overall federal spending and agriculture's share. Conservation funding has grown to represent a sizable portion of the overall farm bill baseline and could see reductions during reauthorization. Many in the conservation community see this as inevitable; however, they do not want to see a reduction in conservation that is disproportionate to other areas of agricultural spending. While most producers are in favor of conservation programs, it is unclear how much of a reduction in other farm program spending they would be willing to support to further conservation efforts. Recent reports and studies have shown that conservation measures are effective in addressing environmental concerns; however, spending reductions, program efficiencies, and federal policies surrounding environmental regulation and compliance will likely drive conservation farm bill discussion in the 113 th Congress."], "subsections": []}]}}
