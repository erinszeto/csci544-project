Although many receive coverage through publicly funded programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private health insurance is the predominant form of health coverage in the United States. In 2014, about 66.6% of the U.S. population had private health insurance. The private market is often described as having three segments: non-group (or individual), small group, and large group. Most individuals and families obtain private insurance through small- or large-group coverage, such as employer-sponsored insurance; some individuals and families purchase private insurance on their own in the non-group market.", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended) includes several provisions that affect the private health insurance market. These provisions create federal rules and incentives for entities and individuals in the market that build on and modify the existing market structure. Collectively, the provisions reflect an overall goal of the ACA\u2014to increase access to health insurance coverage. ", "Nearly all individuals can obtain private coverage regardless of preexisting conditions or health status, and insurers have limited ability to vary premiums based on an applicant's health status and other characteristics. To help accommodate individuals who have access to private health insurance as a result of these (and other) provisions, individuals and small businesses can shop for and purchase private coverage in health insurance exchanges (marketplaces). In addition, some individuals can receive financial assistance toward coverage obtained in an exchange. ", "The ACA's individual mandate requires most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty for noncompliance. Many have argued that unless healthy individuals are encouraged to participate in the private market, insurance pools will consist primarily of individuals who are high users of health care services, potentially creating financially unstable situations for insurers and enrollees. ", "The ACA created three risk mitigation programs\u2014reinsurance, risk corridors, and risk adjustment\u2014to help health insurance issuers adjust to the reformed private health insurance landscape, particularly the new entrants to the market and the changes to how issuers set premiums. Reinsurance and risk corridors are temporary programs, providing issuers assistance from 2014 through 2016. The risk adjustment program, which also began in 2014, is permanent, designed to help issuers address the ongoing issue of adverse selection. ", "The ACA provides financial incentives to employers to consider when determining whether to offer employer-based health insurance to employees. Some small employers are eligible to receive tax credits for their contributions toward their employees' health insurance premiums. Certain large employers are subject to a shared responsibility provision (often called the employer mandate). This provision does not explicitly mandate that a large employer offer employees health insurance; instead, it has the potential to impose penalties on large employers that do not provide affordable and adequate coverage to their employees. ", "The ACA also includes some provisions that states may choose to implement. For example, states have the option of creating a Basic Health Program to provide state-designed assistance to lower-income individuals in lieu of those individuals obtaining coverage through an exchange. State-option provisions give states some flexibility to continue existing programs or create new programs better suited to their specific health insurance markets. ", "This report provides an overview of many of the ACA provisions that affect the private health insurance market. More detailed information about these provisions can be found in other Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports. For a list of related reports, see the \" Related CRS Reports \" section below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Health Insurance Market Reforms", "paragraphs": ["A number of ACA provisions focus on changing how insurers and sponsors of insurance (e.g., employers) offer coverage. Collectively, these market reforms establish federal minimum requirements regarding access to coverage, premiums, benefits, cost-sharing, and consumer protections while generally giving states the authority to enforce the reforms and the ability to expand on the reforms. ", "The market reforms do not apply uniformly to all types of private health plans. The application of some reforms varies by market segment\u2014non-group, small group, or large group. Some reforms apply to all three market segments, but many focus specifically on the non-group and small-group insurance markets. These reforms are intended to address perceived failures in those markets, such as limited access to coverage and higher costs of coverage, and provide some parity with the large-group market, which may already have many of these features. The application of group market reforms also varies by whether the group sponsor (e.g., employer) is fully insured or self-insured. In addition, certain types of private plans are exempt from complying with some or all of the market reforms. See the text box for more details.", "When market reforms were implemented under the ACA, some of them were new to certain insurance markets; others had been in place in some capacity due to either state or federal laws. For example, guaranteed issue requires that an insurer accept every applicant for coverage as long as the applicant agrees to the terms and conditions of the insurance offer (e.g., the premium). In the early 1990s, some states passed laws requiring guaranteed issue in their small-group markets, with fewer states adopting types of guaranteed-issue laws in their non-group markets. In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; P.L. 104-191 ), which requires guaranteed issue in the small-group market in all states. The ACA extends these efforts by requiring, as of 2014, that all non-grandfathered non-group and group plans (except those that are self-insured) offer coverage on a guaranteed-issue basis.

The ACA exchanges are marketplaces in which individuals and small businesses can shop for and purchase private health insurance coverage. ", "Exchanges are intended to simplify the experience of providing and obtaining coverage. They are not intended to supplant the private market outside of exchanges. Plans offered through an exchange must be, for the most part, qualified health plans (QHPs). In general, to be a QHP, a plan has to offer the essential health benefit (EHB) package and meet certain standards related to marketing, choice of providers, and plan networks. ", "To facilitate the purchase of private insurance, the exchanges have two parts. One is the individual exchange , in which individuals can buy non-group insurance for themselves and their families. The other is the small business health options program (SHOP) exchange, designed to assist qualified small employers and their employees with insurance purchases. For SHOP exchange eligibility in 2016 and beyond, a small employer is one with 50 or fewer employees, but states may elect to define a small employer as one with 100 or fewer employees. In 2017, a state will have the option to allow large employers to use the SHOP exchange, regardless of how the state defines large employer.", "Individuals purchasing non-group coverage through an exchange may be eligible to receive financial assistance in the form of premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. Small employers purchasing small-group coverage through a SHOP exchange may be eligible for small business health insurance tax credits.

Individuals who are eligible for minimum essential coverage are generally ineligible for premium tax credits, because the credits are directed at individuals who do not have access to coverage outside the non-group market. An exception is individuals who are eligible for employer-sponsored insurance that is not considered affordable or adequate. If an individual's offer of employer-sponsored insurance is considered unaffordable or inadequate, the individual may purchase non-group coverage through an exchange with the assistance of a premium tax credit (provided the individual is otherwise eligible for the credit).", "The premium tax credits are advanceable and refundable, meaning tax filers need not wait until the end of the tax year to benefit from the credit and may claim the full credit amount even if they have little or no federal income tax liability. The amount of the premium tax credit varies from person to person. The credit is based on the household income of the tax filer (and dependents), the premium for the exchange plan in which the tax filer (and dependents) is enrolled, and other factors. The amount a tax filer receives in credits must be reconciled when filing a federal tax return. Any additional credit amounts owed to the tax filer will be included in the filer's tax refund for that year, and any excess amount that was overpaid in premium credits to the tax filer will have to be repaid to the federal government as a tax payment.

Some individuals may receive both types of cost-sharing subsidies if they meet applicable eligibility requirements. The first form reduces annual out-of-pocket limits for individuals with income between 100 % FPL and 250% FPL. The second form, which also applies to individuals with income between 100% FPL and 250% FPL, involves reducing individuals' cost-sharing requirements to ensure that the plans in which they have enrolled cover a certain percentage of allowed health care expenses, on average.

Taxpayers who fail to pay the penalty will be notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS can attempt to collect any unpaid funds by reducing the amount of a taxpayer's refund for that year or future years. However, individuals who fail to pay the penalty will not be subject to any criminal prosecution or additional penalty for such failure. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot file a lien against or a levy on any taxpayer's property for failing to pay the penalty.", "The individual mandate is often described as working in conjunction with certain ACA market reforms, including guaranteed issue and renewability, nondiscrimination based on health status, coverage of preexisting health conditions, and rating restrictions (see Table 1 ). These reforms are intended to improve access to coverage for sick individuals or those at high risk of becoming ill. The individual mandate works in tandem with these reforms by encouraging healthy individuals to participate in the market so that insurers' risk pools are not entirely composed of individuals who are at high risk of using health care services.

The premium reflects several components, including the expected cost of claims for health care use during a plan year.

", "ACA provisions\u2014particularly the market reforms and the financial assistance available through exchanges\u2014have expanded access to the non-group and small-group markets and limited the methods insurers can use to manage risk. As a result, insurers face increased uncertainty about who will enroll in their plans and the risk levels of those enrollees. For example, individuals who were previously uninsured may apply for coverage on a guaranteed-issue basis, and insurers must accept these applicants despite having little information about their health status and pent-up demand for services. ", "The increased uncertainty about enrollees and their risk levels makes it more difficult for insurers to accurately set premiums. The ACA establishes three risk programs to address different aspects of this uncertainty and help mitigate the financial risks associated with it.

", "However, some of the new ACA market reforms limit the degree to which insurers can vary premiums. The transitional reinsurance program is designed to mitigate the financial risk associated with individuals who had delayed needed health care while they were uninsured. This temporary program assumes that any care that was delayed due to a lack of insurance would be provided in the early years of the program. All insurers and third-party administrators of group health plans (including self-insured plans) must contribute to a reinsurance program.

The insurers' assumptions about the answers to these questions can have an impact on the premiums they set. But if the insurers' assumptions are wrong, they may end up underestimating or overestimating the premiums necessary to pay for their enrollees' claims. ", "Under the program, payments between an insurer and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are adjusted according to a formula based on each insurer's actual, allowed expenses in relation to a target amount. HHS is to make payments to an insurer that experiences losses greater than 3% of the insurer's projections, whereas an insurer whose gains are greater than 3% of its projections is to remit payments to HHS.", "The risk corridors program assumes that insurers will be better able to estimate premiums under the new market reforms after three years.

Individuals who expect or plan for high use of health services tend to seek out coverage and enroll in more generous (and consequently more expensive) plans, whereas individuals who do not expect to use many or any health services may not obtain coverage and, if they do, they tend to enroll in less generous (and less expensive) plans. The relative generosity of the insurance plan will thus attract higher- or lower-spending enrollees. Risk adjustment more accurately compensates insurers for the higher cost of sicker enrollees who tend to enroll in more generous plans, and it more accurately compensates insurers for the lower cost of healthier enrollees who tend to enroll in less-generous plans.

Those individual risk scores are used to calculate an adjusted average risk score for each insurer's book of business (i.e., non-group and small-group markets).
