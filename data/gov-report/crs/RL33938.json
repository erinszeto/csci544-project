In the United States, bee pollination of agricultural crops is said to account for about one-third of the U.S. diet, and to contribute to the production of a wide range of high-value fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, forage crops, some field crops, and other specialty crops.", "The monetary value of honey bees as commercial pollinators in the United States is estimated at about $15 billion annually ( Table 1 ). Some studies report the estimated value of honey bee pollination at as much as $20 billion annually. This estimated value is measured according to the additional value of production attributable to honey bees, in terms of the value of the increased yield and quality achieved from honey bee pollination, including the indirect benefits of bee pollination required for seed production of some crops. About one-third of the estimated value of commercial honey bee pollination is in alfalfa production, mostly for alfalfa hay. Another nearly 10% of the value of honey bee pollination is for apples, followed by 6%-7% of the value each for almonds, citrus, cotton, and soybeans. Overall, pollinator-dependent crops are reported to make up an estimated 23% of total U.S. agricultural production in 2006, up from an estimated 14% in the 1960s. ", "A number of agricultural crops are almost totally (90%-100%) dependent on honey bee pollination, including almonds, apples, avocados, blueberries, cranberries, cherries, kiwi fruit, macadamia nuts, asparagus, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumbers, onions, legume seeds, pumpkins, squash, and sunflowers. Other specialty crops also rely on honey bee pollination, but to a lesser degree. These crops include apricot, citrus (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit, tangerines, etc.), peaches, pears, nectarines, plums, grapes, brambleberries, strawberries, olives, melon (cantaloupe, watermelon, and honeydew), peanuts, cotton, soybeans, and sugarbeets.", "In the United States, most pollination services are provided by commercial migratory beekeepers who travel from state to state and provide pollination services to crop producers. These operations are able to supply a large number of bee colonies during the critical phase of a crop's bloom cycle, when honey bees pollinate a crop as they fly from flower to flower collecting nectar and pollen, which they carry back to the nest. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) 2007 Census indicate that there were about 28,000 operations with 2.9 million bee colonies in the United States. The majority of these, more than 2 million bee colonies, are reported to belong to commercial migratory beekeepers. The Dakotas accounted for a combined 27% of all bee colonies. Another one-fifth of all colonies are in California (about 14%) and Florida (7%). Montana, Minnesota, Idaho, and Texas accounted for 4%-5% each of all colonies nationwide. Other states with a large number of bee colonies were Michigan, Oregon, Georgia, Nebraska, New York, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, with about 2% each. Although these operations also produce honey for commercial sale, it is their value as crop pollinators that provides the greatest economic impact in the production of food and feed crops.", "It is estimated that, each year, more than 2 million bee colonies are rented for U.S. crop pollination. Available limited information indicates that the greatest number of honey bee colony rentals are for apple and almond production, followed by clover seed, cherries, and pears. About one-half of the nation's honey bee colonies (an estimated 1.3 million colonies) are used to pollinate California's current 550,000 acres of almond trees, and this need is projected to grow to 1.5 million colonies by 2010. Both locally and globally, there are concerns that growth in the availability of honey bee stocks is not keeping pace with growing agricultural demands for pollination services. ", "Rental fees collected by commercial beekeepers for pollination services may vary by crop type, and often tend to be lower for some seed crops and higher for berry and tree crops. In recent years, pollination fees paid by crop producers have increased. For example, fees paid by California's almond industry have risen from a reported $35 per colony in the late 1990s to about $75 per colony in 2005. More recent estimates of fees for pollinating almond trees are even higher, at $150 per colony or more. Among the reasons for higher pollination fees are expanding almond acreage and relatively high honey prices, but also fewer available honey bees for pollination due, in part, to colony declines and bee mortalities.

A recent report by the National Research Council (NRC) documents the extensive literature on honey bee population losses due to bee pests, parasites, pathogens, and disease. Most notable are declines due to two parasitic mites, the so-called vampire mite ( Varroa destructor ) and the tracheal mite ( Acarapis woodi ), and also colony declines due to the pathogen Paenibacillus larvae . Other reasons for bee colony declines reported by the NRC include interspecific competition between native and introduced bees, pathogen spillover effects, habitat loss, invasive plant species that reduce nectar- and pollen-producing vegetation, bee genetics, and pesticides, among other factors.", "Mite infestations are a relatively new occurrence. The 1980s saw two periods of large die-offs due to Varroa and tracheal mites: The first Varroa mite infestation was reported in 1987; tracheal mites were first detected in 1984. Varroa mites are also said to have eliminated most feral bee colonies in the mid-1990s. Varroa parasitism affects both worker bees and male larvae and can affect the ability of the queen to reproduce. It is associated with viral pathogens and if left untreated can cause colony mortalities usually within six months to two years after the initial infestation. Less is known about the effects of the tracheal mite. The pathogen Paenibacillus larvae is the most serious honey bee pathogen and causes American foulbrood (AFB), which is a disease of larval honey bees. AFB resulted in large colony losses in the 1940s, but its incidence has been reduced by the use of antibiotics and increased apiary inspection programs. Nevertheless, mite and pathogen infestations have likely raised beekeeper operating costs to pay for miticides and/or antibiotics, labor and expenses for treatment, improved management and inspection, and colony replacement of dead bees.", "Symptoms similar to those observed for CCD have been described in the past, and heavy losses have been documented. It is still not clear whether the current colony losses are being caused by the same factors or if new contributing factors are involved. MAAREC also reports that large beekeeper operations may have experienced higher than normal losses compared with the past few years, and heavy overwintering losses were reported in 2003-2004 for many northern beekeepers.", "Overall, USDA reports that bee colony losses have averaged 17%-20% per year since the 1990s, attributable to a variety of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. By comparison, bee colony losses between the winters of 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 averaged more than 30% during the year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Colony Losses from Available Surveys", "paragraphs": ["The first report of CCD was in mid-November 2006 by a Pennsylvania beekeeper overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers in several states had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases beekeepers feared loss of nearly all of their colonies. Surviving colonies were reportedly weakened and might no longer be viable to pollinate or produce honey. Losses were reported in migratory operations wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma and Texas. In late February, some larger non-migratory beekeepers in the mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northeast regions also reported significant losses of more than 50%. Bee colony losses also were reported in five Canadian provinces, several European countries, and countries in South and Central America and Asia.", "In March 2007, the Apiary Inspectors of America (AIA) conducted a survey of its members in 15 states. The survey tracked changes from September 2006 and March 2007. Overall, responding beekeepers suffered an average loss of 38% of their colonies during the winter of 2006-2007. If these losses are representative of the nation, between 651,000 and 875,000 of the nation's estimated 2.4 million colonies were lost over that winter. While a majority of losses were attributable to known causes, approximately 25% of beekeepers are believed to have suffered from CCD. The survey indicated that, among the beekeepers surveyed, more than 50% reported \"abnormally heavy losses\" with total colony losses of 55%. This compared to those reporting \"normal losses\" with total colony losses of 16%. Of the responding beekeepers, about one-fourth reported conditions associated with CCD. Beekeeping operations experiencing CCD-like conditions reported losses of 45% of their managed bee colonies. Among the leading causes reported by most affected commercial beekeeping operations were pest diseases.", "A 2007 survey conducted by Bee Alert Technology, Inc., showed that, among the beekeepers surveyed, more than 40% reported \"severe losses,\" with losses of nearly 60% of their colonies. Another 48% reported average or lower losses. Smaller operations with less than 100 colonies are more likely to have suffered more severe losses than normal. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether the general cause for colony losses was due to overwinter losses, mites, pesticide exposure, or colony disappearance (or CCD). Among all respondents, colony losses due to disappearance (43%) and overwintering (37%) accounted for the greatest share of total losses, with mites and disease accounting for another 15%. Pesticides were indicated to account for a relatively small share (4%) of surveyed colony failures, regardless of operation size. This compares to other previous estimates of winter losses from various different surveys showing overall colony losses of about 30% during the period 2000-2006, mostly associated with losses due to Varroa mites.", "Survey information reported by USDA and AIA indicate that the number of managed honey bee colonies dropped an estimated 35.8% in the 2007/2008 winter and 31.8% in the 2006/2007 winter. Preliminary loss estimates for the 2008/2009 winter are reported at 28.6%. This survey data also indicates that 15% of all the colonies lost during the 2008/2009 winter died with symptoms of CCD, compared to a 60% colony loss with CCD-like symptoms in the winter of 2007/2008. Although more recent estimates reflect a possible decrease in the rate of managed colony losses, USDA asserts that this rate of loss remains unsustainable.

Moreover, the condition is not only seasonal but manifests itself throughout the year. The term \"dwindle\" implies a gradual loss, whereas CCD onset is sudden. Also, the term \"disappearance\" is used to describe other types of conditions, which differ from the symptoms currently being associated with CCD. Finally, the term \"disease\" is usually associated with a biological agent, but none has yet been identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Symptoms of Colony Collapse Disorder", "paragraphs": ["The symptoms of CCD, based on the available research, include the following: ", "rapid loss of adult worker bees, few or no dead bees found in the hive, presence of immature bees (brood), small cluster of bees with live queen present, and pollen and honey stores in hive.", "Among the key symptoms of CCD in collapsed colonies is that the adult population is suddenly gone without any accumulation of dead bees. The bees are not returning to the hive but are leaving behind their brood (young bees), their queen, and maybe a small cluster of adults. What is uncharacteristic about this situation is that the honey bee is a very social insect and colony-oriented, with a complex and organized nesting colony. Failing to return to the hive is considered highly unusual. An absence of a large number of dead bees makes an analysis of the causes of CCD difficult. Also there is little evidence that the hive may have been attacked. In actively collapsing colonies, an insufficient number of adult bees remain to care for the brood. The remaining workforce seems to be made up of young adult bees. The queen is present, appears healthy and is usually still laying eggs, but the remaining cluster is reluctant to consume feed provided by the beekeeper, and foraging is greatly reduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible Causes of Colony Collapse Disorder", "paragraphs": ["The initial scientific search of the possible factors involved in CCD focused on four areas:", "pathogens, parasites, environmental stresses, and bee management stresses such as poor nutrition.", "Early on, researchers had tentatively removed some practices and conditions from the list of possible causes of CCD. These included feeding practices, chemicals used by beekeepers (such as antibiotics and miticides), use of bees (primarily for honey production versus pollination), and queen source. However, the scientists researching this phenomenon note that these could contribute to the risk of bee colonies developing CCD. Some scientists also wonder whether a combination of the stressors, including mites, disease, and nutritional stress, are interacting to weaken bee colonies and are allowing stress-related pathogens, such as fungi, thus causing a final collapse. Others note the possible role of miticide resistance in bees.", "Others have speculated that because most of the reported colony losses are among large commercial migratory operations, which may move bees two to five times during a growing season, the current disorder may be the result of accumulated stress, and factors such as confinement and temperature fluctuations. These stresses may increase the colony's susceptibility to disease and may also increase its potential exposure to other diseases and parasites. A 10% die-off is not uncommon following transportation, with losses of 30% possible.", "As outlined in USDA's 2007-2008 progress report, the available research over the past few years on the numerous possible causes for CCD has led USDA and university researchers to conclude that \"no single factor alone is responsible\" for CCD. This has led researchers to further examine the hypothesis that CCD may be \"a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically,\" including \"an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors.\" Currently, USDA states, researchers are focusing on three major possibilities: ", "1. pesticides that may be having unexpected negative effects on honey bees; 2. a new parasite or pathogen that may be attacking honey bees, such as the parasite Nosema ceranae or viruses; and 3. a combination of existing stresses that may compromise the immune system of bees and disrupt their social system, making colonies more susceptible to disease and collapse. Stresses could include high levels of infection by the V arroa mite; poor nutrition due to apiary overcrowding, pollination of crops with low nutritional value, or pollen or nectar scarcity; exposure to limited or contaminated water supplies; and migratory stress.

In September 2007, a research team that included USDA published the results of a genetic screening of CCD-affected honey bee colonies and non-CCD-affected hives. The only pathogen found in nearly all samples (96.1%) from CCD-affected colonies, but not in non-CCD colonies, was the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), a dicistrovirus that can be transmitted by the Varroa mite. USDA considers this research to have identified IAPV as a marker of CCD, since it is found in affected bees, but not to have identified IAPV as the cause of CCD; however, this research indicates there is a strong correlation of the appearance of IAPV and CCD together.", "High levels of bacteria, viruses, and fungi have been found in the guts of the recoverable dead bees. Early evidence does suggest the possible presence of a pathogen, given that some bee colonies have recovered once their bee boxes were irradiated. Researchers have found the fungus Nosema ceranae and other pathogens such as chalkbrood in some affected hives throughout the country. Some researchers have speculated that these high infection levels may be compromising the immune system of the honey bees, resulting in immune deficiencies in bees that may be among the possible causes for bee mortalities and disappearance. A 2009 study by researchers in Spain found further evidence that infection in bees by Nosema ceranae may be among the primary causes of CCD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pesticides and Chemicals", "paragraphs": ["Of the possible causes of CCD being examined, one that has become the subject of debate is whether certain chemicals or combinations of chemicals could be contributing to CCD, including some pesticides and possibly some fungicides. Scientists have long been concerned that pesticides may have sub-lethal effects on bees, not killing them outright but instead impairing their development and behavior.", "One class of insecticide being studied are neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and similar other chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees are thought possibly to be affected by such chemicals, which are known to work their way through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar and pollen (which is the food for young, developing bees). The scientists studying CCD have tested samples of pollen and have indicated findings of a broad range of substances, including insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. These scientists note that the doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but they are concerned about possible chronic problems caused by long-term exposure. As noted by the NRC, some studies report sublethal effects of pesticides on bee foraging behavior that may impair the navigational and foraging abilities of honey bees.", "Concerns about imidacloprid, as reported by beekeeping associations in the United Kingdom and France and by some U.S. beekeepers, have focused on its potential to affect complex behaviors in insects, including flight, navigation, olfactory memory, recruitment, foraging, and coordination. However, the NRC and some scientists who study CCD note there is conflicting information about the effect of these pesticides on honey bees. Still, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified some of these chemicals as highly toxic to honey bees, and use of some of these pesticides has reportedly been discontinued in parts of Europe because of their potential effects on pollinators. However, bee colony losses are also occurring in Europe, where these chemicals are reportedly no longer used. In the United States, the Organic Consumers Association reports that bee colony losses are not occurring at organic beekeeping operations.", "Nevertheless, a number of environmental groups are taking legal action to highlight the possibility that pesticides and chemical loads may be contributing to colony declines. For example, in December 2009, a federal court in New York invalidated the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) approval of the pesticide spirotetramat and ordered the agency to reevaluate the chemical, as a result of a suit filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Xerces Society. The pesticide, manufactured by Bayer CropScience under the trade names Movento and Ultor, is thought to be potentially harmful to honey bees. NRDC also filed a lawsuit against the EPA in August 2008 to obtain information that they allege the U.S. government is withholding about the risks posed by pesticides to honey bees. NRDC claims that EPA has evidence of connections between pesticides and CCD. Also in August 2008, a German coalition group brought legal charges against Bayer AG, accusing them of \"marketing dangerous pesticides\" and contributing to bee colony declines. The coalition filed the charge in cooperation with German beekeepers who claim they lost hives because of the Bayer pesticide clothianidin dating back to May 2008. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and France, reportedly are either considering or have already instituted full or partial bans of neonicotinoid-based pesticides due to their potential impact on honey bee populations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Factors", "paragraphs": ["Other reported theories include the effects of shifting spring blooms and earlier nectar flow associated with broader global climate and temperature changes, the effects of feed supplements that are produced from transgenic or genetically modified crops, such as high-fructose corn syrup, and also the effects of cell phone transmissions and radiation from power lines that may be interfering with a bee's navigational capabilities.

Eligible honey bee producers\u2014those who incur physical losses of honey bees and honey bee hives because of colony collapse disorder\u2014must provide documentation, and/or a certification that the loss of honey bees was due to CCD, from one or more of the following: registered entomologist; cooperative extension specialist; and/or land grant university. Additional information on this program is available at USDA's website and at state county FSA offices.

USDA's action plan focuses on improving coordination and redirecting existing resources and research for mitigation and prevention, including education and outreach, as well as expanding research and diagnostic resources to prevent future losses, working with the land grant universities. It also coordinates activities across three USDA agencies: the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). USDA's focus on expanded research is consistent with the approach taken in the most recently introduced congressional bills and with recommendations by the American Honey Producers Association and the American Beekeeping Federation.", "Under the plan, USDA would (1) conduct surveys and collect data on bee health; (2) analyze bee samples for pests, disease-causing pathogens, pesticide exposure, and other factors; (3) conduct controlled experiments to identify factors affecting bee health, including potential causes of colony collapses; and (4) develop best management practices and guidelines to improve general bee health and reduce susceptibility to colony collapses and other disorders among both honey bees and non- Apis bees. Aspects of USDA's action plan were presented at a hearing before the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans of the House Committee on Natural Resources in June 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA's 2007-2008 Progress Report", "paragraphs": ["In June 2009, USDA published its 2007-2008 progress report on ongoing and intended future research efforts related to honeybees and CCD, following on the action items in its action plan.
