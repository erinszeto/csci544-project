Controversy over Spray Eradication Efforts in Southern Colombia", "paragraphs": ["The following discussion of the controversy over spray eradication (i.e.,fumigation) of illegal coca crops in southern Colombia was prepared in response tothe controversy over this effort in southern Colombia. This short synopsis of available information on the effects of fumigation of coca crops in Colombia is onlymeant to provide a summary of various claims; it is not a judgment on their validity. ", "In its U.S.-supported coca eradication program, the government of Colombia sprays coca crops from aircraft with a mixture of the herbicide glyphosate,manufactured by the U.S. company Monsanto and marketed as \"Roundup,\" and twoadditives or \"adjuvants.\" (15) According to the StateDepartment (in its report ofJanuary 23, 2001, submitted to Congress consistent with the provisions of theStatement of Managers accompanying Title III, Chapter 2 of the EmergencySupplemental Appropriations Act. P.L. 106-246 , which provided funding for PlanColombia), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found that \"the use ofglyphosate, as labeled for use in the U.S., is acceptable provided that the regulatorycontrols required by the EPA - the labeled instructions - are followed.\" The StateDepartment also claims that the ingredients in the two additives (COSMOFLUX-411F, a surfactant, and COSMO-iN-D, an anti-foaming additive (16) ), bothproduced in Colombia, are on an EPA list of acceptable chemicals \"for use on foodcrops when the label instructions are followed.\" This report states an EPA review of \"adequate scientific studies\" shows that when properly used glyphosate \"will notcause adverse effects in humans,\" and \"does not cause risks of concern for birthdefects, mutagenic effects, neurotoxic effects, reproductive problems, or cancer.\" Itdoes, however, state that \"splashes\" of glyphosate \"can cause transient irritation toskin and eyes,\"although at the same level of irritation as baby shampoo according toone cited study. For its conclusion that there are \"no grounds to suggest concern forhuman health\" from the spray mixture used in Colombia, the State Department citeda recent study published in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology. (17)", "Since spraying began in December 2000 in Colombia's Putumayo province (where it is now indefinitely suspended), however, there have been many allegationsthat the spray mixture has caused extensive harm to humans, other crops, andlivestock. The ill health effects on thousands of children and adults most commonlyreported in the areas of Putumayo fumigation include fever, eye and gastrointestinalirritation, and skin and bronchial irritation and infections. There have also beenallegations of increased incidence of brain damage in children in these areas sincefumigation was started. In addition, critics claim, many crops other than coca havebeen sprayed, depriving peasants of food crops and other sources of income, andlivestock reportedly have suffered ill effects, including hair loss in cattle frommoderate exposure, abortion among pregnant cows (possibly due, one source notes,from stampedes caused by the noise of overhead helicopters) and the death of fowlfrom spraying or drinking contaminated water. (The effects on livestock and fowlare taken from the \"Counter-Fact Sheet\" of February 9, 2001, prepared by Acci\u00c3\u00b3nAndina, which is a non-governmental organization, and posted online at http://usfumigation.org/Literature/FactSheets/ContraDoS/AA-IPS-RAPAL%20Fact%20Sheet%20-English.htm .) Supporters of aerial fumigation, however, state that negative health and environmental effects can be attributed to drug producersthemselves, whom, they claim, also use Roundup to suppress weeds around cocabushes, and who pollute Colombian rivers with chemicals used in processing andrefining coca into cocaine in their drug labs.", "Some U.S. officials assert that many of the complaints come from those with an interest in continuing coca production, especially as aerial spraying of coca crops hastaken place for many years in other areas of Colombia without the outcry that thespraying in Putumayo has produced. However, according to a Washington Post article of January 7, 2001, about the spraying in Putumayo: \"Until recently, sprayingfocused almost entirely on remote industrial-sized coca and poppy plantations....Nowthe planes are targeting more populous farming areas ... where coca ... is often grownside by side with corn, yucca, pineapple and livestock. Often it shares a plot next tothe farmer's tin-roofed shack.\" (\"Aerial Attack Killing More than Coca,\" by ScottWilson.) Regarding crop damage, the Post reporter stated that his \"inspection offields in the area suggested that food crops have been hit at least as hard as coca.\" Critics have attributed food crop damage to the side-by-side plantings of legal andillegal crops in Putumayo, but also charge that spray planes fly higher than normal for crop dusting operations elsewhere in order to avoid ground fire, and underunacceptable wind conditions, thus leading to the dispersion of spray beyondintended targets. (18)", "Some analysts, however, have noted that complaints of ill effects to humans and animals may not be entirely inconsistent with State Department assertions of safetyunder controlled circumstances as the health and environmental effects could varydepending on the exact formulation of the spray mix, the manner of its application,and the conditions under which it was used. Some critics have argued that Roundupis not being applied in a manner consistent with U.S. usages and with themanufacturer's recommendations, and that not all issues related to ingredients usedin the mixture applied in Colombia have been explored.", "The World Wildlife Fund, in an October 30, 2000 statement, \"Comments on Glyphosate,\" states that existing studies \"may not be adequate toassess the impacts resulting from Plan Colombia's actual use of glyphosate (aerialapplications, product formulation, frequency and rate of application, etc.), especiallygiven the soils, topography, climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, etc.) plant andanimal species found in Colombia.\" (Available online from the WWF at: http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/103001.htm ).", "In a February 9, 2001 statement calling for the end of aerial eradication, representatives of three non-governmental organizations claimed that\"there is evidence that herbicide concentrations much higher than ones recommendedare being applied in Colombia\" and that \"there are no toxicological studies ...regarding the effects of mixing the Cosmoflux-4111F surfactant with pesticides.\" (19) The statement also noted that Roundup Ultra (which opponents say is the actualvariety of Roundup being used in Colombia, although the State Department reportcited above does not refer to either trade name) \"contains other ingredients besidesglyphosate and the two adjuvants.\" The World Wildlife Fund, in the October 2000statement cited above, found that studies on the effects of Roundup \"focus on thepesticide active ingredient alone, not the combination of inert ingredients actuallyapplied, thereby giving an incomplete assessment of the toxic threat,\" and assertedthat \"the inert ingredients mixed with the Roundup to increase its effectiveness canbe as, or more, toxic to humans, wildlife and foodwebs than the pesticide itself.\" TheMonsanto website states that the \"new ingredients\" in Roundup Ultra are on an EPAapproved list (#4B), but the specific \"new\" ingredients are notnamed.", "An analysis by agronomist Elsa Nivia, identified as associated with the non-governmental Red de Acci\u00c3\u00b3n en Plaguicidas y Alternativas - Am\u00c3\u00a9ricaLatina , RAP-AL. PAN-Colombia (Pesticide Action Network), claims that the aerialfumigation of illegal crops in Colombia with Roundup is \"very different from therecommended agricultural use in the United States,\" citing the concentration as 26times greater than that recommended, with negative effects intensified by the use ofCosmoflux 411F. Even though the authors of the report cited by the StateDepartment had found glyphosate and Roundup to be at most mildly toxic, Ms.Nivia's conclusion from their discussion of the effects of accidental and occupationalexposures to higher concentrations, and of the doses that proved lethal in peopleattempting suicide, is that higher than recommended concentrations or applicationscould help to explain the severe ill effects reported in the fumigated areas.
