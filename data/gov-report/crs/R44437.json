Some sources use the two terms interchangeably, and there is no consensus among federal programs and among health care providers on the definition of either term.", "Federal involvement in telehealth is varied. As of 2014, more than 20 federal agencies were engaged in some aspect of telehealth. For example, in FY2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was the largest telehealth provider in the federal government, providing 2.1 million telehealth consultations to some 677,000 veterans. In contrast, the Medicare (Part B) program, covering more than 52 million beneficiaries, the number of telehealth visits increased fivefold from 38,000 telehealth consultations (or visits) in 2009 to 192,692 in 2015. The VA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Institute of Medicine, and other stakeholders have identified barriers associated with the use of telehealth, notably that some telehealth modalities have a stronger evidence base than others. Furthermore, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), key issues requiring additional research are the impact of telehealth on individual and population health, and on moving away from traditional fee structures toward rewarding clinicians for value versus volume of care.", "Telehealth has been an active legislative issue thus far in the 114th Congress. For example, in February 2016, bipartisan legislation was introduced to expand telehealth reimbursement for remote patient monitoring under the Medicare program. In December 2015, the Senate Committee on Finance published options for expanding telehealth utilization for Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions. H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act (as passed by the House), would require CMS and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to submit programmatic information to Congress on telehealth. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10) includes a provision that encourages the use of telehealth as an element in the new Merit-Based Incentive Payment System and requires the Government Accountability Office to study telehealth and its use under the Medicare program.", "This report identifies telehealth activities at select federal agencies along with an assessment of the evidence regarding the potential impact of telehealth on health care access, cost, and quality."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Telehealth is \"the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health and health administration.\" Videoconferencing, store-and-forward imaging, and remote monitoring are some examples of telehealth applications.

For example, market analysts predict that: ", "Private insurers are likely to increase the number of plans that include telehealth services for their enrollees. Institution-to-institution contracts could lead to greater willingness by patients to pay out-of-pocket for telehealth services they perceive to be convenient and valuable. Examples of these contracts are an arrangement between a large hospital and a rural hospital to provide neurologist services via telemedicine, or an arrangement between a clinical consulting group for a second opinion and an academic medical center or hospital wherein the members of consulting groups provide subspecialty consulting to the physicians at the hospital. Alternative payment models for reimbursement and coverage are likely to expand during 2016.", "Though providers are using telehealth to overcome barriers to health care access created by geography and time, the evidence-base for its use, including issues related to cost and quality, are strong in some areas and weak in others. For example, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reports that there is evidence that telehealth is effective for certain types of chronic conditions (such as diabetes, heart disease and conditions such as behavioral health). Also, AHRQ describes how telehealth applications may lead to improvements in health outcomes, and reductions in health care costs, such as fewer hospitalizations and fewer emergency room visits, but these findings have not been tested for all telehealth settings. On the other hand, more robust evidence is not yet available in relation to telehealth and various medical specialties according to AHRQ and the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Among the questions that are in need of more evidence: What is the patient telehealth experience regarding safety, effectiveness, timeliness, and overall access to health care?

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) makes a distinction among technologies that support telehealth, noting that the technologies are not treatments in and of themselves but are the means for delivering health care in different formats, such as remote patient monitoring, videoconferencing, Internet applications, and devices. Within the VA, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) notes that telehealth technologies may include single or combined uses of: videoconferencing, mobile technologies, store-and forward technology (or asynchronous communication). CMS, under the Medicare program, acknowledges that some health plans under its Medicare Advantage (MA) program conduct health services by telephone, over the Internet, or via telemonitoring for selected Medicare beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid program, states use the terms \"telemedicine\" or \"telehealth\" interchangeably. Some state laws explicitly define the terms, and place restrictions within the definition, such as the exclusion of email, phone, or fax from the definition. Other states may use \"telehealth\" to reflect a broader definition, and use \"telemedicine\" to define the delivery of clinical services. ", "These and other distinctions are important not merely for semantic reasons but because they have implications for federal policies that impact access, cost and/or quality. For example, the Medicare statute delineates boundaries for \"telehealth\" reimbursement, and the regulation specifies the conditions under which Medicare makes a payment to a provider for services delivered via telehealth technologies.

A major caveat analysts of telehealth raise is that it may not be appropriate for all consumers or providers in situations where certain clinical, technological, and environmental factors dictate prudence on the part of the provider. For example, in its Practice Guidelines for Live, On Demand Primary and Urgent Care , the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) urges providers to \"exercise their professional judgment when deciding whether or not to use telemedicine, taking into account the patient condition, mitigating circumstances, available resources, and their own comfort level and expertise in using telemedicine.\" For example, where diagnostic interventions cannot be supported by high quality evidence, providers \"shall use their professional judgment, experience and expertise in making such decisions.

The VA's own data from 2014 indicates that mental illnesses are among the major health concerns for veterans, with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) ranking the highest.

On access, veterans and their providers exchange health information and services through integrated networks such as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) ; My Health eVet ; and Blue Button. In 2015, VA providers delivered 2.1 million telehealth consultations to more than 677,000 veterans via videoconferencing, home telehealth, and store-and-forward telehealth that were provided through one or more of those systems. According to the VA, 45% of the veterans receiving telehealth services live in rural areas. In 2017, VA expects to deliver telehealth-based services to nearly 762,000 veterans (an increase of 12.5%).

IHS beneficiaries receive telehealth services through various telecommunications systems that are set up, in part, through federal interagency collaborations and private networks. The IHS and the VA provide health care to veterans through integrated delivery systems that include VA clinical care sites. The following highlights are for telehealth activities within IHS systems (two of which are coordinated with VA and DOD): ", "The Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership (AFHCP) coordinates activities with federal agencies and private partners to provide telehealth and other health services to AI/AN populations. In 2013, the Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS) used the Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network (AFHCAN) to provide 36,229 telehealth consultations (or episodes of care) to 22,982 patients. AFHCAN provides telehealth services for AI/AN populations in Alaska and develops telehealth technologies to support clinical services. For example, AFHCAN has improved access to care via telemedicine by making services for audiology and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) services available to patients in a shorter amount of time. Using telemedicine has also opened up in-person appointment slots, and allowed other needy patients to be seen in an expedited manner. In 2012, more than 75% of all consultations were conducted remotely without requiring the patient to travel to the specialist, resulting in an estimated $8 million to $10 million savings in patient travel cost for the state of Alaska (Medicaid). Also, AFHCAN coordinates with HRSA to operate a telehealth resource center, which is the National Telehealth Technology Assessment Center (TTAC). The IHS Tele-Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) was established in 2008 to provide behavioral health services across the country through real-time (synchronous) video connections. Program managers report the following benefits: (1) patients are 2.5 times more likely to keep their telepsychiatry appointments than in-person psychiatry sessions; (2) in FY2013, IHS patients avoided more than 500,000 miles of travel, which translated into over $305,000 in savings for them; and (3) in FY2013, patients saved an estimated 16,450 hours of work or school that would otherwise have been missed to travel for appointments. IHS collaborates with private entities such as the IHS Joslin Vision Network (IHS-JVN), which enhances annual eye screening opportunities for patients with diabetes. Since 2000, the IHS began a pilot program at two sites in Arizona. Since then the IHS-JVN Teleophthalmology Program (IHS-JVN) has expanded to include 92 IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) sites in 25 states, with more than 16,000 exams performed annually. This program yields important clinical and administrative outcomes. The IHS-JVN reports that its program is more effective and less costly than a conventional eye examination for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) and preventing severe vision loss and a four-year study showed that the IHS-JVN was associated with a 50% increase in compliance with DR standards of care. However, improvements in these measures throughout the enterprise have been variable, and this variability is not completely understood.

", "Similarly, the quality of telehealth services needs additional study for a variety of services, programs, and populations. Is the quality of care and the outcomes associated with that care of greater, lesser or equal value when compared to traditional, brick-and-mortar care? There will be no single, one-size fits all answer to issues of quality. But additional research is needed to answer questions about the impact of these programs on key measures of quality, particularly at a time when there are increased calls to expand the use of telehealth across a number of federal programs as well as efforts to more directly tie reimbursement to quality/performance outcomes. ", "Finally, issues of uniformity in terminology could be the subject of further exploration. Specifically how the terms \"telehealth\" and \"telemedicine\" are used across federally funded health programs and if any differences in definitions result in problems associated with data collection, evaluation, and payment.

ACA and Telehealth", "The ACA created several incentives for telehealth advancement, mainly through Medicare and Medicaid pilots and programs. Although some of these ACA provisions do not explicitly mention telehealth, they provide support for using telehealth-related technologies. Some of the provisions have received funding. Although several provisions could include a role for telehealth, that information is not yet available. ACA Sections 3021, 3022, 3024, 6407, and 10328 explicitly allow telehealth technologies to be incorporated in and assessed through the grant making process. For example, grants under Sections 3021 and 3024 encourage the design and implementation of health care delivery models to support cost-reductions, quality and efficiency in the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP programs. ", "Sec. 3021. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). This funding initiative supports testing for innovative health care payment and service delivery models that have the potential to reduce spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP while maintaining or improving the quality of care for program beneficiaries. Sec. 3022 Medicare Shared Savings Program. Under the shared savings program, administered by CMMI, eligible Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) qualify for an annual incentive bonus if they achieve a threshold savings amount established for the three-year agreement period. The program seeks to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs. While telehealth systems are explicitly permitted as a tool that ACO groups may use to define processes that promote evidence-based medicine, it is uncertain if any funded projects are incorporating them. Sec. 3024. Independence at Home Demonstration Program. This provision of the ACA authorizes demonstration projects on the coordination of care, expenditures, access to care, and quality of care. This demonstration tests the use of teams that use telehealth to provide home-based care to chronically-ill patients through telehealth systems. Sec. 6407. Face-to-Face Encounter with Patient Required Before Physicians May Certify Eligibility for Home Health Services or Durable Medical Equipment Under Medicare. Physicians must have a face-to-face encounter (including through telehealth) with the patient before issuing a certification or re-certification for home health services or durable medical equipment.

FCC officials state that ", "[b]roadband is essential to 21 st Century health care, saving lives, improving the quality of care, and reducing costs by providing instant remote access over high-speed networks to medical specialists, health care records and training. Telemedicine applications provided over robust broadband networks can facilitate immediate diagnoses and care needed to prevent lasting damage to stroke victims, prevent premature births and deliver psychiatric treatment for patients in rural areas, to name a few examples.", "This appendix describes support for telehealth through broadband and telecommunications programs within the following four agencies/departments: (1) Federal Communications Commission; (2) Department of Commerce; (3) United States Department of Agriculture; and (4) Department of Health and Human Services.", "Federal Communications Commission (FCC)", "The FCC is the primary authority in the United States for communications law, regulation, and technological innovation. It regulates interstate and international communications activities connected with broadband programs, as well as television, cable and other communications media, and supports telehealth activities through various initiatives, including program funding and interagency coordination. ", "The Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorized the Rural Health Care Program. With funding capped at $400 million annually (from the Universal Service Fund), the Rural Health Care Program continues to seek improvements in health care quality for patients in rural communities by ensuring that eligible health providers have access to telecommunications and broadband services. The Rural Health Care Program is made up of three programs: the Healthcare Connect Fund, the Telecommunications Program, and the Rural Health Care Pilot Program.", "The Healthcare Connect Fund, established in 2012, aims to increase access to broadband for health care providers, especially those serving rural areas; foster development and deployment of broadband health care networks; and maximize cost-effectiveness of the FCC's universal service health care program. The RHC Telecommunications Program, established in 1997, ensures that rural health care providers pay no more than their urban counterparts for telecommunications services. The Rural Health Care Pilot Program, established in 2006, has funded up to 85% of the costs associated with deploying broadband health care networks. As of 2015, it supported nearly 50 active pilot projects, but this ongoing program is closed to new applicants.", "In 2010, the FCC recommended that HHS make arrangements with private insurers that contract with Medicare to receive tax credits for providing telehealth services to Medicare beneficiaries, but this recommendation has not yet been implemented. In 2014, the FCC created a new Connect2Health Task Force, seeking to support ongoing health telecommunications activities within the agency, and to provide an umbrella for all FCC health-oriented activities, including broadband adoption and health IT promotion. Since March 2014 the task force has led various activities at the local and national/federal level, such as roundtables in a \"beyond the beltway\" series of meetings, and has collaborated in a series of health technology related events with the Food and Drug Administration. The FCC and the ONC plan to increase broadband access in support of health care through 2020.", "United States Department of Commerce", "The Department of Commerce supports telehealth primarily through grants to institutions for projects, and secondarily through collaborations with other federal agencies. Although its statutory mission is silent on an explicit telehealth role, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) oversees the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), which was established by ARRA. ARRA appropriated $4.7 billion for NTIA to establish BTOP to increase broadband access and adoption, provide broadband access, training and support to health care providers as well as to schools, libraries, and other organizations.", "NTIA reports that telehealth project grants were awarded under competitive grants through BTOP, some amounting to $250 million or more for innovative programs that encourage sustainable broadband service. BTOP reports ongoing progress as well as impediments. For example, during 2014, BTOP reported 224 active awards. However, BTOP also reported that impediments such as lack of award acceptance, voluntary project termination and material noncompliance with grant terms and conditions are among the reasons for award cancellations or terminations.

HRSA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) each develop policy for emergency preparedness, including telehealth capabilities that enable responders to communicate with authorities during a public emergency. Additional agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, AHRQ, CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are applying telehealth functions within the scope of their agency missions. Of note, the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) manages the following five types of telehealth grant programs that support telehealth coordination and telehealth networks:", "Telehealth Network Grant Program (TNGP) includes funding projects that demonstrate the use of telehealth networks to increase access to health services for medically underserved populations. Telehealth Resource Center Grant Program (TRC) helps with coordinating telehealth organizations that serve rural and underserved communities throughout the country by providing technical assistance to those organizations. Licensure Portability Grant Program (LPGP) helps institutions and states improve clinical licensure coordination across state lines. Grants through LPGP have supported recent licensure portability studies for groups of physicians and nurses. Evidence-Based Tele-Emergency Network Grant Program EB-TNGP grants aim to expand access to care in remote emergency departments for rural patients and providers and to determine the effectiveness of that care. For example, a grant in FY2014 supported implementation and evaluation of broad telehealth networks to deliver Emergency Department consultation services via telehealth to rural and community providers without emergency care specialists. Rural Child Poverty Telehealth Network Grant Program RCP-TNGP is a three-year pilot program to support established telehealth networks to develop innovative ways to address the unique health care challenges faced by children living in impoverished rural areas.
