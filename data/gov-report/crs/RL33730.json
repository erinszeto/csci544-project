The law authorizes these agencies to charge fees at recreation sites through December 8, 2014. It provides for different kinds of fees, criteria for charging fees, public participation in determining fees, and the establishment of a national recreation pass. The agencies can use the collections without further appropriation. Most of the money is for improvements at the collecting site, such as operation, maintenance, and capital improvement projects. This program supersedes, and seeks to improve upon, the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program.", "The extent of participation in the current fee program varies considerably among the agencies, ranging from fee collection at only one Reclamation site to 4,185 FS sites. The agencies conducted analyses of the extent to which sites charging fees under the former fee program meet the criteria and prohibitions of the FLREA for charging entry, standard amenity, and expanded amenity fees. The NPS and FWS made little change in fees and fee sites as a result of the new law. The BLM made some adjustments, while the FS made the most changes, initially dropping fees at 437 sites. The agencies are determining fee sites and setting fees with public input, with the BLM and the FS using Recreation Resource Advisory Committees for this purpose.", "A new national recreation pass became available in January 2007. There are different versions of the pass for seniors, disabled persons, volunteers at recreation sites, and the general public.", "In FY2009, the agencies collected a total of $258.4 million in recreation receipts under the FLREA, with the NPS collecting about two-thirds of the revenue. Together with fees carried over from previous years, $574.4 million was available for obligation in FY2009. For the first time since the collection of recreation fees under the former fee program, more than 50% of available funding was obligated in FY2009.", "Recreation fees have been controversial for decades, and there continues to be a difference of opinion as to the need for recreation fees and how fee programs should operate. The current program has supporters and critics. Many assert that the program improves recreation and visitor services, keeping most fees on-site for improvements that visitors desire. Supporters contend that the current program improves upon the former one, in allowing fees to be charged only in appropriate circumstances, setting fair and similar fees among agencies, providing for public involvement in setting fees, and establishing a single national pass. Some critics continue to oppose recreation fees in general, or believe that they are appropriate for fewer agencies or types of lands. Others find fault with the current program, for instance, for not simplifying fees enough, ensuring that most fees are used to reduce the maintenance backlogs of agencies, or obligating funds more quickly. Still others contend that it is difficult to implement one national pass, given differences in agency lands and issues regarding pricing and sharing of revenues.", "Congress continues to oversee agency efforts to establish, collect, and spend recreation fees under the FLREA.

The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) authorizes the agencies to charge and collect fees at federal recreational lands and waters. The act authorizes different kinds of fees, outlines criteria for establishing fees, and prohibits charging fees for certain activities or services. The agencies can spend the revenue collected without further appropriation, with most of the money retained at the collection site, and the collections can be used for specified purposes. The act also authorizes an interagency pass that can be used at federal recreation sites throughout the nation, as well as regional multi-entity passes. The program is to terminate 10 years after enactment\u2014on December 8, 2014. ", "This new recreation fee program supersedes an earlier one, the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program (\"Fee Demo\"), which began in 1996 as a three-year trial but was extended several times. That program had allowed the four land management agencies, but not Reclamation, to test the feasibility of charging fees to generate revenues for improvements at recreation sites. While the number of fee sites was limited initially, the agencies ultimately were allowed to establish any number of fee sites, set fee levels, and retain and spend the revenue collected without further appropriation. At least 80% of the revenue had to be retained and used at the site where it was generated, and agencies had wide latitude to spend the funds on purposes specified in law.", "The extent to which fees should be charged for recreation has been controversial for decades, and the Fee Demo program had both supporters and critics. It was supported in part for generating revenue; providing flexibility in setting fees and using revenues; having the direct beneficiaries of recreation pay more for benefits; deterring criminal activity, such as littering and vandalism; and ameliorating damage where it did occur. However, the Fee Demo program was criticized as doubly taxing the recreating public; resulting in unfair and confusing fees in some areas; promoting commercial development that damaged federal lands; and discriminating against lower-income people, rural residents, and low-impact recreation. Still other criticisms pertained to program implementation, including the high cost of fee collection and a lack of consistency in implementation within and across agencies.", "The current recreation fee program is expected to continue to provide incentives for agency managers to charge and use fees for onsite improvements. Prior to Fee Demo, the agencies had little incentive to develop, monitor, and evaluate fee collection since most fees went to the General Fund of the Treasury; the agencies could not retain them for resource improvements or management activities. FLREA monies, like Fee Demo collections, are intended to supplement appropriations. In general, recreation fees have represented a small portion of each agency's overall financing, with the bulk of agency monies coming from appropriated funds. The agencies anticipate collecting about $265 million in fees in FY2011, with NPS collections accounting for about two-thirds of the total. While the fees collected are small relative to total agency funding, the agencies have noted their importance in making improvements at federal recreation sites.", "Congress had considered whether to let the Fee Demo program expire, extend it, or make it permanent, and how to structure any extended or permanent program. Central to the debate was which agencies or types of lands to include in a fee program, and how to determine fee amounts, collect fees, and spend collections. In enacting the FLREA, Congress created a 10-year program, and extended it to Reclamation. Congress sought to eliminate some of the concerns with Fee Demo, in part by simplifying and standardizing the types of fees, authorizing an interagency recreation pass, and providing for public input in establishing fee locations and amounts.", "The balance of this report first provides an overview of key provisions of the FLREA. They include the types of fees allowed, use of fee receipts, public input in determining fees, and the authority for a national recreation pass.

The standard version of the pass became available to the general public in January 2007 for a cost of $80. There are three other versions of the pass, for volunteers, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The standard annual pass is the most widely used. The volunteer pass is free to volunteers who work at recreation sites for 500 hours over any time period. Both the standard annual and volunteer passes are valid for a 12-month period, and cover entrance fees and standard amenity fees. The senior pass is a lifetime pass for those aged 62 or older, for a $10 fee. The access pass is a free, lifetime pass for persons with permanent disabilities. Both the senior and access passes cover entrance fees and standard amenity fees, and discounts on some expanded amenity fees. All passes cover admission of the pass holder(s) and other passengers (in a non-commercial vehicle) at sites where fees are charged by the vehicle, and four adults at sites that charge per person fees. The America the Beautiful Pass supersedes a variety of passes issued by agencies previously, such as the National Parks Pass. Legislation has been introduced in the 111 th Congress ( H.R. 1354 ) to make the pass available to veterans for a cost of $10 annually.

In addition to third-party vendors, the passes are available from recreation sites that charge an entrance fee or a standard amenity fee, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) online or by phone, and other associations and groups. One issue is how to distribute revenues from the sale of the pass among the agencies over the long term. In the short term, revenues from pass sales at sites remain with the agency that collects them. Revenues collected centrally, for instance through sales of passes on the Internet, are used for administrative costs of the program and repaying the NPS for startup costs of the new pass, with additional revenue split among the five agencies.

The NPS and FWS made little change, as both agencies were authorized under Fee Demo to charge entrance fees and continue to have authority to charge entrance fees under FLREA. Currently, about half of the 392 NPS units charge an entrance fee, while about 35 of the 450 FWS refuges that are open to the public charge an entrance fee. These agencies also charge amenity fees at some sites. For instance, the FWS currently charges entrance or other fees (e.g., for hunting) under FLREA at 112 refuges or other locations. ", "Most BLM areas were in compliance with the requirements of FLREA when it was enacted, and continue to charge fees as before. However, some adjustments were made. For instance, some sites added amenities, such as picnic tables, to be in compliance with FLREA provisions. BLM currently manages about 3,600 recreation sites, of which approximately 300 charge amenity fees. The FS made the most changes as a result of the FLREA. The agency initially dropped fees at 437 sites, including numerous trailheads and picnic areas, because they did not have the amenities required by the law. The FS currently manages about 17,500 developed recreation sites, of which 4,185 collect fees under the FLREA. Most of these sites are campgrounds. Taken together, a majority of these four agencies' sites are not charging a recreation fee. ", "In determining entrance fees, the NPS is using a standardized fee structure nationwide. This structure groups national park units into four categories based on type of designation (e.g., national park, national battlefield, national seashore) and other factors. The same entrance fee is charged at each park unit in a category. For instance, for category 2 units, namely, national seashores, recreation areas, monuments, lakeshores, and historic parks, the entrance fee is $7 per person, $10 per motorcycle, $15 per vehicle, and $30 per annual pass.", "The FWS typically charges daily entrance fees of $5 per vehicle and $15 for a refuge-specific annual pass. For particular activities, such as hunts, fees are based on a market analysis. FWS seeks consistency of fees within regions, based on related state and private fees. BLM sets fees based on the amenities available at recreation sites, using low, moderate, and high categories. The FS bases fees on local market rates and a variety of factors including amenities available, site condition, and operation and maintenance costs. The average fees at FS sites are approximately $6 for day use and $9 for overnight use. ", "FS use of high-impact recreation area (HIRA) designations for charging fees has been controversial. While the FLREA does not mention HIRAs, the agencies have agreed to define an HIRA as an area of concentrated recreational use that includes a variety of developed sites providing a similar recreation opportunity. Further, it is a contiguous area composed of places, activities, or special, natural, or cultural features that is the focal point of recreation and that has clear access points and boundaries. The FS views it as more convenient for users to pay fees for use of these areas rather than to pay separate fees at each of their sites. The agency notes that collections are used for upkeep of facilities in the areas. Some of the HIRAs have been criticized by recreationists as broad designations for large tracts of land lacking in the amenities required by the FLREA.", "The FS examined the use of fees at its HIRAs in 2007-2008, and expects to present its findings to the RACs. The FS currently is considering fee changes in some HIRAs and is developing new directives on these areas, which will be made available for public comment. The agency anticipates that some fee changes could result.", "While the FLREA also applies to Reclamation, the agency is charging a fee under FLREA at only one site.

Other Reclamation recreation areas are managed by other federal agencies, and these agencies determine whether the areas charge fees under the FLREA. Of Reclamation's 289 developed recreation sites, 33 are managed exclusively by the agency. Reclamation determined that only six of these sites it manages directly would meet the criteria to charge amenity fees. In reviewing whether and to what extent these areas should participate, Reclamation examined whether the costs of implementing and participating in the program would exceed expected revenues. Reclamation also assessed its authority to charge recreation fees under another authority that was not repealed by the FLREA\u2014the Federal Water Project Recreation Act.

", "Two agencies, the NPS and FWS, have projected how they would spend their recreation fee revenues during the five-year period from FY2009 to FY2013. Priorities for the two agencies include maintenance and visitor services. The BLM, FS, and Reclamation did not similarly publish five-year projections.", "The NPS expects to dedicate the largest share of its funds to reducing the agency's backlog of deferred maintenance. Specifically, the NPS expects to spend a total of $1.04 billion over five years (from FY2009 to FY2013), with $425.0 million (41%) on deferred maintenance. Agencies report annual estimates of the deferred maintenance of their facilities. DOI estimates deferred maintenance for the NPS for FY2009 at between $8.23 billion and $12.11 billion, with a mid-range figure of $10.17 billion. Fifty-five percent of the total deferred maintenance was for roads, bridges, and trails; 19% was for buildings; and 26% was for other structures.", "The NPS projects spending other portions of the $1.04 billion as follows: $200.0 million (19%) on visitor services, $185.9 million (18%) on direct costs/costs of collection, $72.5 million (7%) on non-deferred maintenance, $70.0 million (7%) on habitat restoration, and $82.0 million (8%) on other purposes.", "The FWS anticipates spending $28.4 million over the five-year period. The largest share, $12.1 million (43%), would be used for visitor services. For deferred maintenance, the FWS projects spending $5.4 million (19%) over five years. For FY2009, DOI estimates deferred maintenance for the FWS at between $2.44 billion and $3.59 billion. The FWS anticipates spending other portions of the $28.4 million as follows: $3.5 million (12%) for direct costs/costs of collection; $2.8 million (10%) for non-deferred maintenance; $1.7 million (6%) for administrative, overhead, and indirect costs; and $3.0 million (11%) for other purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unobligated Balances", "paragraphs": ["The recreation fee program historically has had a large balance of unobligated funds. These revenues accumulated under the former Fee Demo program as well as the current program under FLREA. Typically, all of the fees collected during a year are not spent during that year. Questions have arisen as to why the agencies have not used available monies more quickly. Reasons include a need to carry over funds for the next year's operations and for large projects; insufficient staff at some units to administer and implement projects; and the time needed for environmental analysis, design, and engineering.", "FY2009 marked the first year in which more than half of available recreation revenues were obligated by the four agencies. Annual obligations have increased from 20% of total funds available in FY1997, the outset of the former fee program, to 53% in FY2009. Also during this period, revenues and obligations have increased considerably in absolute terms. In FY1997, total funds available for obligation were $55.3 million, of which $11.0 million were obligated. In FY2009, $574.4 million were available for obligation, of which $304.8 million were obligated. That left a combined unobligated balance of recreation fees totaling $269.6 million in FY2009\u201447% of all available revenue. ", " Figure 1 depicts the total recreation revenues available for obligation and the total obligated since the inception of the former Fee Demo in FY1997. For each fiscal year, the first bar shows the total funding available for obligation, comprised of the recreation fees collected during the fiscal year (the bottom part of the bar) and the unobligated balance of recreation fees carried over from the previous fiscal year (top part of the bar). The second bar shows the funding that was obligated in each fiscal year. ", "The percent of recreation funds obligated by the four agencies increased from 46% in FY2008 to 53% in FY2009, primarily due to enhanced NPS efforts to reduce its large balance of unobligated funds. For instance, the agency implemented a Recreation Fee Comprehensive Plan covering all fee projects over five years. Park units provide annual updates to include a timeline for project completion. For the first time in FY2009, NPS obligated more than half of the monies available for obligation (50.5%). An NPS goal is to reduce its unobligated balance further, from $218.4 million in FY2009, to approximately $150 million by September 30, 2010, and $80 million by January 1, 2011. To achieve this goal, the agency is limiting the percent of revenue that park units can carry over from year to year. Parks that do not achieve the carryover standard will be penalized. For instance, as of January 1, 2011, park units will lose their carryover funds if the unobligated carryover balance exceeds 35% of annual recreation revenues. ", "The NPS also is taking actions to speed up the use of the 20% of recreation revenues available to be used agency-wide. For example, funds are to be allocated to projects by December 31 each year. If the funds are not fully obligated by December 31 of the following year, they will be reallocated to other projects.", "The FWS is the only one of the four agencies that obligated less than half of the funds (42%) available during FY2009. The agency has issued guidance for sites to increase the rate of obligations to at least 50%, and has projected obligations for FY2010 and FY2011 at between 62% and 63%. BLM obligated 58% of available FY2009 funds, while the FS had the highest rate of obligation at 65%. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
