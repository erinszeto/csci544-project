Following hearings before the House Ways and Means, Senate Finance, and bothJudiciary Committees, the House passed the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Implementation Act( H.R. 2738 ) by a vote of 270 to 156, followed by the Senate one week later, 66 to 31. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on September 3, 2003 ( P.L. 108-77 ) and it willtake effect on January 1, 2004.", "Chile has now joined a select group of only five other countries that have an FTA with theUnited States (Canada, Mexico, Jordan, Singapore, and Israel). Although many point to the potentialfor trade growth between the two countries, the significance of this FTA runs deeper: 1) it is the firstagreement with a South American country; 2) it is an agreement with one of the most open andreformed economies in Latin America; 3) it exemplifies how trade policy issues, including thosewith social and economic implications, can be resolved between a small developing country and alarge developed one; and, 4) it may prove to be a step toward completing the Free Trade Area of theAmericas.", "The FTA allows increased market access, with 85% of bilateral trade in consumer andindustrial products eligible for duty-free treatment immediately, and other product tariff rates beingreduced over time. Some 75% of U.S. farm exports will enter Chile duty-free within four years andall duties will be fully phased out within 12 years after implementation of the agreement. For Chile,95% of its export products gain duty-free status immediately and only 1.2% fall into the longest12-year phase-out period. Other critical issues resolved included environment and labor provisions,more open government procurement rules, increased access for services trade, greater protection ofU.S. investment and intellectual property, and creation of a new e-commerce chapter. The traderemedies chapter is limited to safeguards so there is no change to the antidumping and countervailingduty options currently available to both countries.", "The bilateral negotiation was a challenging exercise for both countries and although abroad-based agreement was struck, a few issues were controversial for many Members of Congress,as expressed at hearings in both the House and the Senate. Overall, because there are now multipleFTAs being contemplated, there was an overarching concern that provisions in the Chile FTA mightbecome a \"template\" for others that follow. In particular, attention turned to language governingdispute resolution treatment of labor provisions, and financial transfers (capital controls), as well asthe temporary entry for business persons. These and other issues are discussed in this report, whichprovides background and analysis on Chile's economy, trade relations, and the bilateral FTA. Because Congress has completed action on this FTA and it has become law, this is the final versionof the report."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Why a U.S.-Chile FTA?", "paragraphs": ["Trade agreements evoke strong reactions from supporters and opponents alike. Nowhere isthis debate more alive than in the U.S. Congress, which for eight years was at an impasse overpassage of trade promotion authority (TPA) until it renewed TPA in August 2002 as part of theTrade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ). Without TPA, the politically charged nature of trade negotiationsmade passage of implementing legislation for multilateral and regional agreements more uncertain. In addition to complex multilateral trade arrangements, the United States has pursued simplerbilateral agreements that were expected to be less politically sensitive and therefore more likely togain congressional approval, especially if TPA had not been renewed. On September 28, 2001, forexample, President Bush signed into law the implementing legislation for the U.S.-Jordan FTA ( P.L.107-43 ). Bilateral FTAs with Singapore and Chile were pursued with the expectation of similarsupport.", "Opposition to bilateral FTAs, however, has heated up for both economic and politicalreasons. Economists, even those who support free trade, point out that bilateral (and regional)agreements are poor substitutes for multilateral arrangements. Although both countries in a bilateralarrangement may see their welfare improve through trade creation, the agreement may also causetrade (and investment) diversion, which can negatively affect those both in and outside of theagreement. Although trade diversion is often difficult to assess, it is a real consideration in pursuingnegotiations below the multilateral level. (1) ", "In addition to economists' questions over the trade effects of bilateral agreements, there isvehement opposition by various interest groups. Perhaps first among many are the import-competingindustries that bear the brunt of the adjustment costs of a trade agreement. Despite the welfare gainsto society as a whole (e.g. more efficient resource allocation, lower priced imports, greater selectionof goods), those industries subject to increased competition face potentially serious pressure to adjusttheir operations to become more efficient, lower-cost producers. Competition is generally acceptedas a tenet of doing business in a market economy, and on a national level, these adjustment costs maybe small and lead to greater productivity. When the rules change because of trade agreements,however, affected workers and industries resist strongly and their concerns are an integral part of thetrade liberalization debate.", "Strong criticism of virtually all trade agreements also arises from groups arguing that anyarrangement is unacceptable unless it includes strong provisions addressing the impact of the tradeagreement on labor and environmental conditions. When joined with other groups protesting\"globalization\" in general, a formidable coalition is created. Collectively, these interest groups raisethe question of whether trade agreements enhance the social welfare of participating countries. Given the intensity of debate and amount of effort and resources needed to consummate an FTA,some questioned whether the marginal gains from a U.S.-Chile bilateral agreement would bejustified given that Chile is a small and distant U.S. trade partner, and already has a relatively openeconomy.", "Advocates of the U.S.-Chile FTA responded that it offered both economic and political gains,with Chile seen as a potential strategic foothold in South America, a region historically linkedclosely with Europe and Asia. From an economic perspective, U.S. business interests consideredChile a prime target for expanding exports and repeatedly stressed the need to reduce the highertariffs they faced relative to Canada and other countries that already had FTAs with Chile. Lower-cost U.S. imports from Chile also provided benefits to individual and business consumers. Further, some of Chile's exports to the United States have zero or low tariffs already, suggesting thatthe adjustment costs to import-competing firms could be low (see Appendix C ). U.S. investors alsosaw Chile's political and economic stability as attractive for foreign investment.", "From a trade strategy perspective, it was argued that a U.S.-Chile FTA would support U.S.initiatives with the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), currently under negotiation, byencouraging greater Chilean support for U.S. issues and perhaps even helping define key negotiatingparameters (e.g. labor and environment provisions) that could be precedent-setting. (2) The U.S.-Chile FTA was alsooffered as a compelling case for passage of TPA legislation, which would serve as a signal to LatinAmerica and the rest of the world of the U.S. commitment to pursue and complete trade agreements. ", "Chile also saw a logic in prioritizing an FTA with the United States because exportpromotion has been a building block of its growth and development strategy. Guaranteed access tothe large U.S. market offers opportunities for increased and perhaps more diversified trade. Chilealso envisioned increased foreign investment as an attendant benefit of the FTA, and argued that itswell-established track record on economic and trade reform made it the Latin American country mostready to negotiate a bilateral FTA. In short, despite its relatively small economy, Chile presenteditself as a country ready, willing, and able to negotiate a mutually beneficial FTA with the UnitedStates.", "In addition to the benefits that were expected to accrue to U.S. businesses, investors, andconsumers, an FTA with Chile was also seen as an opportunity for the United States to supporteconomic and trade reform in Latin America, for which Chile had become a regional model. Tradewas a big part of the economic growth and development story in Chile, and linked directly toincreased productivity, higher standards of living, greater diffusion of technology, and overallmodernization of the country. Therefore, the United States, it was argued, should support these gainsbecause they are a foundation for continued economic, social, and political stability and progress inthe region. Trade agreements were also presented as playing a role in development and have theadded benefit of \"locking in\" reforms, lending a sense of permanence to economic and politicalconditions that is conducive to attracting and keeping foreign trade and investment.", "Clearly, there were competing viewpoints on the desirability of a U.S.-Chile FTA. A lookat Chile's economic development is one way of addressing many, if not all, of the issues highlightedabove precisely because Chile has been an early and aggressive reformer of economic and tradepolicy in Latin America. In this light, to the extent that the welfare of Chilean society has improvedwith economic openness, it may be one indication that freer trade can support a broad array ofeconomic and political goals. It is with this approach in mind that this report integrates a discussionof Chile's economic growth and development with trade policy issues raised in both the United Statesand Chile."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Reform in Chile", "paragraphs": ["Chile has become one of the most open, reformed, and developed economies in LatinAmerica, a rebuilding process initiated under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet(1973-90) and accelerated under civilian government following the return of democratic rule in 1990. Chile transformed its state-dominated economy into one grounded in market-based economicprinciples, first by stabilizing the economy and then restructuring it (e.g., lifting price controls,deregulating labor markets, privatizing state enterprises, reducing trade and exchange raterestrictions). As part of the process, Chile weathered some devastating domestic setbacks, includingthe 1982 economic collapse, followed by the sudden onset of the Latin American debt crisis. Chilesurvived it all, however, and eventually thrived economically, although not without incurringsignificant social costs along the way. (3) ", "Economic reform has continued into the 21st century and actually coincided with a period ofstrong economic growth that held for most of the last decade (see table 1 ). Currently, Chile isadjusting to the slower economic growth experienced both at home and abroad over the past twoyears. In 2002, Chile's gross domestic product (GDP) rose by only 1.7%, which was higher thanmany of its neighbors. Although, this reflects a slower growth rate compared to average economicgrowth of over 5% in the late 1990s, Chile's economy has proven resilient in the face a globaleconomic downturn and contagion from the Argentine financial crisis.", " Table 1. Chile: Selected Economic and FinancialIndicators", "Data Source: International Monetary Fund and Central Bank of Chile.", "Chile's current macroeconomic management rests on three policy pillars: a flexible exchangerate; inflation-targeting monetary policy; and strict fiscal discipline aimed at generating a publicsector surplus. On the positive side, tight fiscal control has kept Chile's public external debt positionrelatively low, helping restrain inflation to 2.4% in 2002 and leaving room for monetary policy tosupport economic growth as well as price stability. Productivity levels have been sufficient to seereal wage growth, as well. On the negative side, unemployment has remained around 9%, a naggingproblem facing Chilean policy makers.", "Trade reform began in the 1970s and helped transform the economy. By dismantling itsmultilevel tariff schedule and reducing nontariff barriers, Chile sought to engage foreign marketsmore aggressively and open itself to international competition. The uniform average nominal importtariff rate fell from 105% in 1973 to 15% in 1988, and to 11% in 1991 under civilian government. Chile then reduced the tariff rate by 1 percentage point each year until it reached 6% on January 1,2003. Although not without adjustment costs, the competitive pressures of trade reform have clearlyincreased productivity and economic growth.", "Continuing a trend since the mid-1980s, Chile has recently made a number of simplifyingcapital market reforms, including abandoning its exchange rate band in favor of a floating system,eliminating most controls on foreign capital, including the one-year, non-remunerated reserverequirement, and reducing and equalizing capital gains treatment of domestic and foreigninvestment. (4) Changes incapital controls and exchange rate management have been essential to spurring Chile's export-ledgrowth. Privatization and deregulation have also progressed beyond financial services to includetelecommunications, energy, and selected public infrastructure, with Chile also leading LatinAmerica in the divestiture of public-owned enterprises.", "Chile's record of reform, growth, and development corresponds with increased measures ofincome and social well being. In 2001, Chile's per capita income level was second only toArgentina's in Latin America and will likely be first once data reflect Argentina's financial crisis. In addition, Chile's human development index (HDI) for 2002 ranked second in Latin Americabehind Argentina and ahead of the much larger economies of Brazil and Mexico. (5) Welfare gains for the poorersegments of Chilean society are also being seen, with a relatively low child mortality rate andabsolute measures of poverty declining over the past decade and registering lower than most otherLatin American countries. (6) High unemployment and a skewed income distribution in line withthe rest of the region, however, point to the need to increase the quality and quantity of workforceparticipation, which is related to improving education, health care, and other public policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chile's Trade Policies and Relations", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, Chile's increasingly expansive and independent trade policy portraysa strategy that is commonly referred to as \"open regionalism.\" This approach combines unilateralismwith the formation of sub-regional integration groups open to future expansion, such as the AndeanCommunity and the Southern Common Market (Mercado Comun del Sur -- Mercosur), amongothers, while also leaving open the possibility for bilateral and extra-regional trade agreements. Aspointed out in one study, it differs from earlier, fundamentally unsuccessful, attempts at economicintegration in Latin America by emphasizing trade opening rather than collective sub-regionalprotectionism. (7) ", "The \"open regionalism\" policy took shape in the early 1990s when Chile signed economiccomplementarity agreements (simplified free trade agreements) with Bolivia, Mexico, Venezuela,Colombia, and Ecuador under guidelines set out by the Latin American Integration Association(Association Latinoamericana de Integracion -- ALADI). Similar arrangements followed with Peruand Argentina. Chile has signed FTAs with Canada, Mexico, and Central America. In April andOctober 2002 respectively, Chile completed negotiations for an FTA with the European Union andSouth Korea. It is currently courting other countries including Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore,and closing in on an agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), see AppendixD . All are considered part of a strategy to open industrial economies further to Chilean exports. Chile joined Mercosur as an associate member in 1996, limiting its commitment largely because ofMercosur's higher common external tariff. Chile is also an active participant in the World TradeOrganization (WTO), seeing it as the venue to settle controversial issues less suited to regional orbilateral discussions. ", "Figure 1. Growth in Chilean Trade with MajorPartners, 1993-2001", "Trade data reflect Chile's open and independent trade policy. Its exports to the worldexpanded by 89% over the eight years 1993-2001 (see Figure 1 ) and imports grew by 56%. Although Chile is not part of the Andean Community or a full partner of Mercosur, its fastest exportgrowth has been intra-regional, a testament to Chile's trade strategy that combines unilateralreductions in tariff and nontariff barriers with an aggressive effort to enter into bilateralarrangements. From 1993 to 2001, Chilean exports expanded by 126% to Latin America, comparedto 100% to the United States, 43% to Japan, 70% to the rest of Asia, and 71% to the EuropeanUnion. Chile's trade with Canada points to another interesting trend. Although the dollar value ofexports is very small, it grew by some 380%, an issue that was not lost on many U.S. businessadvocates of a U.S.-Chile FTA, who argued that the Chile-Canada FTA put U.S. firms at acompetitive disadvantage until a similar or better agreement could be reached with the United States. ", "Figure 2. Chile Direction of Trade, 2002", "As seen in Figure 2 , Chile has diversified export markets, which not only increasesopportunities for trade, but also reduces dependence on a few markets and thereby softens exposureto foreign shocks (e.g. Argentina). Its largest export market is the European Union, which accountedfor 23% of exports in 2002, followed by the United States with 20%, and Latin America with 19%. Japan accounted for 11% of Chilean exports and the rest of Asia 17%. These figures reflect somerelative change over the past decade, as seen in the growth patterns in Figure 1 . There was adecrease in the European Union's and Japan's share of Chilean exports, as well as to Latin America. Although Chile's exports to Latin America had been rising during the 1990s, slow regional growthat the turn of the century reduced its export market share. The export shares to Asia and the UnitedStates, two areas that have experienced relatively faster growth, have risen recently. There was alsoa large increase in Chilean export share to Canada, although from a very small base.", "Latin America is Chile's largest importing area, accounting for 35% of imports, followed bythe EU with 18%, the United States with 15%, and Asia with 13%. Japan and Canada follow at adistance with 3% and 2%, respectively. The EU trade presence in Chile has declined over the pastdecade, as it did with other Latin American countries. The relative importance of the United Statessuggests that Chile has had a strong incentive to pursue a bilateral FTA, other than a generalpreference for expanding its export base.", "Chile's open regionalism and export driven trade policy have been challenged, however, fornot focusing enough on diversifying the country away from minimally refined agriculture and miningproducts (copper, fish, grapes, and wood). Manufactured products account for less than 15% of totalexports, suggesting two potential problems. First, relying on traditional commodities can providestrong export earnings, but earnings are unpredictable given the volatile nature of commodity prices(see Chile's swings in its terms of trade in Table 1 ). (8) ", "Second, little movement toward a manufacture-based, value-added approach to exportpromotion can limit long-term economic growth, a point developed by an Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IDB) study arguing that the relatively poor income growth performance ofcommodity exporting countries can be traced to this lack of export diversification. Although manyLatin American countries have expanded their intra-regional trade, deepening integration withdeveloped economies seems necessary to achieve greater export diversification.", "The large gains in export manufactures of Mexico and the Central American countries in the1990s, for example, were related, in some measure, to preferential trade arrangements with theUnited States. Other Latin American countries had much slower growth of manufacturedexports. (9) Whether Chilewill adopt export diversification as part of its long-term development strategy is unclear, but Chile'sefforts to develop trade relationships with developed economies, including the U.S.-Chile FTA,would seem to be an important component of such a goal.", "On Chile's import side, most from developed countries are capital goods, highlighting thelink between an open trade policy (lower tariffs on capital goods) and development (capital goodsform the investment base for other production). Importantly, there is strong competition in theChilean capital goods market from firms around the world.

Labor advocates argued that they are a step backward from the provisions agreed to in theU.S.-Jordan bilateral, as well as the Generalized System of Preferences and Caribbean Basin TradePartnership Act, which currently govern much of the U.S. trade with Latin America. Specifically,provisions: 1) requiring effective enforcement of domestic labor laws, 2) reaffirming commitmentsto ILO basic principles, and 3) requiring parties to strive to ensure the \"non-derogation\" fromdomestic standards (not weakening or reducing protections to encourage trade and investment) aretreated differently. (27) ", "In the first case, failure to enforce domestic labor laws can be formally challenged in thedispute resolution process as defined in the FTA (Article 22.16(1)). In the case of the other twoprovisions, which are supported in principle, such recourse is not available. The USTR points tocooperative mechanisms for improving workers' rights in the FTA, (28) but labor advocates arguethat unless all three are enforceable, the FTA provides \"a meaningful trade discipline where -- andonly where -- the country's labor laws are adequate. Otherwise we would simply lock in low andunacceptable labor standards through our trade agreements.\" (29) Although Chile has asound record in support of basic labor rights, such differentiated treatment is challenged asinadequate for use in other countries, particularly those in Central America, (30) and so raises a questionfor some as to whether the Chile agreement does or should constitute a precedent.", "In addition, in the one case where the formal dispute resolution process may be invoked, itis differentiated from disputes related to commercial issues. Ultimately, if a commercial disputeremains unsettled, the country faces the possibility of suspension of benefits under the FTA \"ofequivalent effect\" (Article 22.15(2)), resulting in the raising of tariffs, or payment of a monetaryassessment equal to 50% of what a dispute panel determines is \"of equivalent effect.\" This articledoes not apply to the disputable labor provision. The difference is that the option for failing toresolve a labor dispute is a monetary assessment, which would be capped at $15 million per year,with recourse to an equivalent dollar value of suspended benefits (higher tariffs) if the monetaryassessment is not paid. The monetary assessment would also be paid into a fund and expended for\"appropriate labor initiatives.\" Labor advocates argue that by capping the assessment at $15 millionand having the assessment paid into a fund in the offending country render the labor provisionsineffective. The USTR argues that for a small country like Chile, such a fine would be significantrelative to the dollar value of the trade benefits it will receive. (31) ", "From a congressional perspective, there is an additional question of whether differences inthe treatment of the three labor provisions in some way fail to meet in full the principal negotiatingobjectives of Congress as outlined in TPA legislation. Although the three provisions are notaccorded the exact same treatment in the FTA, neither are they in the TPA language. Section2102(b)(11) of the Trade Act of 2002 (TPA) states that among the principal labor negotiationobjectives is the provision \" to ensure that a party to a trade agreement with the United States doesnot fail to effectively enforce the environmental or labor laws .\" This may be contrasted with theapparently weaker objective \" to strengthen the capacity of United States trading partners to promoterespect for core labor standards, \" and, in Sec. 2102(a)(1)(7) to \" strive to ensure that they do notweaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws as anencouragement for trade.\"", "There is a final point. Although the TPA provisions seem to differ with respect to treatmentof these three labor provisions, under the dispute resolution provision (sec. 2102(b)(12)(G)), aprincipal negotiating objective also listed is \"to seek provisions that treat United States principalnegotiating objectives equally\" with respect to the ability to resort to dispute settlement, theavailability of equivalent procedures, and the availability of equivalent remedies. Whereas the laborgroups have argued that this is not the case with labor and commercial disputes, the USTR hasresponded that this standard has been met since both commercial and labor disputes are subject tomonetary assessments and suspension of benefits. The dispute settlement procedures do operateslightly differently, however, and it may be a matter of interpretation as to whether there is a problemin their meeting congressional negotiating objectives.

The relevantlanguage is set out in the dispute settlement portion of Chapter 10 -- Investment of the FTA. Duringthe 1990s, Chile became famous for controlling capital inflows, a policy intended to limit the realappreciation of the Chilean peso that large capital inflows can cause. This policy, some argue,helped Chile avoid the currency overvaluation problem that contributed to multiple developingcountry financial crises in that decade. Chile's main control policy on portfolio capital, known asthe Ley de Encaje , was discontinued in 2001. While in force, however, it raised issues with respectto the U.S. position favoring the free flow of transfers and payments related to investment, whichhas become a standard position in both U.S. bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and otherFTAs. (33) In hearingson the U.S.-Chile FTA, some Members of Congress expressed concern that U.S. negotiated positionsinsisting on the free flow of payments and transfers might be imprudent if they inhibit countries fromusing controls on capital to help maintain financial stability during times of international financialturmoil. (34) ", "The provisions at issue appear in two annexes of the investment chapter of the U.S.-ChileFTA that cover treatment of both long-term and short-term capital investment. The provision inAnnex 10-F focuses on the treatment of long-term investments under Chile's Decree Law 600 (D.L.600). This law provides an investment option in the form of a contract with the Government ofChile that stipulates certain rights of the investor, but also requires that foreign direct investment(FDI) remain in country for a minimal period of one year (three years at one point). Should a disputearise, the language in the U.S.-Chile FTA would allow the investor the option to make a claim ininternational arbitration as opposed to having to work through the domestic Chilean court systemas set out in D.L. 600. It is the less controversial provision of the two.", "The more controversial provision relates to Chile's Ley de Encaje , which governs short-termportfolio capital flows, and the recourse that U.S. investors may have if faced with restrictions onthe outward flow of certain payments and transfers as defined in Annex 10-C. This annex must beunderstood as part of the larger dispute settlement provisions related to foreign investment, asdefined in Section B of Chapter 10. The U.S.-Chile FTA adopted what has become more or less ofa standard provision, which states that, U.S. investors who seek to file a claim for breach of theChapter 10 provisions can do so only after six months have lapsed from the event giving rise to theclaim. This general rule applies to a broad range of potential investment disputes such as failure toobserve national treatment or expropriation.", "Annex 10-C, the mutually-agreed compromise developed by Chilean and U.S. negotiators,is actually an important exception to the six-month rule. Paragraph 1(a) states that claims allegingthat Chile has breached an obligation under Chapter 10 from its imposition of restrictions ontransfers can only be made one year after the restriction was put in place, with certain exceptions. In general, the United States wanted to make sure that Chile did not have a general \"balance ofpayments\" exception to impose capital controls. (35) Chile wanted to ensure that it would not be penalized if it wereever to reimpose its Ley de Encaje . Under Chile's Ley de Encaje, any short-term capital investmentin Chile required that an additional nonremunerated deposit equal to 10%-30% of the investmentvalue be placed in the Central Bank of Chile for one year. (36) The deposit would be forfeited if the portfolio investment wererepatriated in less than one year, imposing an additional cost on capital volatility. In essence, Annex10-C attempts to reconcile these goals by allowing for an extension from six months to one year (thelife of the encaje ) of the \"cooling off period\" before a claim can be made for dispute resolutionrelated to restrictions on transfers and payments, and by stipulating that the encaje is not anopen-ended invitation to restrict (may not substantially impede) capital movements.

(38)", "There are two important thresholds that the Ley de Encaje must not exceed to avoidtriggering a claim for dispute resolution. First, it cannot affect an investment for more than one year. Historically, this has been the case. Second, the encaje cannot be considered as having \"substantiallyimpeded\" capital outflows. Although in any actual arbitration a panel would be empowered todetermine what constitutes \"substantially impede,\" this language was crafted with the intent that theforfeiture of the encaje not be construed as substantially impeding capital outflows and so may beviewed as unlikely to open the door to U.S. investor dispute settlement. (39) ", "The U.S.-Chile FTA provisions do not eliminate Chile's right to reimpose its capital controllaws per se, especially the Ley de Encaje , but do extend certain additional rights to U.S. investors. In addition, they indicate that U.S. investors could pursue dispute settlement if Chile were to imposecontrols that substantially impeded portfolio capital from leaving the country, setting up the debateover whether such restrictions belong in FTAs. Attention to the issue has grown in the aftermath ofcongressional approval for the U.S.-Chile FTA, particularly in light of the number of subsequentFTAs that are heading for congressional action.

Thesecategories parallel the visa categories commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denotestheir subsection in \u00c2\u00a7101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act : B-2 visitors, E-1 treatytraders, L-1 intracompany transfers, and H-1B professional workers.

In many ways the FTA professional worker visa requirements parallel the H-1B visarequirements, notably having similar educational requirements. The H-1B visa, however, specifiesthat the occupation require highly specialized knowledge, while the proposed FTA professionalworker visa specifies that the occupation require only specialized knowledge.

It counts an FTA professional worker against the H-1B cap the first year he/she enters andagain after the fifth year he/she seeks renewal.
