This time period from retirement to the age of 60 is generally referred to as the \"Gray Area,\" and this category of retirees is generally referred to as \"Gray Area Retirees.\" This term is not defined by statute or regulations, but it generally refers to members of the Guard or reserves who have transferred to the retired reserve after 20 years (or more) of service with their unit and who have not reached the age of 60.", "Most members of the Guard or the reserves who elect to remain in service will have served between 20 and 30 years.

At the age of 60, the GAR is then usually entitled to DOD benefits similar to those of servicemembers who retire from active military service after at least 20 years. However, in many cases, GARs are not considered to be veterans under Title 38 for VA benefit purposes. A GAR carries a Military ID card marked \"Ret,\" maintains military base privileges, and usually keeps the commissary privileges that he or she had while on active reserve status. GARs are eligible for (1)\u00a0VA disability compensation and VA health care for disabilities or injuries incurred while performing inactive duty for training, regardless of length of service; (2) VA home loan eligibility, as long as the retiree had six or more years of honorable service in the selected reserve; (3) VA burial and memorial benefits if the retiree is entitled to reserve retired pay at the time of his or her death; and (4) conversion of Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) to Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI).", "Basically, before the age of 60, the GAR has the same benefits that he or she had before retirement, but without receiving pay. When the GAR reaches the age of 60, retirement pay and medical benefits begin.

Two particular elements of these criteria\u2014\"active duty\" and \"length of service\"\u2014are often difficult for members of the Guard and the reserves to meet.
