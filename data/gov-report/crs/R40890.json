The term \"dispatchable\" is not defined in the bill, but would normally refer to power generating units that can be run at-will by system operators. In this sense a natural gas, nuclear, or coal unit is dispatchable while a wind or solar plant is not, because wind and solar generation is dependent on weather and diurnal conditions.", "The EPA administrator is directed to establish rules within 90 days of enactment for providing incentives to dispatchable power projects that generate 300,000 gigawatt-hours (Gwh) of electricity annually. To put this generation target in context, a reasonably large power plant with a capacity of 500 megawatts (i.e., 0.5 gigawatts) that operates the equivalent of 85% of the time would generate 3,723 Gwh annually. Therefore it would take about 81 of these 500 Mw plants to meet the goal of generating 300,000 Gwh annually under this program.", "To qualify for incentives, an eligible project must produce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) that are below the 2007 average emissions per megawatt-hour (Mwh) by the United States electric power sector, according to the following schedule ( Table 1 ):", "The bill speaks to reductions in the emissions of all GHG released by power plants, but information is readily available only for power plant carbon dioxide emissions (CO 2 is, in any event, the predominant GHG in the electric power sector). Table 2 , below, shows average CO 2 emission per Mwh for the electric power sector as a whole in 2007, the 2007 values for several specific combustible fuel sources, and estimated emissions for new natural gas plants. These estimates, which include no carbon controls, show that only new high efficiency natural gas plants can meet the reduction targets of 25% for 2010 to 2020 and 40% for 2021 to 2025. It does not appear that any combustible fuel source can meet the 65% target which begins in 2026 without carbon controls. ", "Nuclear power is a dispatchable option which could meet these targets since carbon emissions are essentially zero. Geothermal power has very small emissions per Mwh ( Table 2 ) and is dispatchable, but with current technology plants are limited to small installations in the western United States. Another alternative could be to link wind or solar power with electricity storage, creating a combined system which could be dispatched as needed However, current electricity storage technologies are limited by cost, technical, and environmental factors.", "In allocating incentives the administrator is to give priority to projects with one or more of the following characteristics:", "Power generation and energy storage projects intended to integrate variable renewable electricity sources, such as solar and wind power, into the grid.

These include:", "The total dollar amount and form of the incentives. By what point in time projects must enter service to qualify for incentives. Whether the emission reduction target varies for a project over time. For example, assume a project enters service in 2010 and must therefore meet the 25 percent reduction in GHG emission goal ( Table 1 ). If the project is still operating in 2021 to 2025, does it have to further reduce emissions to meet the 40% reduction target that begins in that period in order to continue to receive incentives, or does the higher target only apply to new units that enter service during that period? The bill states that \"Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall provide incentives for eligible projects that generate 300,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year.\" It is not clear from this language if the Administrator must make all awards within three years of enactment, or must merely begin making awards by that deadline.", "Section 182 of Subtitle H, Advanced Natural Gas Technologies , would establish two programs for accelerating the deployment of advanced natural gas technologies. Under one program, for \"Natural Gas Electricity Generation Grants,\" the EPA Administrator \"may provide\" (but apparently is not required to provide) research and development grants \"to support the deployment of low greenhouse-gas-emitting end-use technologies, including carbon capture and sequestration technologies, for natural gas electricity generation.\" Under the second program, for \"Natural Gas Residential and Commercial Technology Grants,\" the Administrator is directed to establish a grant program for research, development, demonstration, and deployment of low GHG emitting end-use technologies for the commercial and residential sectors.
