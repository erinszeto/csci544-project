Medtronic, Inc., the United States Supreme Court held in an 8 to 1 decision that if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants premarket approval (PMA) to a medical device, the device manufacturer is immune from certain suits under state tort law, due to an express preemption provision in the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA). This holding establishes that FDA PMA preempts claims such as strict liability, breach of implied warranty, and negligence in design, testing, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, sale, inspection, or marketing of the device to the extent that such state law claims are \"different from, or in addition to\" federal PMA requirements. However, the Supreme Court held that the MDA's express preemption provision did not prohibit state \"claims premised on a violation of FDA regulation.\" The Court stated that such claims \"'parallel,' rather than add to, federal requirements.\" Post-Riegel, the lower courts have come to differing conclusions when determining whether particular state law claims, such as manufacturing defect claims, \"parallel\" federal requirements, and thus are not preempted, or rather are state requirements \"different from, or in addition to\" federal requirements, and thus are preempted under Riegel.", "The Supreme Court's decision has been a cause for concern for some Members of Congress who disagree with the ruling, as well as trial lawyers and patients. However, advocates of more limited tort liability, including the previous Administration, agree with the ruling. The decision has broad implications for consumers of Class III medical devices, who are prevented from suing device manufacturers on most state common law claims, as well as manufacturers, who are shielded from many suits if their device receives FDA PMA. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced\u2014H.R. 1346, H.R. 4816, and S. 540\u2014that would have overturned the Court's decision in Riegel by modifying the statute at issue.

There are also more specific requirements that a device manufacturer must follow, which are determined by the level of risk that the device poses to patients from its use or misuse.

A device is \"substantially equivalent\" if the FDA makes such a determination based on a comparison of the new device with a predicate device.

At least 90 days before a manufacturer may market one of these new devices, the manufacturer must submit a notification to the FDA.

As the Supreme Court held in Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Association , \"the question whether a certain state action is pre-empted by a federal law is one of congressional intent. The purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone. To discern Congress' intent we examine the explicit statutory language and the structure and purpose of the statute.\"", "In the express preemption context, a federal statute will be deemed to supplant existing state law to the extent that it contains an explicit provision to that effect, the scope of which is determined by interpreting the language of the provision and analyzing the legislative history as necessary. Where express preemption provisions are not present, federal law may preempt state law implicitly. There are several different ways to conceptualize the doctrine of implied preemption, but it is often subdivided into three general categories for purposes of analysis: (1) federal occupation of the entire field of regulation; (2) actual conflict between federal and state requirements; and (3) state requirements that frustrate congressional purpose.", "Courts, however, often encounter difficulty when federal law is silent as to the preemptive effect. The Supreme Court traditionally begins its analysis in this context with a presumption against preemption, an \"assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by [a federal law] unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" Several decisions by the Court have strengthened this presumption, including Maryland v. Louisiana , which stated that \"[c]onsideration under the Supremacy clause starts with the basic assumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law,\" and Chicago & North Western Transportation Co. v. Kalo Brick & Tile Co. , which held that \"[p]reemption of state law by federal statute or regulation is not favored 'in the absence of persuasive reasons either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably ordained.'\" Additionally, in the Supreme Court case Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr , which also addressed preemption of state tort claims under the MDA, the plurality opinion noted:", "Throughout our history the several States have exercised their police powers to protect the health and safety of their citizens. Because these are \"primarily, and historically, ... matter[s] of local concern,\" Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc. , 471 U.S. 707, 719 (1985), the \"States traditionally have had great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.\" Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts , 471 U.S. 724, 756 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).", "These standards, however, are highly case specific in their application. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has noted that \"none of these expressions provide an infallible constitutional test or an exclusive constitutional yardstick. In the final analysis, there can be no crystal clear distinctly marked formula.\" Thus, cases involving federal preemption of state law often hinge on the particular factual circumstances of a given case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arguments for Federal Preemption of State Law Tort Claims with Respect to Devices", "paragraphs": ["There are policy arguments for and against the merits of preemption in the medical device context. Arguments for federal preemption of common law in the medical device context focus on (1) uniform national standards, (2) the rigor of the PMA process, (3) the FDA's expertise in this field, and (4) the potential for delay in the development of new products. Businesses tend to favor preemption, as regulated industries \"generally prefer uniform, national regulation over varying state regulation.\" ", "Those in favor of preemption, including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and trade groups for medical device makers such as the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), equate jury verdicts under state common law with the imposition of a state law \"requirement\" in addition to \"requirements\" that are imposed for devices under the FFDCA and FDA regulations. For example, medical device manufacturers have argued that in light of the rigor of the FDA's PMA process and its resulting \"device-specific design, manufacturing, and labeling requirements,\" separate jury verdicts would also produce \"requirements\" as a practical matter with regard to a device's design, manufacture, or label. One court of appeals case explained the effect of a jury verdict this way:", "The effect of a jury finding of negligent failure to warn would be that state law would require [the manufacturer] to change the label and package insert for [the medical device], but [the manufacturer] may not unilaterally make such changes under federal law. A device may not be labeled in a manner inconsistent with any conditions specified in its PMA. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 814.80 (2000). A manufacturer must submit a Supplemental PMA for any proposed labeling changes that affect the safety of the device. Id. at \u00a7 814.39(a).", "Others in favor of preemption, such as the George W. Bush Administration, similarly have pointed to the FDA as an agency composed of expert scientists vested with authority to undertake matters such as PMA, which should not be overruled by potentially inconsistent state juries. They argue that juries lack the FDA's expertise to engage in a balancing of the benefits and risks that products may pose. Finally, preemption advocates argue that to decide differently may delay or discourage development and marketing of products with beneficial or even life-saving potential, and that recalls of medical devices are \"rare.\" They also respond to the argument that preemption does not give the manufacturer the incentive to update and improve its devices by saying that market pressures will force companies to change their products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arguments Against Federal Preemption of State Law Tort Claims with Respect to Devices", "paragraphs": ["In contrast, arguments against federal preemption of common law in the medical device field focus on (1) congressional intent and legislative history; (2) protections for consumers, who may otherwise be left without a remedy; (3) the change in the FDA's view with regard to preemption, as well as the general presumption against preemption; (4) viewing FDA approval as a preliminary step\u2014a \"floor\" rather than a \"ceiling\"\u2014that does not hold manufacturers accountable for safety concerns; and (5) questioning the agency's capabilities in terms of resources and its reliance on industry. ", "With regard to congressional intent, some commentators have noted that \"Congress did not directly address tort suits in the MDA, despite decades of lawsuits against drug manufacturers.\" Opponents of federal preemption of state common law claims in the device area, such as Senator Kennedy and Representative Waxman, have argued that Congress's silence on the issue evidences \"its intent not to preempt the suits,\" or alternately, that the discussions in the legislative history do not provide evidence of such intent. In Riegel , discussed below, the plaintiffs' attorney also questioned whether Congress would \"have really intended to protect the manufacturer from liability,\" since the passage of the MDA occurred in the wake of the Dalkon Shield cases, in which an intrauterine device \"was linked to serious infections and several deaths, not to mention a large number of pregnancies.\"", "Some who are against preemption view tort law as an \"important and necessary adjunct to the regulatory process\" and cite the FDA's view prior to 2004 that federal law did not preempt product liability lawsuits. While proponents of preemption see it as a way to protect orderly business functions, others assert that \"industry has been pushing to expand federal pre-emption for the past 25 years as a wholesale, get-out-of-jail-free card.\" The Riegels' counsel and others have argued that FDA PMA should be seen as \"a preliminary judgment of safety and effectiveness that did not relieve a manufacturer of an obligation to make a device better and safer.\"", "Moreover, as the Justices explored at oral argument in Riegel , preemption could shield manufacturers who discover a risk or problem with their FDA-approved device, if the FDA has not yet learned of the problem or has not taken action as a result of the risk. It could be argued that the FDA is dependent on manufacturers to provide information regarding devices, that \"[t]here is no opportunity for public comment or for any public challenge to the information presented to the FDA by the device manufacturer\" in the PMA application, and to allow the common law tort claims to go forward may reveal information in the discovery process that manufacturers withheld from the FDA in the PMA process. This view sees the state tort law system as a backstop, as safety concerns may \"have been uncovered not by the agency but during the course of litigation.\" Concerns have been raised that companies may also not \"respond to safety concerns that arise after a product is on the market,\" if federal law preempts state tort claims, or even attempt to manufacture new devices that are safer or better because suits related to marketing previously approved devices would be preempted. Those who view the agency as overburdened may also similarly view the agency's PMA process as inadequate to protect patients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The FDA's Position on Preemption in Medical Device Cases", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, the FDA's position on preemption of state tort law claims in medical device cases has shifted. This section will discuss the express preemption provision, as well as the FDA's positions since the provision was first enacted in 1976.", "The FFDCA contains an express preemption provision with respect to medical devices. This provision was included as part of the MDA, which was enacted in 1976. The statute, 21 U.S.C. Section 360k(a), which was at issue in Riegel , provides:", "Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u2014", "(1) which is different from or in addition to, any requirement applicable under [federal law] to the device, and", "(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under [relevant federal law].", "However, the agency may exempt state requirements that are \"more stringent\" and state requirements \"required by compelling local conditions\" if \"compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be in violation of any applicable requirement under\" the FFDCA.", "The FDA subsequently issued regulations interpreting this preemption provision in 1978, which were amended after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr . In that case, the Court concluded that state common law negligence actions against manufacturers of devices found by the FDA to be \"substantially equivalent\" under the Section 510(k) process were not preempted. In the agency's post- Lohr 1996 final rule amending the regulations, the FDA noted that \"the new quality system regulation does not preempt State tort and common law remedies.\" The regulations presently provide:", "State or local requirements are preempted only when the Food and Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under the act, thereby making any existing divergent State or local requirements applicable to the device different from or in addition to, the specific Food and Drug Administration requirements.", "\u2026", "Section 521(a) [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a)] does not preempt State or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices ... or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices.", "As indicated by these regulations, the FDA's position, prior to the early 2000s, was of a \"long-standing presumption against preemption in implementing section 521\" of the FFDCA (21 U.S.C. \u00a7360k). The agency's outlook with regard to the scope of the preemption provision was that it \"should be interpreted narrowly, with a presumption against preemption.\" With regard to whether the preemption provision applied to state tort claims, the \"FDA did not have occasion to address the precise issue of whether [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k] preempts state tort claims before that issue was litigated in private lawsuits.\" In 1997, the then-Chief Counsel of the FDA argued that \"although the agency had not formally expressed its position on the precise issue, it is clear from the views it expressed in many other contexts [such as a 1984 advisory opinion, a response to a 1980 request from California for an exemption from preemption, and a response to \"a congressional request for an opinion on the preemptive status of another California statute\"] that it did not believe that state tort claims were preempted under\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7360k. She referred to the statute's legislative history, the exemption procedure, and the lack of congressional mention of its intent to preempt state common law claims when noting the agency's \"belie[f] that Congress intended to restrict preemption to positive enactments (for example, legislation or regulations) that apply to the marketing of medical devices within a state.\"", "Meanwhile, in Lohr , the agency had argued in an amicus brief that \"state tort claims generally are not preempted under\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7360k. After the Supreme Court's decision in Lohr , the then-Chief Counsel for the FDA, Margaret J. Porter, stated:", "FDA regulation of a device cannot anticipate and protect against all safety risks to individual consumers. Even the most thorough regulation of a product such as a critical medical device may fail to identify potential problems presented by the product. Regulation cannot protect against all possible injuries that might result from use of a device over time. Preemption of all such claims would result in the loss of a significant layer of consumer protection, leaving consumers without a remedy for injuries caused by defective medical devices. Moreover, FDA's regulation of devices would have been accorded an entirely different weight in private tort litigation than its counterpart regulation of drugs and biologics. This disparity is neither justified nor appropriate, nor does the agency believe it was intended by Congress when section 521 [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k] was enacted.", "The FDA's view on preemption in medical device cases appeared to shift in 2004, when the agency filed an appellate brief in Horn v. Thoratec Corp. , in which the plaintiff sued the medical device manufacturer alleging negligence, defective design, defective manufacture, and failure to warn. In Horn , the FDA submitted an amicus curiae letter brief to the court, which the court referenced, in which the agency \"unequivocally expressed the opinion that state common law claims such as those made by Horn against a PMA-approved device are preempted.\" ", "However, the shift may have occurred earlier. As the court in Horn noted, the FDA argued in a 2003 statement of interest in a Tennessee circuit court case that PMA \"triggers preemption of a wide array of requirements imposed under state tort law.\" Others have argued that the agency's support of preemption began even prior to the change of presidential Administrations from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, although this assertion was not limited to medical device cases. One scholar has characterized preemption \"as a fundamentally political issue.\"", "In its 2004 amicus brief in Horn , the agency specifically acknowledged that it was disclaiming its previous view that 21 U.S.C. Section 360k \"does not preempt a state tort law claim concerning an FDA-approved device,\" which the agency had articulated in a 1997 amicus brief. The agency gave several reasons for its change in position. The FDA previously asserted that its approval of a manufacturer's design did not \"convert the features of that design into federal requirements,\" but now stated that such a \"proposition does not adequately account for the highly detailed ... nature of the PMA process.\" The agency also noted that its past position viewed the PMA process as a minimum standard, which \"should not displace state common law that may provide additional protection to consumers,\" but said in its 2004 amicus brief that PMA \"sets a ceiling as well as a floor.\" Finally, the FDA noted that its position change \"reflects in part the decisions applying Lohr issued by the federal courts\" since the Supreme Court issued that opinion.", "The agency's view under the George W. Bush Administration was that state common law tort claims, such as those at issue in Horn and Riegel , are preempted under 21 U.S.C. Section 360k because the FDA granted PMA, which imposes specific federal requirements on the Class III medical device at issue, and the state common law claims \"would impose a requirement different from, or in addition to, the requirements imposed by FDA in granting pre-market approval.\" The agency previously stated that even though it does not issue specific federal regulations for a device, \"the agency's approval of this device through the PMA process does impose specific requirements for the product, including requirements for its design, manufacturing, performance, labeling, and use,\" which are based on the manufacturer's PMA application. Additionally, the agency asserted that five Justices in Lohr \"concluded that a state common law tort judgment is a 'requirement' under Section 360k(a).\" Therefore, under the agency's view of preemption during the Bush Administration, \"any finding of liability based upon [a device manufacturer's] failure to satisfy a standard different from those approved by the FDA in the PMA process would necessarily rest upon an implicit requirement that this device be designed, manufactured, or marketed in a way that differs from the way approved by FDA.\" ", "Though the Riegel decision was issued before the start of the Obama Administration, the President announced his policy on preemption in a 2009 memorandum, which stated that \"preemption of State law by executive departments and agencies should be undertaken only with full consideration of the legitimate prerogatives of the States and with a sufficient legal basis for preemption.\" The memorandum explicitly addressed the inclusion of preemption statements in regulatory preambles and said such statements should not be included unless the preemption provision is included in the regulation itself. Additionally, such provisions should not be included in the regulation unless they were \"justified under legal principles governing preemption,\" including those in President Clinton's Executive Order 13132 on federalism. That executive order requires agencies to \"construe \u2026 a Federal statute to preempt State law only where the statute contains an express preemption provision or there is some other clear evidence that the Congress intended preemption of State law, or where the exercise of State authority conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority under the Federal statute.\" When addressing preemption in terms of federal requirements in recent regulations, the FDA has cited President Clinton's executive order on federalism as well as the Supreme Court's holding in Riegel .", "The Obama memorandum also called upon agencies to review regulations issued in the previous 10 years that included statements in the preamble or the regulation itself with regard to preemption of state law. A 2008 Associated Press article noted that 51 regulations proposed or adopted since 2005 had placed limits on lawsuits and that a combined 41 of those 51 came from the FDA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2011, the FDA issued its preemption review. The FDA concluded that its position on preemption that had been articulated in the preamble to a rule on supplemental applications for labeling changes for prescription drugs, biologics, and devices\u2014a position also referenced in rules on nonprescription drugs and food labeling\u2014could not \"be justified under legal principles governing preemption.\" These legal principles included the Supreme Court's decision in Wyeth v. Levine , which explicitly addressed the FDA's preemption position in that labeling rule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Riegel v.

The Court said that the New York state common law claims were \"different from or in addition to\" the federal MDA requirements because \"reference to a State's 'requirements' includes its common-law duties.\" ", "To reach its holding, the Court addressed two questions: (1) Has the federal government established requirements applicable to the medical device? and (2) If the answer to the first question is yes, are the plaintiffs' common law claims (such as negligence in the design, labeling, and marketing of the catheter) based on state requirements that are \"different from, or in addition to\" the federal requirements, \"and that relate to safety and effectiveness\"? ", "First, the Court held that the federal government had \"established requirements applicable to\" the device at issue, Medtronic's catheter, and that PMA \"imposes 'requirements' under the MDA.\" In making its determination, the Court distinguished its earlier decision in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr , which held that \"federal manufacturing and labeling requirements\" do not preempt common law claims of negligence and strict liability in instances where (1) any federal requirements are not specific to the device at issue; and (2) the FDA finds that a device \"is 'substantially equivalent' to another device exempt from premarket approval,\" because this constituted an exemption, not a \"requirement.\" The Court found that, unlike the substantial equivalence process, PMA is device-specific and is not an exemption, but rather a \"requirement.\" The Court differentiated from Lohr by reasoning that PMA is focused on safety, rather than equivalence; that PMA is a formal FDA review, as opposed to the lack of formal review that the device subject to premarket notification in Lohr received; and that devices that receive PMA may not deviate from the FDA-approved specifications in the PMA application.", "Second, the Court held that \"New York's tort duties constitute 'requirements' under the MDA\" and that these \"requirements\" were \"different from, or in addition to\" the federal requirements. The Court began by noting that five Justices in Lohr \"concluded that common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability do impose 'requirement[s]' and would be pre-empted by federal requirements specific to a medical device.\" The Lohr Court had said that it did \"not believe that [the MDA's] statutory and regulatory language necessarily precludes ... 'general' state requirements from ever being pre-empted.\" In other words, the MDA could potentially preempt general state \"requirements,\" or general state common law under circumstances such as strict liability, negligence, and implied warranty claims.

Justice Ginsburg noted the act's consumer-oriented purpose, as well as congressional awareness of over 500 lawsuits related to the Dalkon Shield medical device: \"I find informative the absence of any sign of a legislative design to preempt state common-law tort actions.\" She pointed to the absence of a federal compensation scheme for consumers injured by FDA-approved medical devices as evidence that Congress did not intend to preempt state common law suits. Furthermore, she referenced the Court's plurality in Lohr , which stated: \"[N]othing in the hearings, the Committee reports, or the debates ... suggest[ed] that any proponent of the legislation intended a sweeping pre-emption of traditional common-law remedies against manufacturers and distributors of defective devices.\" Justice Ginsburg also cited remedies provided by the MDA\u2014such as the FDA's ability to order a device manufacturer to repair or recall the device\u2014and a provision stating that compliance with an FDA order to recall or repair a device \"shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law,\" as evidence that Congress did not intend to preempt state common law suits.", "With regard to the FDA's shift in its position on preemption, she took note of the FDA's pre-2003 view, as described by a former FDA counsel, that \"FDA product approval and state tort liability usually operate independently, each providing a significant, yet distinct, layer of consumer protection ... [as] [e]ven the most thorough regulation of a product ... may fail to identify potential problems.\" The dissent then addressed the deference that should be granted to the FDA's new position on preemption, finding that the agency's announcement of its position shift in an amicus brief would be entitled to little deference when compared with the FDA's previous view, the presumption against preemption, and the MDA itself.", "The dissent next examined the history of federal regulation of medical devices, and in part, federal regulation of drugs and additives. Justice Ginsburg noted that, prior to the enactment of the MDA in 1976, the defense of state common law claims for defective design or drug labeling either did not involve preemption or, if preemption was asserted as a defense, it was unsuccessful. She argues that Congress included the preemption provision 21 U.S.C. Section 360k \"to empower the FDA to exercise control over state premarket approval systems installed at a time when there was no preclearance at the federal level,\" such as the California PMA system. Moreover, unlike devices, states had not developed PMA processes for drugs or additives.", "The dissent also quotes the FDA's former counsel as observing the disparity that would arguably arise if preemption of state common law suits existed for devices with PMA, but not drugs or biologics: \"This disparity is neither justified nor appropriate, nor does the agency believe it was intended by Congress.\" Medtronic had argued that \"Congress would not have wanted state juries to second-guess the FDA's finding that a medical device is safe and effective when used as directed,\" however the dissent noted that the PMA process for drugs is \"at least as rigorous\" as that for devices, and that courts \"have overwhelmingly held that FDA approval of a new drug application does not preempt state tort suits.\" The decades in which state product liability suits for drugs and FDA approval coexisted may also be seen as an indication of congressional intent not to preempt such claims, according to the dissent.", "Finally, Justice Ginsburg notes that device manufacturers may have two defenses to state common law suits: implied preemption under the actual conflict theory (in other words a conflict between FDA PMA of a device and the plaintiff's case theory), and \"a regulatory compliance defense based on the FDA's approval of the premarket application.\" FDA approval could be used as \"evidence that [the manufacturer] used due care in the design and labeling of the product.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legal Implications", "paragraphs": ["This section addresses the types of cases that may be affected by the Court's decision in Riegel , identifies areas that would not be affected by this opinion, and discusses similar cases that the Riegel Court noted may arise in the future.

And, nevertheless, the claim would be preemptive.\" Justice Ginsburg also argued that manufacturers may lack the incentive to make their devices safer once they receive PMA because they \"have permission to market this product as is.\" Medtronic's counsel responded by arguing that the FDA could withdraw approval of a device already on the market if there was a safer device in existence or allow both the newer and safer device to coexist on the market with the older device that may have more risks for some patients. Congressional critics argue that the FDA's initiation of withdrawal proceedings \"can be a time consuming process,\" as the FDA \"must establish that the product no longer meets the statute's safety and efficacy requirements.\" Relatedly, these Members note that medical device clinical trials \"will not identify all of the significant risks involved in the use of the device,\" and that rare risks \"will emerge only when a device is released into a larger and more heterogeneous population.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preemption Jurisprudence", "paragraphs": ["One preemption scholar, who commented that litigants and scholars alike see preemption jurisprudence as \"a muddle, a mess,\" saw the ruling as part of a \"framework for pre-emption jurisprudence\" that the Supreme Court may be attempting to create.

The Court \"found it unnecessary to rely upon th[e] agency view [in support of preemption] because we think the statute itself speaks clearly to the point at issue.\" Thus, the FDA regulation did not appear to affect how the Court chose to interpret the statute.", "However, the Court noted (and the dissent agreed with the type of deference that would be given) that if it \"had found the statue ambiguous, and had accorded the agency's current position deference ...

Twombly , which was decided a few months prior to Riegel , and Ashcroft v. Iqbal , which was decided after Riegel . These two cases have been hailed by attorneys for defendant manufacturers and bemoaned by plaintiffs' attorneys for raising the plausibility requirements for pleadings.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has stated that \"the contours of the parallel claim exception were not addressed in Riegel and are as-yet ill-defined.\" However, there may be some commonalities, and as more courts issue decisions on parallel claims post- Riegel , it may be easier to predict the types of parallel claims that courts will allow. According to one law review article, in five of the federal circuit courts, \"in order for a parallel cause of action to be properly alleged, the claims must be premised on a violation of federal law or deviation from federal standard.

At the same time, the agency has been identified as strapped for resources and under strain because of the large amounts of responsibility it possesses. While the Riegel decision does not grant the FDA greater responsibilities or authorities per se, it provides the FDA with more complete control over medical devices in the sense that the FDA's approval and regulatory requirements carry greater weight than state law requirements. The Court's finding that the MDA preempts state common law claims related to devices that receive FDA PMA could conceivably pressure the FDA to more stringently examine devices undergoing the PMA process. However, the FDA is not required to alter its considerations of devices undergoing the PMA process due to the effect that its approval would have in terms of preempting later consumer lawsuits, such as those with regard to defectively designed devices.
