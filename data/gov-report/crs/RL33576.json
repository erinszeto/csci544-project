Some would contend that the ESEA authorizations of appropriations, as amended by NCLBA, represent a funding commitment that was promised in return for legislative support for the new administrative requirements placed on state and local educational systems. They would contend that the authorized levels are needed for implementing the new requirements, and that the differences between promised and actual funding levels represent a shortfall of billions of dollars. Others would contend that the authorized funding levels represent no more than appropriations ceilings, and as such are no different from authorizations for most education programs. That is, when the authorization amount is specified, it represents only a maximum amount, with the actual funding level to be determined during the regular annual appropriations process. In the past, education programs with specified levels of authorization generally have been funded at lower levels; few have been funded at levels equal to or higher than the specified authorization amount.", "Five ESEA programs, as amended by NCLBA, have specific authorization levels for FY2002 through FY2007: Title I, Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs); 21 st Century Community Learning Centers (21CCLC); the Education Block Grant; School Choice; and the Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE). For FY2006, the aggregate authorization for these five programs was $26.3 billion, and the appropriation was $14.3 billion, or $12.0 billion less than the amount authorized. For FY2007, the authorized amount was $28.9 billion for the five programs, and the President requested $15.6 billion, or $13.3 billion less. The FY2007 House bill, as reported, would provide $14.3 billion, and, as reported, the Senate bill would provide $14.2 billion for these five programs in FY2007.

Appropriations have never been sufficient to reach the 40% level. In 2004, Congress addressed the authorization issue in P.L. 108-446 , which specified authorization ceilings for Part B Grants to States for FY2005 through FY2011. For FY2006, the Part B Grants to States authorization was $14.6 billion, and the appropriation was $10.6 billion, or $4.0 billion less than the authorized amount.

For example, most FY2007 appropriations will be available for obligation from October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007. Several L-HHS-ED programs, including some of the larger ED programs, have authorization or appropriations provisions that allow funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year. For example, many of the elementary and secondary education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on July 1 of the same year as the appropriations, and remain available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year. That is, FY2007 appropriations for some programs will become available for obligation to the states on July 1, 2007, and will remain available until September 30, 2008. This budgetary procedure is popularly known as \"forward\" or \"multi-year\" funding, and is accomplished through funding provisions in the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill.", "Forward funding in the case of elementary and secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time for school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year. For Pell Grants for undergraduates, however, aggregate program costs for individual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time. Appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support Pell Grants during the following academic year, that is, the FY2007 appropriations will be used primarily to support grants for the 2007-2008 academic year. Unlike funding for elementary and secondary education programs, however, the funds for Pell Grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years.", "An advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for a fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation was enacted. In the case of FY2007 appropriations, funds normally would have become available October 1, 2006, under regular funding provisions, but will not become available until July 1, 2007, under the forward funding provisions discussed above. However, if the July 1, 2007 forward funding date for obligation were to be postponed by three months\u2014until October 1, 2007\u2014the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in a subsequent fiscal year , FY2008. For example, the FY2007 budget request for Title I, Part A Grants to LEAs for the Education for the Disadvantaged was $12.7 billion. This amount includes not only forward funding of $5.3 billion (to become available July 1, 2007), but also an advance appropriation of $7.4 billion (to become available October 1, 2007). Like forward funding provisions, these advance appropriations are specified through provisions in the annual appropriations bill.", "What is the impact of these changes in funding provisions? At the appropriations level, there is no difference between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period available for obligation. At the program or service level, relatively little is changed by the three-month delay in the availability of funds, since most expenditures for a standard school year occur after October 1. At the scorekeeping level, however, a significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year, and is therefore fully included in the current 302(b) allocation for discretionary appropriations. Under federal budget scorekeeping rules, an advance appropriation is not counted in the 302(b) allocation until the following year. In essence, a three-month change from forward funding to an advance appropriation for a given program allows a one-time shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations.
