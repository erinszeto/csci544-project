Almost $7billion was spent for such services for teens in 1998. While many youth have used alcohol or otherillicit drugs, less than 2% received treatment for substance use in 2000. In 1997, costs for such carefor children under 18 totaled $604 million.", "In this report, the availability of selected mental health and substance abuse services underMedicaid and SCHIP for low and moderate income children is explored. Under SCHIP, states mayprovide coverage by expanding Medicaid or creating a separate SCHIP program or both. Data fromtwo CRS-sponsored surveys, documenting general limits placed on such services as of June, 2000,are presented. For Medicaid, including Medicaid expansions under SCHIP, survey results werereported for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. For separate SCHIP programs, survey resultswere reported for all 41 programs operating in 33 states.", "Nearly all Medicaid and SCHIP programs covered inpatient and outpatient mental healthservices for children, and most also covered inpatient detoxification and outpatient substance abusetreatment. Such benefits were more frequently unlimited under Medicaid than under SCHIP. Whilethe majority of Medicaid programs covered residential treatment centers, most SCHIP programs didnot. In many cases, expressing benefit limits as a simple quantity (e.g., days of care, admissions peryear, visits/hours per year) did not address the full scope of restrictions on coverage. Other meansof limiting benefits were also reported (e.g., use of prior authorization, thresholds specific tocondition/diagnosis, and treatment plan requirements). Under SCHIP, but not Medicaid, a singlequantity limit was often applied to two or more related benefits combined rather than separately foreach benefit category.", "Coverage policies and benefit limits for children under Medicaid are seldom absolute in partbecause of special provisions in the law requiring that children receive all medically necessaryservices authorized in federal statute. This guarantee does not exist in SCHIP. Instead, SCHIPchildren have access to similar types of benefit packages available in the private sector.", "Facing declining revenues and increased expenses, some states are implementing a numberof Medicaid cost containment strategies focused on reductions in provider payments, and reductionsin and/or elimination of optional services and populations, mostly affecting adults. Under SCHIP,some states are also capping enrollment and increasing beneficiary cost-sharing. While theseproposed strategies appear to leave mental health and substance abuse benefits for children largelyintact, they could effectively limit access to care.", "Finally, this report also describes mental health parity and its application to Medicaid andSCHIP under current federal law, and related, pending legislation in the 108th Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What are Mental Health And Substance Abuse Services?", "paragraphs": ["Mental health and substance abuse services are designed to ameliorate the negative effectsof mental illness and use of, or addiction to, illicit drugs, respectively. (6) According to the 1999Surgeon General's report on mental health, (7) mental illness refers to all diagnosable mental disorders, which areconditions characterized by alterations in thinking, mood or behavior (or combinations thereof).Among children, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is primarily marked byalterations in behavior (overactivity) and/or thinking (inability to concentrate). Depression ischaracterized by alterations in mood. In general, mental disorders can lead to distress, impairedfunctioning in daily life, and increased risk of pain, disability, death or loss of freedom. Treatmentfor mental illness is generally of three types--psychosocial (various types of individual, family andgroup therapies), pharmacological (prescription drugs), or a combination of both. ", "The Surgeon General's report also describes a patchwork of mental health services that havecome to form a de facto mental health system over the past three centuries. This system has distinctsectors, two of which are most relevant to the purpose of this report -- the specialty mental healthsector and the general medical/primary care sector. ", "Speciality mental health services include services provided by specialized mental healthprofessionals (e.g., psychologists, psychiatric nurses, psychiatrists, and psychiatric social workers),expressly for the provision of mental health care. The general medical/primary care sector consistsof health professionals (e.g., family practitioners, nurse practitioners, internists, pediatricians, etc.)who provide the full range of medical and health services, including but not exclusively for mentalhealth care.", "Various types of mental health treatment are also defined by their duration and setting. Duration of care is divided into services for the treatment of acute conditions versus long-termchronic care. Settings of care include institutional (e.g., hospital, nursing facility, residentialtreatment facilities), community-based (e.g., in public and private schools, services provided bymental health professionals in an office), and home-based. ", "While a recent comprehensive analysis of the current system of care for substance abuse inthis country is lacking, the Surgeon General's description of the patchwork nature of the mentalhealth care system likely applies in this context as well. Substance abuse treatment services aregenerally of two types: (1) detoxification (i.e., to rid the body of the toxic substance) and medicationmanagement (i.e., to control withdrawal symptoms and drug craving, and to block the effects ofdrugs), and (2) education, counseling and rehabilitation. All these services are designed to reduceor eliminate use of and dependence on alcohol or illicit drugs, to improve the individual's ability tofunction, and to minimize other medical and social complications of drug abuse. (8) Care is provided in bothinpatient and outpatient settings, including community- and home-based services, with varying levelsof intensity in response to the individual's acute or chronic care needs. And as with mental healthcare, there are substance abuse specialty practitioners as well as general medical/primary careproviders that treat individuals with alcohol and drug problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Medicaid and SCHIP", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid. Medicaid is a federal-state entitlementprogram that pays for medical services on behalf of certain low-income individuals.

In FY2002, federal paymentsrose to $146.2 billion. (9) ", "Eligibility for Medicaid. To qualify for Medicaid,applicants' income and resources (also called assets) must be within program financial standards . These standards vary considerably among states, and different standards apply to different populationgroups within a state. Medicaid eligibility is also subject to categorical restrictions -- generally, itis available only to low-income persons who are aged, blind, disabled, members of families withdependent children, and certain other pregnant women and children. In addition, certain individualswithin these categories and with higher income, especially those facing high costs for medical care,may also be eligible. (This latter group is sometimes referred to as the medically needy; see belowfor more details).", "The Medicaid statute defines over 50 distinct population groups as potentially eligible,including those who must be covered and those for whom coverage is optional. Eligibility groupshave traditionally been divided into two classifications -- the \"categorically needy\" and the\"medically needy.\" For the purposes of this report, this distinction is important because the scopeof services that states must provide to categorically needy individuals is much broader than thatrequired for the medically needy.", "In addition to financial requirements, for some eligibility groups, disability status is alsoconsidered. For example, the mandatory categorically needy coverage group of recipients ofSupplemental Security Income (SSI) (10) requires the presence of a disability. For children, the SSIdisability criteria are defined by types of functional impairments affecting daily life and may includemental illness. Substance abuse is not considered to be a disability for SSI purposes, and hence, forMedicaid.", "Examples of other major mandatory categorically needy groups relevant to children and forwhich no disability criteria apply include: (1) members of families who meet the requirements of theformer Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program as in effect on July 16, 1996, (2)pregnant women and children under six years of age living in families with income up to 133% ofthe federal poverty level (FPL), (11) and (3) children ages 6 to 19 living in families with income upto 100% of the FPL. Children with mental illness and/or substance abuse problems may qualify forcoverage under these latter groups if the financial criteria, which in some cases are more generousthan the SSI pathway into Medicaid, are met.", "The medically needy are persons who fit the definition of a categorical group (e.g., they areaged, disabled, children or members of families), but who do not meet applicable income and/orresource standards. States may establish higher income and resource standards for the medicallyneedy. (12) Also, suchpersons may \"spend down\" to the medically needy income standard by incurring medical expenses. That is, net income after subtracting medical expenses is used to determine eligibility.", "States have the option of covering the medically needy, and if they choose to do so, they mustinclude children under 18 who would qualify under a mandatory categorically needy group, andpregnant women who would qualify under a mandatory or optional categorically needy group, exceptthat their income and/or resources are too high. States may also offer medically needy coverage tootherwise ineligible individuals under 21 who meet the applicable financial criteria. States maycover all such individuals or reasonable subclassifications (e.g., those in publically subsidized fostercare or adoptions, those receiving active treatment as inpatients in psychiatric facilities or programs).

This is in part dueto the fact that many of the benefit categories listed in Medicaid statute identify a type of providerrather than a type of service. For example, a wide variety of providers can deliver outpatient mentalhealth and substance abuse services. Under Medicaid, the benefit categories listed in statute underwhich such care is most likely covered include outpatient hospital services, rural health and federallyqualified health center services (providers that deliver primary medical services and mental healthcare), physician services (e.g., psychiatrists), other practitioner services (e.g., psychologists, socialworkers), and other clinic services (e.g., community mental health centers and other specialty mentalhealth or substance abuse clinics). Inpatient mental health services and inpatient detoxification aremost likely covered as inpatient hospital services or inpatient psychiatric services for persons underage 21.

Residential treatment centers aretypically covered as inpatient psychiatric services for persons under 21, or under the rehabilitativeservices option.", "In general, the coverable benefits listed in SCHIP statute are more closely aligned to theservice categories included on the surveys. However, there is not an obvious, single benefit categorylisted in SCHIP statute that would encompass residential treatment centers. Several could apply here(e.g., inpatient mental health services, inpatient substance abuse services, rehabilitative services). ", "In sum, each of the five categories of service used in the surveys likely corresponds tomultiple benefits listed in both Medicaid and SCHIP statute. This is an important problem for thesurvey design because very different limits may apply to \"outpatient mental health services,\" as usedon the surveys, when delivered as a \"physician service\" versus an \"other clinic service,\" for example. For this reason, the survey data are imprecise. Therefore, the results from the two surveys representgeneral, statewide benefit limit policies for broad classifications of mental health and substanceabuse services for children under each program.", "Overall, the value of the survey data presented here is not in the specific, detailed responsesthat each state agency provided on benefit limits for each service category. To further complicatethe picture, both Medicaid and SCHIP programs rely on managed care organizations (MCOs) todeliver services to most beneficiaries (described further below). Detailed data on variations inbenefit limits specific to individual managed care contracts under each state program, which candiffer from the general criteria delineated in state plans as reported here, were not captured. Also,states may have changed coverage policies since June, 2000 (the point in time represented by thesurvey data), especially during the past few years as they began to face growing state budgetconstraints and rapidly rising Medicaid costs. Instead, the importance of these survey results lies inthe identification of the different methods states use in their Medicaid versus SCHIP programs todefine the breadth of these services for children.

The methods forlimiting benefits are summarized below.", "Inpatient Mental Health Services. With respectto limits on inpatient mental health services under Medicaid, many states (23 of 51) (21) reported using priorauthorization or other types of review only. A few states specified other kinds of limits in additionto or in lieu of prior authorization or other review, usually in the form of a quantity limit on thenumber of inpatient mental health days per year or per admission. ", "In contrast, few separate SCHIP programs relied exclusively on prior authorization or otherreview only for inpatient mental health services. Nearly one-half of these programs (17 of 39)indicated that specific quantity limits applied to inpatient mental health services. Some of theseprograms (9 of 17) set a single overall quantity limit, usually expressed in terms of days per year, oninpatient mental health services in combination with other related benefits, such as inpatientsubstance abuse treatment or other residential care, and in some cases, outpatient mental healthand/or substance abuse services, or partial hospitalization programs. (22) This practice of applyinga single quantity limit to a combination of related services may facilitate the tailoring of benefits toever changing individual needs, especially for persons with both mental health and substance abuseproblems, while at the same time controlling utilization, and hence costs, for services that tend tobe expensive. ", "For several programs (8 of 39), state respondents highlighted that quantity limits for inpatientmental health care varied by managed care organization, while others established thresholds thatvaried by type of provider (e.g., general acute care versus psychiatric hospitals; 3 of 39) orbeneficiary diagnosis or condition (e.g., unlimited care only for children with severe emotionaldisturbances enrolled in a behavioral health plan; 1 of 39).", "Outpatient Mental Health Services. Other typesof thresholds were used by states to define the breadth of outpatient mental health services. UnderMedicaid, a few states (4 of 51) reported that dollar-based limits were used. More often, othernon-dollar quantity limits applied, expressed in units or hours of service, or in visits, typically peryear (14 of 51). In a few cases, limits varied by type of outpatient mental health service (e.g.,individual versus group versus family therapy; 2 of 51) or by whether the provider was a physicianversus other practitioner (4 of 51). A few states (4 of 51) required an initial evaluation anddevelopment of a treatment plan for each beneficiary which would determine what the Medicaidagency would pay for on behalf of such individuals. ", "In general, the types of limits placed on outpatient mental health services under SCHIP weresimiliar to those under Medicaid. Non-dollar quantity limits were applied in over one-half ofseparate SCHIP programs (22 of 40). In several cases (6 of 40), a single overall quantity limit foroutpatient mental health services, in combination with related benefits, was used. Few programs (2of 40) used dollar-based limits. And a handful of programs had provider-specific, type ofservice-specific or condition-specific restrictions on outpatient mental health services (4 of 40).", "Outpatient Substance Abuse Services. In general,under both Medicaid and SCHIP, the methods used to limit outpatient substance abuse services weresimilar to those used to define restrictions on outpatient mental health care (see above).", "Inpatient Detoxification. The immediate purposeof hospitalizations for detoxification is to rid the body of the toxic substance. Under Medicaid,one-half of the states (22 of 43) used prior authorization or other types of review to monitor suchcare. In a few cases (3 of 43), day limits for inpatient detoxification tended to be short (e.g., threeto five days) probably reflecting per admission/episode limits. Otherwise, such stays were treatedin the same way as any other acute care hospitalization, and thus, overall quantity limits (typicallyexpressed as total admissions and/or total inpatient days per year) on general inpatient acute careapplied.", "Limits placed on inpatient detoxification services under SCHIP were somewhat differentfrom those reported for Medicaid. For example, only three programs relied solely on priorauthorization or other review for this benefit. One-fourth of these programs (9 of 37) used day limitsper year or benefit period for such care. Some set a single quantity limit for inpatient detoxificationservices in combination with other related benefits (4 of 37). A few (3 of 37) also specified lifetimelimits (e.g., expressed as total dollars or admissions per lifetime) on inpatient detoxification services.", "Residential Treatment Center Services. RTCsare rapidly replacing hospitals in treating children with psychiatric disorders. (23) In many state Medicaidprograms (19 of 38), prior authorization or other types of reviews accompany admissions to RTCsfor children. When quantity limits were specified, they tended to be day limits per admission orepisode (4 of 38).", "As reported above, under SCHIP, most programs did not cover RTC services at all. Amongthose which did, most (9 of 23) reported day limits per admission, episode, year or benefit period. As with many of the other services included in the CRS-sponsored surveys, some SCHIP programs(5 of 23) established a single quantity limit applicable to RTC services in combination with otherrelated institutional and outpatient treatments for mental illness and/or substance abuse."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Nature of Coverage and Benefit Limits for Children Under Medicaid and SCHIP", "paragraphs": ["Comparing benefit limits under Medicaid and SCHIP must be done with care because theterm \"limits\" does not have the same meaning across these two programs. This difference in themeaning of \"limits\" has implications for both the relative breadth or scope of care available undereach program as well as efforts to collect uniform, comparable data on benefit restrictions.", "In addition to defining the amount, duration and scope of all covered services, states alsoelect the service delivery systems under which benefits are made available to Medicaid and SCHIPbeneficiaries. There are two primary service delivery systems under each program: fee-for-service(FFS) and managed care. Generally, under FFS, state Medicaid and SCHIP agencies monitor andcontrol all service delivery. In contrast, under managed care, MCOs under contract to states monitorand control all service delivery. These two systems of care are not entirely independent of eachother. There are hybrid models across states that combine various features of FFS and managed carefor a given population or set of interrelated services. At any given point in time, beneficiaries mayobtain all their services under a single system or different sets of services under both systemssimultaneously.", "Under Medicaid, specific limits on benefits have grown out of the fee-for-serviceenvironment in which Medicaid began. State Medicaid agencies determine which optional serviceswill be covered, and set limits on both mandatory and optional services. Such agencies alsoestablish other utilization controls (e.g., prior authorization) to ensure that beneficiaries do notreceive services they do not need or in amounts greater than that needed to serve their medicalpurpose. Providers receive payments from the state based on rates established by the state for agiven benefit or type of provider.", "Under FFS, health care providers must obtain special permission or approval from the stateto continue delivery of medically necessary services beyond the pre-defined, standard upper limitset by the state for a given benefit. For example, a state Medicaid plan may limit coverage ofoutpatient mental health services to 24 visits per year. But children who need more than 24 suchvisits in a year can obtain additional visits, as long as the provider of care demonstrates the medicalnecessity for more visits. Stated limits on benefits reflect what providers can generally expect to bepaid for in the absence of official clearance for more services, rather than definitive limits on whatbeneficiaries may receive. The fee-for-service delivery system is generally used by individualswhose Medicaid eligibility group (e.g., the aged and individuals with disabilities) or geographiclocation (e.g., rural areas) is not served through managed care, or for persons who opt out whenmanaged care is voluntary.", "Most Medicaid children without disabilities receive services in the managed care setting. Under this system of care, state Medicaid agencies negotiate different benefit plans with one or morecontracted managed care organizations (MCOs). MCOs may be commercial plans (e.g., KaiserPermanente) that serve private sector beneficiaries as well as Medicaid and/or SCHIP enrollees. Insome cases, states also contract with Medicaid-only plans. State Medicaid agencies generally payeach MCO a fixed, prospectively determined, monthly fee for each beneficiary enrolled. In turn, theMCOs establish networks of participating providers to deliver the agreed-upon covered services andpay those providers negotiated rates. Benefit plans may be comprehensive or limited in scope (e.g.,behavioral health services only, also referred to as \"carve out\" plans). There are likely to bevariations in coverage of, and limits placed on, specific benefits across Medicaid managed care planswithin a given state. Managed care plans also employ utilization controls to monitor service deliveryand to insure that benefits provided are medically necessary (similar to the point at which priorauthorization begins in the fee-for-service delivery system in Medicaid).", "Even though most Medicaid programs provide services through managed care plans,especially for children without disabilities and families, most states continue to operate significant,parallel fee-for-service programs. Under a Medicaid managed care plan, if benefit limits are met bya Medicaid child and additional services are medically necessary beyond the contractual agreementbetween the MCO and the Medicaid agency, additional funding may be provided to the MCO forextended services, or that child may continue to receive such services in the fee-for-service setting. ", "Coverage policies and benefit limits described in state Medicaid plans are seldom absolute,especially for children, due to the medical necessity criterion, but also because of EPSDT. Underboth fee-for-service and managed care, for nearly all Medicaid children, states are required toprovide all federally-allowed treatment to correct identified problems, even if the specific treatmentneeded is not otherwise covered under a state's Medicaid plan. As a result, when a Medicaid agencyreports that a specific benefit is not covered for children, that means the service is only availablewhen delivery of that service meets the EPSDT requirement. In these circumstances, providerstypically go through a prior authorization process to receive payment for what are sometimes called\"EPSDT extended benefits.\"", "Unlike Medicaid, but consistent with federal statute, separate SCHIP programs are modeledafter private sector, commercial insurance products. The requirement to use benchmark plans (oractuarial equivalents of those plans), most of which are state employee health plans or commercialHMO plans, provides the framework for defining benefit limits. ", "Under SCHIP, managed care is the predominant service delivery system. At the time of theCRS-sponsored survey (June, 2000), all but five SCHIP programs (Alabama, North Carolina, NorthDakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming) contracted with one or more managed care or indemnity plansto deliver care to SCHIP children. California contracted with 23 comprehensive health plans. Somestates also use a FFS delivery system. Under commercial insurance products, benefits are alwayslimited by medical necessity, but other limits, when applicable, vary by insurance product, as do thepoints at which each insurer monitors service delivery for medical need and appropriateness. Payments to providers participating in these plans may be altered based on the outcome of suchservice utilization reviews, which can in turn affect access to care.", "In the CRS-sponsored survey, some of the benefits for which data on limits were collected(i.e., residential treatment centers) are commonly covered under Medicaid, but not routinely includedin commercial insurance products, and hence, SCHIP. There is no federal EPSDT requirement underSCHIP that would guarantee the availability of uncommon, but coverable benefits. ", "In sum, a small, but significant proportion of children have mental health problems. Somealso suffer from the consequences of substance abuse. Medicaid and SCHIP provide access to anarray of inpatient and outpatient services that can help such children in low to moderate incomefamilies overcome these difficulties. However, the breadth of benefits available under these twoprograms likely differs within and across states. Limits on benefits for the lowest income childrenunder Medicaid are seldom absolute, while restrictions on services for higher income children underSCHIP may be. SCHIP children have access to the same types of benefit packages available in theprivate sector as intended by Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in Benefits Under Medicaid and SCHIP Today", "paragraphs": ["Given the recent economic downturn, some members of Congress and advocates for childrenhave raised concerns about the elimination or reduction in benefits under state health care programs. On average, Medicaid expenditures account for approximately 12% of the state funded portion ofstate budgets. Much of the recent increases in costs have been attributed to pharmaceuticals, nursinghome, community-based long-term care services, and payments to managed care plans. However,enrollment increases have also contributed to significant growth in Medicaid costs in the past fewyears.", "Faced with declining revenues and increasing expenses, states proposed or implemented anumber of Medicaid cost containment strategies for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. (24) The majority of changeshave focused on prescription drug costs followed by reductions in provider reimbursement rates, andthe elimination or reduction in optional services and populations. Examples of such actions includeeliminating coverage for certain adults and non-custodial parents, and eliminating dental,chiropractic, optometry and podiatry services. In addition, many states are delaying or rescindingplans for expansions of services.", "Some states are also facing problematic enrollment growth and limited revenues in theirSCHIP programs. About one-third of states have either implemented cost containment measures intheir SCHIP programs in FY2003 or plan to do so in FY2004. Examples of such activities includeeliminating dental care for adults without children (under SCHIP waiver programs), reducingpayments for providers, capping enrollment and increasing beneficiary cost-sharing requirements. In some states, cost containment activities under Medicaid, such as reducing pharmacyreimbursement rates and increasing prior authorization for pharmaceuticals, carry over to SCHIP.", "Detailed state-level information on explicit plans to reduce benefits for children under eitherprogram is not available.

(25) While the CRS-sponsored surveys described in this report donot address this question, mental health parity is a leading policy issue for the mental healthcommunity and providers, as well as lawmakers. ", "In 1996, Congress enacted the Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA), which established newfederal standards for mental health coverage offered by group health plans. The MHPA, however,is limited in scope and does not compel group plans to offer full-parity mental health coverage. Itrequires group plans that choose to provide mental health benefits to adopt the same annual andlifetime dollar limits on their coverage of mental and physical illnesses. Group plans may stillimpose more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing requirements on their mental healthcoverage. MHPA specifically excludes treatment of substance abuse and chemical dependency fromthe definition of mental health benefits. ", "Both Medicaid managed care plans and SCHIP programs must comply with the MHPA.Specifically, all prepaid Medicaid managed care contracts that cover medical/surgical benefits andmental health benefits must comply with MHPA without exemptions. The MHPA does not applyto fee-for-service arrangements because state Medicaid agencies do not meet the definition of agroup health plan. (26) In separate SCHIP programs, to the extent that a health insurance issuer offers group healthinsurance coverage, which can include, but is not limited to managed care, the MHPA applies.", "Congress has reauthorized the MHPA through December 31, 2004. Lawmakers introducedfull-parity legislation in the 107th Congress, but it failed to pass. The legislation, which has beenreintroduced in the 108th Congress ( S. 486 / H.R. 953 ), would expand theMHPA by requiring group health plans to impose the same treatment limitations and financialrequirements on their mental health coverage as they do on their medical and surgical coverage. Thebills are strongly supported by advocates for the mentally ill and have broad, bipartisan support inCongress. Employers and health insurance organizations oppose full-parity legislation because ofconcerns that it will drive up costs.
