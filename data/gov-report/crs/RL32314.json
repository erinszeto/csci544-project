{"id": "RL32314", "title": "U.S.-Thailand Free Trade Agreement Negotiations", "released_date": "2007-01-16T00:00:00", "summary": ["President Bush and former Thai Prime Minister Thaskin on October 19, 2003, agreed to negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA). Six negotiating rounds took place, the most recent January 10-13, 2006 in Thailand. U.S. trade officials had hoped to conclude the negotiations by early 2006, but the negotiations were suspended by Thailand in February 2006 due to Bangkok's political crisis. After 18 months of negotiations the two sides were wide apart on a number of issues, such as financial services liberalization and a number of other sensitive issues. Combined with considerable public opposition to the FTA in Thailand, the Bush Administration may be hard pressed to complete the negotiation before trade promotion authority expires in mid-2007. While the Thai government appointed by the military after Thailand's September 2006 coup remains committed to concluding an FTA with the United States, it also plans to submit any agreement to the 242 National Legislative Assembly (NLA) for approval\u2014a step that deposed Prime Minister Thaskin maintained was not required. At this date, however, there are no plans (date or venue) to resume the negotiations.", "In the notification letter sent to the congressional leadership, then-U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick put forth an array of commercial and foreign policy gains that could be derived from the agreement. The letter stated that an FTA would be particularly beneficial to U.S. agricultural producers, as well as to U.S. companies exporting goods and services to Thailand and investing there. Mr. Zoellick also alluded to sensitive issues that would need to be addressed: trade in automobiles, protection of intellectual property rights, and labor and environmental standards.", "Thailand has been viewed as a strong candidate for an FTA with the United States. Its economy has shown relatively healthy growth in recent years, rising by 6.2% in 2004 and 4.5% in 2005. Yet, Thailand maintains relatively high tariff and non-tariff barriers on a number of products and services. Secondly, an FTA with Thailand would allow U.S. exporters to gain access to Thai markets similar to that obtained by other countries through bilateral and plurilateral agreements with Thailand. Third, a U.S.-Thailand FTA would likely induce other countries to seek a trade liberalization agreement with the United States. Countries that form FTAs agree at a minimum to phase out or reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) on mutual trade in order to enhance market access between the trading partners. The U.S.-Thailand FTA is expected to be comprehensive, seeking to liberalize trade in goods, agriculture, services, and investment, as well as intellectual property rights. Other issues such as government procurement, competition policy, environment and labor standards, and customs procedures are also on the negotiating table.", "The U.S.-Thailand FTA negotiations are of interest to Congress because (1) an agreement would require passage of implementing legislation to go into effect; (2) an agreement could increase U.S. exports of goods, services, and investment, with particular benefits for agricultural exports; and (3) an agreement could increase competition for U.S. import-competing industries such as textiles and apparel and light trucks, thereby raising the issue of job losses. This report will be updated if negotiations are resumed."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Why a U.S.-Thailand FTA?", "paragraphs": ["The Bush Administration notified Congress on February 12, 2004, that it intends to begin free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with Thailand. This notification, which follows an October 19, 2003 announcement by President Bush and former Thai Prime Minister Thaskin of their agreement to launch negotiations, allows for talks to begin within 90 days or by mid-May 2004, after required consultations with Congress. Two negotiating sessions took place in 2004, and a third was held April 4-8, 2005, in Thailand. The fourth and fifth sessions were held July 15, 2005, in Montana, and September 26-30, 2005, in Hawaii. The sixth was held in Thailand from January 10-13, 2006. But Thailand suspended negotiations on February 24, 2006, when it was decided that a new election would be held in April. Since the April election, no decision has been made yet to resume the negotiations due to ongoing political turmoil (the April election was invalidated by the constitutional court and a new general election is to take place this fall).", "In the notification letter sent to the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, then-U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick put forth an array of potential commercial and foreign policy gains that could be derived from the agreement. At the same time, Mr. Zoellick alluded to sensitive issues that require attention: trade in automobiles, protection of intellectual property rights, and labor and environmental standards.", "Zoellick's letter states that an FTA would be particularly beneficial to U.S. agricultural producers who have urged the administration to move forward, as well as to U.S. companies exporting industrial goods and services. For agricultural producers, by eliminating or reducing Thailand's high tariffs and other barriers, the FTA offers the opportunity to significantly increase export sales to Thailand. In 2005, Thailand was the 16 th largest market for U.S. farm exports.", "The administration also argued that an FTA would help boost U.S. exports of goods and services in sectors such as information technology, telecommunications, financial services, audiovisual, automotive, and medical equipment. In 2005, U.S. companies exported to Thailand $7.4 billion in goods and over $1 billion in services. Maintaining preferential access for U.S. investors in Thailand is also a top priority for U.S. business. Given that Thailand is a relatively small economy compared to the United States (1/100 th \"the size\"), the agreement by itself will have limited effects on the overall U.S. economy.", "From the standpoint of U.S. foreign policy interests, the Administration views the proposed FTA as strengthening cooperation with Thailand in bilateral, regional, and multilateral fora. Bilaterally, the FTA is seen as strengthening Thailand's position as a key military ally, particularly in the war on terrorism. Regionally, the FTA is viewed as advancing President Bush's Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative (EAI). The goal of the EAI is to negotiate a network of bilateral trade agreements with the 10 members of ASEAN. Multilaterally, Thailand plays a key leadership role in the World Trade Organization (WTO). An FTA could encourage Thailand to actively cooperate with the United States in supporting multilateral trade negotiations under the aegis of the Doha Development Agenda, particularly in the area of agricultural liberalization.", "As for Thailand, similar broad economic and political calculations explain its interest in an FTA. In economic terms, Thailand is very concerned that its exports to the United States have been losing market share in recent years to countries such as Mexico and China. By eliminating U.S. tariff and non-tariff barriers to Thai exports, an FTA could help increase the competitiveness and market share of Thai products in the U.S. market. Thailand also does not want to be excluded from FTA benefits the U.S. has negotiated with other countries, particularly the potential of an FTA to increase U.S. investment in Thailand. Modernization of the services economy and diffusion of higher levels of technology, know-how, and labor management skills are essential for the Thai economy to advance beyond the competition from lower-wage emerging market economies such as China, Vietnam, and Laos. In addition, a closer political and economic relationship with the United States could provide Thailand with more leverage to play a larger role in Southeast Asia.", "General opposition to the FTA in both countries is expected from workers and companies in import-competing industries that bear the brunt of the adjustment costs of a trade agreement. Despite the welfare gains to society as a whole (e.g. more efficient resource allocation, lower priced imports, and greater selection of goods), those industries subject to increased competition face additional pressure to cut costs, wages, and prices. Some companies may not be able to withstand these pressure and may be forced out of business, accompanied by a loss of jobs. Under these circumstances, certain stakeholders, as a matter of self-interest, may oppose trade agreements that accelerate competition and structural changes in an economy.", "Specific opposition in Thailand has arisen from stakeholders in the agricultural and services sectors. Given that close to 50 percent of the Thai labor force is employed in agriculture, liberalization of this sector has been contentious. Similarly, in a number of services sectors, Thai companies feel they are at a competitive disadvantage in opening up to U.S. competitors. Thailand's banking and financial services industry, in particular, is wary of further liberalization after the financial crisis of 1997. Thai stakeholders are also particularly wary, given the high incidence of AIDS infections, in U.S. efforts to secure data exclusivity for patented pharmaceuticals. In addition, a number of Thai business interests reportedly are concerned over potential U.S. investment in newly privatized companies such as the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand and the Mass Rapid Transit Authority.", "Opposition in the United States may arise from groups concerned about the impact of the trade agreement on labor and environmental standards. Often joined by anti-globalization activists, these interest groups question whether trade agreements enhance the social welfare of participating countries. Other issues such as transparency in government decision-making, human rights, and freedom of the press could also be raised. Increased market access for Thai agricultural products such as rice and sugar, as well as a reduction of the 25% U.S. tariff on lightweight pick-up trucks, is already controversial. In addition, Thailand is a persistent opponent and critic of U.S. trade remedy laws, which many U.S. interests groups don't want to see weakened.", "In short, competing viewpoints have surfaced regarding the desirability of an FTA. As in most FTAs that the United States has negotiated, the distribution of gains and losses would depend on the details of the provisions.", "As background for congressional oversight, this report examines Thailand's economy and trade orientation, the scope and significance of the U.S.-Thai commercial relationship, and the likely top issues in the negotiations. The report concludes with a short summary of the Congressional role and interest in the FTA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Thailand's Economy and Trade Orientation", "paragraphs": ["Thailand was severely affected by the Asian Financial Crisis, which hit the Thai economy in July 1997 and subsequently affected several other East Asian economies. The economic crisis in Thailand was characterized by a significant depreciation of its currency (the baht), depletion of nearly all of Thailand's foreign exchange reserves, a decline in the stock market, bankruptcies among a number of major Thai banks and corporations, and a sharp deterioration of property prices. The combination of these shocks led to a sharp economic downturn. Ten years prior to the 1997 crisis, Thailand had been one of the world's fastest growing economies. Between 1990 and 1996, gross domestic product (GDP) averaged 8.6%, fueled in large part by rapid export growth. However, in 1998, GDP fell by 10.5% while, exports and imports dropped by 6.7% and 33.0%, respectively, over 1997 levels (see Table 1 ). In addition, the unemployment rate rose from 3.2% in 1997 to 7.3% in 1998, and living standards (measured according to per capita GDP measured on a purchasing power parity basis), plummeted by 11%.", "Thailand's economy was stabilized by a $17.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Real GDP grew by 4.4% in 1999 and by 4.8% in 2000, but slowed to 2.2% in 2001. Public dissatisfaction in Thailand with the way the government was handling economic restructuring brought about the election of a new coalition government in 2001 (headed by the Thai Rak Thai Party) with Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister. He launched a series of economic initiatives designed to stabilize the economy, boost domestic demand, encourage the growth of small and medium-sized businesses, and improve rural incomes. Thailand's economy experienced relatively strong growth from 2002-2004; real GDP growth averaged 6.2%. Real GDP growth was more modest in 2005 at 4.5%, due to a number of factors, including the December 2004 tsunami, higher energy prices, rising inflation, concerns over the avian influenza (bird flu), and domestic insurgencies. Global Insight, an international economic forecasting firm, estimates Thailand's real GDP will rise by 4.6% in 2006 and 5.2% in 2007. Major economic challenges include reducing the high level of corporate debt and the amount of non-performing loans held by the banking sector.", "Thailand's economy is heavily dependent on international trade and foreign investment. In 2005, the value of Thailand's merchandise exports was equal to 63% of its GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important source of exports, employment, and access to new technologies and processes. Thailand's top five trading partners in 2005 were ASEAN, Japan, the European Union, the United States, and China (see Table 2 ). The United States was Thailand's second largest export market and its fifth largest supplier of imports. Thailand's major exports (2004 data) included machinery and mechanical appliances (mainly computers and computer parts), electrical apparatus for electrical circuits, and electrical appliances. Major imports included mineral and metal products, electronic parts, and crude oil. Annual FDI flows to Thailand have been relatively flat over the past few years, averaging about $1.5 billion annually from 2002 to 2005. Some analysts contend that China may be drawing FDI away from Thailand and other East Asian countries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S.-Thailand Commercial Relations", "paragraphs": ["The United States and Thailand maintain extensive commercial ties.

U.S.-invested firms in Thailand employ over 200,000 Thai nationals. Major sectors for U.S. FDI in Thailand include petroleum, banking, electronics, and automotive. In recent years, U.S. auto companies have invested heavily in Thailand.", "In 2005, Thailand was the 23 rd largest U.S. export market ($7.4 billion) and its 16 th largest source of imports ($20.0 billion) (see Table 3 ).

Still, a number of contentious issues persist. Thai officials have criticized U.S. agricultural subsidy programs, contending that they give U.S. farmers an unfair competitive advantage. In addition, Thailand has participated in two WTO dispute resolution cases against the United States: U.S. anti-dumping subsidy offsets (the \"Byrd Amendment\"), and U.S. restrictions on shrimp imports.

Many Thai tariff rates are much higher than the average and tend to be applied to imports competing with locally produced products. These include tariffs on autos and auto parts, alcoholic beverages, fabrics, footwear and headgear, and some electrical appliances. For example, the tariff on passenger cars and sport utility vehicles is 80%, the tariff on motorcycles 60%, and the tariff on completely knocked down (CKD) auto kits 33%. Tariffs on fabrics range from 25%-40%.", "Beyond cuts in tariffs, market access for U.S. goods could be improved by reducing excessive paperwork and undue processing delays in Thai customs procedures.

The International Intellectual Property Rights Alliance (IIPA) estimates that IPR piracy in Thailand cost U.S. firms $175 million in 2004.", "U.S. IPR stakeholders lobbied hard to see Thailand make more progress on IPR enforcement before the FTA negotiations were formally announced.

Exceptions in the Singapore agreement deal with sectors that usually require government certification or licenses (lawyers, accountants) involve government institutions (airports, provision of social security, public hospitals, government corporations), or involve national policy (atomic energy).", "Major financial institutions in Thailand include the central bank, commercial banks, finance companies, securities companies, and insurance companies. Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Thailand increasingly deregulated and liberalized access of foreign firms to its financial sector. For example, foreign equity limits were relaxed for ten years to allow foreign ownership of up to 100% (previously 25%) in commercial banks and finance companies. However, new capital invested in these companies after the ten-year period must be provided by domestic investors until foreign-held equity share falls to 49%. Other restrictions concerning the number branches foreign banks may operate, as well as limits on the number of expatriate professionals that can be employed, could also be raised in the negotiations.
