Thus, a cap-and-trade system is intended (and expected) to increase the price of coal, oil, natural gas, and the products they help create, including electricity.", "Congress can affect the distribution of the costs imposed by an emissions cap through emission allowance allocation. In a cap-and-trade system, one emission allowance typically represents the authority to emit one metric ton of GHG emissions. Emission allowances would become a valuable new commodity, potentially accounting, in aggregate, for tens or hundreds of billions of dollars. Therefore, when designing a cap-and-trade program, one of the more controversial and challenging questions for policymakers is how, to whom, and for what purpose to distribute the emission allowance value\u2014the actual revenue or potential revenue (i.e., the value of the allowance as an asset) represented by the allowances.", "Without redistribution of allowance value, cap-imposed costs would ultimately be borne by energy consumers, both businesses and households. In particular, lower-income households would likely bear a disproportionate share of the costs related to an emissions cap, because those households generally spend a higher percentage of their income on energy-related goods and services than do higher-income households. Moreover, lower-income households already pay (on average) a larger share of their income toward the costs of their residential energy and for gasoline. These households are also less likely to have the financial resources to improve the energy efficiency of their dwelling units or to purchase energy efficient appliances or cars, which could help reduce high energy costs. For these and other reasons (including federal precedents), some have argued that allowance value should be used to alleviate the burden households, especially lower-income households, would likely face.", "Congress would face several questions when seeking to implement this objective. A primary consideration would be which households or persons should receive allowance value: should value be distributed evenly to all households, or should particular household groups receive a higher proportion? Moreover, should policymakers seek to account for different costs that households in different regions may experience?", "Policymakers have a variety of mechanisms they could use to distribute emission allowance value to provide assistance to households. In evaluating these options, there are a number of considerations that might be relevant to policymakers in choosing and implementing a distribution system. Among considerations are the ability of a system to reach large numbers of households, the existence of an administrative infrastructure and the costs of distributing funds, and the ease of tailoring benefits to different consumer incomes and regions of the country.

First, global temperature increases are linked in some manner to the measurable increases of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere. Second, human activities (e.g., fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and deforestation) have contributed to the increased concentration of GHG emissions in the earth's atmosphere.", "A variety of efforts that seek to reduce GHG emissions are currently underway or being developed on the international, national, and sub-national level (e.g., individual state actions or regional partnerships). One way in which GHG emissions may be reduced is through market-based approaches, such as a cap-and-trade or emission fees (\"carbon tax\") system. Recent legislative proposals have generally focused on using these market-based approaches to reduce GHG emissions, with cap-and-trade approaches generating far more congressional activity in terms of introduced bills and committee action than carbon taxes. As a result, this report uses both the general term \"GHG control program\" and the more specific \"cap-and-trade program\" to describe proposals to reduce GHG emissions.", "This report discusses the potential impacts that a cap-and-trade program would have on U.S. households and options for how Congress might mitigate those effects.

These include (1) minimizing the overall program costs imposed on society; (2) alleviating the costs borne by subgroups in society and economic sectors; and (3) providing funding to support other policy objectives, which may or may not relate to climate change mitigation.

In 2006, low-income households had a median individual energy burden of 9.5%, meaning that half of low-income households spent more than 9.5% of their income on residential energy and half spent less than 9.5%. This compared to 3.1% for non-low income households. The poorest households\u2014those that actually receive LIHEAP benefits\u2014had a median individual energy burden of 15.3%. (See Figure 2 .) These effects varied by region, with households in the Northeast of all income levels facing higher energy burdens than those in the Midwest, South, or West. ", "Consumer Spending on Utilities\u2014 Another measure of the cost burdens faced by low-income households comes from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES), which measures consumer out-of-pocket spending on a variety of goods and services, including utilities and gasoline. According to data from 2007, spending on utilities (as a percentage of all expenditures) declined from lower to higher income groups with few exceptions. For families with incomes between $5,000 and $10,000 per month, spending on utilities represented more than 10% of their total expenditures. (See Table 1 .) As income increased, the share of spending on utilities decreased incrementally for each income group above $20,000 to less than 5% for those with incomes at or above $150,000. Consumer Spending on Gasoline \u2014 The CES also surveys respondents about their spending on gasoline and motor oil. Families with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000 had the greatest share of expenditures on gasoline\u20145.75%. From there, the share of spending on gasoline by income group gradually declined, dipping below 5% for families with income above $80,000. The share of spending for lower-income families on gasoline\u2014those with income below $20,000\u2014was smaller than those with middle incomes, ranging between 4.74% for those with incomes below $5,000 to 5.47% for those with incomes between $15,000 and $20,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimates of Regressive Impacts from Cap-and-Trade Models", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, multiple economic analyses have provided estimates of impacts that a GHG emission control program (cap-and-trade or carbon tax) would impose on households of varying income levels.

The theory is that the value of a dollar is greater for a person who has fewer of them. Under economic theory, then, if income is redistributed from a higher-income person to a lower-income person, societal well being (or utility) is maximized. ", "Economic theory presumably does not fully explain why society adopts policies to redistribute benefits to lower-income groups, however.

The federal income tax system is progressive, with lower-income families paying lower marginal tax rates and, in some cases, paying no taxes at all or receiving refundable credits. The social welfare system in the United States, including such programs as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as Food Stamps), and Medicaid, subsidizes families below certain income levels. Even social insurance programs such as Social Security, Unemployment Insurance, and Medicare are redistributive to some degree. ", "While Congress could choose to allow households to realize the full consequences of increased energy prices rather than to mitigate those effects in some way, there is precedent for mitigating adverse distributional consequences that occur as the result of government policies. In trade policy, for example, those workers who lose their jobs for trade-related reasons may receive a type of unemployment benefit called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for Workers; there is also TAA for farmers. ", "In addition, the U.S. government has a history of helping low-income families with some of those very costs that are projected to increase as the result of a GHG emission control program\u2014in particular, the costs of residential energy. Since the energy spikes of the 1970s, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) have helped families weatherize (e.g., insulate or update heating and cooling systems) and pay home energy bills. And while no program exists to help consumers buy gasoline, legislative proposals have been made in previous Congresses to assist with the purchase of gasoline. Further, states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (a cap-and-trade program comprised of 10 northeast and mid-Atlantic states) are targeting some revenues to assist low-income families.

Economic studies have found that distributing lump sum rebates to all households would yield progressive results. However, these economic models assumed that the majority of allowance value (through auction proceeds) would go to households. If Congress were to distribute value for other uses, such as investments in technology or assistance to workers in affected industries, there would be fewer dollars with which to compensate households and the distributional effects (i.e., progressivity) would be less clear. If that were the case, providing more substantial rebates to lower-income households may be necessary to ensure progressivity.", "A question that may arise under this approach is whether Congress should consider different household sizes when allotting allowance value.

Policymakers could choose to target funds to \"low-income,\" \"moderate-income,\" and/or \"middle-income\" individuals or groups, depending on their priorities or perceptions of need. As discussed earlier, the argument for providing more targeted assistance, in terms of income levels, relates to the disproportionate impacts that lower income level households would be expected to bear under a cap-and-trade program. However, a targeted approach based on income would likely require further debate among policymakers. For example, how should the emission allowance value be divided among different income groups and which groups should be targeted?", "The terms \"low-income household\" or \"low-income family\" are sometimes used in the laws governing federal programs to describe those persons who qualify for a given benefit, but the meaning may vary depending on the program at issue. Some programs may use the federal poverty guidelines to determine benefits. For example, families qualify for SNAP if their incomes are at or below 130% of poverty. Other programs may use median income\u2014the middle of the income range in a given area such as a state, a county, or a metropolitan area.

Energy sources have varying levels of carbon content: coal has almost twice the carbon content (per unit of energy) of natural gas; the carbon content of electricity from nuclear, hydropower, and renewable energy sources is effectively zero. Thus, households in areas that rely on more carbon-intensive energy sources are generally expected to face disproportionate impacts from a cap-and-trade program (which establishes a price based on carbon content), compared to households that rely on less-carbon intensive energy. Many have argued that assistance to households should reflect these regional differences. Under this reasoning, instead of providing lump-sum household payments, policymakers may consider distributing allowance value in some proportion to the different cost increases that are projected across different regions.

The more carbon intensive the electricity, the more allowances (and expense) would be required to produce it. Thus, if policymakers are concerned about cost disparities across different regions of the country, policymakers would need to account for the different carbon intensities of electricity (i.e., fuel mix used to generate electricity). The carbon intensity of electricity varies based on the energy source used to generate the electricity\u2014for example, electricity produced with coal has a higher carbon content than that produced with natural gas, and so on. As the geographic area in question becomes more refined\u2014moving from a region to a state, or a state to a local distribution company (LDC) \u2014a carbon intensity of electricity determination becomes more difficult.", "The difficulty relates to data availability. Data exist to determine the carbon intensity of electricity at the level of the individual power plant. However, in many cases, an electricity LDC does not have a complete picture of the energy sources used to produce its power supply. Depending on the distribution utility's circumstances, it may have almost no relevant information. Neither state governments nor the federal government collect data needed to accurately and routinely tie electricity deliveries to the generating source. Because of the complexity of power market transactions, in which a block of power can change hands several times before final delivery and the mix of fuels is constantly changing over time, it is unlikely that such a data collection process could be designed and implemented. H.R. 2454 would require such a data collection process.", "Some groups have suggested using existing regional estimates in lieu of LDC-specific data. For example, EPA has developed output emission rates for subregions in the agency's Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID). However, these estimates are not the same as carbon content of electricity consumed , because electricity may be generated in one region and exported for consumption to another region. Therefore, if policymakers use data that measures carbon content of electricity generated to distribute allowance value, regions that are net exporters of high-carbon electricity may be overcompensated at the expense of regions that are net importers of high-carbon electricity. The customers in net importing regions would be the group that would bear the emission cap carbon price. ", "Moreover, distributing allowance value to LDCs based on regional data may overcompensate some LDCs at the expense of others. The regions that would likely be considered comprise multiple states in many cases. Within a particular region (or state), the LDCs' carbon intensities of electricity likely span a wide range.

In evaluating these options, there are a number of considerations that might be relevant to policymakers in choosing and implementing a distribution system. Among considerations are the ability of a system to reach large numbers of households, the existence of an administrative infrastructure and the costs of distributing funds, and the ease of tailoring benefits to different consumer incomes and regions of the country. For each of the potential delivery options, this section of the report discusses some of the considerations that could make the options more or less appealing. This is not an exhaustive discussion and is meant only to raise potential considerations. A table summarizing these options is available in the Appendix . The considerations discussed in this section are:", "A bility to R each Households \u2014A distribution system would have to reach millions of potential beneficiaries (this would be true even in a system targeted only to low-income households). For already-existing delivery mechanisms such as the income tax system, we have some knowledge about their ability to deliver funds. For untried mechanisms, such as universal rebates through an electronic transfer or check, their effectiveness may be more speculative. A dministrati on \u2014Implementing a delivery system would have administrative costs. Some proposed delivery systems may have an administrative infrastructure already in place, others may need to have an existing administrative system adapted to distribute funds, while still others may need to create a new system. The way in which funds are targeted would also have an effect on the administrative costs. In general, the more targeted benefits are, the higher the administrative costs of the system. For example, a program with complicated income eligibility rules and verification processes or a program that delivers multi-tiered benefits is likely to be more expensive to administer than one with simple eligibility rules and standard benefits for all recipients. Consumer F lexibility \u2014A system could deliver cash or in-kind benefits to consumers. For example, funds that are targeted for energy assistance such as LIHEAP and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) can only be used for specific purposes. However, if revenues were to be distributed as cash, consumers would decide how best to use the benefit. According to economic theory, beneficiaries may be better off with a cash transfer than with an in-kind benefit of the same amount because they are not constrained in the way they use the benefit. However, there is a tension in public policy between consumer flexibility and limiting flexibility to ensure that policy priorities are achieved. As discussed earlier, a flexible cash benefit may mean that consumers would not reduce energy consumption as much as they might otherwise, potentially reducing the effectiveness of a cap-and-trade program. Tailoring Benefits for Household Size and Income \u2014Allowance value may be distributed to all households or to those that meet certain income eligibility requirements. They may be the same for everyone or may vary based on household size. Some existing federal benefit systems tailor their benefits by income and number of family members, with benefits phased out at certain income levels. An example is the Earned Income Tax Credit. In the case of other delivery systems, a formula or eligibility determination process might need to be created to take account of factors such as income and household size. Accoun t ing for Regional Differences \u2014Congress may want to account for regional differences when distributing allowance value. Some existing programs such as LIHEAP and WAP take account of energy sources in determining how funds are distributed. In the case of other delivery systems, a formula may need to be created to incorporate energy price data. This approach may require new data collection. Although it would be possible to tailor rebates based on expected regional differences, doing so may decrease the transparency of particular mechanisms. As discussed above, applying a regional calculation to individual households would be imprecise and would likely (1) overcompensate regions at the expense of others and (2) create winners and losers within a particular region. Promoting E nergy E fficiency \u2014It may be desirable to use proceeds in a way that promotes energy efficiency. Some options, such as funding for weatherization, may increase energy efficiency, while lump sum payments may not necessarily encourage increased efficiency beyond any conservation that might take place due to increased prices. As a result, consumers might not reduce consumption to the same degree they would if there were no reimbursement to households. Policymakers could complement the rebate mechanism with an educational/outreach program. The program could offer suggestions of ways households could spend the rebates in terms of energy efficiency activities and explain the long-term (financial) benefits of improving a home's energy efficiency.", "On their own, individual options such as those described in this section may have limitations that do not allow them to reach all the households that Congress may wish to target.

Proposals have been made that would deliver funds to individuals or to households.

Creating one would likely require the involvement and coordination of more than one federal agency. Between them, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may be able to reach a large percentage of Americans. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has name, address, and Social Security number records for millions of Americans due to its role in distributing benefits to retirees and persons unable to work due to disability. In addition, SSA tracks the covered earnings of workers who pay Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes in order to fund Social Security and Medicare. The Internal Revenue Service has information about taxpayers and their dependents. The IRS would not have records for those people who do not file taxes, generally those whose income does not reach the threshold required to file. A source of information for picking up those individuals who may not be captured by either the Social Security system or the federal income tax system may be state public benefit programs. Individuals who do not have earned income, retirement income, or disability income may qualify for public benefits such as SNAP and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). State systems would, in most cases, have contact information for those individuals and their family members who qualify for benefits. Administrati on \u2014There is not currently a unified administrative infrastructure in place that would reach all Americans. The costs of a system would depend in part on the frequency with which funds would be delivered as well as whether payments would be tailored for income, family size, energy prices, or for other reasons. In addition, the manner of delivery\u2014paper versus electronic\u2014would make a difference; according to the Treasury Department, it costs the government $1.03 to send a paper check and 10.5 cents to deliver benefits electronically. The way in which benefits under recent economic stimulus bills were distributed may be instructive. When the federal government distributed rebate checks pursuant to the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-185 ), the administrative costs of extending rebates to around 119 million tax filers were approximately $215 million. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 111-5 ) provided funds so that each Social Security recipient (approximately 50 million individuals in 2008) and SSI recipient (approximately 7.5 million individuals) would receive a payment of $250. Congress appropriated $90 million to SSA for administering these payments. Consumer Flexibility \u2014Households would have flexibility in how they chose to use a direct rebate. Funds could be used for utility bills, gasoline expenses, or any other good or service. Tailoring Benefits for Household Size and Income \u2014Rebates could be increased to account for lower income levels or greater numbers of household or family members. As discussed above, however, this flexibility could affect administrative costs of the rebates by requiring the periodic collection of income and other financial data as well as the calculation of benefit levels.

According to CBO, about 80% of households would be eligible for a payroll tax rebate, with about 54% of those in the lowest income quintile qualifying. In the case of FICA taxes, employers and employees each pay half of the total tax withheld, so one consideration could be whether to calculate a reduction based on just the employee's contribution or both the employer's and employee's contributions. Income Tax Credit\u2014 A tax credit would reach those individuals who file income taxes. There is a portion of the population that does not file taxes at all, in general because they do not reach the income thresholds required to file. However, those individuals could be encouraged to file in order to receive a tax credit. In addition, a portion of those who file taxes do not owe federal income taxes. Some tax credits can only be used to offset income tax liability and do not extend beyond the amount of taxes that someone owes; a refundable tax credit would be necessary to reach those who do not owe taxes. Administrati on \u2014Using the tax system to deliver funds would not require creation of a new administrative infrastructure to reach households because existing tax collection systems could be used for this purpose.

Consumer Flexibility \u2014Households would have flexibility in how they chose to use funds delivered through the tax system. Funds could be used for utility bills, gasoline expenses, or any other good or service. Tailoring Benefits for Household Size and Income \u2014The IRS already gathers taxpayer information regarding number of dependents and income, so this information would not have to be collected separately in order to tailor benefits through the income tax system to household size and income. However, information regarding those who pay FICA taxes may not include information regarding total household size, nor does it necessarily represent total household income. Information about household members and income would have to be collected if funds were to be tailored under FICA reductions.

LDCs are the entities that deliver electricity or natural gas to consumers, local businesses, and industry within a geographic area; typically they receive the energy supply from generators (in the case of electricity) and producers (in the case of natural gas). Under this approach, the energy distributors would be required to pass along the value of the allowances for the benefit of energy consumers. This could occur in several ways, and Congress could stipulate certain provisions in the legislation. For example, policymakers could require the LDC to sell the allowance and use the proceeds to support energy efficiency efforts, which would ultimately benefit consumers. In addition, policymakers could authorize LDCs to use the proceeds to provide rebates for portions of consumers' energy bills. ", "This mechanism could be used to alleviate price burdens on all energy consumers or certain subgroups. ", "Considerations that could be relevant in relying on energy suppliers to compensate households for increased costs of energy include the following:", "Ability to Reach Households \u2014Those households that use natural gas, electricity, heating oil, and propane to heat their homes represent more than 96% of all occupied housing units in the country. Therefore, if a GHG emission control program directed natural gas and electricity LDCs to sell allowances for the benefit of their customers, and if states were given the responsibility for compensating heating oil and propane customers, then nearly all households in the United States could be reached. It is possible, though, that renters whose utilities are included in rent may not see a benefit delivered through LDCs and states. In addition, the household benefits would largely depend on how the LDCs chose to return the allowance value to customers. Policymakers may consider including detailed instructions to avoid inconsistent applications across the country that may otherwise occur. Administrati on \u2014Presumably LDCs would be able to pass on benefits to households through their billing systems without the need for additional administrative infrastructure. If a system were to target household customers based on their income or household size, administrative costs could increase. There may also be a need for an additional layer of administration, with state and/or federal governments overseeing a program in which LDCs are given discretion to help consumers. If states were to oversee a program to channel funds to heating oil and propane users, an application system may have to be established. This could occur through existing low-income energy assistance programs (described in the next section of this report). Consumer Flexibility \u2014The way in which households could use funds under a system administered by LDCs would depend on whether fund transfers took the form of cash rebates or credits toward energy bills. A direct cash rebate could be used for any purpose, while a credit would only help households with their home energy expenses. However, reducing utility bills could free up funds for other uses. Tailoring Benefits for Household Size and Income \u2014LDCs such as natural gas and electricity suppliers presumably do not have readily available information about the households they serve, such as number of people living in the household and household income. Although it would be possible to tailor benefits based on these factors, as discussed above, it would require additional administrative responsibility to gather the necessary information and to implement a tiered benefit system. Accounting for Regional Differences \u2014Proponents of this mechanism maintain that one of its strengths is its ability to account for regional differences, and thus distribute allowance value in a more equitable fashion (so they argue). For instance, Congress could distribute allowances to LDCs based on measures that vary by local energy provider: energy delivered, carbon-content of energy delivered, or some combination of both (see discussion of H.R. 2454 below). However, this potential ability to account for regional differences is not unique to this mechanism. Indeed, this approach may not have a particular advantage over other approaches in this regard. As discussed earlier, local electricity providers (i.e., LDCs) do not collect data regarding the carbon content of the electricity they deliver, a critical measurement in the debate over regional differences. Federal agencies (e.g., EPA and EIA) have prepared approximations of this data at the regional (or subregional) level, but this data could be used in other mechanisms to tailor allowance value distributions to regional differences. Promoting Energy Efficiency \u2014Depending on the way in which a program were to be implemented, it would be possible to improve energy efficiency. For example, benefits could be tied to reductions in energy use. Moreover, policymakers could stipulate (as is done in H.R. 2454 , discussed below) that certain percentages of the allowance value be used to support this objective.

However, LIHEAP does not reach all households defined as \"low income.\" First, states have some flexibility within the federal income eligibility guidelines, and they may set income eligibility as low as 110% of poverty. In addition, unlike some other means-tested programs such as SNAP or Medicaid, where meeting eligibility standards entitles one to benefits, LIHEAP has not reached everyone who is eligible due, in large part, to funding limitations. According to the most recent data available from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), less than 20% of federally eligible LIHEAP households received benefits in FY2006. However, it is possible that supplements to the program through a GHG emission control program would provide funding to serve a greater number of eligible households. Administrati on \u2014As an existing program, no administrative infrastructure would have to be developed to deliver funds through LIHEAP. The program allows grantee states, tribes, and territories to use up to 10% of their grants for administrative purposes. In FY2006, approximately 7.7% of total LIHEAP funds were used for administration. If funding for the program were increased or the number of beneficiaries served grew as part of a greenhouse gas reduction program, it is possible that the amount of funds necessary to administer LIHEAP benefits would also increase. Consumer Flexibility \u2014LIHEAP funds would address higher residential energy costs and would not directly address potential price increases in gasoline or other energy-intensive goods and services. It is possible, however, that a LIHEAP payment toward utility bills may free up funds for other expenses. Tailoring Benefits for Household Size and Income \u2014States have the discretion to adjust LIHEAP benefits based on household size and income. In fact, the LIHEAP statute requires states to target households with \"the lowest incomes and the highest energy costs or needs in relation to income.\" As a result, LIHEAP-recipient households are typically more needy than the population that is eligible to receive LIHEAP benefits. Accounting for Regional Differences \u2014LIHEAP has a statutory formula that allocates funds to states based on both the type of fuel used by low-income households as well as the price by fuel type. However, there is a lag in data used in the formula that might not make it immediately responsive to the effects of a GHG emission control program. The availability of recent data may be more important in distributing allowance auction proceeds, where price fluctuations could be an important part of determining need. Promoting Energy Efficiency \u2014Although the LIHEAP statute allows states to use 15% of funds for weatherization (up to 25% with a waiver from HHS), the majority of LIHEAP expenditures currently go toward direct subsidies for heating and cooling. In fact, some states choose not to weatherize at all.

In 2006, the most recent year for which data are available, 104,382 dwellings were weatherized. (Note, however, that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) provided $5 billion for WAP over three years compared to previous appropriations levels between $200 and $300 million.) A possible limitation in the ability of WAP to serve eligible households is its historic focus on weatherizing single-family homes rather than multifamily structures. States may choose to prioritize single-family homes, and program rules may also present barriers to weatherizing multifamily developments. These limitations may become more flexible, at least in regard to multifamily housing funded through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In response to ARRA, the Department of Energy and HUD entered into a memorandum of understanding so that WAP funds could be used in HUD-subsidized multifamily dwelling units with streamlined income verification of residents. HUD spends an estimated $4 billion per year (more than 10% of its budget) to pay energy costs in subsidized multifamily housing. Administration \u2014Grantees may use up to 10% of WAP funds for administrative expenses. In addition, a portion of WAP funds are allocated to training and technical assistance for the Community Action Agencies that administer WAP funds in local communities. In FY2008, $4.5 million, approximately 2% of the total WAP allocation, was used for this purpose. Consumer Flexibility \u2014WAP funds are used for the purpose of reducing the costs of home energy, so the program would not directly address potential price increases in gasoline or other energy-intensive goods and services. However, as with LIHEAP, reducing home energy bills may free up funds for other expenses. Tailoring Benefits for Household Size and Income \u2014States are required to target needy populations for WAP services. WAP gives priority to elderly residents, those with a disability, families with children, high residential energy users, and households with high energy burdens. In terms of adjusting benefits for household size and income, once program eligibility is determined, the amount of WAP funds used per household is based on the condition of the dwelling unit and the need for weatherization services. Accounting for Regional Differences \u2014WAP uses a formula that takes account of energy consumption and expenditures in determining how funds are allocated to the states, though with similar time lags encountered with the LIHEAP formula. Promoting Energy Efficiency \u2014Weatherization activities may prevent future energy usage, thereby reducing overall household energy costs. An analysis of statewide weatherization programs in 19 states found that after weatherization, the average household using natural gas for heating saw a 22.9% reduction in British thermal units (Btus) consumed for all home energy uses and a 32.3% reduction in Btus used for home heating."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Subsidies Through Other Income-Based Programs", "paragraphs": ["Congress may consider using other, non-energy-related programs to provide assistance to households.

Of the federal share of funds in FY2007 (nearly $2.8 billion), approximately $162 million went to issue benefits while $1.5 billion was used to certify eligibility. A majority of those who would qualify for EBT payments would already have been determined to be eligible for SNAP (approximately 62% of eligible households received benefits in 2007 ).

Separate benefit amounts would be computed for households of sizes one through four, with households of five or more receiving a benefit based on the average loss of purchasing power for all households of five or more persons. The loss in purchasing power for the next fiscal year would be estimated by the Energy Information Administration and published annually (by August 31) in the Federal Register and the benefit adjusted annually. The benefit would be paid monthly, with the monthly benefit being 1/12 th of the estimated annual loss in purchasing power.

The annual benefit amount is relatively small. For example, in 2012 a household of four would receive a little less than $400 per year from the program. This contrasts with SNAP, where the benefit for a family of four is expected to exceed $400 per month . However, the years in the budget window 2012-2019 would be very early in the implementation of the cap-and-trade system. In these years, most allowances would be given away rather than auctioned and the reduction requirements are relatively less stringent compared to other years: thus, the costs of the system are relatively low.

It shows that eligibility for the benefit ends relatively quickly above 150% of poverty\u2014reaching $0 at about 159% of poverty. The very rapid reduction in the benefit is, in part, because of its small size in the early years. A larger benefit would produce a more graduated phase-out.

It was not until 1993 when Congress amended the tax code to provide an EITC to childless tax filers.
