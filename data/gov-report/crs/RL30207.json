For the Science programs, DOE requested an increase of $116.9 million over FY1999, or about 4.3%. Most of this increase consists of two items: $84 million (65%) for continued construction of the Spallation NeutronSource (SNS) and $70 million for thescientific simulation initiative (SSI). The former is to be a major user facility providing a new source of neutronsfor a wide variety of research goals. The latter isdesigned to develop very high speed computational capability for use in simulating complex physical andbiomedical problems such as global climate change andgenome structure and to carry out such simulations.

Included in the House bill is $51million in contractor travel and other directed reductions. The House bill increases funding for High Energy Physicsand Nuclear Physics over the request. It didnot provide any funding for the SSI program arguing that it could not support two supercomputer developmentprograms within DOE given the existence of theAccelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) within the DOE weapons activities.

Themain focus of the program is the development of computational capabilities that can simulate weapons explosionsand perform other important computations. ForFY2000, DOE requested $542.5 million for this element, the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative(ASCI)/Stockpile Computing. That sum is 23.7% of theentire stockpile stewardship request, and is 12.2% above the FY1999 appropriation.", "The Senate appropriated $2.352 billion for Stockpile Stewardship, 2.9% above the request and 10.6% above the FY1999 level. The Senate repeated its concernthat DOE is not requesting sufficient funding for this program. It considers Stockpile Stewardship to be \"criticallyimportant\" particularly in view of the cessationof underground testing. The Senate directed DOE to take steps to improve management of the weapons activitiesin order to operate effectively in the restrictedbudget environment. The Senate also noted its concern with the rate of growth of the ASCI project, but it didprovide DOE with its full request for the project. Further, the Senate commended DOE on its achievements so far and recommended that the project speed up to reachthe 100 teraflop goal. A set of strategicactions now under study by DOE was noted by the Senate which approved an additional $35 million to the coreStockpile Stewardship program to begin thoseactions. The Senate also provided an additional $10 million for the Inertial Confinement Fusion program to assistthe National Ignition Facility (NIF) project toavoid delays in reaching ignition once completed.", "The House approved about $2 billion for Stockpile Stewardship for FY2000, 12.1% below the request and 5.4% below the FY1999 level.

Within that activity, the House bill provides the ASCI efforta $6.1 million increase over FY1999. TheCommittee argued that cost efficiencies could be achieved throughout the weapons complex that would permit theserecommendations. The Inertial ConfinementFusion (ICF) activity would receive an additional $10 million above the request and the NIF would be fully fundedfor FY2000. The House bill directs that $10million be made available to further high-average-power laser development. For the technology transfer andeducation activities, the House recommended $14million compared to a request of $52 million. The House argued that budget constraints make it necessary toconcentrate available funds on the weapons mission.", "In the report accompanying its recommendations, the House noted the security problems reported about the DOE weapons labs. In particular, it cited the report bythe President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board that argued for a restructuring of the DOE national securityprograms as the only way to deal with thoseproblems, which, the Board found, were very serious. The House has concluded that an independent agency willbe needed. It argued that even a separate agencywithin DOE would not suffice because no significant staffing changes would take place. In order to ensure thataction will take place, the House recommended aprovision that would delay $1 billion in obligations for DOE until after June 30, 2000, in order to give time forCongress \"to craft careful, bipartisan legislation\"addressing the problem. Provisions reorganization the weapons program into a semi-autonomous agency withinDOE were included in the FY2000 DefenseAuthorization Act ( S. 1059 , P.L. 106-65 ), signed into law October 5, 1999.", "The final appropriations bill provides $2.252 billion for Stockpile Stewardship for FY2000, $3.6 million above the request. The conferees directed DOE to reducefunding for weapons activities by $64.8 million. It is likely that some of that reduction will be applied to theStockpile Stewardship program, which makes upabout 50% of the weapons activities budget. Therefore, the actual amount available for the program will probablybe less than the $2.252 billion. The confereesprovided $316 million for the ASCI program, $25 million below the request. Also, the additional $10 millionappropriated by the House for high-average-powerlaser development remains in the final bill. The conference report contained language expressing strongdisappointment about news that the NIF cost estimate hasincreased, and the conferees ordered DOE to submit a certified cost estimate to the Appropriations Committees byJune 1, 2000. If that is not possible, theconferees directed DOE to submit a project termination cost estimate.", "Nonproliferation and National Security Programs. The Administration's FY2000 request for these programswas $747 million, about $70 million over FY1999. The House bill included $691 million funding, and the Senatebill $822 million. The bill as passedappropriated $745 million for nonproliferation and national security programs (which are included in the \"OtherDefense Activities\" listed in Table 6). ", "Much of the requested increase was aimed at helping Russia and other former Soviet states deal with the cutbacks of their nuclear weapons activities. Among theprograms are the Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI), to help unemployed nuclear weapons designers find civilian jobs,and the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention(IPP), to help develop new non-defense technologies in the Former Soviet Union. NCI's budget would have beendoubled to $30 million and IPP received $25million in the FY2000 request. The bill as passed included $7.5 million for NCI and $22.5 million for IPP.

The bill as passed appropriated $150 million.", "Environmental Management. DOE's Environmental Management Program (EM) is responsible for cleaning upenvironmental contamination and disposing of radioactive waste at DOE nuclear sites. The FY2000 appropriationfor the program totals $6.32 billion, including$189 million for the \"privatization\" of several DOE waste management projects, such as the solidification ofhigh-level radioactive waste at Hanford, Washington,and $250 million for the uranium enrichment decontamination and decommissioning fund. The total EMappropriation is about $35 million below theAdministration's request but $93 million above the FY1999 funding level.", "The FY2000 EM budget is based on the program's accelerated cleanup strategy, which attempts to maximize the number of sites that can be completely cleanedup by the end of FY2006. DOE managers contend that substantial long-term savings can be gained by focusing oncompleting work at those sites, allowing theearliest possible termination of infrastructure costs. Major sites scheduled for completion during that period areincluded in the \"Defense Facilities ClosureProjects\" account, for which about $1 billion was provided in FY2000 -- about the same level as in FY1999. Thelargest facilities under that account are theRocky Flats site in Colorado and the Fernald site in Ohio.", "Nearly half of EM's FY2000 privatization funding request would go for Phase 1 of the Hanford Tank Waste Remediation System, consisting of a pilotvitrification plant that would turn liquid high-level waste into radioactive glass logs for eventual disposal. Othermajor privatized projects include a facility totreat \"mixed\" radioactive and hazardous waste at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory,and waste treatment, storage, and disposalfacilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.", "The EM privatization effort is intended to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting a portion of project risks from the federalgovernment to contractors. Profits to contractors would depend on their success in meeting project schedules andholding down costs; potentially, profits could besubstantially higher or lower than under traditional DOE contracting arrangements. ", "In a typical non-privatized DOE project, a contractor would be hired to build and operate a facility with government funds. DOE would approve and pay all thecontractor's costs, and then award the contractor a profit based on performance. Under the privatization initiative,a contractor would be expected to raise almostall funding for necessary facilities and equipment for a project. The contractor would recover that investment andearn a profit by charging previously negotiatedfees to DOE for providing services under the contract, such as solidification of radioactive waste. The contractorcould earn higher profits by reducing costs, butthe contractor could lose money if project costs were higher than expected or the required services were notdelivered.", "For non-defense environmental management, the House recommended elimination of all funding -- $3.7 million -- for the DOE National Low-Level WasteProgram. The program provides technical assistance to states and interstate compacts in managing commerciallow-level waste. \"Over $80,000,000 has beenprovided for the low-level waste program over the past two decades, and State expertise is now mature enough thatFederal funding is no longer required,\"according to the House Committee report. The Conference Report specifies that $595,000 be provided to theprogram in FY2000 for maintaining federallow-level waste data bases.", "An additional $10 million was provided for cleanup activities at DOE's uranium enrichment plants at Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, which arecurrently leased to a private firm. Recent controversy has focused on environmental hazards posed by the plants,particularly contamination resulting from thepast enrichment of reprocessed uranium at Paducah.", "Civilian Nuclear Waste Disposal. DOE requested $409 million for the civilian nuclear waste program inFY2000, an increase of $51 million over the level provided for FY1999. Of that increase, $39 million would havecome from unspent funds appropriated inFY1996 for an interim waste storage program that has yet to receive congressional authorization. Because the $39million has already been appropriated, the useof that funding reduced the program's FY2000 net appropriation request to $370 million. The FY2000 Energy andWater Development bill provides $352.5million for the program but does not release the previously appropriated funding sought by DOE.", "The Civilian Nuclear Waste Program is focused almost entirely on studying a proposed permanent underground repository for highly radioactive waste at YuccaMountain, Nevada. DOE's budget justification contends that the $409 million proposal for FY2000 is the minimumrequired to keep the waste disposal programon its current schedule. The major program efforts planned for FY2000 are completion of the final EnvironmentalImpact Statement for the proposed YuccaMountain repository, preparation of a site recommendation report to be submitted to the President in FY2001, anda license application to be sent to NRC in 2002. If any of those \"critical near-term milestones\" are missed, DOE says it might not be able to open the repository in2010 as planned.", "Although DOE did not receive its full request for the waste program, the final amount was substantially more than the level approved by the House. Citing\"severe budget constraints,\" the House Appropriations Committee had voted to cut total appropriations for the wasteprogram to $281 million and directed DOEto \"review all cost components to see what savings can be achieved in fiscal year 2000.\" The final appropriationincludes $240.5 million from the Nuclear WasteFund, which consists of fees paid by nuclear utilities, and $112 million from the defense nuclear waste disposalaccount.", "The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than a statutory deadline of January 31, 1998, for DOE to begin taking waste from nuclearplant sites. Nuclear utilities and state utility regulators, upset over DOE's failure to meet the 1998 disposal deadline,have won two federal court decisionsupholding the Department's obligation to meet the deadline and to compensate utilities for any resulting damages. Utilities have also won several cases in theU.S. Court of Federal Claims, although specific damages have not yet been determined.", "For FY1999, Congress provided $4 million from general revenues to pay for research on treating high-level radioactive waste with advanced particle accelerators. Such treatment would be intended to transmute long-lived radioactive waste into shorter-lived isotopes. DOE didnot request further funding for the effort inFY2000, but the energy and water bill provides $9 million for the program under nuclear energy research anddevelopment.", "DOE requested the restoration of funding for the State of Nevada to monitor the Yucca Mountain Project in FY2000, totaling $12.3 million for the state and nearby units of local government. For FY1999, Congress rejected all but $250,000 of DOE's nearly $5 millionrequest for funds for Nevada, because of concernsthat the state was using the money to fight the waste program, while providing $5.5 million to local governments. The Senate voted to provide $10.1 million forNevada and affected local governments in FY2000, but the House recommended no state and local funding. Theconference agreement provides $500,000 forDOE reimbursement of state oversight costs, and $5.4 million for affected local governments.", "Power Marketing Administrations. DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) developed out ofthe construction of dams and multi-purpose water projects during the 1930s that are operated by the Bureau ofReclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The original intention behind these projects was conservation and management of water resources, includingirrigation, flood control, recreation and otherobjectives. However, many of these facilities generated electricity for project needs. The PMAs were establishedto market the excess power; they are theBonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern (SEPA), Southwestern (SWPA), and Western Area PowerAdministration (WAPA).", "The power is sold at wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies \"at the lowest possible rates ... consistent with sound business practice,\" and priority onPMA power is extended to \"preference customers,\" which include municipal utilities, co-ops and other \"public\"bodies. The PMAs do not own the generatingfacilities, but they generally do own transmission facilities, except for Southeastern. The PMAs are responsible forcovering their expenses and repaying debt andthe federal investment in the generating facilities.", "The 104th Congress debated sale of the PMAs and did, in 1995, authorize divestiture of one PMA, the Alaska Power Administration. Sale of the remaining PMAshas not since been an issue, pending decisions yet to be made about the treatment of public power in the broadercontext of electric utility restructuring.", "BPA receives no annual appropriation. The Administration's request for the PMAs for FY2000 was $200 million, a reduction of 15.8% from the FY1999appropriation. The savings stemmed from the Administration's proposal that, beginning in FY2000, customers of SEPA, WAPA, and SWPA would beresponsible for making their own power purchases and transmission arrangements from any suppliers other thanthe PMA to satisfy their needs. Under thePurchase Power and Wheeling Program (PPW), the PMAs have purchased electricity and transmission capability,which is repaid by PMA customers, tosupplement federal generation. The premise behind the proposed elimination of the PPW program was thatderegulation should make it less expensive and lesscomplicated for PMA customers to make these arrangements. Another possible reason is that the moneyappropriated to the PMAs under PPW is repaid to theTreasury rather than to DOE. This means that the PPW appropriation is fully scored against the caps ondiscretionary domestic spending with which DOE mustcomply. Bipartisan groups in both the House and Senate found this feature of the budget request controversial. ", "The Senate passed the bill with the PPW program maintained and more than $80 million restored. In its report, the Senate Appropriations Committee said it\"disagrees\" with the Department's proposal. However, the House supported the Administration proposal andrequested levels.
