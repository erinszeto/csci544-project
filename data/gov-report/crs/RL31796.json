In the ESA context, the debate has had at least two parts. First, to what extent should, and to what extent does, the ESA restrict the use of privately owned land? Second, given that restrictions on land uses and other property-related activities are imposed under the ESA, to what extent does the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment demand compensation of the property owner? This second question\u2014the \"takings\" implications of the ESA\u2014is our subject here. Much has been written about it elsewhere as well. ", "The court decisions described in this report illustrate the wide variety of private property impacts that may occur under the ESA\u2014going well beyond the land-use restrictions noted above. On the other hand, the report is not a reliable indicator of the aggregate private property impacts of the ESA program. Almost certainly, many landowners who are restricted in some way under the act do not bother to sue. Of the filed suits, CRS has no systematic way of discovering those that were resolved without published decision (as by settlement or voluntary dismissal). And finally, court decisions under the Takings Clause do not exhaust the universe of decisions stemming from the ESA's private property impacts\u2014other legal theories may be invoked also.", "Sections I and II of the report give background: respectively, the ESA features pertinent to the act's impacts on private property and ESA-relevant principles of Fifth Amendment takings law. Sections III through VII then offer summaries of ESA takings decisions grouped by type of property impact involved. The decisions herein comprise all those of which CRS is aware, reported and unreported (though early decisions in a case are omitted if no longer important). Of the 18 decisions reviewed, only one, Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District v. United States , found a taking, and as discussed that decision has been undermined by a later decision of the same judge that appears to have survived appeal. However, two other cases have yet to be finally resolved and thus may or may not ultimately find a taking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "I.

The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS, popularly called NOAA Fisheries), administers the ESA for marine species.", "Important here, listing is to be done \"solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available\" to the pertinent Secretary, without reference to economic costs or private property impacts. In sharp contrast, such costs and impacts may be considered in devising agency responses to the determination of endangered or threatened status. For example, at the time of a listing, the Secretary is required, when \"prudent and determinable,\" to designate the \"critical habitat\" of the species\u2014areas essential to its conservation. A critical habitat designation is to be based both on scientific data and \"economic impact and any other relevant impact,\" presumably allowing impacts on private property to be weighed. This distinction between listing and subsequent agency responses such as critical habitat designation was made by Congress quite deliberately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 9 Prohibitions; Section 10 Permits", "paragraphs": ["Listing and critical habitat designation trigger the ESA provisions that may interfere with private property use. Chief among these is Section 9, prohibiting certain acts in connection with endangered animals and plants. Section 9's prohibitions apply to both private and public land, and apply regardless of whether critical habitat has been designated. For endangered animals, prohibited acts include (a) the \"taking\" of an animal, (b) possessing, selling or transporting an animal obtained by an unlawful \"take,\" (c) transporting an animal interstate in the course of commercial activity, and (d) selling an animal interstate, or importing/exporting same. For endangered plants, the list is narrower\u2014we do not describe it here since there appear to be no Fifth Amendment takings decisions involving listed plants.", "The term \"take\" is a key ESA concept, not to be confused with Fifth Amendment takings. It is expansively defined by the statute to include almost any act adversely affecting a species member\u2014including \"to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, ... capture, or collect\" a listed animal. Central to the ESA's impact on private land owners, the FWS defines \"harm\" to include indirect harm to listed species members through certain significant habitat modifications. This agency definition has been upheld by the Supreme Court as a reasonable interpretation of the statute.", "By general rule, the FWS has extended almost all of the endangered species prohibitions just discussed to threatened animals and plants. \"Special rules,\" withdrawing particular threatened species from aspects of the general regime, have been promulgated for those species with atypical management needs. The NMFS, on the other hand, adopts Section 9's endangered species prohibitions for threatened species only on a case-by-case basis. \"Experimental populations\" of listed species generally are treated as threatened species.", "To minimize its constraints on economic growth, the ESA in Section 10 allows a much-used exemption from section 9's taking prohibitions. The exemption authorizes the appropriate Secretary to permit any taking incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activity \u2014allowing some projects to proceed even if they harm individuals of a listed species. Such \"incidental taking permits\" (ITPs) may be issued to non-federal entities after the landowner submits a habitat conservation plan (HCP) including proposed mitigation measures and the considered but rejected alternatives to the proposed action. The purpose of the HCP is to ensure that the proposed action does not appreciably reduce the survival and recovery prospects of the species.", "In an enforcement action for violating the ESA, the statute allows an affirmative defense for offenses committed in the good faith belief that the defendant was acting to protect persons from bodily harm. The ESA makes no mention, however, of a similar defense for acts to protect property. The absence of a property-protection defense in the ESA itself has been largely offset\u2014as to threatened species and experimental populations, but not endangered species\u2014by administrative regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 7 and Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Another ESA provision with obvious property rights implications is Section 7. This section comes into play only when a project has a federal nexus\u2014as when a non-federal project requires a federal permit or is being federally funded, or the federal agency itself is carrying out the project. Section 7's mandate is that each federal agency consult with the FWS or NMFS, depending on the listed species involved, to ensure that its actions are \"not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of\" designated critical habitat. (Note the focus on the species , in contrast with section 9's focus on individual members of the species.)", "Once consulted, the FWS or NMFS must, if listed species might be affected, prepare a biological opinion to determine the actual impact of the proposed action. If \"jeopardy\" of species or \"destruction or adverse modification\" of critical habitat (see preceding quote) is found, the FWS or NMFS must suggest \"reasonable and prudent alternatives\" to the proposed activity that would not violate the section 7 mandate. If the agency agrees to these or other reasonable and prudent alternatives consistent with the section 7 mandate and approved by the FWS or NMFS\u2014and if, further, any incidental takes satisfy that mandate, and other conditions are met\u2014then the FWS or NMFS issues an incidental take statement and the activity may go forward consistent with its terms. The incidental take analysis under section 7 is the same as for section 10 ITPs, and compliance with the mitigating measures in the biological opinion confers the same exemption from section 9 prohibitions as an ITP does on non-federal entities.", "A federal action may be exempted from the section 7 mandate, despite the possibility of extinction, by an Endangered Species Committee of high-ranking federal officials (popularly called the God Squad). The Committee must find, among other things, that there are no reasonable and prudent alternatives to the agency action, and that the action's benefits clearly outweigh the benefits of alternatives that would conserve the species or its critical habitat. The Endangered Species Committee exemption process is generally considered burdensome and is rarely used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Reforms, Etc.", "paragraphs": ["Several administrative reforms were adopted in the Clinton Administration, under claimed authority in the ESA, to enhance the program's flexibility in dealing with property owners. Joint FWS and NMFS policies streamlined permit procedures for small landowners, and other initiatives encouraged landowners to increase protection for listed species on their land. Under \"safe harbor agreements,\" landowners who increase species habitat can return to baseline conditions without penalty. And \"no surprises agreements\" assure a landowner that if he/she implements an HCP, there will be no further costs or land use restrictions to benefit species covered by the HCP (with minor exceptions).", "Federal managers also attempted, where consistent with the facts, to tilt toward threatened rather than endangered designations, to allow use of the more flexible ESA provisions governing threatened species. Use of threatened status has allowed the FWS, through \"special rules,\" to authorize takes of members of specified species causing depredations of private property (livestock, domestic animals, crops). Usually, such takes of problem animals must be carried out by government officials, rather than the aggrieved property owner. FWS regulations governing private property depredations by members of experimental populations more often allow takes by both government agents and private landowners.", "Despite these impact-softening mechanisms in the ESA and in administrative reforms, the act at times may frustrate the economic desires of owners of land or other property. This fact has long been a rallying cry for the ESA's detractors, who argue that restrictions under the act routinely \"take\" property in the constitutional sense. This brings us to Section II."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "II. ESA-Relevant Principles of Takings Law", "paragraphs": ["The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ends with 12 deceptively simple words: \"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" Long a constitutional sleeper, this \"Takings Clause\" has been thrust into the limelight in recent decades by increased government land use controls (such as under the ESA) combined with a more conservative judiciary interested in greater protections for property owners. The Clause seeks to strike a balance between these two interests\u2014more broadly, between society's needs, as effected by government, and the burdens that satisfying those needs may impose on individual property owners.", "Here we scan the law developed by the courts for deciding which government actions work a Fifth Amendment taking of private property, requiring the owner to be compensated. We include only the principles most relevant to the ESA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preliminary Thresholds", "paragraphs": ["Before a court can even get to a plaintiff's taking claim, some initial hurdles, both procedural and substantive, must be surmounted. Procedurally, a taking claim against the United States (the likely defendant if suing because of the ESA) must be filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, if plaintiff seeks more than $10,000. It must also, under that court's statute of limitations, be filed within six years of the date of the alleged taking.", "Most daunting of all the procedural hurdles, the taking claim must be ripe\u2014that is, the dispute must have reached a sufficient maturity to be suitable for judicial resolution. In cases against the United States, this means chiefly that the property owner must have obtained a \"final decision\" from the government agency in question as to the nature and extent of the restrictions on the property. \"Final decision\" is a much-litigated term of art. To get a final decision, it may be necessary for the property owner, after his/her initial development proposal is rejected, to reapply with scaled-down or reconfigured proposals. In the ESA context, the final decision requirement has been held to mean that the taking claim is not ripe until an ITP has been applied for and, usually, denied. Denial of the ITP is not necessary for ripeness where further negotiations with the federal agency are not needed to indicate what degree of development the government will allow on the parcel, where further negotiations would otherwise be pointless (\"futility exception\"), or where plaintiff is claiming that an agency's delay in granting or denying the ITP is \"extraordinary.\" But as yet, no court has been willing to excuse a plaintiff's failure to even apply for an ITP.", "An agency's determination simply that the property owner's proposal requires an ITP application cannot itself be a taking. The reason is clear: that determination leaves open the possibility that the permit, if applied for, will be granted.", "Most important of the substantive threshold hurdles is the Takings Clause demand that the thing alleged to have been taken is \"property\" as used in the Clause. Almost all common interests in land\u2014fee simple absolutes, leases, easements, etc.\u2014are indisputably property, as are water rights, making this threshold an easily surmounted one in ESA takings cases. However, takings law is cognizant of only direct impacts on the property. For example, the denial of an ITP for a residential subdivision may, in proper circumstances, take the tract for which the permit is sought. However, a taking claim will not be entertained as to the nearby commercially zoned parcel whose value is greatly reduced because no residential subdivision, hence no potential customers, will come to the ITP-denied lot."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Takings Principles", "paragraphs": ["There are three types of takings claims, each evaluated under a different Supreme Court-created test. Each type might arise in the ESA context.", "Regulatory takings . A regulatory taking claim asserts that a government action has taken property merely by restricting its use. The idea of the regulatory taking concept is that even in the absence of an obvious government taking of property\u2014as by appropriation of title or physical occupation\u2014use restrictions may be sufficiently severe to amount to the same thing. Regulatory takings claims break down into two subcategories, depending on whether the property owner alleges the regulation to have caused a total elimination of the land's use or value, called a total taking claim, or a less-than-total elimination, called a partial regulatory taking claim.", "The first subcategory, total elimination of use or value, is held to be a per se taking, with at least one big exception. If the government restriction was implicit in \"background principles\" of property or nuisance law existing when the property was acquired, there is no taking. The rationale for this exception is that the government has not taken away any right the property owner ever had. There is limited case-law support for the argument that the states' historic ownership of wildlife and responsibility for wildlife protection as a trust obligation to the public constitute a background principle that forecloses takings claim based on such protections. However, this defense has yet to be addressed in an ESA-based takings decision.", "Claims in the second subcategory, less-than-total losses, are far more common, and are evaluated quite differently. Instead of a per se test, courts use a fact-intensive, case-by-case approach applying the \" Penn Central balancing test.\" Under this approach, the government action is assessed for its economic impact, the degree of interference with investment-backed expectations, and its \"character.\" These vague factors have been explicated only minimally by the Supreme Court, leading many commentators to complain that the test is muddled and easily manipulated. Still, it is at least clear that the impact on the property owner generally must be severe, as long as the other Penn Central factors are not so compelling on the facts of the case as to be dispositive. The result is that the large majority of regulatory takings claims tested under Penn Central are rejected. This government-friendly pattern has been replicated in the ESA-takings cases raising Penn Central claims, even though takings courts have not accorded the species-preservation goal of the ESA any special status (at least explicitly) in the takings calculus.", "With either total or partial regulatory takings claims, the court must define the \"parcel as a whole\" (aka \"relevant parcel\") as to which the impact of the government action will be measured. The relevant parcel notion is needed because takings law looks at the economic impact and interference with expectations factors in a relative, rather than absolute, sense. As to economic impact, for example, what counts in the takings analysis is not that the plaintiff's land lost X dollars in value due to a government restriction, but rather that the loss constituted a high percentage of the pre-restriction value of the parcel as a whole.", "The relevant parcel generally is defined to include the entire contiguous lot in the same ownership, with noncontiguous lots held by the same owner thrown in if part of an integrated development. Importantly, the relevant parcel cannot be limited to the portion of the property subject to the challenged use restriction, at least not solely on that basis. Thus, a regulation that severely reduces use or value on only a portion of a tract is unlikely to be a taking. For this reason, it is almost certain that the relevant parcel factor has held down the number of ESA-based takings claims; many property owners restricted on a portion of their land still have economic use of the remainder. Beyond the regulated/nonregulated rule, however, the Supreme Court has left unresolved many issues that arise in defining the relevant parcel.", "Also for both total and partial takings claims, the Supreme Court has rejected the \"notice rule,\" under which lower courts once held that restrictions imposed under laws existing when the property was acquired absolutely cannot be a taking. The pre-acquisition existence of the law in question carries some weight in the takings analysis, the Supreme Court says, but does not bar the taking claim outright. This easing of the notice rule is significant for the ESA, which was enacted so long ago (1973) that most landowners today, having bought since its enactment, might be barred from claiming takings under the former, absolute rule.", "Finally, regulatory takings claims are treated differently depending on whether the restriction giving rise to the alleged taking was initially deemed to be permanent (of indefinite duration) or temporary . If an initially permanent government restriction is ultimately withdrawn or judicially invalidated, the analysis of whether it worked a taking while on the books is unaffected. The termination of the restriction nominally changes the permanent taking claim to a temporary one, but its only real effect is to limit the amount of compensation. A few ESA cases present this scenario: land use restrictions were lifted once listed birds were found no longer present in an area. By contrast, the very same land use restriction may not cause a taking if initially designated as temporary (such as a development moratorium), because of the likelihood that the restriction will be lifted after a defined period.", "Physical takings . A physical taking claim asserts that the government has taken property by causing, or authorizing, a physical invasion. Such claims come in two types: permanent physical occupations and temporary physical invasions . Permanent physical occupations are almost invariably held to be takings, because they infringe upon one of the most essential attributes of property ownership: the right to exclude others. Thus in assessing physical occupation claims the courts will not inquire into the extent of the occupation, the magnitude of the economic impact, or the importance of the underlying public purpose\u2014key ingredients of a regulatory takings analysis. Indeed, even the parcel as a whole rule does not apply, so that an occupation of only a minuscule portion of a tract is a taking. Not surprisingly, takings plaintiffs always try to bring a physical occupation claim, among others, if the facts permit.", "Temporary physical invasions, the lesser degree of interference, are regarded quite differently. They are tested under the Penn Central balancing test and generally are held nontakings.", "Physical takings claims are common in ESA cases\u2014the property owner pointing to a required physical diversion of water to supply a fish ladder for a listed species, listed animals whose physical presence on his/her land must be tolerated, the consumption of livestock by listed predators because the livestock owner was barred by the ESA from taking stronger measures against the marauding animals, or the temporary presence on the owner's property of federal investigators. As the decisions described herein show, few of these claims have been successful.", "Exaction taking s . The exaction taking claim asserts a taking on the basis of an exaction demanded by a land regulatory agency as a condition of approving a development proposal. In order not to be a taking, the exaction condition must meet two criteria. First, there must be an \"essential nexus\" between the condition and an underlying purpose of the permit or other approval to which the condition is attached. Second, the burden imposed on the property owner by the exaction must be no greater than \"roughly proportional\" to the impact of the proposed development on the community. Moreover, the burden of proving rough proportionality is on the government. This two-prong test places greater burden on the government defendant than the test for regulatory takings and is referred to as \"heightened scrutiny.\"", "The Supreme Court has clarified that not any condition attached to a development permit can ground an exaction taking claim. Rather, the Court particularly has in mind conditions requiring that the permit applicant dedicate land to a specific purpose\u2014as by recorded easement. Lower courts have split on whether an exaction taking claim can be based, in addition, on a monetary exaction\u2014when government requires a payment or expenditure of effort as a condition for development approval\u2014and the issue is now before the Supreme Court.", "At least potentially, the conditions that landowners opt for in their submitted HCPs could be subject to exaction taking challenge. Such conditions have at times included dedications of acreage on the ITP applicant's land, or commitment by the applicant to purchase mitigation credits. If the ITP applicant realistically had no choice but to adopt one of these options to meet the statutory criteria for ITP issuance, and the condition lacks an essential nexus or rough proportionality, an exaction taking claim becomes possible. We have no information on how often this happens in practice, but can note that even after three decades of ESA implementation, there appear to be no court decisions adjudicating exaction takings challenges to HCP conditions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "III. Restrictions on Uses of Land / Mitigation Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Mitigation condition on development approval: Schooner Harbor Ventures, Inc. v. United States , 569 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ; on remand , 92 Fed. Cl. 373 (2010), affirmed without opinion , 418 Fed. Appx. 920 (Fed. Cir. 2011)", "In 2000, plaintiff developer bought 82 acres adjacent to the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge for $964,000. Long before, in 1977, the land had been designated as critical habitat for the crane, a listed endangered species. Soon after its purchase, plaintiff sold 8 of those 82 acres for $430,000. When the Navy expressed interest in buying the remainder, for construction of Navy housing, the FWS issued an ESA Biological Opinion concluding that the project could go forward only if the loss of Sandhill Crane critical habitat in the remainder parcel was mitigated by the preservation off-site of 77 acres of equivalent habitat value. Thus when, in 2002, plaintiff contracted with the Navy for sale of the remainder, for $1.9 million, the Navy imposed a condition: that plaintiff purchase and transfer 77 acres to the FWS, for inclusion in the Refuge. This the plaintiff did, at a cost of $312,000. Plaintiff claims this mitigation condition was a taking.", "Held (Federal Circuit, 2009) , the trial court mischaracterized the property interest. The trial court (Court of Federal Claims) viewed the property interest asserted by the plaintiff as taken to be its interest in selling the land to the Navy without conditions. Holding that this was not a property interest under the Takings Clause, the trial court granted summary judgment for the United States. But a closer reading of the pleadings shows that the actual property interest alleged to have been taken was plaintiff's right to develop the remainder parcel. The right to develop land is clearly cognizable under the Takings Clause, and the plaintiff has properly pled a taking thereof. Therefore, the trial court on remand must do a Penn Central analysis of the taking claim with regard to the right to develop. In doing so, the trial court must bear in mind that plaintiff's actual or constructive knowledge of the pre-purchase designation of critical habitat (in 1977) is relevant, though not dispositive, on the taking question. Finally, there is a threshold ripeness issue as to whether the FWS's evaluation of the remainder parcel resulted in a sufficiently final conclusion that plaintiff could not develop the land.", "Held (on remand to trial court ), claim not ripe. The trial court found the taking claim to lack final-decision ripeness, since plaintiff had not applied for an ESA incidental take permit. Nor, it held, did the futility exception to proving ripeness apply. Because the plaintiff no longer owned the property, the absence of ripeness could not be cured, so the case was dismissed with prejudice.", "Comment: Even had plaintiff's claim been ripe, it is difficult to see how the trial court, on remand, could have found a Penn Central regulatory taking. First, plaintiff netted roughly $1.6 million on its sale to the Navy ($1.9 million minus $312,000 for mitigation), a profit of about 80% in two years. That the plaintiff would have profitted even more in the absence of the ESA mitigation requirement is not a ground for a taking. Second, the eight acres plaintiff sold prior to its sale to the Navy is likely to be considered by a court as part of the parcel as a whole for purposes of the takings analysis. Adding together the $430,000 received for the eight acres and the roughly $1.6 million net on the sale to the Navy, plaintiff more than doubled its investment in two years. And third, the Court of Federal Claims and Federal Circuit have on several recent occasions found no taking based on restrictions imposed under environmental regimes predating plaintiff's acquisition of the land, as was the case here. See, e.g., Appolo Fuels, Inc. v. United States , 381 F.3d 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2004). ", "The third reason above\u2014courts finding no taking under pre-acquisition regimes\u2014is also of interest in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in 2001 that the pre-acquisition existence of the regulatory regime at issue does not categorically bar a court from finding a taking. See Palazzolo v. Rhode Island , 533 U.S. 606 (2001). That holding left open whether the pre-existing regime still plays some less-than-dispositive role in the takings analysis. Thus far, as noted above, lower courts have continued after Palazzolo to give the pre-acquisition law considerable weight against the taking claim.", "Mitigation condition on development approval: Mead v. City of Cotati , 389 Fed. Appx. 637 (9 th Cir. 2010 ), cert. denied , 131 S. Ct. 2900 (2011)", "Plaintiff, owner of 1.6 acres of vacant land in the city, applied for approval to build four duplexes on 0.9 acres. The city approved, subject to compliance with the city's affordable housing plan and, pertinent here, mitigation of the proposed development's impact on the California Tiger Salamander, an endangered species. Plaintiff's consultant concluded that under interim mitigation guidelines developed by the FWS and the state under the ESA, plaintiff would be required to devote one acre of land to habitat conservation for each acre of a nearby salamander breeding site that was adversely affected by the development. Plaintiff claims the imposition of the two conditions effects a taking. (Facts taken from district court decision: 2008 WL 4963048 (N.D. Cal.).)", "Held, mitigation claim not ripe . The landowner's taking claim based on the required mitigation of his development's impact on the salamander is unripe. The claim fails to satisfy the ripeness requirement that a final decision be obtained from the government body as to the permitted uses of the property, since the landowner did not avail himself of the opportunity to submit to FWS a survey showing the presence or absence of salamanders on his land. Nor has he argued that the cost of performing a proper survey would constitute a taking. For this reason, he has not received a final FWS determination as to whether the salamander mitigation requirements apply to his land.", "(As to the affordable housing requirement, the court assumes without deciding that the claim is ripe and proceeds to the taking question. Because the landowner insists this is an exaction taking claim and not a Penn Central claim, he has not alleged facts sufficient to win a Penn Central claim. Therefore, his claim must be dismissed.)", "Restrictions on timber harvesting for personal use: Morris v. United States , 392 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2004)", "The plaintiffs own a half-acre lot, on which they seek to cut down old-growth redwood trees for lumber to build on another lot they own. They allege that owing to state and county land-use restrictions, harvesting timber is the lot's only economic use. In 2001, the NMFS told plaintiffs the harvest would violate the ESA by harming listed salmon in the river bordering the lot. The NMFS later said they could apply for an ITP, requiring them to prepare a HCP. However, plaintiffs' research led them to believe that the cost of applying for an ITP and preparing a HCP would be greater than the modest value of their trees and property. Hence, they did neither and instead filed a taking claim.", "Held, claim is not ripe. Plaintiffs challenge the cost of the administrative process, rather than any use restrictions that may result from it. But there has been no final agency decision that has sufficiently fixed the cost of the application, and the agency has discretion to assist plaintiffs with their application (indeed, a NMFS handbook instructs field offices to assist ITP applicants). Because the court has no way to predict what influence the wielding of that discretion will have on plaintiffs' costs, this case cannot be ripe. Therefore, the court will not reach plaintiffs' \"novel theory\" that a taking can result from the cost of complying with a valid regulatory process, where the government has never actually restricted the use of the property.", "Comment: This decision is but one manifestation of the longstanding judicial insistence that to ripen a taking claim based on a federal permit requirement, the landowner must at least begin the permit application and negotiation process. Various takings-law ripeness doctrines may indeed excuse the plaintiff's failure to pursue the process all the way to a formal permit denial\u2014the general minimum prerequisite for a ripe taking claim\u2014but to demonstrate their applicability the process must at least be engaged.", "Restrictions on commercial timber harvesting: Seiber v. United States , 364 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir . 2004)", "Plaintiffs owned a 200-acre tract, almost all timberlands. In 1994, Oregon designated 40 acres of the tract as spotted owl nesting habitat. By state law, this designation barred timber harvesting on the 40 acres, unless plaintiffs obtained an ITP under the federal ESA (the United States had designated the spotted owl a threatened species). The FWS found plaintiffs' ITP application inadequate, but said it was willing to work with them. The plaintiffs rejected this offer, and in 2000 the application was denied. The denial letter indicated, however, that several approvable alternatives (including selective harvesting) were available to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs simply applied for reconsideration of the denial, which was denied. In 2001, Oregon informed the plaintiffs that it no longer opposed timbering because the owls had moved away, and in 2002, the FWS found that an ITP was no longer needed for the same reason. The plaintiffs seek compensation for a temporary taking, from 2000 to 2002.", "Held, claim is ripe, but no taking. For purposes of this decision, the court assumes that the federal ESA barred logging during the period of the alleged taking, without which there can be no federal taking. The taking claim was ripe, even though the FWS identified approvable alternatives that the plaintiffs declined to pursue. The FWS did not say it lacked enough information to grant or deny the permit; rather, it formally denied the permit and did not allow further reconsideration. On the merits, there was no physical taking by the presence of the owls. Nor was there a regulatory taking: the government action did not deprive the relevant parcel (whether defined as the 200-acre parcel, or solely the trees on the 200-acre parcel) of all economic value, and indeed, plaintiffs made no showing of any economic injury caused by the temporary taking. Further, there was no regulatory taking by the alternative test: failure to substantially advance a legitimate government interest.", "Comment: This case puts in high relief the ubiquitous takings-law issue of how to define the \"relevant parcel\"\u2014that is, the precise property interest that the court will look at in assessing the impact of the government's action on the plaintiff. It does so in two ways. First, it requires that the 40 acres be evaluated together with the remaining 160 acres on the parcel. This was noncontroversial\u2014squarely in line with precedent. Second, the court raised, but did not resolve, the issue whether the timber on the 200 acres could be regarded separately, prior to harvesting, from the land on which it grew.", "Restrictions on commercial timber harvesting: Boise Cascade Corp. v. United States , 296 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002 )", "The FWS determined that allowing Boise Cascade to log its 65-acre old-growth tract in Oregon might harm spotted owls that would otherwise nest there. Subsequently, in October, 1998, a district court permanently enjoined the logging until Boise obtained an ITP. While Boise's ITP application was pending, however, an owl living on the tract was found dead and surveys found no other owls in the area, so the FWS said an ITP was no longer required. Accordingly, the district court, in August, 1999, lifted the injunction. Boise seeks compensation for the temporary taking of its merchantable timber, which it was prevented from logging during the court injunction.", "Held, no taking. The FWS never denied Boise's ITP; the company was enjoined only from logging without a permit . The mere imposition of a permit requirement by a regulatory agency does not, by itself, effect a regulatory taking. Nor is there a per se physical taking by the owls; the government is only regulating the use of the tract due to the incidental location of the owls there. The state has no control over where the owls choose to nest. Finally, no physical taking was caused by the requirement that Boise allow government officials to enter its land to conduct owl surveys. The visits were brief, nonexclusive, and approved by the district court.", "Comment: The court's refusal to regard the presence of the spotted owls on the plaintiff's land as a physical taking is in accord with almost every prior decision addressing such challenges to wildlife protections. Rather, the logging restriction was deemed to be at most a regulatory taking. As noted, takings plaintiffs prefer to cast their claims as physical, rather than regulatory, takings, since the former are tested under a more plaintiff-friendly standard.", "Restrictions on land clearing and construction of home for personal use: Taylor v. United States , No. 99-131 L (Fed. Cl. June 20, 2001) (unpublished)", "The plaintiff planned to build a house on his residential-zoned lot. After he bought the lot, a pair of nesting bald eagles moved onto the adjacent parcel, within 90 feet of the planned house. The FWS informed the plaintiff that land clearing and construction on his property likely would render the area unusable by the eagles, and that a resulting abandonment of the nest would be a \"take\" pursuant to the ESA. The agency further told him that he could apply for an ITP, which would allow the house construction to proceed. However, when the plaintiff applied, the FWS insisted he agree to all the required mitigation before it would process the application. Plaintiff declined, believing the demanded mitigation to be overly restrictive.", "Held, claim is ripe, but no \"total taking.\" In an unpublished prior decision, the court held that despite the absence of a formal denial of the permit application, the FWS's insistent position ripened the taking claim. In the decision here, the court holds that there is no total taking because the ESA development restrictions do not deprive plaintiff's property of all economic value. The parties must present additional evidence, however, before the court can determine whether a partial regulatory taking occurred based on the takings test for less-than-complete loss of property value. Therefore, the parties' motions for summary judgment are denied.", "Comment: Ultimately, an ITP was issued to Mr. Taylor, meaning that at most he had a temporary taking claim.

Though the Corps of Engineers issued wetlands permits twice, construction did not begin because of state and local permitting and ESA problems. Both of the Corps permits expired. Plaintiff's final application to the Corps, at issue here, was denied in 1994 on the ground that the proposed project would endanger the continued existence of the Lower Keys marsh rabbit and the silver rice rat, listed as endangered in 1990 and 1991 respectively.", "Held, no taking. The plaintiff claims that the effect of the Corps' action was to completely bar economic use of his property\u2014effecting a per se total taking. Even with a total taking claim, however, a property owner must show that his reasonable investment-backed expectations were frustrated. The plaintiff could not have had reasonable expectations when he bought the property in 1973 that he would obtain approval to fill the wetland. By that year, the Corps had begun to deny dredge-and-fill permits solely on environmental grounds. And plaintiff acknowledged in the sales contract the difficulty of obtaining the necessary permits. Finally, plaintiff waited seven years after purchasing the property before applying for permits, during which wetlands protection and endangered species laws became increasingly stringent. While these developments do not bar the taking claim, they reduce plaintiff's ability to claim surprise when the permit application was denied.", "Comment: The Good decision takes a broad view of the \"notice rule\"\u2014the case law doctrine that no regulatory taking occurs when the government restricts a property use under a law existing when the property was acquired, or even, as in Good's case, under a law whose adoption after the property was acquired could have been foreseen. Mr. Good bought his wetlands before the ESA was enacted in its modern form, and 17-18 years before the species that triggered the permit denial were listed. However, as mentioned in Section II, the notice rule is no longer viewed as an absolute bar to a taking claim.", "The Good holding that a property buyer's investment-backed expectations are relevant even to total-taking claims was contravened later by an opposite holding of another Federal Circuit panel, holding that expectations are irrelevant to a total-taking claim.

The Forest Service did not abrogate or repudiate any of its obligations under the contract, nor impair plaintiff's rights to enforce such obligations. Rather, the Service, acting in a proprietary rather than sovereign capacity, sought to exercise its rights under the contract and never suggested it was not bound by the contract.

Plaintiff, however, claims that the Forest Service did not notify his company of this opinion until March, 1992. In addition, plaintiff was told that because his company's April 1, 1992, plan of operation was different than prior proposals, the Forest Service would have to initiate a second section 7 consultation with the FWS.

A claim of taking based on administrative delay must show that the delay was \"extraordinary.\" As to 1990-1992, the complex, multi-step regulatory process to approve mining in an environmentally sensitive area indicates that a 20-month delay is not extraordinary. Moreover, administrative delays of greater length have been held not to be extraordinary, and some time was consumed by the Forest Service's having to request information from the plaintiff several times. As to 1992-1994, the first eight months were taken up by discussions between the Forest Service and FWS as to whether a second consultation was needed and plaintiff's appeal, and an additional four months went by while the Forest Service waited for requested information from the plaintiff. Finally, even if the two separately alleged taking periods are considered together, totalling 43 months, the delay was not extraordinary.

Three Supreme Court opinions (1931 to 1963) hold that when the U.S. physically diverts water away from plaintiff's property, or causes the water to be so diverted, a physical taking occurs. The government says these cases are distinguishable since all that is involved with Casitas is a restriction on the use of water\u2014appropriately analyzed as a regulatory taking. This position must be rejected\u2014the government did not merely require some water to remain in the stream, but instead caused the physical diversion of water away from the canal to the fish ladder, reducing Casitas's water supply. The government's position that in contrast to the Supreme Court trilogy, the U.S. did not divert the water for its own use or for use by a third party must also be rejected: preservation of endangered species habitat is for government and third party (the public) use. Finally, the sharp distinction made in Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v.

In Casitas , the trial court judge had to decide whether his earlier characterization of an ESA-mandated reduction in water delivery as a physical taking, in Tulare Lake (see below), governed here as well. He held that it did not, owing to the Supreme Court's intervening decision in Tahoe-Sierra noted above. Thus, he concluded that Casitas was to be analyzed on a regulatory taking theory. This change of heart led the Federal Circuit, in the Casitas appeal, to address Tahoe-Sierra at length\u2014concluding, as noted above, that Tahoe-Sierra in no way undercut the Supreme Court's physical-diversion trilogy and its labelling of such diversions as physical takings.

There was a taking of the plaintiffs' right to use the water, in the amount of the reduction. The plaintiffs' contracts with the state conferred a right to the exclusive use of prescribed quantities of water. Thus, a mere restriction on use (as to the water not delivered) completely eviscerates the right to that amount of water, and constitutes a physical taking. The federal government has essentially substituted itself as the beneficiary of the contract right and totally displaced the contract holder. And plaintiffs' state contracts hold harmless for reduced water delivery only the state, not the United States. Finally, background principles of state law (public trust doctrine, doctrine of reasonable use, and nuisance law) do not limit plaintiffs' right to use the water, since that right was defined by their contracts and the state's water allocation scheme.

First, it involved ESA-based cutbacks in delivery of irrigation water, a highly emotional issue in the West and one that has generated other takings suits noted in this report. Moreover, at the time it was decided it was the only court decision involving any ESA circumstance that found a taking. Second, the court's rationale included some controversial conclusions\u2014e.g., that a regulatory restriction effected a physical taking, and that the plaintiffs acquired greater rights against the U.S. under their contracts with the state than they had against the state.
