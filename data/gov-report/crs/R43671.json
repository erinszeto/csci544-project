Ex-Im Bank operates under a renewable general statutory charter (Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended).

The first Export-Import Bank was established on February 2, 1934 (Executive Order No. 6581), to assist in financing U.S. trade with the Soviet Union. The Second Export-Import Bank was created on March 9, 1934 (Executive Order No. 6638), originally to assist in financing U.S. trade with Cuba. Its operations were subsequently expanded to include trade financing to all other countries except the Soviet Union. Both the first and second Bank had limited two-year charters. At the end of the two-year period, the Second Export-Import Bank's charter was allowed to lapse, with its functions transferred to the first Bank. The charter for the first Bank was extended and, in 1945, it was superseded by the present Ex-Im Bank. ", "In the immediate post-war period, Ex-Im Bank participated in reconstruction efforts and was viewed as part of the growing U.S. aid efforts. In the 1950s, it responded to requests from U.S. exporters by shifting away from aid-related activities to offering export credit financing for exports of goods and by confronting the competition U.S. exporters faced in the form of officially financed, government-supported export credits. In the early 1960s, it further attempted to meet the needs of U.S. exporters by offering export credit guarantees to insure against political and exchange rate risk. In the 1970s, Ex-Im Bank funded large scale infrastructure projects in numerous developing countries. By the early 1980s, small projects and capital goods and services constituted an increasingly larger share of Ex-Im Bank's business. Presently, Ex-Im Bank provides direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance as a part of U.S. export promotion efforts to contribute to U.S. employment, though its activities also may have foreign policy implications (see \" Market Context and Ex-Im Bank Programs \" section).

Demand for Ex-Im Bank financing relative to the private sector can be highly variable. At a macro level, it may vary depending on market forces and regulatory policies. In recent years, the role of ECAs may have become more prominent, in part due to tighter credit market conditions associated with the international financial crisis and the regulatory impact of Basel III on commercial banks, which requires U.S. banks to hold more capital to back trade finance. Changes in disciplines for ECA activity, such as in the OECD Arrangement, also can affect ECA demand.

These laws are listed in Appendix C of this report, in Table C-1 . Such extensions of the Bank's authority during the first two decades of its existence tended to be for between about five and seven years. Since that time, the length of these extensions has varied, from periods of days or weeks, to about six years. The most recent such extension, in 2015, was for a period of about three years and ten months ( P.L. 114-94 ).", "Provisions in other laws, most typically appropriations acts, have also been used to provide for the continuation of Bank functions during periods when the sunset date had lapsed and not yet been extended. These laws and their relevant provisions are listed in Appendix C of this report, in Table C-2 . While such provisions have varied in form, they have generally indicated congressional intent that the Bank's operations should continue during a specified time period. For example, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2002, which was enacted on January 10, 2002, carried the following provision:", "SEC. 588. [ ... ] Provided, That notwithstanding the dates specified in section 7 of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635f) and section 1(c) of P.L. 103-428 , the Export-Import Bank of the United States shall continue to exercise its functions in connection with and in furtherance of its objects and purposes through March 31, 2002.", "The most recent extension of Ex-Im Bank authority, through a provision in an appropriations act, allowed the Bank to exercise its functions through June 30, 2015 ( P.L. 113-164 ).", "Shorter extensions in the past arguably have given Congress the opportunity to weigh in on Ex-Im Bank operations on a more frequent basis through the lawmaking process. On the other hand, Ex-Im Bank and certain stakeholders have asserted that longer-term extensions can enhance the Bank's long-term planning ability and provide more assurance to clients of the Bank's viability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How have previous continuing resolutions addressed an imminent sunset of the Bank's authority?", "paragraphs": ["Continuing resolutions (CRs) are appropriations laws that provide temporary or full year appropriations in the absence of regular appropriations being enacted. After the first CR is enacted for a fiscal year, usually by the beginning of the fiscal year, one or more additional CRs may be enacted until the annual appropriations process has concluded. ", "Over the past several decades, CRs have often been used to temporarily extend authorizing provisions that are scheduled to expire at the beginning of a fiscal year, or to provide authority to continue functions notwithstanding applicable sunset provisions. In the case of Ex-Im Bank, such provisions have been enacted on a number of occasions to authorize the Bank to continue its functions, either during the duration of the CR or some other specified period (see Appendix C of this report, Table C-2 ). This occurred, for example, at the beginning of FY2012, when the Bank's authority sunsetted and an extension of that sunset date was not enacted until May 30, 2012 ( P.L. 112-122 ).

This act also generally lowered Ex-Im Bank's statutory lending authority to $135 billion for each of FY2015-FY2019, and made reforms to, among other things, Ex-Im Bank's policies or operations in risk management, fraud controls, and ethics, as well as the U.S. approach to international negotiations on export credit financing (see Table 4 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What are scenarios for Ex-Im Bank's authorization status?", "paragraphs": ["Congress could take a range of approaches related to Ex-Im Bank's authorization status. At one end of the spectrum is the option of a \"clean renewal\" of Ex-Im Bank's charter, with an extension of its termination date. At the other end of the spectrum is the option of a sunset in Ex-Im Bank's authority, such as by taking no legislative action (since sunset provisions are contained in Ex-Im Bank's charter in 12 U.S.C. Section 635f), or passing legislation with specific parameters for a wind-down in Ex-Im Bank's functions. In between are options including a renewal of Ex-Im Bank's charter with limited changes (such as revising its exposure cap) or renewal with more substantive reforms (such as to its authorities, policies, and practices). Reforms may be motivated by a range of reasons, including enhancing Ex-Im Bank's ability to fill in gaps in private sector financing and offset competition from foreign ECAs; limiting its size and scope and exposure to U.S. taxpayers; and furthering efforts to eliminate all ECA activity internationally. Proposed reforms may raise, among other things, issues regarding the extent to which such changes would balance Ex-Im Bank's core mission to boost U.S. exports and jobs with supporting other U.S. policy interests. Other options also exist, such as reorganization of Ex-Im Bank's functions. To this end, various proposals have been considered over time, including President Obama's proposal in 2012 to reorganize the business- and trade-related functions of Ex-Im Bank and five other agencies into an umbrella \"department of trade,\" a proposal reiterated in the President's subsequent budget requests. Such proposals prompt debates about whether reorganization would reduce costs and duplication and improve the effectiveness of trade policy programs, or undermine the effectiveness of federal agencies, given their differing missions, and result in the creation of a larger, more costly bureaucracy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What were legislative developments in the 114th Congress related to Ex-Im Bank reauthorization?", "paragraphs": ["Members of the 114 th Congress actively debated Ex-Im Bank and ultimately reauthorized the Bank with bipartisan support.
