In 2008, however, the advent of the global financial crisis and U.S. economic recession began to be felt in Latin America. Growth began to slow as commodity prices and the demand for exports and services from the region declined. Several nations also continued to face considerable challenges that affect U.S. interests and policy in the region. These include entrenched poverty, guerrilla conflicts, autocratic leaders or the so-called rise of radical populism in several nations, drug trafficking, and high rates of crime and violence.", "U.S. interests in Latin America and the Caribbean are diverse, and include economic, political and security concerns. Geographic proximity has ensured strong economic linkages between the United States and the region, with the United States being the major trading partner and largest source of foreign investment for most countries in the region. Free trade agreements with Mexico and Canada, Chile, Central America and the Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR), and most recently with Peru have augmented U.S. economic linkages with the region. The region is also the largest source of migration, both legal and illegal, with geographic proximity and economic conditions in the region being major factors in the migration.

In some countries, weaknesses remain in the state's ability to deliver public services, ensure accountability and transparency, and advance the rule of law. In the second half of 2008, the global financial crisis and U.S. economic recession began to have a significant negative impact on Latin American and Caribbean economies.", "Five nations held elections for head of government in 2007 \u2013 Argentina, Bahamas, Guatemala, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago \u2013 and another five head elections in 2008 \u2013 Barbados, Belize, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Paraguay. The Caribbean nations of Barbados, Belize, and Grenada held parliamentary elections in January, February, and July 2008 respectively, in which incumbent parties were defeated. Paraguay held presidential elections in April 2008, which resulted in the victory of opposition candidate Fernando Lugo over the long-ruling Colorado Party, while elections in the Dominican Republic in May 2008 saw the re-election of an incumbent President Leonel Fernandez.

Countries that had suffered the deepest recessions\u2014Argentina, Uruguay, and Venezuela\u2014all experienced significant economic growth in 2004, and even per capita income for the region as a whole increased by almost 5%. Growth continued in subsequent years, with rates of 4.9% growth in 2005, and 5.8% in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, countries with the highest growth rates were Panama, with growth of 11.5% and Antigua and Barbuda, with growth of 10%. Several countries had growth rates between 8 and 9%: Argentina, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.

In 2008, economic growth for the region slowed to an estimated 4.6%. The preliminary forecast for 2009 is for 1.9%, with some countries like Mexico that are closely tied to the U.S. economy expecting an economic contraction of between 1-2%. The worldwide recession has led to a drop in demand for exports from Latin America and the Caribbean and services such as tourism, and also has contributed to a drop in commodity prices, which again affects many nations in the region that are dependent on exports for growth. Remittances to the region from the United States and other countries have also begun to decline, and it is likely that the overall tightening of financial conditions worldwide will lead to a decline on foreign direct investment flows to the region.", "Politically, the Andean region still faces considerable challenges, including the rise of populism in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador. In Venezuela, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez won another six-year term decisively in December 2006, but lost a December 2007 constitutional reform referendum that would have removed presidential term limits and allowed him to run again in 2012. The election of Bolivian indigenous leader Evo Morales as President in 2005 complicated U.S. relations given Morales' efforts to decriminalize coca growing. Under the Morales government, Bolivia has become increasingly divided over the issues of constitutional reform and regional autonomy. In Ecuador, Rafael Correa, a left-leaning U.S.-trained economist won the November 2006 presidential elections and has vowed to reform Ecuador's political system, renegotiate Ecuador's foreign debt, and reassert state control over foreign oil companies operating in the country.", "Colombia continues to be threatened by drug trafficking organizations and by terrorist groups, but the government of President Alvaro Uribe has overseen the demobilization of more than 31,000 paramilitaries and made significant progress in combating the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). In 2008, the FARC suffered significant setbacks with the deaths of several of its top leaders, including Manuel Marulanda. Colombia's March 1, 2008 bombing and raid of a FARC camp in Ecuador prompted condemnation from Colombia's neighbors, and increased tensions in relations with Ecuador and Venezuela. Captured FARC computer files from the raid also raised questions about potential Ecuadoran and Venezuelan government ties to FARC.", "In Central America, countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua emerged from the turbulent 1980s and 1990s with democratic institutions more firmly entrenched, yet violent crime is a major problem in all countries. Honduras and Nicaragua are among the poorest countries in the hemisphere. In Guatemala, the center-left government of Alvaro Colom took office in January 2008 after elections in 2007 that proved to be the most violent since 1985. The new government's success will depend on its ability to build coalitions since no party in the legislature holds a majority. In Nicaragua, former President and Sandinista party leader Daniel Ortega won the November 2006 presidential election. Critics have raised questions about the Ortega government's lack of transparency in finances, and increasingly authoritarian actions, including municipal elections held in November 2008 that were less than credible. ", "The diverse Caribbean region, which includes some of the hemisphere's richest and poorest nations, also faces significant challenges. The AIDS epidemic in the region, where infection rates are among the highest outside of sub-Saharan Africa, has been a major challenge for economic and social development in several countries. Caribbean nations remain vulnerable to destruction by hurricanes and tropical storms as demonstrated once again by a series of storms in 2008. Haiti\u2014the hemisphere's poorest nation\u2014continues to be plagued by economic, political, and security problems. While for many observers, President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val's May 2006 inauguration marked the beginning of a new era, a food crisis in April 2008 led to violent protests and the removal of the country's prime minister. Since Fidel Castro stepped down from power in 2006, Cuba's political succession from Fidel to Ra\u00fal Castro has been characterized by a remarkable degree of stability. Since Ra\u00fal's official assumption of the presidency in February 2008, the government has implemented a number of economic changes that from the outside might not seem substantial, but are significant for a government that has heretofore followed a centralized communist economic model. While additional economic changes under Ra\u00fal Castro are likely, few expect there will be any change to the government's tight control over the political system, which is backed up by a strong security apparatus."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Policy", "paragraphs": ["U.S. interests in Latin America and the Caribbean are diverse, and include economic, political and security concerns.

As noted above, Latin America has made enormous strides in terms of political and economic development over the past 25 years, with considerable U.S. support, but such conditions as persistent poverty and the rise of populism in such countries as Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador continue to pose challenges for U.S. interests and policy in the region.

The FY2009 request reflected an increase of almost 40% over that being provided in FY2008 in the regular foreign aid appropriations measure. However, if FY2008 supplemental assistance for the M\u00e9rida Initiative ($417 million in FY2008) is included in the comparison, the FY2009 budget request was just about 9% over the $1.88 billion estimated to be provided in FY2008. (See Table 1 .)", "Looking at the top foreign aid recipients in the region, five countries\u2014Colombia, Mexico, Haiti, Peru, and Bolivia\u2014account for the lion's share of U.S. assistance going to Latin America; about 73% of the FY2009 request for the region will go to these five countries. As it has been for the past eight years, Colombia is the single largest aid recipient in the region, and would receive about $543 million or about 26% of assistance going to the region in FY2009. The United States has not traditionally provided large amounts of foreign assistance to Mexico, but the FY2009 request includes almost $501 million, accounting for about 24% of aid to the region, with almost $478 million of that under the M\u00e9rida Initiative that would increase security cooperation with Mexico to combat the threats of drug trafficking, transnational crime, and terrorism. Assistance to Haiti has increased significantly over the past several years as the United States has provided support to the Pr\u00e9val government. The FY2009 request for Haiti is for almost $246 million, or about 12% of assistance to the region.

Colombia, the main source country for cocaine entering the United States and a strong U.S. ally in South America, has received the bulk of ACP funding. However, the ACP program is regional in nature because organizations in countries bordering Colombia also produce and traffic in narcotics. The ACP program began in 2000, when Congress passed legislation providing $1.3 billion in interdiction and development assistance ( P.L. 106-246 ) for Colombia and six regional neighbors: Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil, and Panama. Funding for ACP from FY2000 through FY2008 totaled approximately $6 billion.", "For FY2008, the Administration requested $442.8 million for the ACP program, with $367 million requested for programs in Colombia. This request was lower than in previous years due in part to the Administration's decision to transfer alternative development programs from the ACP account to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 110-161 ) provided some $319.8 million for ACP programs, a reduction of $123.1 million from the Administration's request, but transferred some ACP activities to the ESF and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) accounts. As in previous years Colombia received the overwhelming majority of ACP funding, totaling roughly $244.6 million for interdiction and eradication programs. Other countries receiving ACP assistance included Bolivia ($30 million), Ecuador ($7 million), Peru ($36.5 million), Brazil ($1 million) and Panama ($1 million). Venezuela no longer receives ACP funding. For FY2008, Congress provided roughly $194 million in ESF funding for alternative development/institution building programs and $41.9 million in INCLE funding for human rights and rule of law programs in Colombia.

The request includes funding at or slightly above FY2008 enacted levels for Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, and Panama.", "The ACP program has helped improve security conditions in Colombia and aided the Uribe government's efforts against the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group, but has not reduced drug production in the Andean region. A June 2008 report by the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime found that although yields were down, the coca acreage planted in the Andean region increased by 16% in 2007. Supporters of U.S. counterdrug policy argue that assistance to Colombia is necessary to help a democratic government confront drug-supported leftist and rightist illegally armed groups. Assistance to Colombia's neighbors, according to supporters, is merited because of an increasing threat from the spillover of violence and drug production from Colombia. While some critics agree with this assessment, they argue that U.S. assistance overemphasizes military training and crop eradication rather than alternative development projects that could provide alternative livelihoods for growers who voluntarily give up illicit crops. Critics also assert that U.S. assistance provides inadequate support for the protection of human rights.", "For a broader discussion of Colombia beyond the ACP, see \" Colombia \" below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "M\u00e9rida Initiative", "paragraphs": ["Increasing violence perpetrated by drug cartels, youth gangs, and other criminal groups is threatening citizen security and democracy in Mexico and Central America.

In the act, Mexico receives $352 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance and $48 million in FY2009 bridge fund supplemental assistance, while Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic receive $65 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance. The measure has human rights conditions softer than compared to earlier House and Senate versions, largely because of Mexico's objections that some of the conditions would violate its national sovereignty. The language in the final enacted measure reduced the amount of funding subject to human rights conditions, from 25% to 15%, removed conditions that would have required the Mexican government to try military officials accused of abuses in civilian courts and to enhance the power of its National Human Rights Commission, and softened the language in other conditions.", "On June 11, 2008, the House approved H.R. 6028 (Berman), the Merida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce Organized Crime Authorization Act of 2008 by a vote of 311 to 106.

U.S. trade policy has evolved over time, adjusting to changes in both U.S. interests and altered circumstances and priorities in the region. When Latin American countries faced economic, social, and political upheaval in the 1970s and 1980s, the United States sought to support and influence the region with unilateral (one-way) trade preference programs intended to encourage export-led economic growth and development. This concept was also the basis for the Haiti HOPE Act, which was expanded and extended for ten years in June 2008. By the 1990s, the rebound of economic growth and new-found interest in trade liberalization created an opening for U.S. trade policy to shift toward reciprocal (two-way) free trade agreements (FTAs). Among the major differences with trade preferences, FTAs are negotiated between parties, have more comprehensive, mutual obligations, and are permanent, not requiring periodic congressional renewal.", "By implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the U.S.-Chile FTA, the U.S.-Peru FTA, and the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), countries exchanged their unilateral trade preferences provided under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), and the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) for reciprocal benefits under the FTAs. Newly negotiated FTAs with Panama and Colombia present the same tradeoff with respect to unilateral preferences extended to them under either the CBI or the ATPA. In June 2008, the 110 th Congress extended unchanged the CBTPA for two years until September 30, 2010 ( H.R. 6124 / P.L. 110-246 , Title XV, Section 15408).

First, the proposed hemispheric-wide Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) has stalled over disagreements between Brazil and the United States and appears unlikely to be acted on in the near future. The Brazil-led Southern Common Market (Mercado Com\u00fan del Sur\u2014Mercosur) seems to be expanding its customs union approach to regional integration as an alternative to the U.S.-backed FTAA, particularly to countries with no trade preferences with the United States. It is in this context, as well as the lingering World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, that congressional consideration of the two remaining U.S. bilateral FTAs takes on added significance. Second, the expiration of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) means expedited legislative procedures typically used to consider reciprocal trade agreement implementing legislation is no longer available for FTAs entered into after July 1, 2007. Without a renewed TPA, the United States is limited in its ability to move forward on future FTAs in the region.

In addition, in March 2008, the government lifted a ban on Cubans staying at tourist hotels.

Charges of widespread fraud in November 2008 municipal elections have led to the suspension of significant international assistance. The Sandinista leader's previous presidency (1985-1991) was marked by a civil conflict with U.S.-backed \"contras,\" authoritarian tendencies, and charges of corruption. Ortega, who had lost the last three presidential elections, won only 37.9% of the vote in the 2006 elections. But a Nicaraguan law\u2014which Ortega helped spearhead through the congress\u2014allowed him to avoid a run-off vote because he was more than 5% ahead of the next closest candidate, Eduardo Montealegre, then-head of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN).", "The United States, the European Union, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have suspended international financial support because of the Ortega government's \"closure of democratic space.\" The Sandinista-dominated electoral council (CSE) revoked the legal status of two major opposition parties, the dissident Sandinista Reformist Movement (MRS) and the center-right Conservative Party, which had been expected to do well in November 2008 municipal elections. The opposition claims the Sandinistas won 44 of their 105 municipalities fraudulently. The government has refused to conduct a recount and swore in the new officials. The CSE's postponement of local elections on the Atlantic Coast, and further charges of fraud when they were held in January 2009, led to riots. ", "Ortega also established Citizens Power Councils, despite the National Assembly having voted against them. The councils administer government anti-poverty programs, but are overseen by Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo and controlled by the Sandinista party. Critics say they are another example of a lack of transparency and authoritarian practices. It appears the Sandinistas have renewed a governing pact with the Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC). On January 16, 2009, the Supreme Court overturned the money laundering conviction of PLC leader and former President Arnoldo Aleman, who Transparency International calls one of the ten most corrupt leaders of all time. Within two hours the National Assembly \u2013 which had been paralyzed by the electoral conflict for over two months \u2013 reconvened and reelected a Sandinista legislator as president of the Assembly for another two years.

In 2005, the Bush Administration signed a five-year, $175 million agreement with Nicaragua under the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) to promote rural development. At first, Ortega walked a fine line, balancing strong anti-U.S. rhetoric with cooperation on issues of concern to the United States, such as the pursuit of free-trade policies (including participation in CAFTA-DR), counter-narcotics efforts, and resolution of property claims. In December 2008, however, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) suspended $64 million in new MCA funds in response to the Ortega administration's actions surrounding municipal elections, which the MCC board said \"were not consistent with MCC requirements...that promote political freedom and respect for civil liberties and the rule of law.\" The board will consider whether Nicaragua has implemented measures to address those concerns when it determines its next steps in March 2009.", "Similarly, Ortega's administration signed a poverty reduction strategy with the IMF, providing for a three-year loan program. Now, however, the IMF is withholding $39 million from Nicaragua because the government failed to approve an \"anti-fraud\" energy law to regulate aid from Venezuela, including funds generated by the re-sale of Venezuelan oil bought on preferential terms, which amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The IMF said it will not sign a new agreement with Nicaragua until the legislature passes legislation recognizing the debts owed to Venezuela and regulating the use of the funds. Otherwise, donors and critics say, the Venezuelan aid is basically a slush fund outside the national budget which the Sandinistas can use for patronage, and which could leave future governments with an enormous debt. The IMF also expressed concern over the government's making loans to companies using government social security funds.", "U.S. aid to Nicaragua has fluctuated over the last several years, from $50 million in FY2006, to $36.9 million in FY2007, an estimated $28.6 million for FY2008, and a requested $38 million for FY2009.

In an October 2006 referendum on the issue, 78% of voters supported the expansion project, which officially began in September 2007. The new set of locks is estimated to be completed by 2014. Panama's service-based economy has been booming in recent years, but income distribution remains highly skewed, with large disparities between the rich and poor. Because Panama's Constitution does not allow for presidential re-election, jockeying began in early 2008 for the May 2009 presidential election.

Garc\u00eda's earlier presidency (1985-1990) was marked by hyper-inflation and a violent guerrilla insurgency. President Garc\u00eda has continued the pro-market economic policies of his predecessor, Alejandro Toledo, who presided over one of the highest economic growth rates in Latin America throughout his term. Peru's economy grew about 8% in 2007.

Human rights lawyers have questioned the independence of the recently appointed heads of the Supreme Court and Lima High Court, however, noting that they have expressed views or taken action favorable to Former President Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000) or his associates. Fujimori was extradited from Chile on charges of corruption and human rights violations and his trial began in December 2007. If convicted, he faces 30 years in prison and a fine of $33 million.
