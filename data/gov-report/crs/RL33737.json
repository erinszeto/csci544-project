BAPCPA amends the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7109, to require an individual to receive credit counseling before filing a petition for bankruptcy. In certain circumstances, these requirements may be waived. BAPCPA also requires debtors, after they file for bankruptcy relief, to take a personal financial management course. Both credit counseling agencies and personal financial management instructional course providers must obtain approval from a U.S. trustee before offering a course to satisfy these requirements. Section 106 of BAPCPA creates a new provision that specifies the approval requirements for both credit counseling agencies and personal financial management instructional courses. Finally, section 1220 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 amends the Internal Revenue Code and establishes new standards that a credit counseling organization must meet to be exempt from federal income tax."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["In April 2005, President Bush signed P.L. 109-8 , the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA). The purpose of BAPCPA is not only to \"improve bankruptcy law and practice by restoring personal responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system,\" but to ensure fairness of the system for both debtors and creditors. BAPCPA consists of a comprehensive package of reform measures pertaining to both consumer and business bankruptcy cases. One of its many amendments requires debtors to participate in credit counseling programs before filing for bankruptcy relief. BAPCPA's credit counseling provisions are intended to give consumers in financial distress an opportunity to learn about the consequences of bankruptcy, such as the potentially devastating effect it can have on their credit rating. BAPCPA also requires debtors, after they file for bankruptcy relief, to receive personal financial management training. This training is intended to provide debtors with guidance about how to manage their finances in order to avoid future financial difficulties.", "On August 17, 2006, President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-280 ). Although the Act does not change BAPCPA's credit counseling provisions, section 1220 of the Pension Protection Act amends section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, providing new standards that a credit counseling agency must meet to be eligible for a federal income tax exemption."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Credit Counseling Requirements Under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005", "paragraphs": ["Section 106 of BAPCPA adds credit counseling as a prerequisite to Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing or relief. Section 106(a) of BAPCPA amends section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code to require an individual to receive credit counseling within the 180-day period preceding the date of filing a petition for bankruptcy. The credit counseling must be provided by an approved \"nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency\" and must consist of either an individual or group briefing. This briefing, which may be conducted by telephone or via the Internet, must outline the opportunities for credit counseling and must assist the debtor in performing a budget analysis.", "Under the new section 109(h) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor may be exempt from the mandatory credit counseling requirement in certain circumstances. For example, the requirement does not apply to a debtor who resides in a district where the U.S. trustee has determined that approved credit counseling agencies in that district are not reasonably able to provide adequate services to such individuals. A debtor may also be temporarily exempted from the mandatory credit counseling requirement if the debtor submits to the court a certification that (1) describes exigent circumstances meriting a waiver of this requirement; (2) states that the debtor requested credit counseling services from an approved credit counseling agency, but was unable to obtain such services within the five-day period beginning on the date the debtor made the request; and (3) is satisfactory to the court. This exemption terminates when the debtor meets the requirements for credit counseling participation, but not longer than 30 days after the case is filed, unless the court, for cause, extends this period up to an additional 15 days. The requirements for an exemption from credit counseling under section 109(h) are considered \"stringent,\" and a failure to strictly follow the requirements has led to both denial of exemptions and an inability to file for bankruptcy.", "In addition, a debtor may be exempt from the mandatory credit counseling requirement if the court determines, after notice and a hearing, that the debtor is unable to complete this requirement because of incapacity, disability, or active military duty in a military combat zone. Incapacity, under this provision, means the debtor is \"impaired by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency so that the debtor is incapable of realizing and making rational decisions with respect to financial responsibilities.\" Disability under the 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(h) provision means that \"the debtor is so physically impaired as to be unable, after reasonable effort, to receive credit counseling whether by participating in person, or via telephone or Internet briefing.\"", "BAPCPA also amends the Bankruptcy Code to deny a discharge to Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 debtors who fail to complete a personal financial management instructional course. This requirement does not apply if the debtor resides in a district where the U.S. trustee has determined that the approved instructional courses in that district are not adequate. Such determination must be reviewed annually by the U.S. trustee. In addition, these provisions do not apply to a debtor who the court determines, after notice and a hearing, is unable to complete this requirement because of incapacity, disability, or active military duty in a military combat zone. Section 106(e) adds section 111 to the Bankruptcy Code. Under section 111(a), the clerk is required to maintain a publicly available list of approved credit counseling agencies and personal financial management instructional courses. Section 111(b) discusses the determinations that must be made by a U.S. trustee before a credit counseling agency or a personal financial management course can be approved.", "Under section 111(b)(1), the U.S. trustee must undertake a thorough review of the qualifications of the credit counseling agency or personal financial management instructional course to ensure that the counseling services or course meets the standards set forth in section 111. The section also allows a U.S. trustee to require that the credit counseling agency or course provider provide information with respect to this review. If, prior to approval by the U.S. trustee, a credit counseling agency or instructional course did not appear on the list required under section 111(a), then approval shall be allowed for a probationary period not to exceed six months.

Section 111(c)(2) elaborates on these requirements.

The following cases present some of the circumstances under which the requirements of section 109(h) have been analyzed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Meaning of \"Exigent Circumstances\"", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, under section 109(h)(3), a debtor may be temporarily exempted from mandatory credit counseling if debtor submits to the court a certification that (1) describes exigent circumstances meriting a waiver of this requirement; (2) states that the debtor requested credit counseling services from an approved credit counseling agency, but was unable to obtain such services within the seven-day period beginning on the date the debtor made the request; and (3) is satisfactory to the court. In Dixon , a Chapter 13 debtor filed a certification requesting a waiver of credit counseling. In his certification, the debtor claimed exigent circumstances based on the fact that a foreclosure sale was scheduled for the debtor's home on the same day as the bankruptcy filing. Further, the debtor claimed that after he learned of the credit counseling requirement, he was informed that it would be two weeks before credit counseling could be obtained over the telephone and 24 hours before the counseling could be accessed by the Internet. Based on these circumstances, the debtor argued that it was impossible for him to receive credit counseling prior to the foreclosure sale.", "The bankruptcy court refused to waive the credit counseling requirement and denied the bankruptcy petition. On appeal, the U.S. Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Eighth Circuit considered whether the bankruptcy court erred in its decision to deny the waiver. The Panel discussed the meaning of \"exigent circumstances\" and pointed out that there are two requirements: first, that there be exigent circumstances and second, that the exigent circumstances must merit a waiver of the credit counseling requirement. In discussing whether a waiver of credit counseling requirements is appropriate, the Panel explained that a debtor's exigency must be such that it precludes a debtor from obtaining the credit counseling within the five-day \"window\" preceding the bankruptcy.", "The Panel went on to describe \"exigent\" as meaning \"that the debtor finds himself in a situation in which adverse events are imminent and will occur before the debtor is able to avail himself of the statutory [counseling].\" The Panel acknowledged that in virtually all cases (including the instant case) debtors have exigent circumstances. The real question, the Panel explained, was whether exigent circumstances present were deserving of a waiver. The Panel noted that in the earlier decision, the court had observed that state law required 20 days notice of foreclosure. With that much notice, the Panel found, the circumstances were not exigent. The Panel concluded that the bankruptcy court had not abused its discretion in denying the waiver and affirmed the decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Adequate Services\" by Approved Credit Counseling Agencies", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned above, under section 109(h)(2), a debtor may be exempt from the credit counseling requirement if the debtor resides in a district where the U.S. trustee has determined that approved credit counseling agencies are not reasonably able to provide adequate services to such individuals. In Petit Louis , the debtor, who could only speak and understand Creole, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Because the debtor could not obtain the credit counseling in Creole, and because he could not afford to hire an interpreter, the debtor requested that the U.S. trustee either waive the credit counseling requirement, provide a Creole interpreter, or decertify the approved counseling agencies for failure to provide Creole speaking counselors. The U.S. trustee declined the requests of the debtor, and the debtor then applied to the bankruptcy court for a waiver of the counseling requirements. The U.S. trustee claimed, among other things, that the trustee had no responsibility to provide language interpreters and that lack of English capability was not a sufficient reason for a waiver. The court found that the credit counseling agencies in the district were not reasonably able to provide adequate services to the debtor, and the court waived the credit counseling requirement.", "On a motion for reconsideration, the U.S. trustee argued that the court did not have the authority to waive the credit counseling requirement. The court disagreed and ruled that not only could a court waive the credit counseling requirement under section 109(h)(3), it also had the authority to waive the requirement under section 109(h)(2). The U.S. trustee also argued that the court did not have the right to review a U.S. trustee finding that credit counseling agencies in the district were \"adequate.\" The court again disagreed and found that the forum was proper.", "The court affirmed its determination that credit counseling services in the Southern District of Florida were inadequate for this debtor. The court explained that Mr. Petit-Louis had properly invoked the court's jurisdiction by notifying the U.S. trustee that he intended to challenge the adequacy of the credit counseling available, and giving the U.S. trustee an opportunity to respond. The U.S. trustee's motion for reconsideration was denied."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credit Counseling After Bankruptcy Petition Filed", "paragraphs": ["BAPCPA amends section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code to require an individual to receive credit counseling prior to filing a petition for bankruptcy. In general, most courts have strictly followed this provision and have been reluctant, for any reason, to accept a bankruptcy petition when credit counseling was sought or obtained after the petition was filed. For example, in Davenport , a debtor claimed she was unable to receive pre-petition counseling due to the repossession of her car. She later obtained counseling after filing a bankruptcy petition and sought to be excused from the pre-petition requirement. The debtor claimed that equity principles (i.e., \"no harm, no foul\") should apply to her because she completed the counseling after filing for bankruptcy.", "The bankruptcy court explained that the only way to excuse compliance with the pre-petition requirement was to meet the three requirements necessary for a waiver; equity principles would not suffice. Although the court noted that exigent circumstances were present, it found that to be a debtor, an individual must establish that a request for credit counseling was made before the petition was filed. The court dismissed the bankruptcy petition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Meaning of \"Date of Filing\"", "paragraphs": ["Section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code states that credit counseling must be obtained \"within the 180-day period preceding the date\" of filing for bankruptcy. However, the courts have split on the question of whether this requirement is satisfied by debtors who complete credit counseling on the same day, but just before, filing a bankruptcy petition. ", "Some courts fall into the \"plain language\" category and hold that debtors must have completed credit counseling on the day before filing a bankruptcy petition. The \"plain language\" cases posit that the \"date of filing\" refers to the entire calendar day on which a petition is filed, not the specific moment at which it is filed. As the 180-day period must precede the day of filing, the \"plain meaning rule\" concludes that the last day on which credit counseling can precede the filing date is the day prior to the date of filing. The \"plain language\" cases also draw support from Rule 9006 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which governs the calculation of time. It provides that, when counting days, \"the day of the act, event or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.\" In other words, when calculating the earliest day on which counseling can occur one should not count the day of filing. Consequently, when counting the latest day on which counseling can occur, \"plain language\" cases argue that the day of filing should not be included.", "Other courts are categorized as \"bright line\" cases and conclude that a debtor has satisfied the credit counseling requirement so long as counseling occurs prior to filing. Courts that have adopted this reasoning have relied on other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that prescribe retrospective time constraints. For example, \u00a7 547(b)(4)(A) provides that the trustee may avoid certain transfers of an interest in property made 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition. As the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Tenth Circuit noted, ", "[T]he date of filing in \u00a7 547(b)(4)(A) is interpreted as the moment of filing, since there would otherwise be an uncovered gap between midnight and whenever the petition was filed, during which transfers could be made whether or not they were otherwise preferential, an absurd result, 'contrary to the congressional purpose of the provisions.' ", "Applying this construction of the \"date of filing\" to the language used in \u00a7 109(h) permits debtors to satisfy the credit counseling requirement on the same day as they file for bankruptcy, so long as the counseling occurs before the petition is filed.
