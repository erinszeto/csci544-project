The PAYGO process was effectively terminated in December 2002 by the enactment of P.L. 107-312, which set all remaining balances on the PAYGO scorecard to zero.", "Under the PAYGO process, if the OMB director determined that there was a positive balance for a fiscal year on the PAYGO scorecard, then the President was required to issue a sequestration order implementing across-the-board cuts in nonexempt direct spending to eliminate the balance. The OMB director issued 12 final sequestration reports under the PAYGO process, for FY1992-FY2003. The final balances on the PAYGO scorecard for all years were either negative amounts (reflecting net savings) or zero. Accordingly, no PAYGO sequester was required for any fiscal year during this period. While the OMB director's final determinations indicated compliance with the PAYGO requirement in all years, in some cases the balances reflected adjustments due to emergency requirements, provided for under the process, or directed scorekeeping provisions in law that intervened in the normal operation of the process in order to prevent a sequester.

There was widespread concern that procedures under the 1974 act were not sufficient to cope with persistent deficits of such size.", "The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 provided strengthened procedures in the form of declining annual deficit targets, set in statute, that were expected to lead from a deficit of $171.9 billion for FY1986 to a balanced budget by FY1991. The deficit targets were enforced by a process known as sequestration, which involved largely across-the-board spending cuts in nonexempt programs that would be triggered automatically toward the beginning of the fiscal year if the Comptroller General determined that the applicable deficit target was not expected to be met. A sequester was viewed as such a draconian approach, and the consequences of it so unacceptable, that the threat of one would force Congress and the President to reach agreement on needed budgetary legislation under regular legislative procedures.", "The 1985 Balanced Budget Act was modified two years later by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987, signed into law by President Reagan on September 29, 1987. The two major modifications were: (1) in order to overcome constitutional objections, placing the authority to trigger a sequester in the hands of the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); and (2) revising the deficit targets and extending the goal of a balanced budget by two years, to FY1993.", "Unlike the congressional budget process under the 1974 act, in which enforcement procedures were internal to Congress, the sequestration process relied on actions by the executive: the OMB director determined whether a sequester would occur and the amount of the required spending cuts; the President issued any required sequestration order; and executive agencies implemented the bulk of the spending cuts (sequestration also applied to legislative and judicial agencies, which constitute a relatively small portion of the federal budget).", "During the period that deficit targets were in effect, three deficit sequesters occurred, for FY1986, FY1988, and FY1990. Initial outlay savings associated with the three deficit target sequesters were substantial: $11.7 billion for FY1986; $20.0 billion for FY1988; and $16.1 billion for FY1990. The across-the-board cuts made in different categories of spending ranged in size from 4.3% to 10.5%. Except for FY1986, these savings subsequently were rescinded as part of a budget agreement (FY1988) or were reduced by a later law (to $4.55 billion for FY1990).

As indicated earlier, the sequestration process was modified by several laws over the years and these modifications revised the timetable; the timetable in its most recent form is used in this report. Actions under the PAYGO process were synchronized with actions pertaining to the discretionary spending limits (and, for the remainder of their existence, the deficit targets).", "As a general rule, the enforcement procedures for the PAYGO process, on the one hand, and the discretionary spending limits, on the other, were separated by a \"firewall.\" Violations of the PAYGO requirement were corrected by reductions solely in direct spending programs, while violations of the discretionary spending limits were remedied by reductions only in discretionary spending programs. Further, savings made on one side of the firewall could not be used to the advantage of programs on the other side. For example, the cost of tax-cut legislation could not be offset by reductions in discretionary spending in annual appropriations acts in order to avoid a PAYGO sequester.", "As mentioned previously, the PAYGO process was set forth in Section 252 of the 1985 Balanced Budget Act. Procedures dealing with the enforcement of the discretionary spending limits were set forth in Section 251 of the act, and procedures for the enforcement of the deficit targets were contained in Section 253. Aside from these core elements, the act also contained sections providing definitions (Section 250), dealing with the timetable for, and contents of, sequestration reports and orders (Section 254), exempt programs and activities (Section 255), general sequestration rules and special rules for selected programs (Section 256), construction of the budget baseline (Section 257), as well as other sections.", "With regard to direct spending, the PAYGO requirement applied to outlay levels rather than levels of budget authority. Outlays, rather than budget authority, are compared to revenue levels to determine the amount of the surplus or deficit.", "During the course of the session, OMB was required to provide Congress with a cost estimate for each budgetary measure within seven days of its enactment, so that compliance with the PAYGO requirement and discretionary spending limits could be monitored. The cost estimates had to be based on the economic and technical assumptions used in the President's most recent budget, and had to include similar cost estimates prepared by CBO together with an explanation of any differences between the two sets of estimates.", "The PAYGO balances for each fiscal year were recorded on a rolling PAYGO \"scorecard,\" maintained by the OMB director, that accumulated the budgetary effects of laws enacted during the session and in prior years. The threshold test for a PAYGO sequester dealt with how legislation affected the net cost for a fiscal year on the PAYGO scorecard, not how it changed the surplus or deficit for that fiscal year in the federal budget.", "Under the timetable for the sequestration process, the OMB director issued a sequestration report at the time the President's budget was submitted to Congress (the preview report), midway through the congressional session (the update report), and within 15 days after the end of the session (the final report). In preparing its update and final sequestration reports, OMB had to use the economic and technical assumptions that were used in the earlier preview report. The CBO director issued sequestration reports in advance of the OMB reports, but they were advisory only. (CBO sequestration reports are not addressed in this report.)", "If the OMB director's final sequestration report indicated that enacted direct spending and revenue levels had incurred a net cost for the fiscal year on the PAYGO scorecard, then the President was required to immediately issue a sequestration order to remedy the violation through automatic, across-the-board spending reductions. If a sequester under this process was required, it had to occur within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourned at the end of a session and on the same day as any sequestration tied to enforcement of the discretionary spending limits.", "The sequester had to eliminate any net positive balance on the PAYGO scorecard, for that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year combined, caused by the enactment of legislation during the session and in prior years. (In order to close any enforcement loophole, the budgetary impact of direct spending and revenue legislation enacted during a session, but after the OMB director's final sequestration report had been issued, was recorded on the PAYGO scorecard in the following session. Hence, this balance was combined with the balance for the budget year to determine if a violation had occurred.)", "Any required reductions would have been made in non-exempt direct spending programs. Emergency direct spending and revenue legislation, so designated by the President and in statute, was not subject to the PAYGO sequestration process. Spending for the Social Security program, except for administrative expenses, was exempt from sequestration, as were many other direct spending programs. Any reductions in Medicare spending were limited to 4% and other special sequestration rules applied to selected programs.", "Section 258 of the 1985 Balanced Budget Act provided for the suspension of selected budget enforcement procedures because of low economic growth or war. With regard to low economic growth (i.e., at least two consecutive quarters of GDP growth below 1% or negative growth), the suspension procedure would have been triggered automatically by the issuance of a \"low-growth report\" by CBO. Under the suspension procedure, certain budget enforcement procedures would have been suspended if Congress and the President subsequently enacted a \"suspension resolution.\" Action on a suspension resolution was required in the Senate but was optional in the House.", "During the years that these suspension provisions were available, the United States was in a period of sustained low economic growth only twice\u2014in late 1990 through early 1991 and in late 2001 through early 2002. CBO issued low-growth reports three times in 1991, but in each instance a measure to suspend enforcement procedures was defeated in the Senate by a wide margin. More recently, CBO issued low-growth reports on October 31, 2001, and on January 30, 2002. In each instance, the Senate Budget Committee reported unfavorably a suspension resolution that subsequently was defeated on the floor.

The concern arose from the fact that the stated purpose of the PAYGO requirement (in Section 252(a) of the 1985 Balanced Budget Act) referred only to legislation \"that increases the deficit.\" In the report accompanying the FY2000 budget resolution, the House Budget Committee stated:", "The law is somewhat unclear whether PAYGO lapses when there is an on-budget surplus.

The savings reflected in these balances could have been used to offset direct spending increases or revenue reductions that were not contemplated by the budget resolution.", "Second, in more recent years, the budget resolution recommended significant reductions in revenues, coupled with increases in direct spending, that would have incurred substantial positive balances (reflecting net costs) on the PAYGO scorecard. The barrier between the PAYGO process and procedures to enforce the discretionary spending limits did not permit savings from constraints on the growth of discretionary spending to offset or \"pay for\" revenue reductions. Consequently, the enactment of legislation imposing tax cuts and direct spending increases threatened to trigger a PAYGO sequester in some years.", "As a result of these two concerns, Congress and the President enacted provisions in at least seven different laws intervening significantly in the normal operation of the PAYGO requirement. The interventions involved scorekeeping directions to the OMB director that prohibited him from counting direct spending or revenue changes in certain legislation on the PAYGO scorecard, or that instructed him to reduce balances on the PAYGO scorecard or to set them to zero.", "Additionally, the OMB director sometimes was directed in statute to reclassify direct spending or revenue provisions in annual appropriations acts so that they would not be scored under the discretionary spending limits. In recent years, Congress and the President several times used omnibus appropriations measures to bring action on regular appropriations acts for a fiscal year to a close. Because the congressional leadership sometimes used such measures as a legislative vehicle for direct spending and revenue provisions, the directed scorekeeping provisions prevented the Appropriations Committees from being held responsible under budget enforcement procedures for budgetary provisions that were the responsibility of other House and Senate committees.", "Statutory interventions in the PAYGO process involving directed scorekeeping, and their implications for sequesters, are summarized in Table 4 .

In the first two of these cases, the legislative vehicles were annual appropriations acts considered toward the very end of the session (the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001 and the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2002); in the final instance, the legislative vehicle was a free-standing law devoted solely to this purpose.", "The seven measures containing directed scorekeeping provisions did not make adjustments in the FY1991-FY1993 balances on the PAYGO scorecard.
