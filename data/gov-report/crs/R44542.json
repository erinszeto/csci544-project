This section of the report provides a concise summary of some NACTE findings about the state of CTE in the United States and the implementation of Perkins IV. Several of these findings have received considerable attention in the CTE researcher and practitioner communities.", "Federal appropriations for Perkins IV have fallen since the 2006 reauthorization. Adjusting for inflation, total Perkins funding declined by 24% from FY2007 to FY2014. Declines in allocations for individual states have ranged from 6% to 30%. In PY2008-2009, the most common uses of Perkins funds reported by local providers were purchasing equipment and providing career guidance and academic counseling to students. When surveyed about the implementation of programs of study (POS) in Perkins IV, nearly half of all state secondary and postsecondary CTE directors (23 of each) reported in PY2008-2009 that CTE teachers and faculty did not have a good understanding of POS, suggesting that the POS concept was unclear to the instructors of CTE. Flexibility in the Perkins IV definitions of core indicators of performance and the resulting variety of definitions used by the states precludes the ability to use performance data reported by the states for valid comparison of performance between states or for aggregating data across states to examine national progress and trends in CTE over time. The percentage of high school graduates completing four-year college preparatory coursework nearly doubled from 1990 to 2009, and CTE students showed larger increases than did non-CTE students. This trend can be interpreted to indicate that participating in CTE programs can increase students' chances of completing college preparatory coursework. However, this may reflect changes in who participated in CTE rather than the impact of CTE. College-going and completion rates varied considerably by CTE concentration field, as did continuation in the same CTE field at the postsecondary level. For example, as of 2006, college-attendance rates for 2004 high school graduates, examined by CTE concentration field, ranged from 84% for CTE students who had concentrated in computer and information sciences to 52% for concentrators in repair and transportation.

Basic State Grants Allocation Formula", "This appendix provides a detailed description of the formula used for allocating Perkins IV Basic State Grant funds to the states after set-asides for the outlying areas, the Native American CTE Program, and the Native Hawaiian CTE Program have been reserved. ", "Initial Allocation", "After reservations for outlying areas and the Native American and Native Hawaiian CTE Programs, Basic State Grants funds are award ed to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The base formula for state allocations was historically designed to target funds toward states with higher proportions of aged 15 to 19. States with lower per capita incomes are also targeted by the initial allocation formula.", "The base formula depends on three population groups in each state: persons aged 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 to 65. Each of these populations is then weighted in the calculation of initial allocations. The largest weight (0.5) is assigned to the 15 to 19 age group. The 20 to 24 age group is weighted 0.2, while the 25 to 65 age group is weighted 0.15. Note that these weights differ from those stated in the body of the report, because this section provides a higher level of detail about the formula calculations. ", "The second factor for calculating the initial allocation is the state's allotment ratio. This is calculated by dividing a state's per capita income (PCI) by the national average PCI. That quotient is then multiplied by 0.5 and subtracted from 1.", "This calculation results in higher allotment ratio values for states with low PCIs and lower allotment ratio values for states with high PCIs. No state may have an allotment ratio higher than 0.6 or lower than 0.4. Allotment ratios for states with higher or lower calculated ratios are set to either 0.6 or 0.4, respectively.", "Each state's initial allocation is then calculated by adding four quantities based on weighted populations in the three age groups and allotment ratios.", "The first three components of the sum are calculated by multiplying a state's allotment ratio by its population in the given age group, and then dividing the result by the sum of all such products across all the states. That number is then multiplied by the weight corresponding to the particular age group:", "where 0.5 is the weight factor associated with the 15 to 19 population group.", "Correspondingly, the allocations associated with the 20 to 24 and 25 to 65 population groups are calculated as follows:", "where 0.2 is the weight factor associated with the age 20 to 24 population group, and", "where 0.15 is the weight factor associated with the 25 to 65 population group.", "The fourth component of a state's initial allocation, Allocationprop in the above formula, is calculated as that state's proportion of the total funding determined by the sum of the first three formulas. This last component is given a weight of 0.15. As a result, Allocationprop is calculated as follows:", "To recap, the largest proportion (50%) of each state's initial allocation under the Basic State Grants formula is assigned based on the number of persons aged 15 to 19, which is the traditional target population for CTE programs. The inclusion of PCI in the formula helps states with lower PCIs receive a greater share of available funds. Thus, states with lower PCIs and higher numbers of persons aged 15 to 19 will get the highest initial allocations.", "Perkins IV has two different formulas for adjusting state initial allocations. The determination of which formula is used is based on how the total amount of funding available for state grants compares with the amount available in FY2006, which was $1,115,902,206.", "Formula for Funding at FY2006 Level or Lower", "Under Perkins IV, there are actually two formulas that are authorized for use in making state grant allocations. The first formula applies if the total amount of funding available for Basic State Grants is equal to or less than the amount that was available in FY2006. This formula has been used to calculate state allocations each year from FY2007 to FY2016.", "Under this formula, the initial state allocations can be altered to ensure that each state's allocation meets certain minimum state grant provisions. There are three separate possible minimum grant conditions calculated for each state:", "1. 0.5% of the total allocated to states; 2. 150% of a state's prior-year grant; 3. 150% of a state's population aged 15 to 65 multiplied by the national average per pupil payment (NAPPP). The NAPPP is calculated by dividing the total amount allocated to all states by the total national population of persons aged 15 to 65.", "The smallest of these three possible minimum grant amounts is then compared with the state's FY1998 allocation. The larger of these two amounts is then considered the state's minimum grant amount.", "If a state's initial allocation is lower than its minimum grant amount, that state's allocation is increased to equal its minimum grant amount. For any state whose initial allocation exceeds its minimum grant amount, its initial allocation is ratably reduced to ensure that all states have met their minimum grant amounts. If the resulting allocations put some of the states whose allocations were ratably reduced below their minimum grant amounts, then additional ratable reductions can take place until every state has met its minimum grant amount. Figure A-1 summarizes the process of determining state allocations when appropriations are at the FY2006 level or lower.", "Formula for Funding at Higher than FY2006 Level", "A different formula for state allocations of Perkins IV Basic State Grants funds applies when total appropriations are greater than those from FY2006. Under that formula, initial allocations are calculated in the same way as in the formula described in the previous section of this report. Once initial allocations are calculated, state grants are adjusted using only one of the three possible minimum grant rules: the state minimum grant equal to 0.5% of total allocations. Additionally, a special rule is introduced for the distribution of \"new money,\" which is defined as the amount by which the current year's funding available to states exceeds the total funding available to states in FY2006. ", "The formula for state allocations when total funding exceeds FY2006 levels would allot up to one-third of the new money to bring states with allocations below 0.5% of total allocations up to the 0.5% level. The new money would be allotted in such a way that states that are furthest below the 0.5% mark would receive proportionately larger shares of the new money than states that are closer to, but still below, the 0.5% minimum. As a result, none of the states with initial allocations below 0.5% of the total could end up with final allocations above 0.5%. If total appropriations are sufficiently high, then each state should be able to reach the 0.5% minimum allocation.", "The remaining funds\u2014at least two-thirds of the new money and the funds left over from bringing the smaller states up to the 0.5% minimum\u2014would be allocated to the remaining states in proportion to their initial allocations, except that no state, including those at or below the 0.5% minimum, would receive a grant less than its FY1998 allocation.", "Appendix B.
