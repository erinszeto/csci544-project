{"id": "RS22685", "title": "Copyright Protection for Fashion Design: A Legal Analysis of Legislative Proposals", "released_date": "2011-01-04T00:00:00", "summary": ["Fashion design does not currently receive explicit protection under U.S. copyright law. Limited avenues for protection of certain types of apparel designs can be found through trademark and patent law, though proponents of copyright protection for fashion design argue that these limited means are insufficient. The 111th Congress did not pass legislation that would have provided a three-year term of copyright protection for fashion designs, the Design Piracy Prohibition Act (H.R. 2196) and the Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act (S. 3728). This report analyzes these two legislative proposals. The 112th Congress may consider similar legislation regarding fashion design protection.", "The bills resembled each other although contained differences. For example, for a fashion design to receive protection under H.R. 2196, the designer must register the design with the U.S. Copyright Office; S. 3728 contained no such registration requirement. Instead, protection arises under S. 3728 upon the design's creation, although the design must be a sufficiently \"unique, distinguishable, non-trivial and non-utilitarian variation over prior designs for similar types of articles.\" This is a more restrictive definition of \"fashion design\" compared to H.R. 2196.", "Both bills offered copyright protection for the appearance of an article of apparel as well as its ornamentation. They broadly defined the term \"apparel\" to mean the following: clothing (including undergarments, outerwear, gloves, footwear, and headgear), handbags, purses, wallets, tote bags, belts, and eyeglass frames. H.R. 2196 would have denied protection to fashion design that had been embodied in a useful article that was made public by the designer in the United States or a foreign country more than six months before the date of the application for registration. In contrast, S. 3728 would have denied protection if the design was made public prior to the enactment of the bill or more than three years before the date upon which protection of the design is asserted. H.R. 2196 would have required the Register of Copyrights to establish and maintain an electronically searchable database of protected fashion designs; such database must be made available to the public without a fee or other access charge. S. 3728 contained no similar provision.", "Both bills would have prohibited the creation, importation, sale, or distribution of any article whose design has been copied from a protected fashion design (or from an image of it), without the consent of the registered design owner. Such activity would have been considered an infringement of the fashion design owner's rights, and the adjudged infringer would have been subject to damages of the greater of: $250,000 or $5 per copy (under H.R. 2196) or $50,000 or $1 per copy (under S. 3728). H.R. 2196 provided several limitations on infringement liability: (1) if the allegedly infringing article is original and not closely and substantially similar in overall visual appearance to the protected design; (2) if the allegedly infringing article reflects a \"trend\" (defined by the bill as a newly popular concept or idea expressed in a wide variety of designs of apparel that are in immediate demand); or (3) if the allegedly infringing article is the result of independent creation. S. 3728's limitations on liability were slightly different: (1) if the allegedly infringing article is not \"substantially identical\" in overall visual appearance to the original elements of a protected design (that is, the article would not likely be mistaken for the protected design because the article contains non-trivial differences in construction or design); (2) if the article is the result of independent creation; or (3) if a person produces a single copy of a protected design for non-commercial personal use. In addition, both bills expressly stated that an infringing article is not an illustration or picture of a protected design in an advertisement, book, periodical, newspaper, photograph, broadcast, motion picture, or similar medium."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["U.S. copyright law does not protect useful articles, and copyright protection has been denied to fashion designs because clothing garments have traditionally been viewed as useful articles\u2014basic items of necessity having utilitarian value\u2014rather than as artistic creations.

Although useful articles cannot be protected in and of themselves, certain aesthetic or creative aspects of such articles can receive protection. Designs of useful articles can be protected under copyright law \"only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\" Because \"pictorial, graphic, and sculptural\" works are eligible for copyright protection under \u00a7 102 of the Act, protection is permitted for aspects of a utilitarian article that fall into this category and can be physically or conceptually separable from the utilitarian aspects of the article. The U.S. Copyright Office describes this \"separability test\" as an \"extremely limited\" means of protecting the designs of useful articles, as courts have excluded most industrial designs from copyright protection.", "Both the patent and trademark law regimes provide limited means for protecting fashion design. Under the concept of trade dress (part of trademark law), a fashion design can be protected in cases where the product has gained a reputation among consumers as being identifiable with a particular market source. Under patent law, design patents could also be a potential means for protection.

The definition subsection of \u00a7 1301 first explains what makes a design original, and then limits the definition of \"useful article\" to a vessel hull or deck.

Additionally, the term covers handbags, purses, wallets, duffel bags, suitcases, tote bags, belts, and eyeglass frames, rendering these items eligible for protection. However, the bills defined \"fashion design\" differently; S. 3728 mirrored H.R. 2196 's definition but then added several additional qualifications that the design would have to satisfy in order to qualify for protection. H.R. 2196 provided the following definition of \"fashion design\":", "the appearance as a whole of an article of apparel, including its ornamentation, and includes original elements of the article of apparel or the original arrangement or placement of original or non-original elements as incorporated in the overall appearance of the article of apparel.

The three-year term starts from the earlier of the date of publication of the registration or the date the design is first made public. Proponents of legislation to protect fashion design assert that a three-year term is sufficient because its purpose is to protect high end \"haute couture\" designs when they are first sold at expensive prices\u2014a time when the designs could be vulnerable to copies sold at substantially lower prices.

The purpose of including a limited registration period \"is to require prompt registration of protected designs, which gives notice to the world that design protection is claimed.\" Because the entire term of protection for fashion designs is significantly shorter than that for vessel hulls and decks, a shorter window for registration of fashion designs is deemed necessary. The two-year time frame for vessel hull and deck registration would have remained unchanged under the bill.
