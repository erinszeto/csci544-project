Although the CPSC has the authority to issue mandatory consumer product safety rules under some circumstances, in most instances, the CPSA requires the Commission to defer to \"voluntary consumer product safety standards\" that are predominately drafted and developed by private industry. In light of this mandate, the CPSC provides technical assistance and otherwise helps industry groups develop voluntary standards more frequently than it issues mandatory safety standards through rulemakings. Additionally, although the Commission has authority to order companies to engage in various corrective actions, which the CPSC collectively refers to as \"recalls,\" it generally may only exercise this authority after it conducts an administrative hearing on the subject. Furthermore, any entity that is adversely affected by such an order can challenge the action in federal court. Consequently, in most circumstances, the Commission generally attempts to negotiate voluntary actions with companies to correct product hazards upon mutually acceptable terms before initiating an involuntary recall order. ", "Courts have stated that because the CPSA is a \"[r]emedial safety\" law, it \"should be broadly construed to effectuate its purpose.\" Courts have applied this judicial principle when interpreting the term \"consumer product,\" which largely defines the scope of the CSPC's jurisdiction under the CPSA. As is discussed in detail below, the term \"consumer product\" generally covers thousands of products that are manufactured or used for consumer purposes, with the exception of those products that are carved out by statute. The term \"consumer products\" includes products that are manufactured domestically, as well as hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of products that are manufactured outside of the U.S. and imported into the country each year. The CPSC estimates that covered consumer products play a role in over $1 trillion of costs to the country annually in the form of deaths, illnesses, injuries, and property damage.", "Given this broad statutory mandate and the impact consumer products have on the day-to-day lives of the general public, the CPSC has been of perennial interest to Congress.

", "The CPSA has been amended a number of times. As is discussed below, Congress made a number of notable changes to the Commission's rulemaking process via legislation enacted in 1981. The last major legislative amendment to the CPSA occurred in 2008, with the enactment of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). Congress passed the CPSIA, in large part, to respond to what became known as the \"Year of the Recall,\" when millions of consumer products, many of them children's toys imported from China, were recalled in 2007. The CPSIA, among other things, ", "required the CPSC to change several existing voluntary standards into mandatory consumer safety rules utilizing a more streamlined rulemaking process than that with which the Commission must normally comply; required the Commission to create a publicly available and searchable consumer product safety database; and enhanced the CPSC's enforcement powers.", "This report provides a legal overview of the CPSC's structure, jurisdiction, and statutory powers under the CPSA, as amended. First, the report discusses the CPSC's structure and the scope of its jurisdiction and general powers. The report next discusses the CPSC's authority to engage in consumer monitoring, research, and investigations that inform the type of rules the Commission will issue and the enforcement actions it takes. The report then distinguishes between the types of standards the Commission may set, examining its authority to issue mandatory product safety rules and product bans on the one hand, which are seldom issued in practice, and the CPSA's intent that the Commission defer to voluntary, industry-developed safety standards on the other. Finally, the report analyzes the Commission's enforcement powers, including the requirement under the CPSA that companies self-report certain product risks to the Commission; the Commission's ability to inspect products for compliance with the CPSA; the various corrective actions the Commission may either initiate or agree to as part of a negotiation with a company; the Commission's rarely used authority to designate a product an \"Imminently Hazardous Consumer Product\"; and the civil and criminal penalties to which violators of the CPSA may be subject."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CPSC Structure", "paragraphs": ["The CPSC is comprised of a maximum of five commissioners who are appointed by the President, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve seven-year terms.

", "One of the CPSC commissioners is selected by the President, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to be the Commission's Chairman. The Chairman is empowered with the executive and administrative responsibilities of the CPSC, which includes hiring personnel, expending appropriations, and delegating duties among the other commissioners and CPSC staff.", "The Commission has six main offices: Communications; Legislative Affairs; Inspector General; Executive Director; Equal Employment Opportunity and Minority Enterprise; and General Counsel.

Circuit) interpreted the phrase \"any article or component thereof\" of the consumer product definition to mean either \"a distinct article of commerce\" or \"a component part of such a distinct article.\" The language \"for sale to the consumer\" applies to products that are purchased directly by a consumer, while the phrase \"for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer\" encompasses products that a consumer obtains through other means, such as \"through lease, promotional gift, or purchase by an institution for consumer use.\" The D.C. Circuit has explained that, to comport with the phrase \" customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer,\" a product does not have to be primarily sold or distributed to consumers, but those sales or distributions must be more than \"occasional\" and \"there must be a significant marketing of the product as a distinct article of commerce for sale to consumers or for the use of consumers.\"", "Congress expressly carved out a handful of items from the broad definition of consumer product. These items, which are largely outside the scope of the CPSC's jurisdiction, include tobacco and tobacco products; motor vehicles; pesticides; firearms; aircrafts; boats; food; and drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics. Generally, these products are regulated primarily by other federal agencies, and thus likely excluded from the CPSC's jurisdiction to avoid duplicative regulation.", "The CPSC, thus, has jurisdiction over approximately 10,000 types of products from baby strollers, cribs, and bath seats, to cigarette lighters and matchbooks, to lawn mowers, garage door openers, and television antennas, to name a few."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Powers Under the CPSA", "paragraphs": ["The legislative objectives of the CPSA are", "1.

[T]o develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and to minimize conflicting State and local regulations; and", "4. [T]o promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of product-related deaths, illnesses, and injuries.", "To meet these legislative ends, the CPSC is empowered to monitor consumer markets, study and investigate dangers associated with consumer products, and develop safety regulations for the manufacture, sale, and distribution of products. Notably, Congress statutorily requires the CPSC to defer to industry-developed voluntary safety standards and only authorizes the Commission to implement mandatory safety standards through rulemakings under the limited circumstances discussed below. Additionally, the Commission generally relies on manufacturers, distributers, and sellers to take voluntary steps to rectify product defects, voluntary safety standard compliance issues, and mandatory safety rule violations. The Commission will generally only exercise its authority to impose mandatory recalls, product bans, and other corrective measures, and to seek civil and criminal penalties, when expressly mandated by Congress or when the Commission determines voluntary steps are insufficient, product dangers are particularly acute, or safety standard violations are egregious. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consumer Monitoring, Research, & Investigations", "paragraphs": ["One of the primary means by which the Commission addresses its mission of protecting consumers is by monitoring and evaluating deaths, injuries, illnesses, and other harms associated with consumer products. In accordance with the CPSA, the Commission maintains a publicly searchable database\u2014called the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)\u2014of injury reports derived from dozens of emergency rooms across the country. These reports form the basis of a statistically significant sampling of the consumer product-related injuries that occur in the United States and allow the CPSC to estimate the total number of these injuries that occur each year, as well as the societal costs that flow from these injuries. The Commission describes the NEISS as \"the foundation for many CPSC activities,\" as it informs the CPSC's investigations, research, and enforcement and remedial actions discussed further below. ", "In addition, the Commission also contracts with all 50 states and the District of Columbia to receive and track information on accidental deaths connected to consumer products. The Commission purchases and reviews thousands of \"death certificates that have a high probability of consumer product involvement.\" The CSPC distills and disseminates this consumer product injury-related information in its annual reports to Congress. The Commission typically aggregates the death, injury, and societal cost data by age groups and consumer product types. ", "Utilizing this trove of data, the CPSC performs studies, conducts investigations, and engages in other research \"to identify hazardous products and design effective strategies to reduce product hazards.\" In FY2016, for example, the Commission issued reports on consumer harms related to ATVs and carbon monoxide poisonings, studied the impact that exposure to flame retardants and crumb rubber have on human health, and engaged in a number of research activities involving nanotechnology. The CPSA authorizes the Commission, through contracts and grants, to team up with both governmental and nongovernmental entities to advance its research activities, and generally requires the research from these collaborative efforts to be made publicly available, free of charge. This research provides data that can help the CPSC develop measures to detect and eliminate consumer product hazards utilizing its safety standard-setting authorities and enforcement powers, which are discussed in the next two sections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voluntary Safety Standards, Mandatory Safety Rules, & Product Bans", "paragraphs": ["Many of the thousands of consumer products in the CPSC's jurisdiction are subject to either voluntary safety standards developed primarily by private industry, mandatory safety rules issued by the CPSC, or a combination of both. These standards and rules detail labeling, packaging, and performance measures that are designed to promote product conformity and reduce safety risks associated with the use of the products. ", "In a few instances, Congress has expressly required the CPSC to promulgate mandatory consumer safety rules. For example, pursuant to the CPSIA, the Commission promulgated mandatory consumer safety rules for \"durable infant or toddler product[s],\" certain kids' toys, and all-terrain vehicles. Absent such an express legislative mandate, the CPSC, in accordance with amendments made to the CPSA in 1981, is generally required to defer to industry-developed voluntary safety standards. The CPSC is statutorily restricted from issuing mandatory consumer safety rules except in instances in which voluntary standards would not \"eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury\" and where it is unlikely there \"will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards.\" The 1981 amendments to the CPSA also added a number of procedural steps that the Commission must follow in order to issue mandatory consumer safety rules. These rulemaking procedures, which are codified in CPSA Section 2058 and discussed below, arguably enhance CPSC accountability and the procedural rights of interested parties, but also potentially make it more costly, time-consuming, and difficult for the CPSC to promulgate mandatory safety rules. Accordingly, the Commission participates in the development of voluntary standards more frequently than it issues mandatory consumer product safety rules. Nevertheless, because finalizing voluntary standards generally requires building consensus among consumers, industry, and other interested parties, it also is not uncommon for the process to finalize voluntary safety standards to span multiple years. ", "In addition to issuing mandatory safety rules, the CPSC also has authority to promulgate rules that ban products from the stream of commerce if it determines that \"no feasible consumer product safety standard . . . would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product.\" In order to promulgate a rule banning consumer products, the CPSC must follow the rulemaking procedures provided in CPSA Section 2058.

Most of these rules were implemented prior to the 1981 amendments that generally required the Commission to defer to voluntary safety standards and added certain procedural steps to the rulemaking procedures under CPSA Section 2058. Four of the rules were promulgated pursuant to express legislative authorization under the CPSIA to follow the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) that typically apply to federal agency rulemakings, rather than the more arduous procedures of CPSA Section 2058 with which the CPSC usually must comply. ", "CPSA Section 2058 requires the CPSC to take certain procedural steps when issuing rules that go beyond the typical APA notice-and-comment procedures. For example, prior to implementing a mandatory consumer safety rule or product ban, the Commission must issue a detailed \"final regulatory analysis.\" This regulatory analysis requires the Commission to engage in a cost-benefit analysis and assess \"reasonable alternatives\" to the final rule, as well as justify why these alternatives were not adopted. In addition, the Commission must substantiate a number of factual findings. For example, the CPSC must document \"that the rule (including its effective date) is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product,\" \"that the rule imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated,\" and \"that the benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.\" Similarly, the CPSC is permitted to issue a rule banning a product only if \"no feasible consumer product safety standard under this chapter would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product.\"", "The CPSA expressly authorizes any party that is or would be impacted by a mandatory consumer safety rule or product ban to file a lawsuit challenging the rule in a U.S. Court of Appeals. In such cases, courts review the rule in accordance with the APA, under which the court can set aside the rule if it finds that the CPSC acted unlawfully, abused its discretion, or otherwise acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner. The CPSA also provides that neither a product ban nor a \"consumer product safety rule shall [] be affirmed unless the Commission's [final regulatory analysis' factual] findings . . . are supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.\" In addition to setting aside a mandatory safety or product ban rule promulgated by the CPSC, the court may issue other forms of relief to a party challenging such a rule, including ordering the CPSC to cover the prevailing party's attorney's fees.", "The CPSA provides that, when the CPSC issues a consumer product safety or product ban rule, states and localities are generally barred from implementing any other \"safety standard or regulation which prescribes any requirements as to the performance, composition, contents, design, finish, construction, packaging, or labeling of such product which are designed to deal with the same risk of injury.\" However, courts have disagreed over how broadly to interpret this preemption provision in light of the savings clause of CPSA Section 2074, which provides that \"[c]ompliance with consumer product safety rules or other rules or orders under this chapter shall not relieve any person from liability at common law or under State statutory law to any other person.\" One commentator has explained:", "Although a few courts have found state-law claims to be preempted by the CPSA, the majority of the courts have followed the Supreme Court of the United States' decision in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 529 U.S. 861 (2000), in which the Court addressed the dilemma posed by inclusion of an express preemption provision and a savings clause in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and held that the presence of the savings clause prohibits a broad reading of the preemption provision to include common-law claims. In light of the Geier decision, many courts have found that the CPSA forms only a minimum safety standard and that its provisions are not intended to completely replace or preempt state law.", "The CPSA's preemption provisions generally do not apply to voluntary safety standards.", "The CPSA generally requires manufacturers of consumer products that are subject to CPSC-issued rules to have such products tested and certified for \"compli[ance] with all rules, bans, standards, or regulations applicable to the product\" before the products enter the marketplace. Furthermore, the CPSA subjects heightened standards on manufacturers of children's products covered by a CPSC-issued rule.

These voluntary standards are largely developed by private industry \"standards development organizations,\" such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and ASTM International, which generally consist of trade groups, research bodies, consumer advocates, and similar entities. Interested parties typically volunteer to participate in the development of voluntary standards in accordance with the relevant standards development organization's own written policies and procedures. The policies and procedures generally allow for divergent views to be expressed and consensus to develop as to the final safety standards. ", "The CPSC often participates in the development of voluntary safety standards by, for instance, providing standards development organizations recommendations on standards that should be implemented and technical assistance during the standard development process. The CPSC issues semi-annual reports on its involvement in the creation of voluntary standards. The CPSC does not have legal authority to enforce voluntary standards by initiating an enforcement action against entities for failing to comply with voluntary safety standards.

To help identify instances that warrant the exercise of these enforcement powers, the CPSA requires industry to notify the Commission of certain product hazards and authorizes the Commission to conduct compliance inspections of facilities where the consumer products are produced, stored, or distributed. The Commission also works with other federal agencies, as well as state and local governments, to inspect products for compliance with safety standards and corrective actions. To address hazards more quickly, however, the Commission often attempts to negotiate corrective actions on terms agreeable to both the CPSC and the affected companies prior to initiating formal enforcement actions.

A product may also pose a Substantial Product Hazard when a defect in the product \"creates a substantial risk of injury to the public,\" in light of factors such as the severity of the injury it could cause and the quantity of affected products that are in the market. A defect in a consumer product can occur at any stage of commerce\u2014when it was designed, manufactured, finished, or packaged. A product also could be defective due to its labeling, instructions, construction, and contents. The CPSC does not consider a product to be defective simply because it poses the risk of harm to consumers. For example, a hammer is not defective simply because an errant swing could result in a broken finger. Rather, the CPSA and its implementing regulations outline a number of factors that should be weighed by an industry party making a determination of whether a product needs to be reported to the CPSC as a potential Substantial Product Hazard and by the CPSC when making a determination of whether the product actually poses a Substantial Product Hazard. These factors include: the product's usefulness; the product's propensity for and potential severity of harm; the types of individuals who are most likely to be injured by the product (e.g., children, adults); and whether the risks of the product are readily apparent or can be sufficiently diminished through warning labels or instructions.", "Substantial Product Hazard reports should include", "a product description; contact information of all known manufacturers, distributors, importers, and sellers of the product; an explanation of the product's nonconformance with relevant safety standards or other rules; and an explanation of the product's potential dangers.", "With the exception of trade secrets and certain other confidential types of information, the Commission may publicly release information included in these reports, but generally only after giving the manufacturer or other affected party an opportunity to contest the disclosure with the Commission or seek a court order staying the disclosure because it is confidential, inaccurate, or misleading."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance Inspections", "paragraphs": ["The CPSA authorizes the Commission \"to enter [and inspect], at reasonable times, [] any factory, warehouse, or establishment in which consumer products are manufactured or held, in connection with distribution in commerce\" for the purpose of ensuring that regulated products comply with mandatory safety rules, recalls and other corrective actions, and other aspects of the CPSA. The CPSA also authorizes the CPSC to obtain, through the Secretary of the Treasury, \"a reasonable number of samples of consumer products being offered for import\" for inspection. The Commission may request that Secretary of the Treasury deny entry into the country any imported product that fails to comply with a consumer product safety rule, poses a Substantial Product Hazard, or fails to meet various other requirements.", "The CPSC lacks the resources to inspect every one of the millions of consumer products manufactured domestically or imported into the country before these products reach American consumers. As a result, the Commission tends to focus its inspection efforts on foreign products that are imported into the country because they historically are more likely to be subject to corrective actions than products manufactured in the United States. According to a 2014 GAO report, four out of five of CPSC's product recalls in the United States involved an imported product. The CPSC utilizes a risk-based system, called the Risk Assessment Methodology, as well as data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to help the Commission prioritize and select which imported shipments of consumer products to inspect.

Moreover, even when the Commission goes through this administrative process, the CPCS's Substantial Product Hazard determination and ordered corrective action can be challenged in federal court by adversely affected parties.
