As early as 1967, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)argued that debt service payments in many poor nations had reached \"critical situations.\" (2) Since then, and notably in thelast ten years, there has been pressure exerted on national bilateral creditors and multilateral lenders(such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank) by non-governmental organizations(NGOs) and several Western nations for creditors to cancel all debts owed to them by the poorestand least developed countries. In a speech to the United Nations in 2002, UK Chancellor of theExchequer [author name scrubbed] challenged developed nations to help build \"a virtuous circle of debtrelief, poverty reduction and sustainable development for the long term\" for the world's poorestcountries. (3) According toU.S. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow, debt has been \"locking these poorest countries intopoverty and preventing them from using their own resources [for development].\" Requiringrepayment of the debt is, he added, \"morally wrong.\" (4) ", "Much of the recent debt relief momentum has been spurred by the Jubilee (formerly theJubilee 2000) debt campaign. Initially launched in 1996, the Jubilee campaign's mission is toconvince major creditor nations to cancel the unpayable debts of the poorest countries under a fairand transparent process. (5) The international campaign is spearheaded primarily by various Catholic and Protestantorganizations that have had longstanding involvement in debt relief issues and includes numeroushigh-profile supporters such as Sir Bob Geldof, an Irish rock singer and activist, and Bono, leadsinger of the Irish band U2. ", "Debt relief proponents often maintain that poor country debt is illegitimate, or according toBono, \"immoral and unjust.\" (6) This claim rests on the so-called \"odious debt\" argument. Odiousdebt is normally considered to be debt which benefits ruling elites in a borrowing country (throughgraft and corruption) but has little or no benefit for the general population. Debt critics questionwhether successor regimes should be obligated, under international law, to repay money that wasstolen, wasted, or otherwise used in ways having little benefit for their people. Although the odiousdebt concept has gained popularity in the NGO community, it has not been endorsed by anyinternational legal or financial body. Moreover, there is almost no likelihood that debts incurredthrough World Bank or IMF projects could be legally determined to be odious, since they wereundertaken for nominally development-related projects. Nonetheless, many agree that high levelsof debt are a major burden for the poorest countries and that any effort to promote economic growthand reduce poverty needs to address the HIPC debt burden.", "The poor country debt burden is indeed staggering. For the 38 International DevelopmentAssociation (IDA) (7) countries that have been designated as the most Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, total external debtrose from $19.7 billion in 1975 to a peak of $222 billion in 1995, a major increase over otherdeveloping countries. (8) Table 1 compares debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for three tiers of poorcountries: HIPCs, other IDA countries, and other lower middle income countries. (9) (See Appendix 1 forinformation on the World Bank debt and poverty classification systems.)", " Table 1. External Debt as a Percentage of GDP (PeriodAverage)", "Source: World Bank.", "In the 1980s and early 1990s, as the debts of the poorest countries increased rapidly comparedto other low-income countries, several debt relief efforts were introduced. In 1988, a group of majorcreditor nations, known as the Paris Club, (10) agreed for the first time to cancel debts owed to them instead ofrefinancing them on easier terms as they had done until then. ", "In 1996, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the regional developmentbanks agreed to allow a portion of debts owed to them to be cancelled as well, and created the DebtRelief Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). At the meeting of the G8 financeministers on June 11, 2005, member nations extended debt relief and committed themselves tocancelling permanently all remaining multilateral HIPC external debt, providing up to $55 billionin additional debt relief. According to the proposal, the 18 countries that have completed the HIPCprogram would receive immediate debt relief (worth $40 billion at face value). Countries that arein the middle of the program, or have not yet begun, would receive total debt relief upon completionof the program. If the remaining 20 countries complete the HIPC program, total debt relief couldexceed $55 billion.", "There are several root causes of the HIPC debt burden. A 1999 IMF study concluded thatthe rise in HIPC debt had its origins in weak macroeconomic policies, a lack of economic structuralreform, and poor debt management practices on the part of debt-stressed countries, as well as adversetrade shocks and political factors such as war, famine, and social strife. (11) The debt problem wascompounded by the willingness of creditor nations and multilateral institutions to provide loans andaccept risks that the private sector would not. William Easterly, formerly a World Bank economistand currently a professor at New York University, points out that between 1979 and 1997, the IMFand World Bank provided more financing to HIPCs than other countries of their income level,despite HIPC countries' often poor economic policies. (12) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Economic Debate over Debt Relief", "paragraphs": ["Among economists, the likely success of debt relief in spurring meaningful economic reformor make substantial inroads against poverty is often questioned. Critics maintain that money to funddebt relief must be transferred from other resources and there is a risk that donors will take all orsome of these resources from other parts of their foreign assistance budgets. If this occurs, overallresources for promoting development may not increase, or may increase by less than the amount ofdebt relief provided. Moreover, many analysts argue that there are foreign aid activities, such asadditional investments in the legal, financial, education, or public health systems that may have agreater impact on promoting economic growth and providing resources for poverty reductionactivities than debt relief. A second problem is determining whether the actual debt load is itself sobig as to impede growth and development. Advocates of debt relief argue that such a \"debtoverhang\" must be relieved if a country is to resume growth.", "Debt Overhang: Theory. Most debt relief isgrounded in the \"debt overhang\" theory which holds that the accumulation of a large stock of debtwill frighten off potential lenders and investors. It originated in the 1980s and was based on thelargely positive economic growth that several heavily indebted countries experienced following a1989 debt relief initiative known as the \"Brady Plan,\" named after then-U.S. Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady. (13) Thetheory suggests that if investors expect a country's debt level to impair its ability to repay its loans,they will not invest out of a concern that the government may resort to distortionary measures, suchas expanding the money supply (which promotes inflation) or raising taxes on their profits to financedebt payments. (14) Evenif the debt is not being serviced, the theory suggests that it is still an impediment to economic growthbecause of the effect the large debt stock has dissuading private investors. ", "When a large stock of external debt is present, creditor countries could continue to lend atconcessional rates in the hope that continued aid will spur economic growth and that the recipientcountry will one day be able to repay its debts. According to the debt overhang theory, however, itis better to forgive the debts, either entirely or to some reduced \"sustainable\" level so that investorconfidence will be restored. It is presumed that at a \"sustainable\" level debtor nations would be ableto make some debt payments to their creditors without sacrificing economic growth. ", "Debt Overhang: Evidence. A 2002 study of 93developing countries between 1969 and 1998, and a follow-up study of 61 countries over the sametime period, were cited as strong support for the debt-overhang theory. The first study found thatexternal debt began to have a negative impact on growth when its net present value (15) exceeded 160% to 170%of exports and 35% to 40% of GDP. Study simulations suggest that doubling the average stock ofexternal debt in these countries would slow down annual per capita growth by \u00c2\u00bd% to 1%. Thesecond study found that doubling a country's average external debt level would reduce growth ofboth per capita physical capital and productivity by almost 1%. The studies concluded that largedebt stocks negatively affect growth by slowing both the accumulation of physical capital andproductivity, often at the expense of investment. (16) ", "Although the debt overhang theory may be true in general, several new studies have arguedthat it does not hold for HIPC countries. One study points to two key differences between the Bradyand HIPC countries. (17) In contrast to the Brady countries, there never was a significant amount of private investment in theHIPC countries, and the HIPC countries have never suffered a negative net flow of resources becauseinflows of foreign aid are typically more than sufficient to cover debt payments. (18) Moreover, debt relief thatthe HIPC countries have received has not been sufficient to allow them access to private sector creditmarkets. ", "Thus, rather than a debt overhang, some argue that lack of institutional capacity (legal,political, educational, health, etc.) are the HIPCs' major impediments to economic growth, and thatin the absence of additional funds dedicated for debt relief, other forms of targeted assistance maybe more effective in boosting economic growth than debt relief. If the economies of countries grew,they argue, the debt would not be a problem. Instead of forgiving debts, creditor nations may be ableto help the poorest countries by helping to improve their domestic institutions, expand their exportsectors, and by providing greater market access for their goods.

One is through legislation enacted byCongress granting authority to the President to cancel country debt obligations. (19) The second is throughthe Paris Club. The Paris Club is the major forum where creditor countries renegotiate official sectordebts. By definition, 'Official sector' debts are those that have been either issued, insured, orguaranteed by creditor governments. A Paris Club 'treatment' refers to either a reduction and/orrenegotiation of a developing country's Paris Club debts. The Paris Club includes the United Statesand 18 other permanent members, the major international creditor governments. Besides the UnitedStates, the permanent membership is composed of Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden,Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The London Club, a parallel,informal group of private firms, meets in London to renegotiate commercial bank debt. Unlike theParis Club, there is no permanent London Club membership. At a debtor nations request, a LondonClub meeting of its creditors may be formed, and the Club is subsequently dissolved after arestructuring is in place. ", "The Paris Club does not exist as a formal institution. It is rather a set of rules and principlesfor debt relief that have been agreed on by its members. Five 'principles' and four 'rules' currentlygovern Paris Club treatments. Any country that accepts the rules and principles may, in principle,become a member of the Paris Club. Yet since the Paris Club permanent members are the majorinternational creditor countries, they determine its practices. ", "The five Paris Club 'principles' stipulate the general terms of all Paris Club treatments. Theyare: (1) Paris Club decisions are made on a case-by-case basis; (2) all decisions are reached by full consensus among creditor nations; (3) debt renegotiations are applied only for countries that clearlyneed debt relief, as evidenced by implementing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) program andits requisite economic policy conditionality ; (4) solidarity is required in that all creditors willimplement the terms agreed in the context of the renegotiations; and (5) the Paris Club preserves the comparability of treatment between different creditors. This means that a debtor country cannotgrant to another creditor a treatment on more favorable terms than the consensus reached for ParisClub members. (20) ", "While Paris Club 'principles' are general in nature, its 'rules' specify the technical details ofParis Club treatments. The 'rules' detail (1) the types of debt covered -- Paris Club arrangementscover only medium and long-term public sector debt and credits issued prior to a specified\"cut-off\"date; (2) the flow and stock treatment; (21) (3) the payment terms resulting from Paris Club agreements; and(4) provisions for debt swaps.

Creditor countries thatparticipate in the negotiation sign a so-called 'Agreed Minute.' The Agreed Minute recommends thatcreditor nations collectively sign bilateral agreements with the debtor nation, giving effect to themultilateral Paris Club agreement.", "Prior to U.S. involvement, Paris Club members began providing outright debt cancellationin 1988. Previously, debt treatments involved rescheduling of debts on increasingly concessionalterms. At the 1988 Toronto meeting of G7 finance ministers, it was agreed that Paris Club memberswould extend to some countries up to one-third forgiveness of their bilateral debts.

Of this, the United States reportedly agreed to pay up to $1.75 billion over the next tenyears in compensation to the development banks over the next ten years to fund the debt relief.

(48) ", "Reaction from poor countries not included in the debt deal was critical. Many have longargued that debt relief benefits countries that have poor economic performance and that are lesswilling to service their debts than other developing countries. Some countries, such as Kenya, areineligible for debt relief, yet suffer from many of the same economic constraints as many HIPCcountries and are servicing their debts. \"Those faithful in servicing their debt like Kenya are beingignored while HIPCs who have failed to service the debt are getting more attention. This is not goodfor Africa,\" asserted Kenyan Planning and National Development Minister Peter AnyangNyongo.

According to Mr. Rato, although InternationalMonetary Fund member countries are committed to canceling debts of the world's poorest nations,debt relief should be carefully designed and implemented. He stressed that there is a \"clearconsensus\" among IMF directors that writing off the debt should not affect the fund's ability tocontinue to lend to poor countries. (50) Mr. Wolfowitz has also voiced support for the proposal. (51) However, several WorldBank concerns with the proposal were reported in the press.

Decision pointand pre-decision point countries would be eligible for 100% debt cancellation upon their completionof the HIPC program. Key features of the agreement are: ", "World Bank and AfDB debt cancelled under the proposal will be deductedfrom gross country allocations and redistributed among all available countries. ", "The amount of the redistributed assistance that the 18 completion pointcountries receive will depend on how they compare with other World Bank or AfDB countries. Thatthey meet the economic targets to reach completion point should serve as assurance that they willreceive some portion of the redistributed assistance under the proposal.

Additional funds would bemade available immediately to cover the full costs during the next three years , covering currentreplenishment periods.

Reportedly, the intention is to finance the U.S. share of IDA and AfDF debt relief byearly encashment of regular U.S. appropriated contributions. (53) Early encashment is theimmediate disbursement of appropriated funds that are normally disbursed over a given period oftime. This means that either more contributions will be asked for later to replace funds used by earlyencashment or IDA aid will shrink in the future unless higher contribution levels are appropriated. Donors also committed to finance debt relief for any new countries that enter the HIPC program,either among the nine countries that have not yet reached the decision point, or any new countriesthat the program accepts. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Since the proposal was released, several critiques of it have been published by various debtrelief-related NGOs. (54) Four potential areas of concern are: ", "No Net Resource Gain. The proposed agreementspecifies that HIPC countries that receive debt reduction will have their gross assistance flowsreduced by the amount of debt forgiven. Many would prefer that any debt relief be additional tocurrent assistance. This is based on the belief, which is supported by some, that according to recentresearch, one-for-one changes in debt service payments and official aid flows have no net effect oneconomic growth. In this view, any potential economic growth due to the increased resourcesprovided by debt relief may be negated by a decrease in total net assistance. (55) ", "Limited Debt Cancellation. As proposed, theagreement only covers one regional development bank, the African Development Bank. Althoughthe majority of HIPC countries are African, several are not, and many owe debt to the other regionalbanks, such as the Inter-American Development Bank or the Asian Development Bank. There arealso many smaller sub-regional development banks to which the HIPCs are indebted.", "Multilateral Development Bank Compensation is NotGuaranteed. The proposed agreement to compensate the IFIs only covers the nextthree years, through the completion of the most recent replenishments of the World Bank and theAfrican Development Bank's concessional lending facilities. Future assistance to the developmentbanks, compensating them for their debt relief, is not assured. The agreement states that \"donors willcommit to cover the full costs for the duration of the cancelled loans, by making contributionsadditional to regular replenishments\" (emphasis added). However, there is no regular replenishmentamount for either institution. Every three years, donor nations meet and decide how much to fundthe institutions' concessional lending facilities. Since there is no baseline level of assistance, it maybe impossible to know if the funds for debt relief are additional to the amount of funding that themultilateral development banks would normally receive. ", "The World Bank has expressed two additional concerns over the proposed debt relief terms.These are contained in an internal World Bank presentation that was leaked to the press. (56) First, although the WorldBank will write off the debt owed it immediately, promised donor contributions to cover the cost ofthis debt relief will be spread out over the next decade. Since the agreement includes no bindingfuture commitment to cover donor contributions during this period, the World Bank is concernedthat donor countries may not be committed to compensating the World Bank for all of the debtpayments it would have received from the debt relief recipients. Second, many concessional loansfrom the development banks have terms lasting up to forty years but the proposal only specifiesrepayment of lost debt payments for ten years. Theoretically, the Bank would lose 30 years' worthof repayments under the proposal. ", "In response, the World Bank has suggested donor countries either make legal commitmentsnow for the extra money needed to finance the debt relief or allow creditor countries to receive debtrelief over time by relieving payments as they come due rather than wiping out the entire stock ofdebt immediately. This would have the same effect on net flows to debt relief recipients without theWorld Bank assuming a potentially unfunded liability by cancelling all debts owed to it immediately. For the United States, making a legal commitment to finance additional debt relief would requirecongressional action.", "Future Cost May Rise. Depending on whichcountries are added, the cost of HIPC may increase. When the HIPC program was designed in 1996,a two-year sunset clause was included to limit the countries eligible for debt relief to those that havereached decision point as well as to prevent HIPC from becoming a permanent facility. Since then,the sunset clause has been repeatedly extended. In September 2004, the World Bank and IMFBoards agreed again to extend the sunset clause by two years, through 2006. (57) The Boards also extendedthe sunset clause to IDA-only and PRGF-eligible countries that have not yet benefitted from HIPCrelief. ", "In April 2006, the World Bank released a list of eleven countries that currently meet theHIPC income and indebtedness criteria and may wish to be considered for HIPC debt relief. The listincludes seven countries previously identified as HIPCs (Central African Republic, Comoros, Coted'Ivoire, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, and Togo) and four new countries (Eritrea, Haiti, the KyrgyzRepublic, and Nepal). Three additional countries, Bhutan, Lao PDR, and Sri Lanka, also meet theHIPC criteria but do not wish to partake in the initiative. If HIPC debt relief is provided to all elevencountries, the total cost is estimated at $21 billion, broken up among various creditors. The cost tobilateral Paris creditors is estimated at $10.2 billion, while the cost to the IMF and the World Bankwould be $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion respectively. (58) ", "Several analysts have proposed extending the HIPC program to countries eligible for grantassistance from the World Bank. In November 2004, the World Bank created a framework to assessthe level of debt burden necessary to qualify for 100 % grant assistance instead of loans. (59) Under the new \"debtdistress\" framework, 47 countries are projected to receive grant financing, 42 of which will receive100% of their IDA assistance in grants. The 47 countries eligible for grant assistance include 29HIPC and 18 non-HIPC countries. According to one analyst, the debt burden of these 18 countriesis comparable to those receiving HIPC assistance and they may be worthy of receiving debt reliefunder HIPC. This would mean an 18-country increase in the size of the HIPC program, and increasethe amount of debt relief provided by an additional $31.8 billion in nominal debt relief.
