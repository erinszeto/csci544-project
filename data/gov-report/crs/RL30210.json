Throughout the 1990s, the Congress andAdministration have debated about whether military construction funding andlong-term planning are adequate. Members of Congress have complained that poorplanning and insufficient funding on the Pentagon's part has made it difficult for theCongress to insure that added military construction projects meet pressing priorities.", "The Department of Defense uses a formal process called the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) to create its budget for Congress. (5) ThePPBS process is also used to prepare DOD's internal, long-term financial plan. Thelong-term plan extends over a six-year period and is known as the Future YearsDefense Plan (FYDP). In the 1990s, Congress has criticized the Pentagon'slong-term planning for military construction.", "In hearings on the FY2000 military construction request, legislators expressedcontinuing concern over military construction planning and the sufficiency offunding. Rep. Joel Hefley, Chair of the Military Installations and FacilitiesSubcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee argued at a hearing onMarch 16, 1999 that the FY2000 budget request -- like the previous FY1997-99requests -- continues the poor planning and downward trend for military constructionbudgets. For the FY1997-2000 military construction requests, the Administrationrequested fewer funds than it had programmed in its budget assumptions in theprevious years' FYDP. This mismatch between plans and funding was cited in thecongressional criticism of the Pentagon's military construction planning. SinceFYDP and requested amount decreases each year for military construction, Mr.Hefley states that he is finding it difficult to take Pentagon future plans for militaryconstruction seriously. That sentiment was echoed by the Senate AppropriationsMilitary Construction Subcommittee chair -- Sen. Conrad Burns -- who expresseddismay at the lack of long-term planning seen in the FY2000 military constructionproposal.", "Implementation of the Privatization of Military Family Housing Initiative. In testimony to the House ArmedServices Committee on March 9, 1999, Randall Yim -- Acting Deputy UnderSecretary of Defense (Installations) described the continuing problem of militaryfamily housing. He stated that approximately two-thirds of DOD's nearly 300,000family housing units need extensive renovation or replacement. Yim also testifiedthat fixing this problem using only traditional military construction methods wouldtake 30 years and cost as much as $16 billion. ", "Recognizing the severity of this problem four years ago, Congress passed theMilitary Housing Privatization Initiative in the FY1996 Defense Authorization Act( P.L. 104-106 ). This gave the Pentagon new authorities to obtain private sectorfinancing and expertise for military housing. The authorities are:", "guarantees, both loan and rental;", "conveyance or lease of existing property andfacilities;", "differential lease payments;", "investments, both limited partnerships and stock/bondownership; and", "direct loans.", "The legislation enables the new authorities to be used individually, or in combination. (6) The Department of Defense's HousingRevitalization Support Office(HRSO) is coordinating the implementation of the new authorities for each of theServices (7) . HRSO is staffed with 16 full-time housingand real estate experts fromeach of the Services and the Office of Secretary of Defense, along with consultantsupport. The Pentagon estimates that with these authorities, defense dollars can beleveraged to build three times the amount of housing units financed the traditionalway. ", "New policies and procedures in the Services and DOD were needed to implement the privatization initiative. A new mind-set of how to work withcommercial real-estate practices and practitioners had to be formed. For example,Office of Management and Budget had to determine rules (approved in June 1997)to account for government obligations with each of the authorities. Also, thePentagon needed to develop loan and loan guarantee concepts into actual documentsthat the private financial community would trust for investment grade financing,which took some time.", "Progress with the privatization initiative has been slow. Rep. Joel Hefley, Chair of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee of the House ArmedServices Committee stated in a March 9, 1999 hearing that the Congress has beendisappointed in the pace of privatization implementation, especially as the expirationdate of February 10, 2001 (for the five-year test period of these authorities)approaches.", "The General Accounting Office (GAO) highlighted some concerns with the privatization initiative when it reviewed DOD's military housing situation in July1998. (8) Initial evaluation of life-cycle costs ofprivatized housing versus traditionalmilitary housing showed a potential savings of only about 10% or less. The proposedlong-term time horizons for some privatization projects of 50 years or more broughtup concerns that the housing might be not needed in the that far into future. Also, theGAO pointed out the continuing weakness in the Pentagon planning for militaryhousing. GAO stated that housing requirements are not integrated with particularfacilities and community needs, that the plans underutilize the use of local housingand that there is poor communication between offices responsible for housingallowances and military housing construction. GAO recommended thatcomprehensive, better integrated plans could help maximize the privatizationinitiative while minimizing total housing costs.", "Rep. Hefley also raised a serious policy issue in the Pentagon's current approachto the implementation of its military family housing privatization program. Heexpressed concern that the military departments -- particularly in the Army and theNavy -- were placing virtually all of their hopes for improving military familyhousing on privatization without being certain that it would work in all locations. Rep. Hefley pointed out that privatization was only one tool, along with regularmilitary construction funds, which could ameliorate family housing problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History and Context", "paragraphs": ["The Funding Pattern for Military Construction Budgets. In recent years, the Congress has added significantamounts to annual Administration military construction budget requests. This hasbeen a recurring pattern in the 1990s. The President proposes what the Congresscalls an inadequate military construction budget, especially for Guard and Reserveneeds. The Congress then adds funding for military construction, with someattention to Guard and Reserve projects. For example, Congress added $479 millionin FY1996, $850 million in FY1997, $800 million in FY1998 and $875 million inFY1999 to the military construction accounts. ", "Congressional additions to the military construction budget have been common and controversial throughout the 1990s. Three themes explain the pattern ofrecurring congressional additions. First, some members of the military constructionsubcommittees have believed that military construction has been chronicallyunderfunded. This theme was echoed in recent hearings on the FY2000 budget andthe FY1999 and FY1998 reports from the House Appropriations Committee and thedefense authorizing committees. Second, often Congress has different priorities thanthe Administration, as reflected in frequent congressional cuts to overseasconstruction requests and contributions to the NATO Security Investment Program. Third, other Members of Congress, as Senator Bond commented during the floordebate on FY1996 military construction appropriations, believe that the Pentagoncounts on Congress to add money to Guard and Reserve programs. In recent years,Congress has added large amounts for National Guard and Reserve constructionprojects, including a peak amount of $401.8 million in FY1995. (See Table 4.) ", "Debate over congressional additions to the military construction budget involves several overlapping issues. Military construction proponents, including facilityadvocates in the military services, argue that military facilities have beensystematically underfunded for many years -- even, some say, in the midst of thebuildup of the early- to mid-1980s. This line of argument was prominent duringHouse Appropriations Committee mark-up of the FY1996 military construction bill. Some complained that the funding level was up 28% from the prior year, while othersdefended the increase as necessary to make up for previous shortfalls in funding fornew construction and maintenance. The FY1996 enacted amount for militaryconstruction peaked that year at $11.2 billion. The House report on the FY1997 bill( H.Rept. 104-591 ) cited a DOD backlog of deferred maintenance and repair forfamily housing alone that totaled over $4.5 billion dollars. ", "DOD facility managers have not met their goal to allocate 3% of the plant replacement value of DOD facilities for annual construction and maintenance (calledreal property maintenance at the Pentagon). Although this 3% goal is below theaverage for public facilities nationwide, actual DOD funding has typically run at 1to 2% of plant replacement value. For example, the Air Force testified on March 16,1999 to the House Armed Services Subcommittee for Military Installations andFacilities that the Air Force could budget only 1% for real property maintenance. This is why facility proponents welcome any congressional additions.", "Finally, congressional military construction subcommittees -- authorization as well as appropriations subcommittees -- have frequently taken issue withAdministration military construction priorities. In the early 1990s, for example, thecommittees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas -- on thegrounds that troop levels abroad should be reduced and that allied burden-sharingcontributions should increase -- and reallocated the funds to domestic projects. Inaddition, congressional committees have added unrequested funds for quality of lifeimprovements, such as day care centers and barracks renovation. The Congress hasargued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor ofwarfighting investments.", "The Debate Over Added Projects. Since the Congress has added significant amounts to military construction budgetsover the last 10 years, congressional debate has centered on how to prioritize worthyadditional projects.", "In 1994, the Senate debate on the military construction appropriations bill focused the amount of congressional additions to the request despite constraints onoverall defense spending. Senator McCain, in particular, objected to the provisionof substantial amounts for projects that the Administration had not requested. Heargued that such projects largely represented \"pork barrel\" spending, and came at theexpense of higher priority defense programs. In Senate floor consideration of themilitary construction bill that year, the managers accepted a McCain amendment thatcalled for criteria to be applied to additional projects. His amendment included aprovision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical yetunbudgeted projects. The McCain amendment was not incorporated into the finalconference version of the bill, however, and the conference agreement provided over$900 million for unrequested construction projects.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 ( P.L. 103-337 ), however, incorporated Senator McCain's criteria as a \"Sense of the Senate\" provision, (9) providing that the unrequested projects should be:", "1. essential to the DOD's national security mission, ", "2. not inconsistent with the Base Realignment and Closure Act,", "3. in the services' Future Years Defense Plan (see above),", "4. executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated, and", "5. offset by reductions in other defense accounts, through advice from theSecretary of Defense.", "Since the 104th Congress, the House military construction authorizing and appropriations committees have also used similar criteria, in collaboration with thePentagon, to add projects to the military construction budget. Each potential projectneeds to pass the following criteria, similar to the McCain criteria: Is the projectessential to the DOD mission, consistent with BRAC plans, in the Future YearsDefense Plan and \"executable\" in the coming fiscal year? If the project can meetthose criteria, the military construction authorizing and appropriations committeesmay add the project. ", "Debate over congressionally-added projects continues. In debate on the FY1999 military construction appropriations conference report, Senator McCain continuedto discuss projects added by Congress. He noted that the Congress added 148domestic projects in all, at a cost of nearly $977 million.
