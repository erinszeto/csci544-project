Young adults and teenagers may find their parents' prescription drugs in unsecured medicine cabinets or other obvious locations in the home, or they may retrieve expired or unwanted medication from the trash. It is believed that properly disposing of unwanted medications would help prevent prescription drug abuse by reducing the accessibility and availability of such drugs. Yet throwing prescription medications into the trash or flushing them down the toilet may not be environmentally desirable. In response, many local communities and states have implemented pharmaceutical disposal programs (often referred to as drug \"take-back\" programs) that collect unused and unwanted medications from patients for incineration or other method of destruction that complies with federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to public health and the environment.", "Prescription drugs may be categorized as either controlled substance medication or non-controlled substance medication. Pharmaceutical controlled substances, such as narcotic pain relievers OxyContin\u00ae and Vicodin\u00ae, are among the most commonly abused prescription drugs. However, community take-back programs usually only accept non-controlled substance medication, in compliance with the federal Controlled Substances Act. This statute comprehensively governs all distributions of controlled substances, and it currently does not allow for a patient to transfer a controlled substance to another entity for any purpose, including disposal of the drug. (Federal regulations provide a limited exception to this general prohibition\u2014local law enforcement may obtain a waiver from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to collect unused controlled substances from patients and destroy them.) As a consequence, patients seeking to reduce the amount of unwanted controlled substances in their possession have few alternative disposal options beyond discarding or flushing them.", "The 111th Congress has considered legislation that would create a legal framework governing disposal of controlled substances that have been dispensed to patients. On October 12, 2010, President Obama signed the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (S. 3397) into law (P.L. 111-273). P.L. 111-273 amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow a patient to deliver controlled substances to an entity that is authorized by federal law to dispose of them, providing that such disposal occurs in accordance with regulations issued by the Attorney General to prevent diversion of controlled substances. The Attorney General is required, in developing those regulations, to take into consideration the public health and safety, as well as the ease and cost of drug disposal program implementation and participation by various communities. Also, P.L. 111-273 gives the Attorney General discretion to issue regulations that authorize long-term care facilities to dispose of controlled substances on behalf of patients who reside in those facilities.", "Other related bills in the 111th Congress include the Safe Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (H.R. 5809), the Safe Drug Disposal Act of 2009 (H.R. 1191, S. 1336), the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2009 (H.R. 1359, S. 1292), and the Safe Prescription Drug Disposal and Education Act (H.R. 5925)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Prescription drug abuse is the second-most common form of illicit drug abuse among teenagers in the United States, trailing only marijuana use. The director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), R. Gil Kerlikowske, has called prescription drug abuse \"the fastest-growing drug problem in the United States\" and \"a serious public health concern.\" Controlled substances, such as the narcotic pain relievers OxyContin\u00ae and Vicodin\u00ae, are among the most often abused prescription drugs. Young adults and teenagers may have easy access to prescription drugs via their parents' medicine cabinets, from their friends or relatives, or they may retrieve expired or unwanted medication from the trash. A possible approach to addressing the prescription drug abuse problem is to reduce the availability of such drugs by patients disposing of unwanted medications that have been accumulating in their homes. Yet throwing prescription medications into the trash, flushing them down the toilet, or pouring them down a sink or drain\u2014such that they end up in solid waste landfills or wastewater treatment systems\u2014may have undesirable environmental consequences. As Director Kerlikowske testified before Congress,", "These drugs are dispensed for legitimate purposes and too often, the public's perception is that they are safe for uses other than those for which they are prescribed. We must change public perception so the societal norm shifts to one where unused or expired medications are disposed of in a timely, safe, and environmentally responsible manner. We envision a future where disposal of these medications is second-nature to most Americans, in much the same way as proper and responsible recycling of aluminum cans has become. Creating a method of disposal of expired or unused prescription drugs is essential to public health, public safety, and the environment.", "Some local and state government agencies and grassroots organizations have established drug disposal programs (often referred to as pharmaceutical \"take-back\" programs) to facilitate the collection of unused, unwanted, or expired medications for incineration or other method of destruction that complies with federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to public health and the environment. There are several different types of take-back programs, including the following: permanent locations where unused prescription drugs are collected; special one-day events in which patients can drop off unwanted drugs at pharmacies or hazardous waste collection sites; and mail-in/ship-back programs. One of the action items set forth in the ONDCP's 2010 National Drug Control Strategy calls for an increase in the creation and operation of take-back programs in communities around the country to address the pharmaceutical abuse problem.", "However, these take-back programs often exclude controlled substance medications because federal law currently does not allow for a patient to deliver a controlled substance to another entity for disposal purposes, unless local law enforcement has obtained a waiver from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to take custody of the unused controlled substances from patients and destroy them. As a consequence, those seeking to reduce the amount of unwanted controlled substances in their households have few alternative disposal options beyond discarding or flushing them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Federal Guidelines on Proper Disposal of Prescription Drugs", "paragraphs": ["The ONDCP has issued the following recommendations regarding disposing of expired or unused prescription medications in such a way that makes it difficult for the drugs to be easily retrieved:", "This consumer guidance was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA also maintains a list of less than 30 medicines that the agency recommends patients flush down the sink or toilet if they wish to dispose of them, although the agency is careful to note that \"disposal by flushing is not recommended for the vast majority of medicines.\" The FDA warns that the particular medications on its list, if taken accidentally by children, pets, or anyone for whom they were not prescribed, could cause harmful health effects including breathing difficulties, heart problems, or even death. Thus, in the FDA's view, flushing serves not only to deter illegal drug abuse, but also to reduce the danger of unintentional use of these medicines. In support of flushing certain medicines down the toilet or sink, the FDA has addressed concerns over whether such action poses a risk to human health and the environment:", "We are aware of recent reports that have noted trace amounts of medicines in the water system. The majority of medicines found in the water system are a result of the body's natural routes of drug elimination (in urine or feces). Scientists, to date, have found no evidence of harmful effects to human health from medicines in the environment. ", "Disposal of these select, few medicines by flushing contributes only a small fraction of the total amount medicine found in the water. FDA believes that any potential risk to people and the environment from flushing this small, select list of medicines is outweighed by the real possibility of life-threatening risks from accidental ingestion of these medicines.", "In addition to the ONDCP and FDA recommendations described above, a public-private collaboration between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the American Pharmacists Association, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America has produced a national campaign called \"SMARxT DISPOSAL\u2122,\" to provide information regarding the safe disposal of medication and to raise public awareness about the possible environmental impacts from improper disposal of drugs. The advice disseminated under the SMARxT DISPOSAL\u2122 campaign regarding unused medication disposal is substantially similar to that offered by the ONDCP and FDA.", "While the federal guidelines encourage consumers to utilize community pharmaceutical drug take-back programs, the current legal restrictions on collecting controlled substances necessarily limit many programs. In January 2009, in response to the concerns raised about these impediments, the DEA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice, requested public comments in advance of a proposed rulemaking to permit the disposal of dispensed controlled substances in a manner that is consistent with the federal Controlled Substances Act. As of the date of this report, the DEA has not yet promulgated a regulation concerning this matter. However, the DEA has recently explained in testimony before Congress that it cannot move forward with the regulatory proposal in the absence of legislation that provides the agency with the necessary statutory authority to fully implement it.", "This report presents an overview of the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations that relate to patient disposal of unwanted prescription medication, as well as describes legislation introduced in the 111 th Congress that would amend federal law to provide for more accessible methods of secure and environmentally responsible disposal of dispensed controlled substances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Controlled Substances Act", "paragraphs": ["The vast majority of prescription drugs are not controlled substances and therefore are not regulated under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, commonly referred to as the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). However, some prescription drugs\u2014in particular those most susceptible to abuse such as narcotics and opiates that are often used in the treatment of pain \u2014come within the purview of the CSA because they have a greater potential for abuse than other prescription drugs and may lead to physical and psychological dependence. Enacted in 1970, the CSA is designed to regulate and facilitate the use of controlled substances for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes and to prevent these substances from being diverted for illegal purposes. By delegation from the U.S. Attorney General, the DEA is responsible for administering and enforcing the CSA and its implementing regulations. ", "The CSA assigns various plants, drugs, and chemicals to one of five schedules, ranging from Schedule I, which contains substances (such as heroin) that have no currently accepted medical use in treatment and cannot be dispensed under a prescription, to Schedules II, III, IV, and V, which include substances that have recognized medical uses and may be manufactured, distributed, and used in accordance with the CSA. The order of the schedules reflects substances that are progressively less dangerous and addictive. Schedule II narcotics include the drugs morphine, codeine, and OxyContin\u00ae. Schedule III substances include Vicodin\u00ae and anabolic steroids, while Schedule IV includes Xanax\u00ae and Valium\u00ae.

A prescription for a controlled substance may be issued only for a \"legitimate medical purpose\" by a physician \"acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\" The CSA authorizes the DEA Administrator to suspend or revoke a physician's prescription privileges upon a finding that the physician has \"committed such acts as would render his registration ... inconsistent with the public interest.\" In determining the public interest, the DEA Administrator is required to consider the following factors:", "the recommendation of the appropriate state licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; the applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances; the applicant's conviction record under federal or state laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; compliance with applicable state, federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances; and such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CSA Regulatory Scheme", "paragraphs": ["The regulatory structure of the CSA creates a \"closed system\" in which distribution of controlled substances may lawfully occur among registered handlers. The CSA places several regulatory requirements upon legitimate handlers of controlled substances, including registration, providing effective security, recordkeeping, and reporting. Every person who manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, or exports any controlled substance, or who proposes to engage in the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, importation, or exportation of any controlled substance, must obtain a registration issued by the DEA (unless exempt). Manufacturers and distributers of controlled substances must register annually, and those who dispense controlled substances must obtain registrations that may not be issued for less than one year or more than three years. Registrations specify the extent to which registrants are authorized to manufacture, possess, distribute, or dispense controlled substances. All registrants must provide \"effective controls and procedures\" to prevent the theft or diversion of the controlled substances in their possession. In addition, the CSA imposes accountability requirements on all registered handlers of controlled substances. Registrants must keep strict records and maintain inventories in compliance with federal law and rules adopted by the relevant state. For example, a registrant must maintain a complete and accurate record of each substance manufactured, received, sold, delivered, or otherwise disposed of by the registrant. Registrants must also complete and submit to the DEA periodic reports of every sale, delivery, or other disposal of any controlled substance. ", "The DEA has described the movement of a controlled substance from manufacture to the patient as follows:", "[A] controlled substance, after being manufactured by a DEA-registered manufacturer, may be transferred to a DEA-registered distributor for subsequent distribution to a DEA- registered retail pharmacy. After a DEA-registered practitioner, such as a physician or a dentist, issues a prescription for a controlled substance to a patient (i.e., the ultimate user), that patient can fill that prescription at a retail pharmacy to obtain that controlled substance. In this system, the manufacturer, the distributor, the practitioner, and the retail pharmacy are all required to be DEA registrants, or to be exempted from the requirement of registration, to participate in the process.", "This \"closed system\" of distribution guarantees that a particular controlled substance is always under the control of a DEA-registered person until it reaches the patient or is destroyed, and the CSA's regulatory requirements \"ensure that all controlled substances are accounted for from their creation until their dispensing or destruction.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CSA Civil and Criminal Penalties", "paragraphs": ["For persons who lawfully handle controlled substances, failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the CSA may result in civil penalties involving fines. Examples of violations include the distribution or dispensing of a controlled substance not authorized by the person's registration with the DEA, as well as the refusal or failure to make, keep, or furnish any record or report required under the CSA. The CSA provides that violations of its regulatory requirements generally do not constitute a crime, unless the violation was committed knowingly , in which case imprisonment of up to one or two years is authorized.", "The CSA provides a variety of criminal sanctions for unlawful possession, manufacturing, distribution, or importation of controlled substances. The CSA outlaws simple possession of controlled substances regardless of intent, stating that, \"It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance.\" However, the CSA permits patients to possess a controlled substance that \"was obtained directly, or pursuant to a valid prescription or order, from a practitioner, while acting in the course of his professional practice.\" Any person who violates the simple possession offense may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than one year, and fined a minimum of $1,000, or both. A second violation raises the minimum fine to $2,500 and a minimum imprisonment term of 15 days with a maximum of two years; a third offense carries a minimum fine of $5,000 and minimum imprisonment for 90 days, with a maximum term of three years.", "The CSA also prohibits any person from knowingly or intentionally acquiring or obtaining possession of a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception, or subterfuge. A violation of this section may result in a term of imprisonment of not more than four years or a fine of up to $250,000, or both; second offenses involving this section increases the maximum imprisonment term to eight years.", "The CSA broadly defines \"distribution\" to include virtually every transfer of possession. Dispensing a controlled substance means \"to deliver a controlled substance to an ultimate user ... by, or pursuant to the lawful order of, a practitioner, including the prescribing and administering of a controlled substance.\" The term \"deliver\" means \"the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance or a listed chemical, whether or not there exists an agency relationship.\" It is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to distribute or dispense, or to possess with intent to distribute or dispense, a controlled substance, except as authorized by law. The criminal penalties for violating this prohibition on unlawful distribution of a controlled substance vary depending on whether the individual is a first-time offender or a repeat offender, the type of substance involved, and the quantity of the type of substance involved. For example, a violation of \u00a7 841(a) by a first-time offender involving a schedule II substance such as codeine is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 20 years and a fine of up to $1,000,000.

Upon receipt of this letter, a SAC may authorize the ultimate user to dispose of the controlled substance by one of the following methods: (1) by transfer to a DEA registrant; (2) by delivery to a DEA agent or to the nearest DEA field office; (3) by destruction in the presence of a DEA agent; or (4) by \"such other means as the Special Agent in Charge may determine to assure that the substance does not become available to unauthorized persons.\" The DEA has conceded that ultimate users have very rarely utilized this procedure that is available to them.", "The DEA's testimony offered in congressional hearings, the DEA's website, and the agency's comments published in the Federal Register have all repeatedly asserted the DEA's view that the CSA prohibits consumers from returning unwanted or unused controlled substances to their pharmacies or giving them to other DEA-registered entities for disposal purposes. The DEA has stated that the CSA has no provisions that allow a DEA registrant (such as a pharmacy) to accept and take custody of controlled substances from a non-registrant (individual patient). The DEA has previously explained the following:", "The Controlled Substances Act is unique among criminal laws in that it stipulates acts pertaining to controlled substances that are permissible. That is, if the CSA does not explicitly permit an action pertaining to a controlled substance, then by its lack of explicit permissibility the act is prohibited.", "Not only does the CSA lack provisions that permit the transfer of a controlled substance between non-registrants and DEA registrants, but the CSA expressly prohibits an ultimate user to engage in \"distribution\" of a controlled substance. Because the CSA defines \"distribute\" to mean \"deliver ... a controlled substance\" and further defines \"deliver\" to mean \"the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance,\" it is illegal for an ultimate user to give a controlled substance to another person (whether DEA-registered or not) for disposal purposes.", "Some state and community drug take-back programs accept controlled substances from patients because they have been granted \"temporary allowances\" from the DEA to do so\u2014such programs involve the participation of law enforcement agencies that have sought authorization from the SAC to directly receive the controlled substances from ultimate users for disposal purposes. In the absence of such DEA approval, however, community pharmaceutical take-back programs are not permitted to collect controlled substances from consumers.

Also, the bill grants the Attorney General discretion to promulgate regulations that authorize long-term care facilities to dispose of controlled substances on behalf of ultimate users who reside (or have resided) at the long-term care facilities. The DEA has observed that \"[t]his provision is necessary because nursing homes and other long-term care facilities sometimes gain possession of controlled substances that are no longer needed by patients, but the CSA currently does not allow such facilities, which are usually not registered under the Act, to deliver controlled substances to others for the purposes of disposal.\" The bill includes a congressional findings section.
