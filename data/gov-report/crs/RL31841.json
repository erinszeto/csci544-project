Their value is projected at $57 billion for FY2003, and they are expected to grow over the long term. Theseexports are the equivalent of about a quarter of the gross income of U.S. farmers and generate bothfarm and nonfarm employment. U.S. agricultural imports, expected to reach $43 billion in FY2003,are fostered by low average U.S. tariffs, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, and consumer tastesand preferences for high value food products, the largest component of imports. A large share ofagricultural imports compete against U.S. products, but they also generate economic activity in theU.S. economy.", "Although many world economic and other factors influence exports, many farm groups believe that U.S. agriculture's future prosperity also depends on such U.S. trade policies as 1) negotiatingimproved market access for U.S. products bilaterally, regionally, and multilaterally; 2) assuringmarket access and consumer acceptance at home and abroad for products of agriculturalbiotechnology; 3) assuring that China adheres to its World Trade Organization (WTO) agriculturalmarket access commitments; and 4) resolving contentious commodity trade disputes.

Up until 30 or 40 years ago, clearerdistinctions could be made between domestic and foreign markets for the products of agriculture -and early federal farm policy reflected this distinction. Farm support programs were initiallydeveloped primarily to support farm income and commodity prices through government spending. These programs were often combined with supply management measures that included importrestrictions. U.S. export competitiveness and impacts on world trade relations and patterns were lessimportant considerations.", "Mounting productivity has enabled U.S. agriculture to produce far more than needed simply to meet domestic demand, which is relatively stable. Foreign markets, once viewed more as an outletfor surplus production, are increasingly becoming the foundation of agriculture's prosperity (see\"U.S. Agricultural Exports,\" below). A robust world economy and strong demand (particularly inthe developing world where consumer incomes and populations are rising) suggest strong exportprospects and positive farm returns. Conversely, when exports decline, farm income suffers - asoccurred after 1998 when the Asian financial crisis signaled the start of a wider recession that hurtU.S. agricultural exports. (Congress subsequently provided billions of dollars in federal farm aidto bolster farm incomes.)", "Even when world economic conditions are favorable, U.S. agriculture enters the global marketplace facing stiff competition from foreign exporting nations like Canada, Australia,Argentina, and Brazil, where production costs may be competitive with those in the United States,and the European Union (EU) and China, where strong government support in the form of subsidiesand/or other aids also play an important and often trade-distorting role, according to many analysts. Furthermore, the EU and China, along with others like Russia, Japan and Korea, have imposed whatU.S. interests consider to be unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical measures(labeling rules, segregation of imported from domestic product, etc.), high tariffs, and other importbarriers that choke access to their markets. These countries are, and are expected to remain, leadingcustomers for U.S. farm products - not only bulk grains but, increasingly, higher-value products likemeats, poultry, fruits and vegetables, and processed food products. Furthermore, their views aboutagricultural markets influence the views of policymakers in developing countries.", "Farm groups and agribusinesses are well aware that many world factors influence U.S. agricultural exports. They count on lawmakers and Administration officials to develop and promoteU.S. trade policies that (1) aggressively reduce foreign-imposed barriers (including tariffs, non-tariffbarriers, domestic subsidies, and export subsidies) to U.S. farm products, (2) hold other countriesaccountable for commitments they have already made in existing trade agreements, (3) resolvefestering agricultural disputes with major trading partners, and (4) fully use USDA export and foodaid programs. ", "Some U.S. farm groups point out that, by maintaining barriers to U.S. imports and their own high export subsidies and internal farm supports, not all countries have fully honored existing tradeagreements. Such concern has on occasion dampened U.S. agriculture's enthusiasm for entering intonew trade agreements. Even when the United States wins a case in dispute settlement, as it did in1997, when the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled in favor of the United States that the EUcannot ban, without scientific justification, beef produced with hormones, a country may not complywith the decision. In the beef case, the United States was authorized to impose retaliatory tariffs butU.S. beef still cannot enter the EU. Although U.S. officials say more trade disputes are resolvedfavorably than unfavorably (often through negotiation at lower levels rather than formal disputeresolution), there is a perception among some farmers that established international trading ruleshave not always worked to their benefit. ", "Moreover, some U.S. producer groups (particularly those representing import-sensitive commodities) have pressed for continued protection of their own commodities, and for morerestrictions on foreign farm and food imports into the United States. The U.S. average tariff onagricultural imports (12%) is much lower than the global average tariff (62%) imposed on similarimports. However, the United States along with other developed countries restricts the entry of\"import-sensitive\" agricultural products to protect certain domestic producers from foreigncompetition and the economic adjustments that such imports might entail. U.S. tariff-rate quotasallow zero or low duty access for specified amounts of foreign beef, sugar, peanuts, cotton, tobacco,and dairy products. Imports above the quota may enter, but face prohibitively high tariffs. Thisusually makes such imports uncompetitive in the U.S. market. Safeguards (involving the temporaryuse of higher tariffs and/or quotas) allow producers of an affected commodity or product sectoradditional time to adjust to increased import competition. Such adjustments will be more severe inareas whose production must compete with imported products. In recent years, the United States hasimposed safeguards on imports of lamb meat and wheat gluten to allow U.S. producers of thoseproducts time to adjust to foreign competition. (2)", "Foreign trading partners argue that such efforts are ill-advised because free trade must flow in all directions, including into the United States. In some cases, other countries are using tradenegotiations and, sometimes, dispute settlement procedures in the WTO, to enhance their access tothe U.S. market for agricultural products, or to reduce competition in third-country markets fromsubsidized U.S. production. For example, both the lamb and wheat gluten safeguard actions weresuccessfully challenged by other WTO member countries in WTO dispute settlement and were notrenewed by the United States. More recently, in September 2002, Brazil initiated a case at the WTOagainst certain aspects of the U.S. cotton program. ", "Many developing countries are particularly concerned about what they see as limited access tothe U.S. market for the above import-sensitive and other commodities. Such countries also see highdomestic farm supports in richer countries like the United States and EU member states astrade-distorting and are seeking substantial reductions in such support in multilateral negotiations. ", "It is within this context of competing U.S. agricultural interests and other countries' concerns, that agricultural trade issues are likely to be taken up in legislation, congressional-executive branchconsultations on trade negotiations, or in oversight hearings during the 108th Congress. Among themost prominent are the following, which are discussed in more detail later in this report:", "Agriculture in Bilateral and Regional Free Trade Agreements. Unique to free trade agreements (FTAs), as illustrated by the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), are provisions designed to fully liberalize trade (e.g.,reduce and eliminate tariffs and quotas) between partners within an agreed- upon time period. Provisions affecting agricultural trade are found in two bilateral FTAs the Bush Administrationconcluded with Chile and Singapore late in 2002. Agriculture also will likely prove to be acontentious issue in negotiating other FTAs the Administration has initiated, including withAustralia. While some agricultural commodity groups and food product manufacturers welcome themarket openings these agreements may provide, producers of import-sensitive commodities (e.g.,sugar, dairy products, meats) will carefully monitor and seek to shape those provisions that affectthem. ", "The Administration also has placed a high priority on negotiating an agreement to remove all trade barriers within the Western Hemisphere. The Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA) isintended to go beyond NAFTA to encompass all trade and services among all of the region'scountries (except Cuba), and eventually supersede both NAFTA and regional trading agreements,including the free trade agreement the United States has just negotiated with Chile and the FTAbeing negotiated with Central America. Crafting rules for liberalizing agricultural trade andnegotiating the fine details among the region's 34 countries by 2005 will be difficult and contentious.", "Agricultural Negotiations in the World Trade Organization. The United States is engaged in a new round of multilateral tradenegotiations, one of whose aims is further liberalization of global agricultural trade. According tothe declaration agreeing to a new trade round, the objectives for agriculture are to substantiallyimprove market access for agricultural products, reduce and phase out export subsidies, andsubstantially reduce trade-distorting domestic support. Most U.S. agricultural interest groups supportthe inclusion of agriculture in a broader multilateral trade round. These groups believe thattrade-offs possible in a comprehensive negotiation would result in improved market prospects forU.S. agricultural exports. Others, such as producers of import-sensitive crops, who feeldisadvantaged by previous trade agreements (e.g., NAFTA) or threatened by possible newagreements, are not as enthusiastic about U.S. participation in a new round. The agriculturalnegotiations have important implications for farm bill programs that provide price and incomesupport to farmers and for export and food aid programs. There are also important differences innegotiating positions among WTO member countries, especially between the United States and theEuropean Union, and between those two WTO members and the developing countries.", "Biotechnology and Agricultural Trade. Differences between the United States and its trading partners over genetically engineered (GE)crops and food products that contain or are derived from them pose a potential threat to, and in someinstances have already disrupted, U.S. agricultural trade. Corn and soybean exports are the mostseriously threatened crops. Underlying the conflicts are pronounced differences, reflected inconsumer attitudes and regulatory systems, between the United States and several important tradingpartners about GE products and their potential health and environmental effects.", "China and U.S. Agriculture. There is mounting concern from U.S. producer groups, Administration officials, and other trading partners that Chinahas been slow to implement, only partially implemented, or in some instances has failed to complywith agricultural trade commitments made under recent international trade agreements. The speedand manner with which China implements its trade commitments are critical to the development ofU.S.-China agricultural trade. While U.S. agriculture and trade officials have been working toresolve these differences, progress has been slow.", "Country-of-Origin Labeling. The 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) soon will require many food stores to provide country-of-origin labeling (COOL) onfresh fruits, vegetables, red meats, seafood, and peanuts. Proponents of COOL argue that U.S.consumers have a right to know the origin of their food, particularly during a period when foodimports are increasing, and will continue to increase under both existing and future trade agreements,and when there are concerns about food safety. Critics of the new law, however, argue that suchlabeling does not increase public health protection by telling consumers which foods are safer thanothers: all food imports already must meet equivalent U.S. food safety standards, which are enforcedvigorously by U.S. officials at the border and overseas. Scientific principles, not geography, mustbe the arbiter of safety, they add. Some critics are urging the 108th Congress to revisit the newlabeling law, on the grounds that implementation will be extremely costly and hinder rather than helpU.S. producers' competitive advantage. Proponents maintain that the expected benefits to U.S.farmers, ranchers, and consumers will outweigh implementation and compliance costs.", "Agricultural Exports to Cuba. U.S. policy is to exempt commercial sales of agricultural and medical products from U.S. unilateral sanctionsimposed on foreign countries, subject to specified conditions and prohibitions. Debate continues,though, among policymakers on the scope of restrictions that should apply to agricultural sales toCuba.", "Bilateral Trade Disputes. The United States is engaged in a variety of trade disputes involving individual countries. The outcome of a number ofthese could prove critical to future application and recognition of WTO farm subsidy rules, disputesettlement procedures, and other world trade issues of importance to U.S. agriculture. Among thedisputes are: ", "A WTO case, instituted in September 2002, by Brazil against certain aspects of the U.S. cotton program . Subsequent consultations between the United States andBrazil inDecember and January failed to resolve the dispute. Continuation of the WTO dispute settlementprocess could lead to a \"final\" panel decision for or against the complaining country. Resolution ofthe case in Brazil's favor could result in WTO recommendations concerning implementation of U.S.cotton program provisions. Non-compliance with such provisions on the part of the United Statescould result in compensation or possible limited trade sanctions.", "A U.S. complaint that Canadian wheat trading practices, particularly theexport practices of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), are inconsistent with Canada's WTOobligations and disadvantage U.S. wheat exporters in Canadian and international markets. Canadamaintains that Canadian import practices and the CWB wheat export practices comply fully withinternational trade rules and its WTO obligations. Successful resolution of this dispute in favor ofthe United States could result in greater competitiveness for U.S. wheat vis-a-vis Canadian wheatin international markets and in U.S. wheat having improved access to the Canadianmarket.", "Import barriers by Russia, Mexico, the EU, and Japan, affecting U.S. meat and/or poultry exports .

Revised offers would then follow this \"request-offer\" process.", "USTR's Ambassador Zoellick, on February 11, 2003, laid out the scope of the U.S. tariff reduction offer on agricultural and other products. In unveiling this offer, he said that the UnitedStates is prepared to grant immediate duty-free access on 56% of the agricultural products that enterfrom non-NAFTA countries once the agreement takes effect. On politically-sensitive farm products,Ambassador Zoellick stated that the United States proposes to eliminate tariffs with specifictimetables that would differ between countries or regional groups. Transition periods could be 5 or10 years, or even longer, depending upon a country's size and its level of economic development,and the type of agricultural product. Ambassador Zoellick indicated all agricultural products are onthe table and subject to negotiation (i.e., no exclusions), and that the United States will move forwardwith other countries willing to take the same position.", "Hemispheric free trade in agriculture by about 2020 is envisioned if negotiators reach agreement on an FTAA in 2005. The agricultural component of the FTAA negotiating process, though, couldbecome problematic once negotiators begin to apply negotiating modalities to specific commoditiesand food products that each country historically has protected. Some Latin American countries,particularly Brazil, seek increased access to the U.S. market for competitive products such as beef,citrus, and sugar. U.S. commodity groups and agribusiness seek additional openings for theirproducts in the rapidly growing Latin American market. They also seek legal assurances that allcountries will abide by sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules with respect to agricultural imports. Though the United States will emphasize eliminating tariffs and other barriers to agricultural trade,Brazil and other countries have signaled they want the negotiating agenda to also address the issueof domestic agricultural support (i.e., farm price and income support). They have suggested linkingreductions in their higher tariffs to a concession by the United States on the domestic support issue.

Most U.S. agricultural interest groups support the inclusion of agriculture in abroader multilateral trade round.

The agricultural negotiations have important implications for farm bill programsthat provide price and income support to farmers and for export and food aid programs.

This new round, because of its emphasison integrating developing countries into the world trading system, is called the Doha DevelopmentAgenda (DDA). A first phase of agricultural trade negotiations had been underway since early 2000. The DDA incorporates those negotiations into a comprehensive multilateral trade negotiation andbegins a second phase of negotiations on agriculture. ", "For agriculture, the Doha Ministerial Declaration states that \"building on the work carried out to date (in the sectoral negotiations)\" and \"without prejudging the outcome of the negotiations, wecommit ourselves to comprehensive negotiations aimed at: substantial improvements in marketaccess; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantialreductions in trade-distorting domestic support.\" The Declaration also provides that \"special anddifferential treatment for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of thenegotiations.\" The Declaration takes note of \"non-trade concerns reflected in negotiating proposalsof Members\" and confirms that \" non-trade concerns will be taken into account\" in thenegotiations.", "During 2002, WTO member countries discussed the issues of market access, export competition, and domestic support. The United States, the Cairns Group of agricultural exportingcountries, (8) the European Union (EU), Japan, andseveral developing countries submitted negotiatingproposals during 2002. (9) The DDA called forreaching an agreement by March 31, 2003 on \"modalities\" (e.g., formulas, targets, timetables) for achieving the objectives mandated by the DohaDeclaration, but that deadline was missed. Now, negotiations on modalities will continue butprobably not be completed until the September WTO Ministerial Conference scheduled forSeptember 2003 in Cancun, Mexico.", "Negotiating modalities has not been easy. Member countries differ sharply in their choice of modalities. For example, some want to reduce high tariffs more rapidly than lower tariffs, whileothers will want to protect \"sensitive\" products by slowing the pace of tariff reduction. Similarly,some want rapid reductions in export or domestic subsidies while others will want longer timetablesfor reductions. Once an agreement on modalities is reached, WTO member countries would beginto negotiate individual country schedules or lists of commitments. ", "The U.S. position, first tabled in June 2000 and amplified in a July 2002 proposal, includes the elimination of agricultural export subsidies; substantial reductions in tariffs (with no country'sindividual tariff exceeding 25%); 20% increases in tariff-rate quotas on agricultural imports;disciplines on state trading enterprises; and reductions in \"amber box\" spending (trade distortingdomestic support) to no more than 5% of the value of each country's total agricultural production- the objective being to make all countries' domestic support levels comparable in relative terms(i.e., harmonized). (10) Most of these changeswould be phased in over 5 years. Ultimately, accordingto the U.S. proposal, tariffs and domestic support also would be eliminated. The Cairns Groupproposal, which is strongly supportive of the U.S. position, also calls for deep cuts in tariffs anddomestic support and the elimination of export subsidies. Many in Congress have expressed supportfor the U.S. negotiating proposal, but have made their support contingent on reduction andharmonization of tariffs and subsidies by other WTO members, especially the EU. ", "In sharp contrast to the U.S. position, the EU calls for applying formulas used in Uruguay Round agriculture negotiations (1986-1994) as modalities. Such an approach would yieldprogressive reductions in tariffs and subsidies but not harmonization or elimination. The EUalso has conditioned its support for export subsidy reduction on negotiating disciplines forexport credit programs and food aid programs. The EU negotiating proposal, along withthose of Japan and Korea place greater emphasis on so-called non-trade concerns likeprotecting the environment, animal welfare, and rural development. Those WTO membersare seeking exemptions from WTO reduction commitments and disciplines for subsidiesprovided to promote such non-trade concerns. The U.S. position is silent on non-tradeconcerns, but U.S. trade negotiators express fears that payments to producers to promotenon-trade concerns would be disguised trade-distorting measures. ", "Some suggest that the success of the agriculture negotiations depends on the pace of agricultural policy reform in the EU and the United States. A recent agreement betweenFrance and Germany to maintain EU domestic farm support at current levels and postpone anyreductions in support until after 2007 may make it more difficult for the EU to agree toagricultural trade reforms in the current round. In the EU, efforts to reform its CommonAgricultural Policy face considerable opposition from several EU member states. Thesereforms, which include substantial de-coupling of income support from production andreductions in price supports, could, if adopted, facilitate the EU's ability to accept cuts intrade-distorting domestic support or the elimination of export subsidies. ", "In the United States, the President on May 13, 2002, signed into law a farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) to replace the 1996 Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform, or FAIR, Act)that, many critics say, could raise trade-distorting domestic support above U.S. WTOcommitments to reduce such spending and also undermine the U.S. position in the new round. However, the farm bill stipulates that the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent possible,make adjustments in U.S. farm subsidies to ensure that it does not exceed levels allowableunder the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. Moreover, U.S. trade officials insist that theUnited States has not wavered from its negotiating objective of securing substantialreductions in domestic subsidies, including U.S. subsidies, that distort trade, and thatcongressional support for the U.S. negotiating proposal remains strong. ", "Developing countries who constitute the majority of WTO members are calling for rapid dismantling of developed countries' trade barriers and the elimination of production-linkeddomestic subsidies. Developing countries are also seeking exemptions for developingcountry domestic support deemed essential for economic development. Developing countriesare a large and diverse group with many different position on negotiating issues, but many,especially those that are exporters of agricultural products, have targeted both U.S. and EUsubsidies for elimination in the negotiations. While developing countries are seekingsubstantial reductions in agricultural tariffs of developed countries, they are resistant to theidea of reciprocal tariff reductions, preferring instead to be accorded special and differentialtreatment which would entail maintaining tariffs or phasing them down over lengthy timeperiods.", "To facilitate the process of reaching agreement on modalities, the chairman of the Agriculture Negotiating Group, Stuart Harbinson, issued on February 17, 2003 and revisedslightly on March 20, 2003, a draft paper with various proposals for modalities. Harbinson's\"modalities \" report attempted to steer a middle course between the U.S. and EU negotiatingpositions, while according special and differential treatment to developing countries. Chairman Harbinson's report dealt with the three so-called pillars of the agriculturenegotiations: market access, export competition, and domestic support. On market access,he proposed that for tariffs greater than 90% ad valorem the simple average would be reducedby 60% subject to a minimum cut of 45% per tariff line; for agricultural tariffs lower than orequal to 90% but greater than 15%, the simple average reduction would be 50% subject to aminimum cut of 35% per tariff line; and for all agricultural tariffs lower than or equal to 15%,the simple average reduction would be 40% subject to a minimum cut of 25% per tariff line. ", "On export competition, Harbinson's modalities report recommends that export subsidies be eliminated over a ten-year period. Export credit and food aid programs would also becovered by new rules. Repayment terms for export credits would be limited to a maximumof six months but developing countries would be allowed longer repayment periods. Onlygrant food aid would be permitted under the Harbinson recommendations. However, food aidprovided in kind for development projects could be provided through United Nations foodagencies or UN food agency projects operated by non-governmental or charitableorganizations. ", "On domestic support, the modalities report calls for a 60% reduction in trade-distorting (or amber box) support. The report also suggested that trade-distorting support tied toproduction limits (blue box support used primarily by the EU) be capped and then reduced by50% over five years. The modalities report also included an option for eliminating the bluebox altogether by including it in the amber box category and subjecting it to a 60% reduction. ", "While U.S. trade negotiators indicated they considered the modalities report as a reference point for further negotiations, they were highly critical of specific proposals. At ameeting of WTO trade ministers in Tokyo (February 14-16) where a draft of the report wasconsidered, the United States and the Cairns Group said the recommendations fell far shortof their earlier proposals. U.S. criticisms, among others, were that the market accessprovisions did not result in harmonization of tariff levels and that the application of theHarbinson approach would still leave very high tariffs on many products, especially meatproducts. While the U.S. trade officials welcomed the elimination of export subsidies, theynoted that the ten-year phase-out schedule should be considerably shortened. According toU.S. participants in the Tokyo meeting, reduction proposals for amber box support wouldenable the EU to maintain trade-distorting blue box payments and to continue to provideconsiderably more trade-distorting amber box support than could the United States. U.S.amber box support is capped at $19 billion annually, while the EU's is capped at $67 billion. Under the Harbinson proposal, U.S. amber box support would fall to around $8 billion peryear, while the EU's would be capped at $27 billion per year. ", "Not only the Administration, but many in Congress reacted negatively to the Harbinson proposals for the agriculture trade negotiations. A particular concern was that the Harbinsonproposal for a 60% reduction in trade-distorting or amber box support, did not \"level theplaying field\" between the United States and the EU. Permitted EU trade distorting subsidieswould still be more than three times the level of permitted U.S. subsidies. Also in the 2002Trade Act, Congress had made preserving export credit guarantee programs a majornegotiating objective. The Harbinson proposals for tightening export credit programdisciplines are thus likely to come under intense congressional scrutiny. ", "The EU also reacted negatively to the Harbinson proposals. In the EU view, they were unbalanced and placed most of the burden of adjustment on the EU. The EU was particularlyconcerned that, with the exception of adding animal welfare subsidies to the category ofnon-trade distorting (or green box) subsidies, the Harbinson report ignored non-tradeconcerns. The EU criticized the report's call for the elimination of export subsidies withoutsimilarly disciplining export credit programs, such as U.S. export credit guarantees. EUofficials argued also that blue box subsidies are less trade distorting than amber box supportand should not be subject to the same reduction requirements as amber box support. ", "Missing the deadline for agreeing to modalities, some observers suggest, indicates that the agriculture negotiations are stalled with neither side prepared to compromise. Some evensuggest that the inability to agree on a way forward for agriculture imperils the entire Doharound. However, both U.S. and EU negotiators are maintaining that an agreement onmodalities can be reached by the time of the Cancun Ministerial and that the missed deadline,though serious, will not forestall concluding the round by January 1, 2005.

One country suffering from severe food shortages in that region has rejectedfood aid shipments containing GE corn, while others in the region have required that GE cornin food aid be milled, thus adding to the costs of providing relief.

How these are resolved, in turn, willlikely influence the terms reached on future U.S. HFCS sales to Mexico. Some observe thatMexico's interest in reaching an agreement in the short term has diminished, due to the smallquantity of Mexican sugar available for export this year and the political dynamics associatedwith upcoming mid-term congressional elections in July. Also, with the Mexican Congresshaving adjourned in December 2002 without dropping the tax on soft drinks sweetened withcorn syrup-viewed by the U.S. side as necessary to reach a comprehensiveagreement-prospects for a quick resolution have faded.

Anychanges in these programs resulting from a trade agreement would ultimately be subject tocongressional scrutiny under fast-track procedures for considering trade agreements. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background and Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) authorizes USDA to operate a number of programs to promote U.S. agricultural exports or to provide foreign food aid. The Foreign AgriculturalService operates USDA's international programs. These programs include: agriculturalexport subsidies, export market development, export credit guarantees, and foreign food aid. Legislative authority for most of these programs now extends to the end of 2007. Exportsubsidies, but not other types of export and food aid programs, are subject to reductioncommitments agreed to in the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA). On-going WTO agriculture negotiations are considering new rules and disciplines for exportcredit programs and food aid based on surpluses. ", "U.S. agricultural export subsidies include the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP). Market promotion programs include the MarketAccess Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development or \"Cooperator\" Program(FMDP). Considered to be non-trade distorting, programs to promote exports are exemptfrom Uruguay Round reduction commitments. The FSRIA authorizes export credit guaranteesby USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) of $5.5 billion worth of farm exportsannually, plus guarantees of an additional $1 billion for emerging markets through 2007. ", "The FSRIA also authorizes P.L. 480 Food for Peace programs and Food for Progress through FY2007. P.L. 480 Titles I (Trade and Development Assistance) and II (Emergencyand Private Assistance) are the main vehicles for U.S. foreign food aid. Food for Progress(FFP) provides commodities to developing countries and emerging markets that aredeveloping their private sectors. Another food aid program, Section 416(b), permanentlyauthorized in the Agricultural Act of 1949, provides surplus commodities for donationoverseas. The 2002 farm bill also established a new food aid program, the McGovern-DoleInternational School Feeding and Child Nutrition Program.", "Some of these programs, notably food aid provided under P.L. 480 and the salaries and expenses of USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), require annual appropriations. Other programs (food aid other than P.L. 480, export subsidies, export market development,export credit guarantees) are funded or guaranteed by USDA's Commodity CreditCorporation (CCC) and do not require line item appropriations. Congress is presentlyconsidering proposals in the President's budget transmitted to Congress on February 3, 2003for funding USDA export and food aid programs in FY2004. The President's budgetestimates that agricultural export and food aid programs would have a program value of $6.2billion. Of that amount, approximately $1.4 billion (for P.L. 480 and FAS) would requireauthorization of budget authority in an appropriations act; the rest would be funded by CCCborrowing from the Treasury. ", "The biggest item requiring authorization of budget authority is $1.185 billion requested for P.L. 480 Title II, the same as requested in FY2003. However, the President's budgetrequest for Title II is less than the amount appropriated in FY2003. The farm bill authorized$100 million of CCC funding for the McGovern-Dole school feeding program in FY2003. Beginning in FY2004, however, the program will be funded by appropriations and thePresident requested $50 million for McGovern-Dole in FY2004. The President's budgetenvisions $151 million of CCC funding for FFP. That program level is expected to provide the minimum 400,000 tons of commodities in FFP required by the 2002 farm bill. ", "The President's budget assumes a program level of $28 million in FY2004 for EEP. The farm bill, however, allows EEP spending of $478 million, which is the maximum allowedunder the World Trade Organization/Uruguay Round agreement on subsidy reductioncommitments. EEP is capped at $28 million in FY2003 by P.L. 108-7 , but for FY2004,unless Congress decides otherwise, USDA retains some flexibility to increase the level ofEEP subsidies.. For DEIP, the budget expects a program level of $57 million for FY2004, anincrease above the $36 million estimated for FY2003. The budget request assumes that theCCC will guarantees commercial financing of $4.2 billion of U.S. agricultural exports inFY2004. Consistent with the farm bill reauthorization of MAP, the budget provides for MAPfunding of $125 million in FY2004. The budget assumes the farm bill authorized level of$34.5 million for FMDP in FY2004.
