The MMPA's authorization of appropriations expired at the end of FY1999. At issue for Congress are the terms and conditions of provisions designed to reauthorize and amend the MMPA to address a variety of concerns relating to marine mammal management. In the 109th Congress, the House passed a bill to reauthorize and amend the MMPA, but no further action was taken on this measure. The 110th Congress may again consider measures to amend and reauthorize the MMPA as well as bills to address specific marine mammal regulatory and management issues.", "Several issues that may arise in reauthorization relate to modifying management of the interactions between marine mammals and commercial fishing operations. Other concerns relate to marine mammals in captivity and subsistence use of marine mammals by Native Americans. Additional issues include providing for trade in marine mammal products, managing robust marine mammal stocks, understanding the effect of noise on marine mammals, fostering international cooperation, regulating large incidental takes, modifying the scientific research permit process, improving agency compliance with MMPA deadlines, facilitating marine mammal research by federal scientists, dealing with harassment of marine mammals, considering a directed research program, and appropriating adequate funding for federal agency programs. While some of these issues could be addressed administratively, in regulations proposed and promulgated by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, others likely would require statutory changes.", "Most potential participants in the reauthorization debate anticipate extended negotiations on some of these issues. Although the authorization for appropriations expired at the end of FY1999, the MMPA itself did not expire. Eventually, however, an extension of funding authority may need to be considered to continue federal program operations. Most of the issues associated with this law are not time-sensitive, and a number of oversight hearings have been held to increase understanding of various issues, positions, and possibilities.", "This report lays out the range of issues likely to be raised during any reauthorization debate, the reasons behind them, and possible proposals that could be offered to address these concerns.

The authorization of appropriations under the MMPA expired at the end of FY1999. The 104 th , 105 th , 106 th , 108 th , and 109 th Congresses enacted additional amendments addressing single or limited issues (see \" Miscellaneous MMPA Amendments \"); no MMPA amendments were enacted by the 107 th Congress. At issue for Congress are the terms and conditions of provisions to reauthorize and amend the MMPA to address a variety of concerns related to marine mammal management. Legislation introduced, but not enacted, in the 105 th , 106 th , 107 th , 108 th , and 109 th Congresses suggests a number of issues that may be discussed during a reauthorization debate. To identify a larger universe of potentially relevant concerns, the Congressional Research Service queried commercial fishing, scientific research, public display, animal protection, Native American, and environmental interests to identify issues that might surface during a reauthorization debate. This report identifies these concerns and provides background to facilitate a better understanding of various positions on these issues. These concerns, along with other factors, may be considered as Congress determines whether and how to address MMPA reauthorization.", "Other than recommendations contained in reports to Congress mandated by the MMPA Amendments of 1994 (discussed later in this report) and in testimony presented at a June 29, 1999 oversight hearing before the House Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife, and Oceans, the Clinton Administration did not release any comprehensive proposals related to MMPA reauthorization. In the 109 th Congress, H.R. 4075 incorporated some of the MMPA amendments proposed by the Bush Administration. Congress has been active on marine mammal protection issues in recent years, responding primarily to balancing concerns of the commercial fishing industry and environmental interests. Congress generally views the MMPA as working well, but possibly needing changes to address an increasing number of concerns that have arisen since the 1994 amendments.

The MMPA established a moratorium on the \"taking\" of marine mammals in U.S. waters and by U.S. nationals on the high seas. The MMPA also established a moratorium on importing marine mammals and marine mammal products into the United States. The MMPA protects marine mammals from \"clubbing, mutilation, poisoning, capture in nets, and other human actions that lead to extinction.\" It also expressly authorized the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to issue permits for the \"taking\" of marine mammals for certain purposes, such as scientific research and public display.", "Under the MMPA, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS, in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also popularly referred to as \"NOAA Fisheries\"), is responsible for the conservation and management of whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions. The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), is responsible for walruses, sea otters, polar bears, manatees, and dugongs. This division of authority derives from agency responsibilities as they existed when the MMPA was enacted. Title II of the MMPA established an independent Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals to oversee and recommend actions necessary to meet the requirements of the MMPA. Title III authorized the International Dolphin Conservation Program. Title IV authorized the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program. Title V implemented the Agreement Between the United States and the Russian Federation on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population.", "Prior to passage of the MMPA, states were responsible for managing marine mammals on lands and in waters under their jurisdiction. The MMPA shifted all marine mammal management authority to the federal government. It provides, however, that management authority, on a species-by-species basis, could be returned to a state that adopts conservation and management programs consistent with the purposes and policies of the MMPA. It also provides that the moratorium on taking can be waived by the federal government or states with management authority for specific purposes, if the taking will not disadvantage the affected species or population. Permits may be issued to take or import any marine mammal species, including depleted species, for scientific research or to enhance the survival or recovery of the species or stock. Non-depleted species may be taken or imported for purposes of public display. The MMPA allows U.S. citizens to apply for and obtain authorization for taking small numbers of mammals incidental to activities other than commercial fishing (e.g., offshore oil and gas exploration and development), if the taking would have a negligible impact on any marine mammal species or stock, and if monitoring requirements and other conditions are met.", "The MMPA's moratorium on taking does not apply to any resident Alaskan Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo who dwells on the coast of the North Pacific (including the Bering Sea) or Arctic Oceans (including the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas), if such taking is for subsistence purposes or for creating and selling authentic Native articles of handicrafts and clothing, and is not done wastefully. However, such taking can be regulated or even prohibited if the Secretary determines a stock is depleted. The MMPA also provides for co-management of marine mammal subsistence use by Alaska Native groups, under which authority Native commissions have been established.", "The MMPA also authorizes the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations. In 1988, most U.S. commercial fish harvesters were exempted from otherwise applicable regulations and permit requirements for five years, pending development of an improved system to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations. The taking of marine mammals incidental to the eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishery is governed by specific and separate provisions in Title III of the MMPA.", "The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA; P.L. 93-205 , as amended; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71531, et seq.) provides additional protection for some marine mammal species that have been determined to be threatened or endangered with extinction.

In addition, the 1994 amendments substantially changed provisions relating to public display of marine mammals, authorized imports of polar bear trophies from Canada, authorized the limited lethal removal of pinnipeds, and enacted a general authorization for research involving only low levels of harassment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Implementation of the 1994 Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Implementation of the 1994 MMPA amendments by NMFS and FWS has been controversial on several issues. In some cases, implementation of new provisions took more than the full five years of the authorization to complete. One of the most difficult and controversial amendments to implement was the convening of Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) and the development of Take Reduction Plans by these TRTs. Critics believe an insufficient number of TRTs have been convened and that development of plans is far behind schedule.", "NMFS has convened nine TRTs to reduce bycatch of strategic stocks of marine mammals in selected commercial fisheries. One of these, the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean TRT, was disbanded in August 2001 due to changes in the affected fisheries. Another, the Mid-Atlantic TRT, became the Mid-Atlantic Harbor Porpoise TRT, because of priority given to particularly vulnerable harbor porpoise. Six of the remaining TRTs address bycatch issues on the Atlantic Coast, while the remaining TRT addresses marine mammal bycatch in the Pacific driftnet fishery for swordfish and sharks.", "Several TRTs have yet to be convened and plans developed. Although NMFS recognizes that fishery-related mortality exceeds the PBR level in some marine mammal stocks, no new TRTs are to be convened until additional funds are appropriated or redirected from existing Take Reduction Plans that have been declared successful. Congress recognized that funds would be limited and established criteria for prioritization of this effort in 16 U.S.C. \u00a71387(f)(3).", "Overall, NMFS believes that the time allowed by the MMPA to convene a TRT and develop a plan has been adequate. However, NMFS found it difficult to publish a final rule based on a plan in the time allotted by the MMPA, due primarily to the complexity and difficulty of implementing regulations that minimize impacts to the industry as required by the MMPA, and by the economic analyses and requirements of other statutes. The difficulties in meeting statutory deadlines and implementing plans for these strategic stocks has been both frustrating to many, sometimes resulting in litigation, and satisfying to others in that serious bycatch/fishery issues have been addressed.", "In response to the 1994 MMPA amendments at 16 U.S.C. \u00a71386, NMFS and FWS have completed reports assessing more than 170 different marine mammal stocks as required by the MMPA, and have developed a list of fisheries that monitor their annual takes of marine mammals by stock. These lists are frequently being revised and are also the target of controversy as new information is incorporated into the assessments. However, some of the stock assessments conducted by FWS have been criticized for using outdated (e.g., decades old) data. In addition, Alaska Native interests continue to be concerned that some stock assessment reports have little information on incidental take from commercial fishing operations. The sparse information in these reports, based on data collected during the 1988-1992 exemption, was the result of an emphasis on some U.S. fisheries having interactions with marine mammals at a rate that was considered more serious than that occurring in fisheries of concern to Native Alaskans. An observer program was therefore not initiated in Alaska until 1998. NMFS anticipates becoming better able to address the concerns of Alaska Natives.", "The 1994 amendments also directed the federal government to undertake an ecosystem-based research and monitoring program for the Bering Sea to identify the causes of ecosystem decline. There is controversy over the extent to which this provision has been fulfilled. Meanwhile, the Alaska Native community would like to initiate a complimentary effort to understand Bering Sea ecological processes by drawing upon traditional Native knowledge and wisdom. The Alaska Native community was unable to obtain public funding to convene meetings among affected villages to review the draft federal Bering Sea research plan, and eventually sought independent funding to support a March 1999 Bering Sea conference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Miscellaneous MMPA Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Subsequent to the 1994 reauthorization, several additional MMPA amendments were enacted separately:", "Section 405(b)(3) of P.L. 104-297 amended the MMPA's definition of the term \"waters under the jurisdiction of the United States.\" In P.L. 105-18 , \u00a72003 provided a \"good samaritan\" exemption allowing individuals to free marine mammals entangled in fishing gear or debris, while \u00a75004 modified the requirements for the importation of polar bear parts from polar bears legally harvested in Canada before the MMPA Amendments of 1994 were enacted. P.L. 105-42 modified dolphin conservation provisions of the MMPA applicable to the eastern tropical Pacific tuna seine fishery and specified under what conditions tuna products can be labeled \"dolphin-safe.\" Administrative provisions for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in P.L. 105-277 clarified that polar bear trophy permit fees remain available until expended for cooperative research and management programs.

In addition, for many species, the limiting habitat factors that govern carrying capacity are not known or well understood.", "Animal protection, scientific, and environmental interests generally agree that OSP is an important concept for assessing the viability of a population or stock. Some scientists, however, express concern that, if current rather than historic population data are used to calculate OSP, OSP levels may be calculated too low for some marine mammal stocks. Some in the commercial fishing industry, however, argue that OSP, as currently defined, is complex and vague in concept. They contend that \"maximum productivity\" is difficult to determine and imprecise, and complicates work on developing Take Reduction Plans for marine mammal stocks. The difficulties in declaring that a species is at OSP (1) frustrate fishing industry interests by impeding the ability of the federal government to transfer management authority to states and (2) prevent or delay fishermen from gaining authority to deliberately kill marine mammals. In addition, commercial fishing interests chafe when the MMPA, through OSP, grants marine mammals priority access to certain fish stocks and allocates marine mammals de facto \"harvest quotas\" in direct competition with and to the detriment of the fishing industry. Environmental and scientific interests counter that marine mammals are part of the marine ecosystem and should have their prey species protected from excessive fishing. These interests also believe that critics within the commercial fishing industry may be too quick to blame marine mammals for reductions in target fish populations where predator-prey relationships are incompletely understood.", "Commercial fishing interests would like to see the MMPA amended to modify, simplify, and clarify the definition of OSP as the objective for marine mammal management. Scientific, animal protection, and environmental interests believe that OSP, as the central \"core\" innovation of the MMPA, should be retained and improved. Other suggestions include directing the MMC to host a workshop, involving marine ecologists, oceanographers, and climatologists, to further examine the methods for determining OSP and its derivative potential biological removal (see section below). Appropriation of funds necessary for this task would probably be required."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculating Potential Biological Removal", "paragraphs": ["The potential biological removal (PBR) level is used to establish limits on incidental marine mammal mortality for commercial fishing operations. It is defined in 16 U.S.C. \u00a71362(20) as \"the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population.\" PBR is calculated by multiplying a stock's minimum population estimate by half the known or presumed maximum net productivity of the stock. This product is multiplied by a fractional multiplier known as the recovery factor. Take Reduction Plans are based on two assumptions: (1) that a stock or population currently within its OSP range will remain so, and (2) that any stock or population below its maximum net productivity level will increase to that level if the total human-caused mortality is kept below the PBR level. However, some scientists believe that both these assumptions might be questionable in light of today's much better information.", "MMPA critics in the fishing industry and Native Alaskan community believe that NMFS has been so restrictive in calculating PBRs that the economic viability of certain fisheries (e.g., the New England and mid-Atlantic gillnet fisheries, Bering Sea pollock fishery) is being compromised. NMFS and FWS managers counter that the lack of critical data used in PBR calculations limits their ability to calculate precise PBR values for many species. These issues are particularly acute for Alaskan species where population surveys, productivity rates, and harvest data are absent or based on crude estimates several decades old. Some scientific and animal protection interests, however, are concerned that, if the method for calculating them is changed, PBRs could be set too high to provide adequate incentive for commercial fishermen to develop better ways of targeting and catching certain species of fish (e.g., phasing out indiscriminate harvesting methods).", "Segments of the commercial fishing industry would like to have the concept or definition of PBR revised to be less restrictive by, for example, manipulating one of the multipliers (particularly the recovery factor). Scientific, animal protection, and environmental interests believe that PBR is an extremely important concept and an excellent management tool that should be maintained. Without a way to calculate concrete limits on take, they argue, NMFS would have no way of adequately determining the impact of human-caused mortality on marine mammal stocks or of adequately enforcing regulations. Some scientists contend that the necessary monitoring and research to accurately calculate useful PBRs is lacking. These critics suggest that a deadline be set for completing development of models to address these concerns.", "As mentioned in the previous section, suggestions for MMPA reauthorization include directing the MMC to host a workshop, involving marine ecologists, oceanographers, and climatologists, to further examine the methods for determining OSP and its derivative PBR. Considerations for such a workshop might include (1) multiple mortality factors such as subsistence harvest, commercial fishery interactions (including entanglement in net discards), and industrial activities (e.g., noise, contaminants); (2) standardized guidelines for using the recovery factor (e.g., endangered species that continue to decline should use 0.1 or less; endangered but increasing should use 0.2); and (3) variability in natural mortality due to extreme events (e.g., mass stranding, El Ni\u00f1o ).

However, while marine mammal mortality in many fisheries has been reduced (in some cases, substantially), animal protection and environmental interests do not consider these reductions to be significant. They believe that the ZMRG can be implemented in ways that do not impose burdensome costs on the fishing industry, and that promote marine ecosystem sustainability that is in the interest of all parties. Similar to their reasoning on PBRs, they believe ZMRG must be maintained as a means of encouraging the development and use of more risk-averse fishing methods.", "The fishing industry is concerned that ZMRG be implemented in a manner that recognizes a reasonable balance between marine mammal protection and economically viable fisheries, and that can be seen as having been already achieved in many instances.

Alaskan Native interests suggest that the MMPA (16 U.S.C. \u00a71386(d)) be amended to confer greater authority to Regional Scientific Review Groups, authorizing these groups to exercise more power in addressing concerns of where research is needed, rather than be only advisory.

Currently, the burden falls on the federal government to prove that a deterrent is harmful before it can be prohibited. For example, the long-term effects on marine mammals of acoustical harassment devices (AHDs), such as \"seal bombs\" and \"seal scarers,\" are not known. NMFS and the Marine Mammal Commission sponsored a 1996 scientific workshop that raised significant concerns about AHDs and recommended that their use be severely limited. NMFS proposed but never finalized deterrence regulations because of the difficulty in identifying measures for safely deterring endangered and threatened marine mammals, and the use of AHDs has increased substantially in recent years. Similarly, some scientists are concerned that there has been insufficient research to determine at what threshold a deterrent device might become harmful to marine mammals.", "With huge gaps of knowledge in marine mammal science, some animal protection advocates argue that it would be prudent to allow only proven harmless deterrents for use on marine mammals interacting with fishing vessels and/or fish farms. Some have argued for reliance on the precautionary principle that would require manufacturers to prove that a deterrent does not cause permanent harm to any age/sex class of affected marine mammal species before allowing its use. In addition, some scientists and managers believe that not enough emphasis has been placed on encouraging fishermen to change their fishing practices, rather than use a proven deterrent, to reduce interactions with marine mammals. However, fishermen are likely to make their choice between deterrents and changes in fishing practice on the basis of their relative cost.", "Some parties critical of the current situation may endorse proposals to alter the burden of proof for deterrents found in 16 U.S.C. \u00a71371(a)(4)(C); others may support efforts to direct NMFS to study the causes of fishery-marine mammal interaction problems to develop a different basis for regulating deterrents. Others suggest that the MMPA be revised to require permits for AHD users, allowing NMFS to better monitor the amount of ocean noise generated by these devices. NMFS has recommended that Congress consider (1) removing impediments to testing non-lethal deterrent technologies and (2) funding additional research, development, and evaluation of innovative non-lethal pinniped deterrence techniques. Some managers and scientists as well as certain interest groups caution, however, that considerable care must be taken to fully assess the \"side effects\" of noise and other emissions of non-lethal deterrents to identify any potential for damage to targeted and non-targeted marine mammals, fish that may be more sensitive to noise (e.g., herring, cod, other schooling fish), and divers. Any potential for damage will need to be weighed against the benefits of these deterrents before their use becomes even more widespread."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reinstate Limited Authority for Intentional Lethal Taking", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the 1994 MMPA amendments, commercial fishermen were allowed to kill certain pinnipeds as a last resort to protect their gear and catch. The 1994 amendments eliminated authorization for such lethal taking and replaced it with authority to use deterrence measures that do not kill or seriously injure marine mammals. However, conflicts between fishermen and pinnipeds have become more frequent, and economic losses have increased. NMFS has recommended that Congress consider authorizing the intentional lethal taking of California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals in specific areas and fisheries to protect gear and catch until effective non-lethal methods are developed. Critics oppose reinstating this authority, fearing that allowing fishermen to kill California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals could reduce the incentive to modify fishing practices or develop non-lethal deterrents, and would likely result in accidental kills of similar-appearing species that are endangered, such as the ESA-listed Steller sea lion. These critics suggest that more attention be given to modifying fishing practices and fishery management policies to reduce contact between commercial fishermen and marine mammals. One possible means for accomplishing this might involve the creation of marine protected areas that encompass key marine mammal habitats. In particular, animal protection advocates strongly oppose any reinstatement of intentional lethal taking, fearing the increased risks of merely injuring animals and causing significant suffering as shown by the number of live-stranded sea lions that are sent to rehabilitation centers after having been illegally shot.", "With regard to sea otters rather than pinnipeds, Washington State sea urchin fishermen are becoming more concerned about harmful interactions by increasingly abundant sea otters, and may seek some means for limiting or controlling sea otter abundance to benefit the sea urchin fishery. The state lists sea otters as endangered, but no federal protection is afforded this population under the ESA. However, a 1996 stock assessment report prepared under MMPA authority indicated this population was below OSP.

However, the MMPA lacks a comparable program to deal with large incidental takes, other than those by the commercial fishing industry (for more information, see \" Commercial Fishing Interactions with Marine Mammals \"). Related to this, the regulatory burden for protecting marine mammals appears to fall inequitably on different industries. For example, while small incidental take permits are regularly required by NMFS for offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, NMFS does not regulate large commercial vessel traffic under the small incidental take program, despite concerns that serious injury and mortality of cetaceans due to vessel strikes may be significant. Other activities that may \"take\" large numbers of marine mammals by harassment include whale-watching vessels, high-speed ferries, recreational jet skis, and other sources of anthropogenic noise. By statute, small take permits may be issued for periods of as long as five years under regulations, or one year under incidental harassment permits, with congressional report language indicating an intent that such permits be renewable. NMFS claims that most permits limit taking to small numbers of animals by harassment because mitigation measures imposed by NMFS on the activity prevent serious injury or mortality to marine mammals. If it were proposed that the MMPA be amended to address this issue, individuals who might be required to comply with these modified permitting procedures (e.g., jet skis, whale-watching vessels, ocean transport vessels) would likely oppose such a change if the new requirements were viewed as imposing additional or burdensome restrictions on their activities.

Anthropogenic acoustics (e.g., ship traffic, military active sonar, seismic exploration, explosives trials, acoustic harassment devices used by fishermen) permeate the water column and have the potential to affect numerous unseen marine mammals, fish, diving birds, and other marine life. Although it is difficult to measure the potential that noise has to harm or harass unseen animals, the U.S. Navy, the Minerals Management Service, and other agencies have invested considerable time and funds on research to develop monitoring capabilities and to document and quantify the impact from specific noise sources on certain species under known conditions. However, significant information remains lacking on sound impacts on cetaceans, on behavioral and physiological reactions of marine mammals, and on which species are exposed at what depths and distances from sound sources. For this reason, the effect of noise on marine mammals is subject to much speculation, presumption, and misinformation. FWS and NMFS have reacted to issue- or site-specific concerns, generally through the permit process, but they have not issued any guidance or regulations concerning anthropogenic noise, nor have they implemented any systematic monitoring or enforcement programs.", "Some scientists, believing that the benefits of acoustic research may outweigh any potential effect on marine mammals, may propose amending the MMPA to simplify procedures for federal authorization of incidental taking from acoustic noise. As one approach, these scientists suggest that the MMPA might be amended to authorize the regulation of impacts collectively as broad categories or classes of sound-producing activity rather than separate individual actions. Other proposals might include revising the definition of level B harassment (16 U.S.C. \u00a71362(18)(A)(ii)) to be applicable to actions that can reasonably be expected to constitute a significant threat only to marine mammal stocks rather than also to small numbers of individual animals. Reasons offered by some in the scientific community for change include (1) some of the most prevalent anthropogenic noisemakers, including personal watercraft (e.g., jet skis), large high-speed oceangoing ships, and whale-watching vessels, are unregulated; (2) a disproportionate \"harassment\" burden is placed on scientists using acoustics for research (i.e., direct research into the potential effects of sound on marine life is subject to a higher regulation and compliance burden than any other human-made ocean acoustic activity); and (3) human-made sound in almost all cases is neither as loud nor as constant as naturally-occurring ocean activity (e.g., subsea earthquakes, rain on the sea surface, volcanic eruptions, and whale calls themselves).", "The effects on marine mammals by active sonar development and deployment by the military has been of intense concern. Coincident with low-frequency active (LFA) sonar tests conducted by a NATO research vessel in the vicinity, a mass stranding and death of 12 Cuvieri's beaked whales was observed in May 1996 in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Ionia Sea). The mass stranding of at least 15 whales of four species (at least 7 of these animals died) in the Bahama Islands on March 15, 2000, occurred coincidental to U.S. Navy transit and activities in the area. Additional strandings of beaked whales have been observed in conjunction with mid-frequency active sonar exercises in Madeira (2000) and the Canary Islands (2002). A September 2002 beaked whale stranding in the Gulf of California occurred concurrently when a vessel operated by Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory pulsed the ocean with high-powered sound waves to map the lithosphere beneath the ocean floor. More than five years of regulatory attention to deployment of low frequency active sonar by the U.S. Navy, with accompanying legal challenges, culminated in publication of a final rule in July 2002, with letters of authorization required for subsequent deployment. In addition and in recognition of concerns raised in federal court over use of the LFA system and to further its commitment to responsible stewardship of the marine environment, the Navy is preparing a supplemental environmental impact statement on this technology.", "Some animal protection advocates, environmentalists, and scientists characterize many sources of anthropogenic noise in the ocean as increasingly persistent and regular. These critics point to a growing body of evidence, particularly the mass mortalities of beaked whales associated with military active sonar use, as indicative that current mitigation practices are insufficiently protective of marine mammals. Believing that too little is known about the long-term effects of noise on marine mammals, these critics believe a precautionary approach is necessary and oppose any action that could be interpreted as liberalizing the regulation of anthropogenic sources. In addition, these critics are especially concerned with low-frequency sound that is produced at very high pressure levels and is designed to travel thousands of miles through the ocean, as opposed to other anthropogenic noise that dissipates relatively quickly in the ocean. Furthermore, these critics suggest that, rather than exempting acoustic scientists from regulation and permitting additional sources of ocean noise, other sources of non-research-related noise should be more aggressively regulated to reduce this harassment.

Such committees might also be helpful in addressing concerns about alleged misuse of scientific research permits by whale-watching operators, dolphin encounter tour brokers, and others wherein \"paying volunteers\" are recruited to help conduct \"research\" of questionable value.

How to manage these stocks is expected to be an issue during MMPA reauthorization. The issue is seen by some as whether an increasing human population on the West Coast can co-exist with a truly robust pinniped population or whether these pinnipeds will be adversely affected by coastal development and marine resource exploitation or will themselves have an adverse effect on coastal resources.", "While some local residents and fishermen fear that these pinniped stocks may be \"over-populating,\" scientists, environmentalists, and animal protection advocates counter that populations may be merely returning to their historic carrying capacities after over-exploitation diminished their abundance earlier in the 20 th Century.

NMFS has recommended that Congress consider amending the MMPA to create a new framework that would allow state and federal resource managers to immediately address site-specific conflicts involving California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals. In this report, NMFS suggests that a streamlined approach provide procedures for lethal removal of these species where they are harming severely depleted salmonids (including some populations listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA), where they are harming salmonid populations identified as being of special concern by states, and where they are in conflict with human activities. While the MMPA in 16 U.S.C. \u00a71389 already provides for the lethal removal of pinnipeds to protect human safety and fish stocks, federal and state managers view the process for implementing the existing provisions as lengthy and overly cumbersome. Environmental, animal protection, and scientific critics, however, condemn the idea of culls and lethal nuisance animal control as excessive. They believe that such an approach deflects resources from addressing other expensive and contentious human activities that contribute to fish stock declines (e.g., habitat degradation, siltation, water diversions, fish passage at dams, overfishing) and that non-lethal deterrents have not been adequately explored. Furthermore, they express concern that authorizing the killing of marine mammals interacting with wild fish stocks appears counter to the MMPA's mandate to manage on an ecosystem basis.

MMPA funds for such activities are at least an order of magnitude less than the millions of dollars in federal U.S. endangered species funds that are used to foster international cooperation to protect elephants, tigers, rhinoceros, great apes, and other species. Proponents of increased international cooperation argue that no similar program for marine mammals is provided in the MMPA or elsewhere in U.S. law.
