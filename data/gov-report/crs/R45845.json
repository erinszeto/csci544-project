Its purpose was to remove an unintended advantage or windfall that the regular Social Security benefit formula provided to workers who also had pensions from noncovered employment. The regular formula is weighted to replace a greater share of career-average earnings for low-paid workers than for high-paid workers. However, the formula could not differentiate between those who worked in low-paid jobs throughout their careers and other workers who appeared to have been low paid because they worked in jobs not covered by Social Security for many years (these years are shown as zeros for Social Security benefit purposes). The WEP is intended to remove this unintended advantage. ", "Under the WEP, a worker's Social Security benefit is computed using a new formula, rather than the regular benefit formula, which results in a lower initial monthly benefit. The WEP applies to most people who receive both a pension from noncovered work (including certain foreign pensions) and Social Security retired worker benefits based on fewer than 30 years of substantial earnings in covered employment or self-employment. In 2019, the WEP reduces the share of the first $926 of average indexed monthly covered earnings that Social Security benefits replace, from 90% to as low as 40%. That adjustment reduces the associated benefit from $833.40 to as low as $370.40 per month, with a maximum reduction of $463.00. The WEP reduction amount is phased out for workers with between 21 years and 30 years of substantial earnings in employment covered by Social Security. Therefore, the WEP reduction's impact is smaller for workers who have more years of substantial covered employment. In addition, the WEP includes a guarantee that the reduction in the benefit amount caused by the WEP formula is limited to one-half of the noncovered pension."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Dual Entitlement Rule and the Government Pension Offset", "paragraphs": ["In general, Social Security spousal and survivors benefits are paid to the spouses of retired, disabled, or deceased workers covered by Social Security.

The improper payments occurred in part because SSA did not properly impose the WEP and the GPO on dually entitled beneficiaries who also receive a pension based on noncovered employment. In a January 2013 report, SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) identified 20,668 dually entitled beneficiaries in current-payment status whose WEP or GPO reductions were not applied properly. Among them, OIG estimated that SSA has overpaid approximately $349.5 million to 10,546 dually entitled beneficiaries whose WEP reduction was not applied properly and $320.6 million to 10,122 dually entitled beneficiaries whose GPO offset was not imposed correctly. OIG also estimated that SSA overpaid those beneficiaries an additional $231.9 million from 2013 to 2017, and that if no corrective action is taken, SSA might continue overpaying them by approximately $46.4 million annually. In 2018, OIG identified about 7,409 dually entitled beneficiaries with a GPO reduction on their spousal benefits but no WEP reduction on their retirement benefits and 8,127 dually entitled beneficiaries with a WEP reduction on their retirement benefits but no GPO offset on their spousal benefits.", "To prevent further improper payments to dually entitled beneficiaries who are subject to both the WEP and the GPO, in September 2018, SSA planned to generate system alerts for individuals who apply for retirement and spousal benefits when pension information is already available. OIG indicates that the planned alterations to the system, if implemented properly, might effectively prevent additional WEP and GPO overpayments. ", "Improper payments to Social Security beneficiaries affected by the WEP and the GPO also occurred because some beneficiaries fail to report receipt of or changes in their pensions based on employment not covered by Social Security. If a beneficiary is receiving a noncovered pension based on his or her own employment, the beneficiary must provide evidence from the employer or pension-paying agency (e.g., an award letter) that shows the gross periodic pension amount, including the effective date and expected future pension increases. SSA cited GPO errors as one of the most important causes of the increase in the overpayment error rate between FY2016 and FY2017. ", "Several proposals have been made to improve SSA's collection of pension information from states and localities for administering the WEP and the GPO. For example, the President's FY2020 budget includes a proposal for up to $70 million for administrative expenses, $50 million of which would be available to the states, to develop a mechanism to facilitate reporting of information about pensions based on noncovered employment. In addition, a 1998 report from the General Accounting Office (GAO; now called the Government Accountability Office) recommended that SSA obtain public pension data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Table 3 illustrates an example of a worker's Social Security benefits with and without an extension of Social Security coverage on the worker's own employment. Without Social Security coverage, the worker in example 1 might have no Social Security retired-worker benefits ($0), and his or her Social Security spousal benefits ($1,000) would be reduced by the GPO (2/3 of noncovered pension = 2/3\u00c3\u0097$900=$600). In this example, the beneficiary would be affected by only the GPO. If the worker's position became covered by Social Security in midcareer, the Social Security retirement benefits based on his or her own earnings record would become positive (assumed to be $450) and the noncovered component of the pension would decrease accordingly ($450) to reflect fewer years of noncovered employment (example 2). This individual would be subject to both the WEP and the GPO. Consequently, the beneficiary would become dually entitled to both Social Security retirement benefits and spousal benefits, and the spousal benefits would be reduced by both the dual entitlement rule ($450) and the GPO (2/3 of noncovered pension=2/3\u00c3\u0097$450=$300). ", " Table 4 illustrates another example of the Social Security and pension benefits of a beneficiary whose spouse becomes covered under Social Security in midcareer. The beneficiary is assumed to receive Social Security retirement benefits based on his or her own covered earnings and a pension benefit based on noncovered employment, which makes the beneficiary subject to the WEP (example 1). Extending the spouse's Social Security coverage would increase the before-offset spousal benefits from zero to positive, which consequently would result in the beneficiary becoming dually entitled (examples 2 and 3). In example 2, the Social Security spousal benefits ($1,000) would be reduced by the worker's own Social Security benefit under the dual entitlement rule ($600). The Social Security spousal benefits would be further reduced by the GPO (2/3 of noncovered pension=2/3\u00c3\u0097$900= $600), and result in a net spousal benefit of zero (because the spousal benefit cannot be reduced below zero). In example 3, the Social Security spousal benefit ($1,300) is higher than the combined benefit reductions from the dual entitlement rule ($600) and the GPO ($600), thus resulting a net spousal benefit of $100. In all three examples, the beneficiary is affected by both the WEP and the GPO. ", "Although a Section 218 Agreement may result in some potential beneficiaries being subject to both the WEP and the GPO, such an extension of Social Security coverage may also have a reverse effect\u00e2\u0080\u0094future Social Security beneficiaries who might be affected by both provisions without the Section 218 Agreement might become subject to only one provision with such an agreement. For example, a potential dually entitled beneficiary subject to both the WEP and the GPO might be exempted from the GPO if he or she switched from a noncovered position to a covered position and stayed in that covered position for at least five years.
