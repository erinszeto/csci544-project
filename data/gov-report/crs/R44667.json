Since 1938, Congress has amended the FLSA to raise the minimum wage 10 times for a total of 22 rate increases, with periods between increases ranging from 1 to 10 years. An alternative to periodically amending the FLSA to increase the minimum wage would be to index, or link, the federal minimum wage to another variable so that the minimum wage changes automatically when the other variable changes. Indexing the minimum wage provides regular adjustments to and reduces the volatility of minimum wage rates, maintains the relative value of the minimum wage to other economic indicators (e.g., prices), and decouples rate changes from other policy considerations. On the other hand, indexation may also reduce regular oversight of minimum wage changes because it automatically adjusts the rate and changes one part of the FLSA while leaving other parts of the act unchanged subject to congressional action. Although Congress has considered indexing the federal minimum wage at various points, it has not done so.", "The most common proposed indices for the minimum wage include different versions of the Consumer Price Index, personal consumption expenditures, employment costs, and hourly earnings. Based on a review of seven possible indices and a simulation of federal minimum wage rates under different indices, the minimum wage in 2016 would have been highest had it been indexed to average hourly earnings and lowest had it been indexed to personal consumption expenditures. Linking the value of the federal minimum wage to consumer prices would have generally resulted in minimum wages higher than the current rate, depending on the starting point.", "Currently, 17 states and the District of Columbia index (or have enacted laws that will in the future) their state minimum wages to some economic measure.

In general, the FLSA mandates broad minimum wage coverage. It also specifies certain categories of workers who may be covered by other FLSA wage standards, such as workers with disabilities or certain youth workers. The FLSA was enacted because its provisions were meant both to protect workers and stimulate the economy.

Most of the debate in the literature focuses on the impacts of minimum wages on labor market outcomes, such as employment, earnings, poverty, and hours worked. A full discussion of the wide range of issues related to minimum wages is beyond the scope of this report, which focuses on indexation of the federal minimum wage. That is, this report addresses the issue of indexing, or linking, the minimum wage to an economic measure so that the rate would adjust automatically with changes in that economic measure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indexation and the Minimum Wage", "paragraphs": ["Generally, indexation is linking one variable's (e.g., a minimum wage, a benefit) value to changes in another, independent variable (e.g., an average wage, cost of living). For example, a price index is constructed by dividing the price of a market basket of goods and services in a given year by that same basket's prices in a base year. In the case of the minimum wage, indexation would mean the minimum wage rate changes when the index (e.g., prices, wages, costs) changes. If a minimum wage rate is established as a fixed nominal amount and not increased (through either legislative action or indexation), its real value will erode over time due to the tendency of prices and wages to increase over time. That is, relative to other economic indices that may be increasing (e.g., prices, wages, productivity), a nominal wage loses value unless it too is adjusted. In general, to maintain the relative value of a wage over time, that wage may be indexed to some measure in the economy. For this reason, several states, but not the federal government, have attempted to maintain the value of their minimum wage rates by indexing the rate to some measure of inflation. This mechanism provides for automatic changes in the minimum wage over time as the index changes and does not require legislative action to make periodic adjustments. Finally, as will be discussed further in the remainder of this report, most indices that have been operationally tied to minimum wages at the state level aim to keep pace with consumer prices. There have been recent proposals, however, that aim to tie the minimum wage to changes in average or median wage levels.", "As an illustration of indexation, Figure 1 shows the nominal and inflation-adjusted value (in 2016 dollars) of the federal minimum wage since it was enacted in 1938. As will be discussed in greater detail later in the report, there are several possible indices for the minimum wage; the data in Figure 1 illustrate the concept behind indexation using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). As noted, Congress has increased the minimum wage rate 22 times since it was enacted in 1938, from an initial value of $0.25 per hour to its current level of $7.25 per hour. In constant (inflation-adjusted) 2016 dollars, however, the value of the minimum wage has varied from $3.96 (1948) to $10.98 (1968)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "To Index or Not\u2014Considerations", "paragraphs": ["The issue of indexing the federal minimum wage has been a part of the discussion since the FLSA was enacted in 1938.

However, this does not mean the FLSA was amended 22 individual times for purposes of a rate change, nor does it mean that the rate was increased about every four years. Rather, in many instances Congress amended the FLSA and included multiple increases in the minimum wage rate, phased in over a number of years. The frequency of adjustment has not been even in this period. From 1938 to 1978, Congress amended the FLSA (with regard to the minimum wage rate) seven times for a total of 15 rate changes. From 1978 through 2016, Congress amended the FLSA (with regard to the minimum wage rate) three times for a total of seven rate changes. Even within these periods, congressional action has varied. For example, in three FLSA wage rate amendments over 11 years (1966-1977), Congress enacted nearly half (9 of 22) of all the minimum wage rate changes since 1938.", "In part due to the irregular pattern of rate changes, minimum wage increases may represent sizeable percentage increases in a short period of time, especially compared to the changes in the values of the indices that might be used to adjust the minimum wage rate. Those same increases, however, would have been lower on an annual basis had they been spread across multiple years. For example, the minimum wage rate increased from $5.15 to $7.25, or 41%, in the 2007 to 2009 period, compared to a change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) in that period of 6.4%.

That said, a minimum wage rate is one variable among many that affect the standard of living, such as housing costs, food prices, educational opportunities, wage growth, and productivity increases, to name a few. Over time the price of goods and services tends to rise. Thus if the minimum wage rate remains fixed, the real value of the minimum wage will decline over time. Indexation is one method of maintaining the relative value of the federal minimum wage to the price of other goods and services in the economy, while not indexing or increasing it implicitly lowers its relative value over time due to rising prices or wages. On the other hand, requiring congressional action to change the minimum wage rate allows for the role of the minimum wage in the larger context of the economy (e.g., its relationship to poverty) to be considered with each rate change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship to Other Policy Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the 1996 amendments, the amendments to the FLSA that increased the minimum wage were narrowly targeted on increasing the rate (e.g., 1955 amendments); more broadly focused on increasing the rate along with the scope of coverage (e.g., 1966 amendments); focused on the wage rate and various exemptions, such as the tip credit (e.g., 1989 amendments); or some combination of all of these. The 1996 and 2007 amendments, however, included minimum wage rate increases as part of broader legislation that dealt with tax policy, pension rules, and trade policy (1996 amendments) or as part of supplemental appropriations legislation (2007 amendments). In the case of the 1996 and 2007 amendments, the minimum wage increases were explicitly tied to tax provisions for smaller businesses.", "Indexation of the minimum wage would generally decouple rate setting from other policy considerations related to wage setting. If the minimum wage were indexed, the rate itself would adjust periodically rather than being considered on its own as part of a larger legislative vehicle. While indexation could decrease legislative consideration of the minimum wage and would require no congressional action to change the rate, it would also ensure that the rate itself changes without it being tied to unrelated policy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Elements of Indexation", "paragraphs": ["Before discussing possible indexation options, it is worthwhile to note briefly the main elements of minimum wage indexation. While the most important element of indexing a minimum wage is the index itself, there are additional elements that may affect the performance of a minimum wage index.", "Index. The index itself determines the changing value over time of the minimum wage; different indices may vary in growth and volatility. The index also reflects the underlying purpose of an index. That is, should an indexed minimum wage reflect changes in consumer prices, productivity, earnings, economic growth, or some other variable? Initial value . The starting point of indexation affects future values, regardless of the index used. Because there is a tendency for any index (e.g., inflation, wages, growth) to increase over time, the initial value of a minimum wage \"locks in\" past growth. For example, if a minimum wage is set at one point in time and not increased through a period of high consumer price inflation, then it loses real value (i.e., purchasing power in the case of consumer price increases) despite having the same nominal value. If indexation begins after a period of inflation without an adjustment to its initial value, then it locks in the erosion associated with the high inflation, compared to raising the nominal rate and then indexing it going forward. Limits . An indexed minimum wage is by definition tied to changes in another variable. Depending on other considerations (e.g., consumer prices may increase but wages may stagnate), limits may be placed on changes in the index such that a minimum wage is not adjusted downward despite a decline in the index (a \"hold harmless\" provision) or a minimum wage is not allowed to exceed a certain level (e.g., an increase may be the lesser of the change in the index or some other percentage). Triggers . Because an indexed minimum wage reflects changes in one variable, as opposed to multiple variables, indexation policies may include triggers that allow for the consideration of other factors not explicitly in the index. For example, an indexation policy may indicate that if the unemployment rate is above a certain threshold or economic growth below a certain level, then the minimum wage rate will not increase regardless of the change in the index value. Periodicity . Indexation of state minimum wages is typically structured on an annual basis. It is possible, however, to structure adjustment over different periods of times. For example, the recent DOL rule on the overtime exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees includes an automatic adjustment mechanism for the salary threshold that occurs every three years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Minimum Wage Index Options", "paragraphs": ["This section provides an overview of seven possible minimum wage indices, each of which is discussed in more detail below.", "Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), Consumer Price Index Research Series Using Current Methods (CPI-U-RS), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), Employment Cost Index (ECI), Average Hourly Earnings for Manufacturing Workers (AHE-Manufacturing), and Average Hourly Earnings for Production and Nonsupervisory Workers (AHE-Production).", "This is not an exhaustive list; it reflects indices used in the states (see Table A-1 ) or proposed in past or recent legislation (see Table 2 ).

The remaining seven columns show the 2016 value, by index, of the minimum wage had the nominal wage been indexed at the time it was first enacted. For example, if the 1938 minimum wage of $0.25 per hour had been indexed to the CPI-U upon enactment, the federal minimum wage in 2016 would be $4.23 per hour; if it had been indexed from its nominal rate of $1.60 in 1968, it would be $10.98 in 2016.

In addition, four states that will begin using indexation in the future\u2014California, Michigan, Minnesota, and Vermont\u2014use caps that limit increases to the lesser of the index change or a statutory percentage increase. Also, California's and Michigan's indexation policies include triggers that prevent increases in the minimum wage rate based on changes in other economic characteristics (e.g., unemployment in excess of a certain percentage).", "Finally, it is also worth noting that of the approximately 39 localities (cities and counties) with minimum wages above the federal rate, 24 localities currently index the local minimum wage and an additional 11 will begin indexation in the future.
