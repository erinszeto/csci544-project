The basic donor state argument is a relatively straightforward call for what they view as equity or fairness. Donor state advocates generally contend that for too many years they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure, especially the older highway infrastructure in the Northeast.", "Donee state advocates argue that fairness is in the eye of the beholder and should not be separated from needs. They assert that the age of their highway infrastructure, especially in the Northeast, the high cost of working on heavily congested urban roads, and also the limited financial resources of large sparsely populated Western States justify their donee status. They further argue that there are needs that are inherently federal rather than state, and that a national highway network cannot be based solely on state or regional boundaries.", "A number of interest groups and State Departments of Transportation (state DOTs) are expected to propose that reauthorization increase the rate-of-return guarantee (currently 92%) and expand the scope of the statutory guarantee to cover more Federal-Aid Highway Program funding. This may be difficult to achieve in a tight budget environment. The Equity Bonus (EB) program, which is the principal means by which the rate-of-return adjustment is facilitated, is already the largest federal highway program. Others would restructure, modify or eliminate the EB altogether.", "The Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) donor-donee figures indicate that for FY2007 all 50 states were donee states. For FY2006 there were 41 donee states and no donor states fell below a 91% rate-of-return (based on a dollar in-dollar out calculation method). Some donor state advocates argue that this situation is anomalous and have argued for a method of calculation that relies on share percentages, rather than dollars, because this would eliminate the modifying effect of the recent drawing down of the unexpended balances of the HTF.", "Near the end of FY2008, the balance in the highway account of the HTF had fallen to the point that Congress provided for a transfer of roughly $8 billion from the Treasury's general fund to the highway account of the HTF in the hope that the transfer would be sufficient to support the guaranteed funding authorized in SAFETEA for FY2009. This transfer of general fund monies has no connection to the transportation taxes paid by highway users to the HTF and raises questions about basing an equity guarantee primarily on the states' shares of payments to the HTF."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Issue Overview", "paragraphs": ["Historically, transportation policy battle lines have often formed along regional rather than partisan alignments. The regional character of transportation policy is evident in the debate over the need for an equitable distribution of federal highway aid among the states. Since 1982, Congress has included legislative provisions in every surface transportation reauthorization act to address these perceived funding distribution concerns through a variety of rate-of-return guarantee provisions. For many years, some states (mostly Southern as well as some Mid-Western and certain fast growing Western states) have complained that they receive significantly less federal highway aid than their highway users pay in federal highway taxes to the highway account of the highway trust fund (HTF). These states, referred to as donor states, argue that they are not getting their perceived fair share of federal-aid highway spending and have pressed for legislative remedies that would assure them a higher rate-of-return on their tax payments. Donee states, states that receive more federal highway aid than they pay in federal highway taxes, have not opposed equity provisions per se in recent years but have opposed any reduction in their own existing percent shares of total federal highway aid.", "Since the 1970s much of the debate has been data driven. The data used to designate states as either donor or donee have been drawn from Table FE-221 of the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) annual Highway Statistics publication, which estimates states' ratios of contributions to the HTF to the federal highway funding that is made available to them each fiscal year. Data from the most recent (FY2007) Table FE-221 is reproduced in Table 1 of this report.", "The current authorization, under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: a Legacy for Users (SAFETEA; P.L. 109-59 ), expires September 30, 2009. Proposals for reauthorization are expected during the first session of the 111 th Congress. For an overview of reauthorization issues see CRS Report R40053, Surface Transportation Program Reauthorization Issues for the 111th Congress .", "Following a background and overview discussion, this report provides a brief history of the donor-donee issue and its origins. It also describes the existing programmatic rate-of-return guarantee mechanism, the Equity Bonus (EB) Program. The report then discusses issues related to the EB program and possible modifications that may be considered as part of the reauthorization debate. Finally, the report reviews a number of overarching issues related to the donor-donee state debate that could be of interest to Congress during the upcoming reauthorization of SAFETEA.", "A number of characteristics of the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) need to be kept in mind in a discussion of the donor-donee question. First, the federal monies for highway project spending are not provided to states up front. Rather, when amounts are \"distributed\" to the states, it is only a notification of the availability of federal funds. Once a project is approved and the work is started, the states may submit vouchers to the FHWA for reimbursement for the project's costs as, or after, they are incurred. Second, the FAHP is an umbrella term for nearly all the highway programs administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Most of these programs can be described as being either formula (apportioned) programs, which constitute the vast majority of program funding, or discretionary (allocated) programs. The formula programs apportion funds to the State Departments of Transportation (state DOTs) based on formulas set forth in legislation. The discretionary programs are programs nominally under the control of the FHWA that were designed to provide funds to projects chosen through competition with other projects. In recent years, however, most of the discretionary program funding has been earmarked by Congress.", "The distinction between formula and discretionary programs becomes especially significant in the process of creating equity programs, such as the current Equity Bonus Program (EB), that could make states' federal spending rates-of-return on their federal highway taxes more uniform. It is difficult to conceive of how discretionary programs could be constructed to guarantee a designated percent return to states on their payments to the HTF and still remain discretionary. The formula programs were originally created, at least in part, to fulfill perceived policy needs.", "Some highway needs, such as roads on federal lands, border crossing infrastructure, trade corridors, and interstate system maintenance, have inherently federal aspects that would likely not be fully addressed if the Federal-Aid Highway Programs were predicated on a return to all states. Even advocates of devolving the FAHP to the states have acknowledged some federal needs. In addition, donor states themselves have in the past recognized the need for some states to get a larger than normal share of federal-aid funds. During the debate that preceded passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 (ISTEA; P.L. 102-240 ), for example, donor states agreed that large sparsely populated states and some small states (such as Rhode Island, Vermont, and Delaware) should receive larger shares. Authorizers also thought that the sparsely populated \"pass-though\" states had insufficient state resources to build and maintain their parts of the national highway network, so they were given larger shares.", "To deal with these problems in a way that retains these programmatic policy goals and at the same time achieves improvement in the uniformity of states' rates-of-return, Congress has decided to include some programs in the equity programs (such as the current EB) and exclude others. Often referred to as the \"scope,\" the list of programs (as well as how large a percentage of the overall federal highway aid budget they total) that are subject to the equity adjustments, has varied since the first equity program was introduced in 1982. The major formula programs were always within the scope of the equity guarantee. Which other programs were included changed under the various surface transportation authorization acts. The scope of the equity program is important for a number of reasons. First, under a guaranteed share mechanism, the more program dollars left outside the equity program's scope, the more likely that at least some donor states will not reach their minimum percentage return relative to the entire Federal-aid highway program. Second, in general, the more inclusive the equity program's scope, the more costly the program. Third, earmarking of programs within the scope generally provides no new dollars to the state receiving the earmarks. These earmarks simply allow Members of Congress to set project priorities. Earmarks of programs outside the scope actually provide more money to the state getting the earmark. Scope issues are discussed in detail in the \" Overarching Issues for Congress \" section, later in this report.", "The highway account of the HTF is supported by revenue from a combination of a variety of fuel taxes (15.44 cents per gallon for gasoline, 21.44 cents per gallon for diesel and kerosene, and a variety of special fuels taxes, at differing rates) as well as a number of truck taxes including, a heavy tire tax, a truck and trailer sales tax, and a heavy vehicle use tax. Revenues from the fuel taxes are also distributed to the Mass Transit Account (2.86 cents per gallon) and the unrelated Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund (0.1 cents per gallon). All tire, truck and trailer, and heavy vehicle use tax revenues go solely to the highway account.", "Because the federal taxes on fuel are collected at the first point of distribution (at the terminal \"rack,\" usually at a refinery or a fuel tank farm) rather than at the retail level, most of the revenue is collected from a small number of corporations (often large oil companies or distributors that own fuel farms) located in a relatively small number of places. This means that the Treasury has no way of knowing how much fuel tax should be attributed to each state. FHWA has a process to estimate each states share of payments to the highway account. ", "In simplified form, the process of attributing each state's shares to the highway account is as follows:", "The Treasury Department provides the basic national revenue estimates for each kind of tax (gasoline, diesel, special fuels, and truck-related sales, etc.). The FHWA then examines state fuel tax data to produce estimates of on-highway gallons of fuel taxed in each state (use is difficult to track as vehicles can gas up in one state and then travel in another). Each state's on-highway gallons are divided by national total gallons. The resulting distribution is a representation of each state's share of national consumption, measured in gallons. The Treasury's estimates of total revenues received from highway users are then multiplied by the derived state shares of gallons to produce each state's estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. The share of the various truck-related taxes are extrapolated from diesel fuel use in the states. Gathering and compiling the data takes time, usually over a year. This means that the data underlying the state-by-state federal tax payments data is normally two years old when used to determine attribution.", "A number of statistical issues have an impact on the rate-of-return guarantees. The use of non-current data (i.e., revenue estimates from two years prior) may skew the state donor-donee ratios and lead to conclusions about donor or donee status that are questionable. Also, state-by-state data may not always be completely accurate or up to date. The economic cycle can also have an impact on revenues and the budgetary process that can lead to years when revenues and spending levels differ significantly from each other: this can have an impact on relative rates-of-return. As mentioned above, the Equity Bonus and other equity adjustment proposals attempt to achieve a specified \"share\" return based on two year old payments data. Distribution equity, however, is almost always judged by Table FE-221 in the annual FHWA Highway Statistics Report , which compares estimated dollars paid and apportionments and allocations received for the same fiscal year. This statistical disconnect means that even an effective equity program will face criticism when the same year dollar-for-dollar return data are released. In addition, the impact of proposed revenue changes on states' relative shares of payments to the HTF are hard to predict over the life of the reauthorization. These changes can shift some donor states to donee states, or vice versa, over the years. The statistical shifts could also influence the calculation of program size under an equity guarantee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Brief History of the Donor-Donee Issue", "paragraphs": ["The concern by states that federal spending might benefit other states' infrastructure more than theirs has a long history. It was one of the formative forces that led to a federal policy of nonparticipation in road building during the century preceding passage of the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916. In 1808, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin recommended that the federal government provide $20 million over a ten-year period for a national network of canals and roads. The plan, however, was never funded. Among the factors that mitigated against the plan was the view by Southern states, who generally opposed federal grants for roads and canals, that spending would benefit other regions more than the South. The New England states, which had relatively good roads, opposed federal funding for roads, because they expected the money would be spent for roads outside New England. Anticipating these regional concerns, of the $20 million recommended in the report, Gallatin proposed that only $16.6 million be designated for the network of roads and canals. The remaining $3.4 million was to provide benefits to those \"eastern and perhaps southern states,\" which are part of the Union, but \"are less immediately interested in those inland communications,\" provided for in the plan. Even with this incentive, the plan failed to gain sufficient support to be passed. This could, however, be thought of as forerunner of the modern minimum guarantees within the context of the donor-donee debate. The federal government's involvement in road building ebbed to nonparticipation until the 1890s and even then its participation was primarily technical and advisory. Consequently, since there was no federal program, there were no road issues similar to donor-donee issue until after the turn of the Twentieth Century when the \"good roads\" movement gained traction and interest groups began to encourage legislation for federal spending on roads.", "A forerunner of the modern donor-donee argument emerged during the debate on the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 355; hereafter referred to as the 1916 Act). The 1916 Act established the first federal aid to roads on a programmatic basis. An opponent of the Act, Senator Lippitt of Rhode Island, presented a table to his Senate colleagues showing the share of highway spending each state would receive out of each $25 million of road aid provided, in comparison to the share of every $25 million in federal income and corporate tax revenues each states citizens paid. His table indicated that 12 states (except for California, all in the Northeast and upper Midwest), would receive shares of the road aid that were less than the share that they contributed in taxes. According to his table, three states: Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania would together contribute more than 50% of the tax revenue but receive only between 11% and 12% of the road spending. Senator Lippitt's table, however, did not forestall passage of the bill.", "The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 (70 Stat. 387) established the HTF. The impetus was the construction of the Interstate System (IS). Because the rate and timing of construction would vary greatly from state-to-state, the construction of the Interstate System did not lend itself well to arguments in support of an equal rate of return on highway tax payments. Nothing equivalent to the modern donor-donee debate emerged as a major point of contention during the discussions that preceded the passage of the 1956 Act. The federal-state intergovernmental relations conflicts focused more on issues of state or federal preeminence in highway policy, as well as, state concerns that increases in the federal fuel taxes would have a crowding-out effect on states' ability to raise revenues through their own fuel taxes. The passage of the 1956 Act did, however, eventually have an impact on the evolution of the donor-donee issue, because the HTF made it possible to eventually attribute the flows of revenues from states' highway users to the fund.", "For the most part, however, although the argument regarding a fair return on tax payments did not disappear entirely after the passage of the 1916 Act, it did not surface as a major issue until after the first publication of Table FE-221 in the 1972 edition of the FHWA's annual Highway Statistics. The table's publication provided a statistical source that supported concerns about the state \"fair share\" issue that persist to this day. Table FE-221, \"Comparison of Estimated State Payments into and Receipts from the Highway Trust Fund, and Federal-Aid Apportionments,\" published for each state, presented in side-by-side format not only the state payments to and receipts from the HTF, but also the ratio of aggregate payments to receipts for fiscal year 1957 through June 30, 1973. The receipt of federal aid for each dollar paid to the highway trust fund varied greatly from state to state. Alaska appeared to fare best and North Carolina worst at $8.34 and $0.52, respectively. During the 1970s, significant construction was still underway on the Interstate Highway System, and the degree of effort required continued to vary significantly from state to state. This may have, in the minds of some, provided a reasonable justification for the disparity among state rates-of-return. By the early 1980s, however, the interstate system was nearing completion. At the same time, a general perception that U.S. roads and bridges had deteriorated coincided with growing support for increased spending on transportation infrastructure, in part, as an economic stimulus measure.", "The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA; P.L. 97-424 ) included the first attempt to mitigate the dissatisfaction of donor states by providing that each state would receive a minimum core program allocation of 85% of its estimated highway tax payments to the highway account of the HTF (STAA established the mass transit account). Between STAA and SAFETEA all surface transportation reauthorization bills included equity provision modifications changing the rate-of-return guarantee percentages and scope of the various equity programs. For a detailed legislative history of these changes, see Appendix A ."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Donor-Donee State Arguments", "paragraphs": ["The donor state argument is that for the sake of equity each state should receive federal highway funding roughly equal to the fees and taxes that their state's highway users pay into the HTF. Donor state advocates generally contend that they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure, especially of the older highway infrastructure in the Northeast. Most also argue that they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending to the same degree as some donee states. Southern and certain Western donor states also argue that they are fast growth areas, relative to most donee states, and that consequently their needs are as great or greater. Finally, they argue that with the completion of the Interstate Highway System there is no valid rationale for any donor-donee disparity.", "Donee states argue that fairness should not be separated from needs. They assert that the age of their highway infrastructures (especially those in the Northeast), the high cost of working on heavily congested urban roads, as well as the limited financial resources of large, sparsely populated western states justify their donee status. They also argue that some needs exist that are inherently federal, such as a national highway network, that cannot be based solely on state or regional boundaries. Furthermore, donee states argue that Mid-Western and Southern donor states often spend less local and state money on highways than donee states, and chide these donor states for pleading for federal funds when they are unwilling to ante up their own state and local resources.", "Historically there has also been a third view that has challenged the basic concept that states should be entitled to a balance between the federal taxes collected from their citizens, businesses, or highway users versus the federal spending that eventually occurs in the state. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is the only federal program that considers rate-of-return criteria. Those who challenge the basic donor-donee conceptual framework generally refer to studies showing that some highway program donor states are overall donee states in terms of federal tax and spending flows in general, or in other kinds of federal spending such as defense or human service programs. They also argue that rate-of-return mechanisms inherently constrain the federal government's ability to address changing national needs, creating a framework where state and local priorities trump federal priorities. They also point out that, especially in regard to freight, road improvement in some states (such as for ports or freight bottleneck areas) benefit the surrounding states, the region, and the nation as a whole. They argue that such projects' funding decisions should be based on efficiency not equity. In addition, some cast doubt on the mind-set that construction spending, including wages, remains in the state where a project is built by pointing out that construction companies from all over the nation bid for federally funded projects and that construction labor is mobile."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Dilemmas", "paragraphs": ["The 111 th Congress faces difficult policy choices in resolving the seemingly contradictory goals of meeting donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless at a time when the revenue base of the Highway Trust Fund's (HTF) highway account is insufficient (at least in real terms) and is expected by most observers to be insufficient to fund both goals. Part of the problem is that a bill that simply reduces the shares of donee states to increase the shares of donor states would have difficulty overcoming a filibuster by donee states in the Senate. To provide an equitable rate-of-return structure to overcome this obstacle, reauthorization bills have, in past practice, included \"hold harmless\" provisions that maintained certain base shares. This process of bringing donor state shares up to the guaranteed percentage return has required increasing the overall federal highway program size, usually by a large amount (since donee state funding could not be reduced). In other words, providing equity remedies that keep both donor and donee states reasonably content has been accomplished by giving more money to all states, but even more to donor states to meet their guaranteed share requirement, currently 92%. Providing equity in this way is very expensive. The Equity Bonus program (EB) under SAFETEA, in fact, is the largest highway program ($41 billion over the five year life of the bill). Finding sufficient funds to support an equity distribution mechanism is likely to be a major difficulty in reauthorization.", "In a broader sense, the debate over equity remedies has implications for a number of issues. As was referred to earlier, a guaranteed rate-of-return that approaches roughly 95% or higher could leave little room for addressing additional transportation needs that are viewed as uniquely federal, such as the Federal Lands Highway Program or the Interstate Maintenance Program. Further, the role of the federal government vis-a-vis the states comes into question as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%. If the federal government is essentially collecting HTF revenues only to return them to the states with no redistribution, some would argue the need for a federal role is questionable.", "In addition, not all highway funding has originated from the highway user taxes that provide revenue to the highway account of the HTF. Spending originating from the Treasury's general fund has been significant since passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. This is the primary reason that (in Table 1 ) the cumulative ratio of apportionments and allocations to payments to the HTF for FY1957-FY2007 exceeds the 1.0 break-even point by 0.12. This inclusion of general fund monies muddles the rationale for a 1.0 ratio return that underlies the donor-donee debate. The highway user taxes have nothing to do with the revenues that support the Treasury's general fund, which is supported mostly by individual income, corporate income and payroll taxes.

The same is done for the cumulated amounts since FY1957. Assuming that the total national amounts flowing into and from the HTF are equal, if a state receives as much as it pays in, its dollar-in/dollar-out ratio is 1.0. If a state receives less than it pays in, its ratio will be below 1.0 and it may be considered a donor state. If a state receives more than it pays in, its ratio is above 1.0 and it may be considered a donee state. For example, for FY2007 Alabama is estimated to have paid into the HTF $680,178,000 and had apportionments and allocations from the HTF made available to the state totaling $817,468,000. Since Alabama, according to Table FE-221, received more than it paid in, its ratio of 1.20 and for the year it can be considered a donee state (i.e. it received $1.20 for each $1 it paid into the HTF). With a cumulative ratio of 1.12 for the period FY1957 through FY2007, Alabama is also historically a donee state. Using the percentage-in/percentage out calculation method, discussed below, Alabama's ratio for FY2007 is 1.0: Alabama is neither a donor state nor a donee state.", "In recent years, the authorization legislation has been intentionally drawing down what was the unexpended balance of the highway account.

All states had a ratio above 1.0. The excess of spending over payments at the national level is reflected in the grand total for FY2007, which was 1.20. The cumulative grand total (FY1957-2007), however, is not significantly affected by the draw down of the HTF's unexpended balance, yet at 1.12, it is also over the 1.0 level.

They argue that the years when spending exceeds revenues are anomalous and mask the true status of donor states shares of the total relative to those of donee states. To remedy this a second method of calculation has been devised. This method is set forth in the last two columns of Table 1 . The \"relative ratio of apportionment and allocations to payments\" (percentage-in/percentage-out method) is calculated by dividing a state's percentage of total nationwide apportionments and allocations from the HTF by the state's percentage of the total nationwide payments into the HTF to generate a third ratio. Using Arizona in FY2007 as an example, Arizona's payments to the fund were 2.127% of the national total and its apportionments and allocations received from the fund were 1.823% of the national total. Dividing Arizona's percent of total nationwide apportionments and allocations from the fund (1.823) by Arizona's percent of nationwide payments into the fund (2.127) results in a ratio of 0.86. By contrast, Arizona's dollar-in/dollar-out ratio for FY 2007 is 1.03. This percentage-in/percentage-out method eliminates the impact of the spending down of the fund's unexpended balances on the determination of donor-donee status. It also allows donor states to argue that, even in years when in dollar terms they get more than they pay into the fund, they are not getting the share of the total distribution of funds they should be getting because their relative ratio of what they receive to their payments is below 1.0.", "It is important to note that even using the percentage-in/percentage-out method, the cumulative grand total (the extreme right hand column in Table 1) is 1.12, as it is using dollar-in/dollar-out method. This indicates that, even accounting for the recent drawdown of the fund's balances, the federal government has spent more on highways than has been paid into the fund, via highway user taxes and fees, during its existence.", "The outcomes from these differences in the calculation methods are significant, as indicated in Table 2 . For FY2007, using the dollar-in/dollar-out method there were no states that did not have more money made available to them than their highway users paid to the HTF. Using the percentage-in/percentage-out method, however, produces 27 states below the 1.0 ratio. Using the historical data for FY1957-2007, results in 13 states below the 1.0 threshold.", "It is important to keep in mind that a 100% return on payments to all states is considered by most observers to be unrealistic. There are administrative FHWA and other costs to cover and also some programs and activities, for example the Federal Lands Highways Program, that do not lend themselves to effective distribution if based on rate-of-return on state payments to the HTF. During the last two reauthorizations, donor state advocates have pressed for a rate-of-return of 95%. The case can be made by some that a 0.95 ratio is a more realistic benchmark for determining donor state status. Using below a 0.95 ratio as the measure, the number of historical donor states (i.e. FY1957-FY2007 cumulative) drops to 6 using either dollar-in/dollar-out or percentage-in/percentage-out methods. For FY2007, using the dollar-in/dollar-out method, the number of states under 0.95 is 0, while under the percentage-in/percentage-out method, the number of states under 0.95 is 17.", "Some states move back and forth across the donor-donee divide from year to year. HTF revenues are sensitive to the condition of the economy and can have a significant impact in the pattern of payments to the HTF across the states. Some of the results can seem counterintuitive. For example, a donor state may become a donee state because an economic downturn reduces the expenditures on fuel and sales of trucks and heavy tires. Thus, a state may become a donee state not because it is getting more money but because its economy is generating fewer transportation tax revenues for the HTF. This reduces the amount of federal funding needed to bring the state's ratio up to 1.0 (or 0.95 depending on your definition of donor status). Another example that can influence donor-donee status is shifts in fuel use. Gasoline, and diesel fuel have different tax rates and, because of this, shifts in use can influence the amount of revenue produced in a state. A shift from gasoline special fuels, for example, could lead to a drop in overall revenues because some special fuels are taxed at a lower rate.

Roughly 80% of the Federal Transit Administration's funding comes from the mass transit account, with the remaining funding provided by treasury general funds. The distribution of nearly all of these funds is, by formula and by earmark, from the federal government to the individual transit authorities (i.e., it differs from the highway programs which are funded through the state DOTs).

A mass transit 95% guaranteed rate of return would shift large amounts of funding to less densely populated areas where the number of people served would be low and the costs per passenger mile would be high (i.e. would lead to inefficiencies).

Transit donee states may argue that a transit guaranteed rate of return would punish the urban areas that have taken the initiative to build, in some cases before significant federal funding was available, transit systems that are in line with federal policy goals of enhancing urban mobility, reducing fuel consumption, and improving air quality.

The big losers could be California and New York. Interestingly, some states that view themselves as highway donor states are major beneficiaries of the transit program. For example, should California and New Jersey support a donor state position on payments to the highway account of the HTF, they could be in the position of having to oppose a transit minimum guarantee or risk a loss of much more transit funding than they gained through the highway program guarantee. In addition, such a major shift in funding would probably require a major rewriting of the federal transit programs for the programs to make sense as a whole. It would also overturn what many see as the great compromise of 1982 under which the transit account of the HTF was created. Transit dependent states supported an expanded highway program in return."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Devolve the Highway Program to the States?", "paragraphs": ["One approach to the donor-donee controversy that attracted attention during the debate prior to passage of TEA-21, but that has not yet garnered much interest in the current reauthorization debate, would be to simply devolve most of the federal highway program role to the states. The Transportation Empowerment Act ( H.R. 1470 and S. 667 , 105 th Congress), sponsored by former Senator Connie Mack of Florida and former Representative John Kasich of Ohio, would have devolved much of the federal highway program role to the states. Only a program for maintaining the Interstate System, federal lands highways, National Security Highways, Emergency Relief, and a proposed Infrastructure Special Assistance Fund would have remained federal. A four year phase out of 12 cents of the federal gas tax would have corresponded with the declining federal role. States would have had the option of replacing the declining federal taxes with gas tax increases of their own. States would then have had the freedom to spend, or not spend, on their own roads and transit systems as they saw fit.", "Although this proposal garnered some support from advocates of a reduced federal role in transportation, it did not obtain broad support from many governors, state legislatures, or state DOTs, many of whom were wary of the political implications of pushing large replacement gas tax increases through their state legislatures, and at the same time keeping these funds dedicated to transportation. Despite the failure of devolution proposals to be enacted, some would make the case that the closer the EB guarantee gets to 100%, the more sense devolution to the states makes. They would argue that as the guaranteed rate of return increases, the FHWA's role becomes more like a tax collector for the states. The need for and efficiency of the federal government as middleman comes into question. At this time, however, there appears to be limited interest at the state or federal level for any radical change in the federal role in the highway program.", "On the other hand, some argue that, given the nature of the practical politics required to pass surface transportation reauthorization bills, the perceived inequitable nature of the funding distribution relative to payments to the HTF is intractable. From this view, some argue that devolution is the solution to both the rate-of-return inequity in particular and the donor-donee issue as a whole. ", "Appendix A. Legislative History", "Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA)", "STAA ( P.L. 94-424 ) authorized a significant increase in funding for the Federal-Aid Highway system for FY1983-FY1986 and included a provision designed to mitigate the dissatisfaction of donor states by providing that each state would receive a minimum allocation (also known as the minimum guarantee) from the core FHWA programs. Specifically, the bill ordered the FHWA to allocate among the states sufficient funds to assure that each state's total apportionments from the core highway and safety programs (Interstate Highway Substitution, Primary, Secondary, Interstate, Urban, Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation, hazard elimination, and rail-highway crossings, and section 203 of the Highway Safety Act of 1973) would not be less than 85% of the percentage of estimated tax payments each state paid into the highway account of the HTF. These \"equity adjustment\" allocations could be obligated to the core highway programs.", "Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA)", "STURAA ( P.L. 100-17 ) authorized the Federal-Aid Highway Program for FY1987-1991, retaining the 85% minimum allocation, but altering the basis of its calculation. The act revised the calculation to include the allocated (sometimes referred to as discretionary) programs, with the exception of federal lands programs and safety programs. For FY1987 and FY1988 emergency relief funds and interstate construction discretionary funds were not included in the calculation. The act continued the minimum allocation provision established by STAA.", "With the exception of the changes in the treatment of the minimum guarantees, the formulas for allocation of funds under STAA and STURAA remained the same. Minor changes were made in the criteria for awarding discretionary program grants. Emergency Relief and Federal Lands Highways grants continued to be distributed on a project-by-project and needs basis, respectively.", "Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA)", "ISTEA ( P.L. 102-240 ) reauthorized surface transportation programs, including Federal-Aid Highway Programs, for FY1992-FY1997, making major changes in the overall program structure, program formulas, minimum allocation, and other provisions that could impact the state donor-donee ratios. To a great extent, the changes were an outgrowth of the fact that the remaining unfinished portions of the interstate system would be completed under ISTEA. The act also enunciated a broader vision of the mission of federal highway programs to include air quality, alternative transportation, and historic preservation. ISTEA retained the three formula programs that provided funding for the Interstate system (Interstate Construction, Interstate Maintenance, and Interstate Highway Substitution) as well as the Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program. The other formula programs, such as, the Primary System, Secondary System, Urban System, and Urban Transportation Planning, were replaced by the National Highway System Program, the Surface Transportation Program, and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. The distribution criteria for projects under the discretionary programs remained the same except that the Interstate Construction Program (renamed the Interstate Discretionary Program) was changed to be at the discretion of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the Interstate 4R (for resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitation, and reconstructing lanes on the Interstate System) program funds were now a set-aside within the new National Highway System Program.", "Equity Adjustment Provisions", "ISTEA included five provisions, with separate funding, designed to assure a more equitable distribution of federal funds to the states.", "The 90% Guarantees", "The act raised the minimum allocation to 90% of estimated state contributions to the highway account of the HTF (although narrowing its calculation to the core formula programs, scenic byways, safety belt and motorcycle safety grants).", "The act also included a new minimum payments guarantee (of a broader scope than the minimum allocation discussed above) that assured that each state's apportionments (for the core formula programs) for the fiscal year and allocations (to the discretionary programs) from the previous year would be at least 90% of its estimated state contributions (i.e., calculated from all programs except special projects).", "Donor State Bonus", "For each fiscal year, donor states were identified by comparing projected contributions to the HTF with the apportionments to be received that year by each state. Under the donor state bonus, starting with the state with the lowest return, each state was brought up to the level of the state with the next highest level of return. This was repeated successively for each state until the ISTEA authorized program amount was exhausted.", "Hold Harmless", "This provision set a specific percentage that each state was to receive from the core formula highway programs plus Federal Lands Highway Programs, minimum allocation, donor state bonus, and Interstate Reimbursement. Each state received an addition to its regular apportionments to raise its total to the set percentage.", "Reimbursement for Interstate Segments", "ISTEA authorized $2 billion for FY1996 and FY1997 to reimburse each state for the costs to them of building segments of the Interstate System without federal assistance prior to or during the early days of the Interstate Construction Program.", "Despite all of the above provisions significant gaps remained among states on their share return on contributions to the HTF. As reauthorization of ISTEA approached, dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the equity provisions led to challenges to the ISTEA program paradigm.", "Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21)", "The reauthorization debate that preceded passage of TEA-21 ( P.L. 105-178 ) included a wide range of views on the donor-donee state issue and is worth reviewing because all the major underlying arguments that had emerged over time, reemerged during the TEA-21 debate. Significant characteristics of the debate included a greater, primarily regional role and virtually no role for party affiliation. Also in play were different philosophies of the appropriate role of the federal government vis-a-vis the states, differing views of whether the completion of the Interstate Highway system should trigger a reduction in federal involvement in highway construction; how national highway needs criteria can fit a return-on-the-tax-dollar view, and the influence of a large increase in gas tax revenue to the HTF on program structure.", "Regional Conflict Over Funding", "Under ISTEA, Southern and Mid-Western States made up most donor states while Northeastern, Pacific coast, and large sparsely populated Western States made up most of the donee states. In general, donee states were satisfied with the distribution under ISTEA and supported the \"ISTEA works\" legislation that, in general, adhered to the ISTEA funding formulas. Most of the donor states joined \"STEP-21,\" a coalition whose centerpiece proposal was a guarantee that each state receive at least a 95% return on its estimated contribution to the highway account of the HTF. The dominance of regional differences over party affiliation was reflected on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, where the Republican committee leadership supported the donee friendly \"ISTEA works\" bill while a Republican colleague, sponsored the Streamlined Transportation Efficiency Program for the 21 st Century (STEP 21) which included the 95 cents on the dollar guarantee, as well as program formula changes supported by donor states.", "Devolution", "What most observers considered a more radical approach was the Transportation Empowerment Act, sponsored by Senator Connie Mack of Florida and Representative John Kasich of Ohio.

The main reason for this was the large increase (roughly 40%) in overall funding levels. Still there were equity provisions that were included in the hope that they would narrow the donor-donee divide.", "Minimum Guarantee", "The TEA-21 minimum guarantee had three components:", "Guaranteed Base Share", "TEA-21 guaranteed each state a percentage share (set forth in a table in 23 U.S.C. 105) of the total program, defined as all the apportioned programs: Interstate Maintenance Program (IM), National Highway System Program (NHS), Surface Transportation Program (STP), Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP), Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program (CMAQ), Metropolitan Planning, Recreational Trails Program, Appalachian Development Highway System Program and Minimum Guarantee, as well as High Priority Projects.", "Minimum 90.5% Share on Contributions", "All states were guaranteed at least 90.5% return (up just 0.5% over ISTEA) on their share of tax contributions to the highway account of the HTF (based on the most recent year for which the data are available \u2014 generally from two fiscal years before). Using Ohio as an example, of total FY2001 highway account contributions, Ohio's percentage share contributions amounted to 3.7578%. Ohio was guaranteed 90.5% of its share of estimated FY2001 contributions and was thus guaranteed a minimum share of 3.4008% of the FY2003 apportionments (i.e., the core formula programs), plus High Priority Projects and the Minimum Guarantee itself. If the above base share was less than a 90.5% return to a state then the share was adjusted upward until the 90.5% share was reached. The money to raise shares to 90.5% was provided by \"squeezing\" down the percentages (but not the total amounts) of those states that were above the minimum.", "Minimum State Payment", "Each state was guaranteed that as part of the minimum guarantee it would receive at least $1 million in Minimum Guarantee funds.", "It is important to keep in mind that the TEA-21 Minimum Guarantee was a compromise provision. It was constructed in such a way as to give money to all states in the process of bringing the donor states up to the 90.5% minimum guarantee. Each state received the $1 million minimum. Then, the lowest percent share of any state or the District of Columbia (generally the District) was used to extrapolate the total program funding (as defined under Minimum Guarantee) needed for the District to retain its total program percentage. For example, using FY2003, because the District's program level percent share of 0.3860% was lower than the District's percentage of total apportionments (roughly 0.5%), high priority projects, and $1 million guarantee, and because no money could be taken back, the only way to achieve the District's 0.3860 % was to raise the national total. To achieve that percentage for the District, a total FY2003 program size of $27.76 billion was needed. The total Minimum Guarantee program funding needed to achieve this total was over $6 billion. Ironically, the degree of the District's donor status meant more money for all states (in absolute, not relative terms).", "Minimum Guarantee Distribution", "Each year, the first $2.8 billion of Minimum Guarantee funds were administered as STP funds (see STP discussion below) except that set-asides for Transportation Enhancements, Safety Construction, and certain population-based sub-state allocations did not benefit from this distribution. Any Minimum Guarantee funds above $2.8 million were distributed to the five core programs: STP, Interstate Maintenance (IM); Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP); National Highway System (NHS); Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ). The distributions to the states were based on the ratio of each core program's apportionment to the total apportionment of all five programs for each state.", "Program Formula Changes", "TEA-21 also included formula changes that were perceived as benefitting donor states.", "Interstate Maintenance Program", "TEA-21 reduced the weight given each state's share of total Interstate Highway System lane miles and total state share of Interstate System vehicle miles traveled to 1/3 each and created a third weighed category that provided the final 1/3 be distributed based on each state's percent share of annual contributions to the HTF attributable to commercial vehicles. This final weighted third was expected to benefit donor states.", "Surface Transportation Program", "STP's apportionment formula under TEA-21 was weighted 35% to estimated state share of tax payments paid into the highway account of the HTF. This also was expected to benefit donor states. State share of total lane miles of Federal-aid highways (25%) and share of total vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways (40%) were the other weighted attributes in the STP apportionment formula.", "National Highway System Program", "TEA-21's NHS apportionment formula was weighted at 30% of a state's share of diesel fuel used on highways. Some observers expected that this would also benefit donor states.", "The Resolution of the TEA-21 Donor-Donee Debate", "In the end, what many observers had predicted would be a major battle between donor and donee states was resolved relatively amicably. This occurred despite the donor states only being able to achieve a 0.5% increase in the minimum guarantee percentage and formula changes, which some predicted would have little impact on donor state returns on the tax revenues these states paid to the highway account of the HTF. Some even argued that donor states would have been better off if TEA-21 had retained the ISTEA formulas. In the case of TEA-21, what alleviated the concerns of STEP-21 and other donor state advocates was the amount of money available during TEA-21's lifetime. By shifting, in 1997, revenues generated by the 4.3 cent deficit reduction gas tax to the HTF, Congress was able to provide large increases in highway funding for all states. The extra money made the donor-donee debate less urgent to the donor states. As the TEA-21 authorization neared its expiration (FY2003), however, the donor-donee state issue resurfaced.", "TEA-21 created a so-called \"firewall\" around the highway account to prevent highway account funds being used for non-highway purposes. It also required that spending from the highway account approximately equal the revenues flowing into the account on an annualized basis. To make sure that annual spending and revenues were roughly equal each year, the Act provided for Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to be distributed proportionally across all states to maintain a balance of spending and revenue flows. Although these changes did not affect the operation of the TEA-21 minimum guarantee they did have an overall impact on the availability of funds to support the minimum guarantee program, which was funded on a \"such sums as necessary\" basis.", "Appendix B.
