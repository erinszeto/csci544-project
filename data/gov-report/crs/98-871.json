The U.S. educational system has a long history of attempted education reforms. One particular report that received considerable attention was released in 1983 by the Department of Education (ED). The report, A Nation At Risk, attacked the school system, declaring that U.S. schools were sinking under a \"rising tide of mediocrity,\" partly as a result of a shortage of qualified teachers in science, mathematics, and other essential disciplines. More than 25 years after the report, there is some debate as to whether or not our educational system is still \"at risk.\"", "Reforms in science and mathematics education have focused on both what to teach and how to teach it. A 1998 publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Blueprints for Reform - Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education , presented goals for science, mathematics, and technology literacy. The goals offered multidisciplinary instructions in the real world, structured so students would use the discovery process to study issues that are multidimensional, to arrive at alternative approaches, and to be able to anticipate both positive and negative consequences of their choices.", "In 2000, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) released a revised Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, which described how students should be taught to solve non-routine problems in meaningful context. The NCTM standards promoted the policy of students learning through induction rather than memorization, directing the instructional process on inquiry as opposed to the traditional tell-and-test approach, and promoting assessment methods that are open-ended instead of machine-scoreable. More recently, a 2005 report of the Fordham Institute states that \"While state standards are very much in flux, the nation, in its entirety, is neither making progress nor losing ground when it comes to its expectations for what students should learn in science.\"", "The ongoing discussions of reform in science education stressed the importance of inquiry-based instruction as the most beneficial in assisting students to think critically, to work independently or cooperatively, and to solve problems as they encounter them in different and novel situations. In 2002, the National Research Council released its publication, Investigating the Influence of Standards, A Framework for Research in Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education. The report examined two primary questions: (1) How has the system responded to the introduction of nationally developed mathematics, science, and technology standards?, and (2) What are the consequences for student learning?

The NAEP 2007 mathematics assessment was based on a framework that was developed through a comprehensive national consultative proces s. The results are reported according to three basic achievement levels\u2014basic, proficient, and advanced.

For 8 th grade students, there was no significant change in overall scores in 2005 from the previous assessments. For 12 th graders, there was no change in performance from the administration in 2000. However, in 2005, 12 th graders received lower average scores than in 1996.

The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) for grades 4 and 8, conducted in 2007, investigated mathematics and science curricula, instructional practices, and achievement in 59 countries (at either the 4 th or 8 th grade level or both). Results at grade 4 showed that in mathematics, U.S. students scored higher than those in 23 of the 36 participating countries, lower than in eight countries (all eight were in Asia or Europe) and not significantly different than the average scores of students in the remaining four countries. Hong Kong SAR was the top performing jurisdiction in mathematics at the 4 th grade level, followed by Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, England, Latvia, Netherlands, and Lithuania.

However, there is the counter argument that due to refinement in collection of data and methodological procedures employed in the analyses, the comparisons are valid for the student populations examined. ED estimates that the United States spends approximately $455.0 billion annually for elementary and secondary education. What is puzzling to some is with that level of funding, how can the U.S. system of education with graduate schools considered to be the best in the world, a system that produces some of the best scientists and engineers, also produce some students in elementary and secondary schools who perform less well on international measures?

All disciplines have been targets, however, considerable importance is placed on graduates in the natural sciences, engineering, health sciences, computer sciences, and other quantitatively-based fields.", "One challenge facing research institutions is that of finding a balance between the basic academic activities of teaching and research. Within the scientific and engineering disciplines, attempting to find the flexibility to blend the priorities of teaching and research has been a perennial problem. The standing of an institution is in direct relationship to the research productivity of its faculty, and the competition for grants and scholars has led many research institutions to place increased emphasis on research at the expense of teaching. In many research institutions, research productivity has been given more weight than teaching effectiveness when deciding tenure or promotion. Efforts are underway at some institutions to change the reward system and evaluation of their faculty members.", "An additional challenge for research universities is the need to address the complaints concerning undergraduate teaching. Many of these complaints are focused on the use of graduate students as teaching assistants in the undergraduate programs, especially in the science and engineering disciplines. A considerable number of undergraduate courses in science and engineering are taught by foreign graduate students who do not have a good command of the English language. Reinventing Undergraduate Education found that \"...

The report noted that colleges and universities are being held far more accountable for the education of their students than in the past. Institutions with peer review mechanisms to evaluate faculty research in science, mathematics, and engineering, should have the same of attention directed at evaluating the faculty teaching in those disciplines. The public and private sectors that make significant investments in university research suggested that faculty members excelling in the classroom should be recognized and rewarded similar to those faculty engaged in research.", "The report recommended strategies for evaluating undergraduate teaching and learning in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology. The methods used for evaluation could serve as a basis for the professional advancement of faculty. Faculty are encouraged to set definitive goals for their students and then determine if the goals are being met. In addition to the faculty, recommendations for evaluating teaching and learning were made for presidents, boards, and academic officers; deans, department chairs and peer evaluators; and for research sponsors and granting and accrediting agencies. The recommendations were based on the following tenets:", "Effective postsecondary teaching in science, mathematics, and technology should be available to all students, regardless of their major. The design of curricula and the evaluation of teaching and learning should be collective responsibilities of faculty in individual departments or, wherever appropriate, through interdepartmental arrangements. Scholarly activities that focus on improving teaching and learning should be recognized as bona fide endeavors that are equivalent to other scholarly pursuits. Scholarship devoted to improving teaching effectiveness and learning should be accorded the same administrative and collegial support that is available for efforts to improve other research and service endeavors.", "On March 15, 2006, the House Science Committee held a hearing to explore the efforts of colleges and universities in improving their scientific and engineering programs. The Committee was interested also in what role the federal government could play in encouraging more students to enter the science, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Witnesses testified about the factors that shape the quality of undergraduate reforms in the scientific and engineering disciplines. Elaine Seymour, University of Colorado, contends that there is a decline in the perceived value of teaching. Teaching as a career is believed by many undergraduates as being of low status, pay, and prospects. Also, faculty in many institutions are more focused on research than teaching. Academic success is measured by grant writing and publications. In many science and engineering departments, a portion of faculty salary is from research grants. As a result, there is less interactive teaching by many faculty and more \"straight lecturing.\" Many classes become the responsibility of teaching assistants. In numerous surveys, students have indicated that \"poor teaching\" and \"unsatisfactory learning experiences\" were the primary reasons for switching majors and leaving the sciences. Seymour states that the institutional reward system and the pressure to obtain grants have consequences for both undergraduate and K-12 education in the science, mathematics, and engineering.", "John Burris, President, Beloit College, testifying before the March 15 hearing, offered several recommendations as to how the federal government can identify, assess, and disseminate that which works in undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering programs. He suggested that with the proposed doubling of the NSF budget over the next ten years, there should be a doubling of the funding targeted specifically for strengthening and sustaining undergraduate programs in colleges and universities. Burris stated that \"Significant parts of what works are: I) attention to how students learn; ii) an institutional culture that has a common vision about the value of building research-rich learning environments; and iii) faculty who are eager to remain engaged within their disciplinary community, and who have the resources of time and instrumentation to do so.\" He suggested that the increased funding be directed at networks, collaborations, and partnerships. He further called for the establishment of a taskforce to oversee the proposed doubling of undergraduate funds. The task force would be charged with outlining NSF undergraduate priorities that are contained in the numerous reports calling for the federal government to strengthen and reenergize investments in science and engineering education.", "A September 2006 report on the future of higher education states that while our colleges and universities have much to applaud for in their achievements, there are areas where improvements are needed.

The committee's actions led to the release of the 1995 report, Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers. The report stated:", "The three areas of primary employment for PhD scientists and engineers\u2014universities and colleges, industry, and government\u2014are experiencing simultaneous change. The total effect is likely to be vastly more consequential for the employment of scientists and engineers than any previous period of transition has been.... A broader concern is that we have not, as a nation, paid adequate attention to the function of the graduate schools in meeting the country's varied needs for scientists and engineers. There is no clear human-resources policy for advanced scientists and engineers, so their education is largely a byproduct of policies that support research. The simplifying assumption has apparently been that the primary mission of graduate programs is to produce the next generation of academic researchers. In view of the broad range of ways in which scientists and engineers contribute to national needs, it is time to review how they are educated to do so.\"", "COSEPUP had solicited responses concerning the existing structure of graduate education from such groups as: postdoctoral researchers, professors, university officials, industry scientists and executives, representatives of scientific societies, and graduate students themselves. The general sentiment was that while the basic structure of graduate education was sound, some change was warranted in order to respond to \"changing national policies and industrial needs.\"", "COSEPUP presented a national strategy that was intended to emphasize both versatility and information. One recommendation in the report was that graduate programs should provide a wider variety of career options for their students. This could be accomplished in a program that has a student grounded in the fundamentals of one field that is enhanced by a breadth of knowledge in a related field. Added to such a program would be off-campus experiences exposing the student to the skills requested by an increasing number of employers: the ability to communicate complex ideas, and the experiences of working in groups of interdependent workers. Another recommendation offered to foster versatility in graduate programs was to have those entities providing financial assistance to graduate students adjust their support mechanisms to include new education and training grants.

Some of the many issues examined by the NSB were: (1) the relative merits of fellowships and traineeships; (2) the role of graduate students as teachers; (3) the mentoring of graduate students; (4) access to faculty and time to degree; (5) and the continuing underrepresentation of minorities and women in many areas of graduate science and engineering programs. The NSB identified several areas of concern in the federal/university partnership where adjustments \"may enhance the capacity of the enterprise to serve the national interest in a changing global environment.\" The NSB noted that because of changes over the past 50 years, such as increased demand for higher education, the need to respond to advances in communications and information technology, rising tuitions and administrative burdens, and stresses on universities and faculty, require changes and improvement in the federal/university partnership.", "One of the stresses confronted by university partnerships, as discussed by the report, is the unintended consequences of federal policies. The increased federal investment in research and education has come with increased oversight and accountability of funding. The report states that", "The growing Federal focus on accountability tends to emphasize short-term research \"products\" and to de-emphasize benefits to graduate education from engaging in research at the frontiers of knowledge. Increased emphasis on accountability also may result in an increase in the perceived value of postdoctoral researchers compared with graduate students on research grants, thus reducing options for cutting-edge research experience during graduate training.", "The recommendations posed by the NSB placed increased emphasis on the expansion of the partnership to include a wider range of colleges and universities, the integration of research and education, increased flexibility of job opportunities outside of academia, and diversity in graduate education. It recommended that the federal government promote closer collaboration between research and non-research institutions, and to provide greater exposure to both faculty and students to research experiences and opportunities. To address the concern of the narrowness of graduate education, the report suggested that, in addition to the core training, the student should be provided with additional training options that might include interdisciplinary emphasis, teamwork, business management skills, and information technologies. The NSB proposed to reward institutions that established model programs for the integration of research and education.", "A 2005 report of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, The Responsive Ph.D., Innovations in U.S. Doctoral Education , analyzed the findings of several studies on doctoral education and detailed the most effective practices from leading doctoral institutions. One of the challenges discussed in the report is the need to combine traditional research with \"adventurous\" scholarship within and across disciplines. Effective, inclusive, and more relevant training of the doctoral student requires extending knowledge beyond the walls of the institution and the major discipline. Also, the report contends that graduate schools require a significantly stronger central administration and structure that currently exists. A graduate school should guard against operating in isolation within an institution, and instead, create a graduate community of \"intellectual cohesiveness\" across disciplines. A theme contained in all the reports reviewed was that for reasons of equity and efficacy, there is a need to broaden and reinvigorate efforts to increase the participation of underrepresented minority groups in the sciences. Some recommendations for action offered by the report include:", "Doctoral students need both departmental and extra-departmental structures to give their concerns a strong and effective voice and to cultivate graduate student leadership as a component of graduate education and professional development. Information about doctoral education, program expectations, and career prospects must be more transparent to students from the moment they begin to consider a Ph.D. Doctoral programs urgently need to expand their approaches to mentoring, such as through team mentoring, particularly for attracting and retaining a diverse cohort of students.", "The Council of Graduate Schools released a report in April 2007 describing the relationship between graduate education and American competitiveness and innovation. The report stated that: \"[A]s our world flattens, we face new and growing competition.\" It maintains that our nation is in jeopardy of losing its highly trained scientific and technical workforce that is required for economic dominance. The number of scientific papers published by U.S. citizens has remained constant for more than a decade in comparison to a 30.0% increase registered by other countries. In addition, the report suggests that the United States lags behind other countries in providing support and investments in graduate education and in attracting scientific talent.

The degrees earned by Hispanics remained almost level, 2.8% in 2000 and 2.9% in 2006. As at the other two degree levels, Native Americans' proportion remained at less than 1%. Asian/Pacific Islanders reported a decrease in earned degrees, from 6.6% in 2000 to 5.9% in 2006. Whites also reported a decrease in earned degrees, from 51.8% in 2000 to 42.4% in 2006. Doctoral degrees awarded to foreign students increased from 29.5% in 2000 to 38.6% in 2006.", "While minorities have increased their share of degrees awarded in the sciences, poor preparation in science and mathematics is said to be a major factor limiting the appeal of science and engineering to even larger numbers of these groups. A large number of blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans lack access to many of the more rigorous college preparatory courses. Enrollment in college preparatory track or courses offers a student a better chance at being accepted at a college through her/his performance on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or American College Testing (ACT), and a better chance at success in college. Despite gains in the past 10 years, the average scores made by blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, who take both the SAT and the ACT continue to fall behind the average scores of whites and Asian students who take the test.", "In addition to recruitment as a problem for greater minority participation in science and engineering, retention of minorities in the educational pipeline, once recruited, also is of concern. (Attrition rates for blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans are higher than for whites or Asians). Currently, these underrepresented minority groups are reporting increased enrollments in colleges and universities and in their share of science and engineering degrees. However, there is concern that some of the programs in the universities to attract minorities to the sciences have come under attack as a result of the limitations currently imposed on affirmative action in higher education. In an effort to avoid the threat of litigation or complaints, many institutions no longer target programs solely to minority groups or use race-based eligibility criteria in awarding fellowships or participation in academic enrichment programs. These programs that were formerly race-exclusive, have been opened to all students \"... to serv[e] the broader and more abstract goal of promoting campus diversity.\" Most institutions have renamed their \"minority\" offices and programs as \"diversity\" or \"multicultural\" offices and programs.", "Women are also found to be underrepresented in selected science and engineering disciplines. Although enrollment in rigorous course work and advanced placement classes in high school has increased for women in more than 10 years, there is still a need to strengthen the course taking and persistence of women all along the educational pipeline. Data reveal that in 2005, women were awarded approximately 50.5% of the undergraduate degrees in science and engineering, a slight decrease from 50.8% in 2002. The number of women who persist in the science and engineering disciplines to the graduate level shows a decline. In 2005, 39.5% of the doctorate degrees in science and engineering were awarded to women, almost level with the 39.2% in 2002. Disaggregated data find that these awards were concentrated in selected disciplines. In 2005, women were awarded 22.5% of the doctorate degrees in engineering, 26.7% in the physical sciences, and 19.8% in computer sciences. The proportion for these awards earned by women in 2002 were 17.5%, 26.6%, and 20.6%, respectively. In the social and behavioral sciences, women earned 55.0% of the doctorates in 2005, an increase from the 54.4% in 2002. There was even more significant participation by women in psychology. Women were awarded 68.0% of the doctorates in psychology in 2005, and 66.7% in 2002.", "Shirley Ann Jackson, President, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, states that in the \"altered environment\" resulting from the Supreme Court decisions, the nation is challenged more than ever to confront the changing demographics. Blacks, Hispanics, and women, groups underrepresented in the science, engineering, and technical disciplines, comprise more than 66% of the entire workforce. It is expected that this \"new majority\" will replace the impending retiring scientific and engineering workforce which is largely white and male. Jackson notes that:", "[W]e are experiencing pressure to replace the graying science and engineering workforce with new talent\u2014educated young scientists and engineers who will make the discoveries and innovations which have paid off so handsomely, to date.... While the recent Supreme Court decisions uphold diversity, they force us to come at things in a different way. We must come up with solutions for developing science and engineering talent\u2014solutions that address the new and coming realities of the underrepresented minority becoming the underrepresented majority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Science and Engineering Students92", "paragraphs": ["The increased presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs has been and continues to be of concern to some in the scientific community. Enrollment of U.S. citizens in graduate science and engineering programs has not kept pace with that of foreign students in those programs. NSF data reveal found that first-time, full-time science and engineering graduate enrollment of foreign students in science and engineering disciplines increased by approximately 16.0% from 2005 to 2006. The increase for U.S. citizens and permanent resident students during this same academic year was slightly more than 1.0%. In addition to the number of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs, a significant number of university faculty in the scientific disciplines are foreign, and foreign doctorates are employed in large numbers by industry.", "NSF data reveal that in 2005, the foreign student population earned approximately 34.7% of the doctorate degrees in the sciences and approximately 63.1% of the doctorate degrees in engineering. In 2005, foreign students on temporary resident visas earned 20.6% of the doctorates in the sciences, and 48.6% of the doctorates in engineering.

Some argue that U.S. universities benefit from a large foreign citizen enrollment by helping to meet the needs of the university and, for those students who remain in the United States, the Nation's economy.", "Foreign students generate three distinct types of measurable costs and benefits. First, 13 percent of foreign students remain in the United States, permanently increasing the number of skilled workers in the labor force. Second, foreign students, while enrolled in schools, are an important part of the workforce at those institutions, particularly at large research universities. They help teach large undergraduate classes, provide research assistance to the faculty, and make up an important fraction of the bench workers in scientific labs. Finally, many foreign students pay tuition, and those revenues may be an important source of income for educational institutions.", "Some argue that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers has resulted in depressed job opportunities, lowered wages, and declining working conditions for U.S. scientific personnel. While many businesses, especially high-tech companies, have recently downsized, the federal government issued thousands of H-1B visas to foreign workers. There are those in the scientific and technical community who contend that an over-reliance on H-1B visa workers to fill high-tech positions has weakened opportunities for the U.S. workforce. Many U.S. workers argue that a number of the available positions are being filled by \"less-expensive foreign labor.\" Those critical of the influx of immigrant scientists have advocated placing restrictions on the hiring of foreign skilled employees in addition to enforcing the existing laws designed to protect workers. Those in support of the H-1B program maintain that there is no \"clear evidence\" that foreign workers displace U.S. workers in comparable positions and that it is necessary to hire foreign workers to fill needed positions, even during periods of slow economic growth.", "The debate on the presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and the workforce intensified following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It has been reported that foreign students in the United States are encountering \"a progressively more inhospitable environment.\" Concerns have been expressed about certain foreign students receiving education and training in sensitive areas. There has been increased discussion about the access of foreign scientists and engineers to research and development (R&D) related to chemical and biological weapons. Also, there is discussion of the added scrutiny of foreign students from countries that sponsor terrorism. The academic community is concerned that the more stringent requirements of foreign students may have a continued impact on enrollments in colleges and universities.

This legislation included components of other competitiveness bills introduced during the 110 th Congress. The COMPETES Act authorized $33.6 billion for FY2008 through FY2010 for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology programs across the federal government. Among other things, it directed the NSF to expand the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship and the Graduate Research Fellowship programs, and to establish a clearinghouse of programs related to improving the professional science master's degree. To address the need to expand the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, the COMPETES Act supported a program for mentoring to women interested in pursing degrees in science, mathematics, and engineering. In addition, it required the NSF to establish teacher institutes that are focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. These are to be summer institutes and are to provide professional development for teachers at the precollege level teaching in high-need subjects and in high-need schools.", "Legislation during the 111 th Congress includes H.R. 1709 , STEM Education Coordination Act of 2009. This bill would establish a committee under the National Science and Technology Council with the responsibility of coordinating STEM activities and programs for all federal agencies. The committee would provide a five-year STEM education strategic plan for the participating agencies that includes annual and long-term objectives, and the metrics used to assess progress in obtaining the objectives. In addition, the committee would provide a description for the role of each agency in supporting programs and activities designed to achieve the objectives. H.R. 461 , 10,000 Trained by 2010 Act, would authorize funding for competitive grants to generate innovative approaches in the health care information fields.

H.R. 1144 , Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Act, would, among other things, increase awareness of and overcome gender bias in academic science and engineering through research and training. The bill would develop a uniform policy for each federal science agency to conduct workshops directed at educating program officers, grant review panel members, and others about methods that reduce the effects of gender biases in evaluation of research grants.
