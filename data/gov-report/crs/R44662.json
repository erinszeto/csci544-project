In its November 1, 2012, meeting, MedPAC commissioners voted to recommend that the ambulance add-on payments not be extended. This recommendation (and others concerning Medicare's ambulance payments) was included in MedPAC's June 2013 report to Congress. ATRA Section 604 extended the 2% urban add-on payment and the 3% rural add-on payment until January 1, 2014, and required HHS to study existing cost reports for ambulance services furnished by hospitals and critical access hospitals and the feasibility of obtaining cost data on a periodic basis to assess the appropriateness of ambulance add-on payments. The HHS study concluded that existing cost reports are not an effective approach to collect data to inform ambulance payment policy due to numerous limitations of such data. HHS also concluded that although it is technically feasible to collect more complete and detailed cost data on a periodic basis, it would be difficult to develop a standard cost-reporting tool given the wide variety of characteristics of ambulance providers and suppliers.
