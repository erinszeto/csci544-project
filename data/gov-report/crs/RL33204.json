In addition, an understanding of the interplay of market forces overtime contributes to flexibility in making policy for what may be short-term market phenomena. Thegeneral price level of an agricultural commodity, whether at a major terminal, port, or commodityfutures exchange, is influenced by a variety of market forces that can alter the current or expectedbalance between supply and demand. Many of these forces emanate from domestic food, feed, andindustrial-use markets and include consumer preferences and the changing needs of end users;factors affecting the production processes (e.g., weather, input costs, pests, diseases, etc.); relativeprices of crops that can substitute in either production or consumption; government policies; andfactors affecting storage and transportation.

International market conditions are also importantdepending on the \"openness\" of a country's domestic market to international competition, and thedegree to which a country engages in international trade.", "Local Supply and Demand Conditions. Differences in grain and oilseed prices throughout the world reflect differences in local supply anddemand conditions (as well as differences in local market structures). In general, grain and oilseedprices are lower in the inland producing regions where they are in surplus, and higher in grain andoilseed deficit, densely populated and port regions where demand exceeds local production. Similarly for cotton, prices are lowest in the production zones, and highest around processing centersand textile mills.", "Product Characteristics. Today's marketparticipants tend to be very sophisticated buyers who carefully compare the price of differentagricultural commodities in terms of their cost per unit of desired end-use characteristic. As a result,supply and demand conditions in agricultural markets -- whether it be markets for export, feedrations, fresh products, food processing, or textile manufacturing -- may depend on a commodity'sparticular variety, quality, or end-use characteristic more than the overall supply of the genericcommodity. For example, a flour processor may base wheat purchase decisions primarily on thespecific variety of wheat and its particular milling and baking characteristics. A yarn or textilemanufacturer may select cotton based on its fiber color, strength, or length depending on the intendedprocessing outcome. A livestock or poultry operation strives for the least-cost, balanced ration(depending on the type of animal) that includes sufficient protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, androughage. An ethanol plant may select corn based on its starch content, while a food processor mayprefer corn with an above-average oil content. ", "Transfer Costs. Key components of the U.S.grain and oilseed handling network include on-farm storage, trucks, railroads, barges, and grainelevators (including county, sub-terminal, and export elevators). A complex web of local supply anddemand conditions determines how and when commodities move through this network. Pricechanges at any point along the chain can result in shifts to alternate transport modes or routes asgrain marketers search for the lowest-cost method of moving grain between buyer and seller.", "For grains and oilseeds, prices at the local country elevator are derived from a central marketprice less transportation and handling costs. Country elevator managers watch the prices in severalmarkets (whether a processing plant, feedlot, export terminal, or futures exchange) to determinewhere the demand is the greatest, then deduct transfer costs to the higher-priced market indetermining the bids they can offer local producers. In competitive markets, transfer costs -- loadingor handling and transportation charges -- are usually the most important factors in determiningspatial (i.e., location-based) price differentials. In the international marketplace, transfer costsinclude barriers to trade such as tariffs and quotas. The more it costs to transport a commodity toa buyer, the less the producer will receive and vice versa. Price differentials between regions cannotexceed transfer costs for very long as marketers will quickly move commodities from the low-pricedmarkets (raising prices there) and ship them to the higher-priced markets (lowering pricesthere). (3) ", "From the farm to the processing plant or export terminal, trucks, trains, and barges competeand complement one another in moving grain to successively larger elevators. Shipping distanceoften determines each mode's particular role. Trucks traditionally have an advantage in moving grainfor shorter distances (less than 250 to 500 miles) and therefore function primarily as the short haulgatherers of grain product. Railroads have a cost advantage in moving grain long distances, butbarges have an even greater cost advantage where a waterway is available. (4) Most economists and marketanalysts agree that inexpensive barge transportation helps hold down rates charged by the rail andtruck transportation industries. ", "Any disruption to the agricultural transportation network generally results in highertransportation costs throughout the system as the demand for transportation services shifts toalternate modes and routes in search of the next best means of moving production to market. Forexample, a weather event that dramatically slows or severely limits barge traffic on the MississippiRiver will have the effect of raising barge freight rates as the demand for barge services exceeds theirsupply. Higher barge freight rates for grains will in turn shift these commodities to alternate uses(feed, food, industrial, or storage), to alternate transport modes (rail or truck), or to alternate traderoutes (e.g., to the Atlantic via the St. Lawrence Seaway, or overland to Canada, Mexico, or alternateports along the Gulf coast or as far away as the Pacific Northwest). Because truck and rail aresignificantly more costly than barge transport, shifting bulk commodities to truck- or rail-basedroutes can substantially raise the cost of moving grain and result in a widening basis and fallingprices in interior positions.", "Government Policies. Several of the major fieldcrops grown in the United States (including wheat, corn, barley, sorghum, oats, rice, soybeans,peanuts, and cotton) receive support under different types of government programs. (5) Annual direct commoditypayments have averaged over $18 billion in the United States during the eight-year period,1998/1999 to 2005/2006. (6) The intended function of government programs vary from direct price support under commodity loanprovisions to conservation management. Because of their influence on per-acre returns, governmentprograms play an important role in the crop selection and marketing decisions of agriculturalproducers. ", "The degree of influence of government programs varies greatly from commodity tocommodity. But, in general, government programs increase the incentives to produce the cropreceiving support. As a result, the supply of government-supported crops available to the markettends to be larger than the supply actually demanded by the market under the supply and demandconditions that would prevail in the absence of government programs. The consequence ofover-supply is lower price. ", "The United States is not alone in the support it provides through government programs to itsagricultural sector. (7) Mostof the other major agricultural producing countries provide some form of support, although in manycases it is in the form of border protection (via tariffs, quotas, and other import restrictions),state-sanctioned monopolies (e.g., the Canadian Wheat Board), rural infrastructure development, oragricultural research rather than direct payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Role of Market Information", "paragraphs": ["Commodity prices reflect the equilibrium between supply and demand at a particular locationfor a given moment in time.

Unlike cash markets which deal with the immediate transfer of goods, a futuresmarket is based on buying (or selling) commodity contracts at a fixed price for potential physicaldelivery at some future date.

", "Each exchange publishes information on the months for which futures contracts are available,the contract size, deliverable grades, trading hours, contract period, minimum price fluctuations,daily price limits, and margin information. (9) A futures contract specifies the grade, quality, amount, andconditions for product delivery (including acceptable delivery locations), as well as the deliverymonth. In most cases, various product grades are deliverable in lieu of the contract's base grade ortype, but subject to price premiums and/or discounts. The contract specifications are written toensure that they closely mirror cash market conditions, and the months of trading are usually selectedbecause of their significance in the crop marketing year. (10) ", "A futures exchange provides the facilities for buyers and sellers to trade commodity futurescontracts openly, then reports any market transactions to the public. Most futures exchanges publishdaily information on the open, high, low, and closing price of active futures contracts, as well as ontheir volume (reported as either the number of contracts or the total of physical units such as bushelstraded) and open interest (the total number of futures contracts that have been entered into and notyet liquidated by an offsetting transaction or fulfilled by delivery). (11) ", "As a result of this activity, futures markets function as a central exchange for domestic andinternational market information and as a primary mechanism for price discovery. The reliabilityof a futures market's price discovery function is dependent on the volume of daily transactions. Thinly traded markets, as indicated by low volume, are more susceptible to price manipulation thanare heavily traded ones. In such situations, prices on the futures market may not accurately reflecteither price behavior in the cash market or expectations about the future. (12) It is not unusual for distantcontracts -- that is, futures contracts whose delivery date is a year or more in the future -- toexperience very low volume.", "Publicly announced futures prices also play a critical role in facilitating seasonal marketoperations because they provide a forum for forward contracting and hedging. (13) Regional and local grainelevators rely on futures commodity exchanges for hedging grain purchases and generally set theirgrain bid prices at a discount to a nearby futures contract in areas of surplus production, (such as forcorn in the Corn Belt) or at a premium in deficit production areas (such as for corn in NorthCarolina). As a result, cash prices and futures contract prices are strongly linked, i.e., both pricescontain much of the same information about market conditions.", "Speculators -- i.e., any person or entity that buys or sells futures contracts to profit fromanticipated commodity price changes in their favor -- provide an important function in futuresmarkets by expanding both the trading volume and liquidity of daily futures market transactions. Today speculators, including private investment funds, comprise the majority of market participants. The presence of many speculative buyers and sellers tends to dampen extreme price volatility andallows hedgers to buy and sell in large volume with ease.

Basis Convergence", "In cases where local demand exceeds local supply, whether due to a crop shortfall or a nearbyprocessing plant, the basis may be less than the transport margin or even exceed the futures marketprice. For example, local corn demand may be bolstered by the existence of an ethanol plant or amajor livestock feeding operation. Geographic basis distributions demonstrate that local corn pricesin the southern plains states (with large cattle feeding operations) and eastern seaboard states (withwidespread dairy and poultry feeding operations) routinely exceed the price of the nearby CBOTcorn futures contract (i.e., an inverted basis) by as much as 10 to 20 cents per bushel due to stronglocal demand from livestock and poultry feeding operations; whereas local corn prices in the primarycorn growing regions of the northern and western Corn Belt average 30 to 40 cents below CBOTcorn futures prices.

However, the generally repetitive patterns of the basismovements for storable agricultural commodities make the basis more predictable from year to yearthan the movement of either cash or futures prices.

This predictabilitygreatly reduces the risk of using the futures market to hedge or forward contract.", "Major Factors Influencing the Basis. Factorsaffecting the local basis for grains, oilseeds, and cotton are similar to the factors affecting both cashand futures prices and include 1) the overall supply and demand for each commodity by variety ortype; 2) the supply and demand of other commodities that compete for either the same land inproduction or the same dollar of consumer expenditure; 3) geographical disparities in supply anddemand; 4) transportation and transportation problems; 5) transportation pricing structure; 6)available storage space; 7) quality factors; and 8) market expectations.

Forexample, suppose that the hypothetical cost of carrying a $4.00 bushel of wheat for one month is 3cents (calculated as: 6% annual interest charges for one month which equals 2 cents; plus insuranceand other fees of 1 cent per bushel per month). (18) Then the premium (based strictly on carrying costs) between theSeptember contract of the current year and next year's March contract would be 18 cents per bushel(calculated as: six months at 3 cents per month per bushel, equal to 18 cents). ", "However, \"normal\" conditions rarely persist and the market is always altering its expectationsof future events as new market information becomes available. As a result, price differencesbetween futures contracts rarely equate to simple carrying charges. During periods of supplyshortage, cash prices tend to rise relative to futures contract prices, and nearby futures contract pricestend to rise relative to more distant contract months. As a result, both the basis and the price spreadsbetween nearby and deferred contracts will narrow. If a severe scarcity develops, the carryingcharges may disappear or actually become negative -- a situation called an inverted market. Scarcitycauses high prices in the cash and nearby futures contracts because the market gives priority to thepresent and discounts the future.

(19) This type of inversion is often referred to as theold-crop/new-crop inversion. For wheat, the old-crop/new-crop price spread is represented by theprice difference between the May and July futures contracts; September and December contracts forcorn; August and September contracts for soybeans; and July and October contracts for cotton.", "As an example of how these price spread relationships may vary, consider theold-crop/new-crop price spreads at the three major U.S. wheat exchanges in the spring of 2004. OnMarch 1, 2004, the May (04)-July (04) price spread for Hard Red Spring (HRS) wheat at theMinneapolis Grain Exchange settled at +4 cents per bushel indicating a relatively tight supplysituation for high-protein spring wheat. In contrast, the May (04)-July (04) price spread for HardRed Winter (HRW) wheat settled at -2 cents at the Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBOT), and at-2.5 cents for Soft Red Winter (SRW) wheat at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). If carryingcharges were the sole determinant then the May-June price spread would be about -5 to -6 cents perbushel. Instead, the KCBOT and CBOT old-crop/new-crop prices spreads of -2 and -2.5 cents wereless than the full carrying charges for the two-month time period separating the May and Julycontracts suggesting relatively tight supply conditions. However, the market conditions for HRWand SRW wheat appeared to be significantly less tight than for HRS which had an inverted basis of+4 cents.

", "Feed Use. No survey of feed use is undertaken byUSDA; however, several USDA reports provide information about the potential for feed demand aswell as the prices and availability of substitute feeds. Three specific NASS reports -- the monthly Cattle on Feed report, the quarterly Hogs and Pigs report, and the monthly Poultry Slaughter report-- provide information about the location and sizes of animal populations during certain periods ofthe year. These reports are supplemented by the monthly Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook report published by ERS that presents detailed economic analysis of the implications of NASSlivestock reports. The NASS Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin , with its index on the quality ofpastures, provides an indication of grazing availability -- an important offset to feedlot use and feeddemand. ", "Seed Use. Seed demand is directly related toplantings and will, therefore, move up or down with changes in the projections for crop area planted. However, seed use traditionally represents such a small portion of total disappearance that anychanges to expected seed demand rarely, in and of themselves, elicit a market response. Both the WASDE report and ERS commodity outlook reports provide data on seed use for various (but notall) crops.", "Food and Industrial Use. Projections of food andindustrial use tend to be fairly stable and, therefore, more predictable than feed use or exportdemand. In most cases a simple trend line is used to predict future food and industrial demandlevels. This results, in large part, because primary agricultural products usually represent only a verysmall portion of the final cost of most processed products, whether it be a food product such as a loafof bread, a box of breakfast cereal, or a jar of baby food; or an industrial product such as soap orpaint. As a result, changes in this demand category are rarely unexpected, and rarely produceunexpected market price movements. ", "Basic data for industrial use comes from the Census Bureau's survey of manufacturingindustries which is issued every five years. Industry reports such as the Milling and Baking News provide information on demand for wheat and other cereals by food processing sector. Similarly,specific agricultural processor's associations, such as the National Oilseed Processors Association(NOPA), provide information on processing capacity and use. In recent years, federal support forethanol production has promoted industrial use of corn and some sorghum.

Since the market events of1972, most market observers consider exports to be the great uncertainty underlying commoditysupply, demand, and price forecasts. (31) In 1972, the Soviet Union made unexpected purchases of largeamounts of U.S. grain. Prices for corn, wheat, and soybeans climbed to record-levels in 1973, thento still higher levels in 1974.

Similarly, per-capita income growth usually trends upward ordownward gradually and predictably with the national economy. As a result, short-term pricemovements are rarely driven by either of these phenomena.

Most agricultural crops grown intemperate-zone countries like the United States where freezing winters limit crop production to a 6-to 9-month period (the growing period is shorter at higher latitudes) have strong seasonal productionpatterns. As a result, the biological nature of crop production plays an important role in agriculturalproduct price behavior. ", "In particular, the production of spring-planted crops has a lag in its response to marketsignals. Producers must make their planting decisions by early spring in order to purchase the seedand other inputs needed for production. However, producers do not receive a price for theirproduction until after the harvest when ownership of the physical commodity is transferred. (50) As a result, growers'planting decisions are based partly on their expectations about future yields, prices (of both outputsand the inputs needed to produce those outputs), and government program support rates foralternative production activities. Also, expectations concerning international market conditions andthe possibility for unexpected changes in the trade outlook are often relevant for most major U.S.field crops. ", "A region's agronomic conditions, such as weather and soil types, may influence the viabilityof producing a particular crop or undertaking a livestock activity; however, expectations of marketconditions such as harvest-time output prices influence the final choices. As a result, changes in theexpected supply and demand of crops or other activities that compete for land, or of other foodsources that compete for demand can ripple through the various agricultural markets, thus alteringprices. Furthermore, since the end result of a planting-time production decision does not materializeuntil several months later at harvest time, it is possible that market conditions will have changedsubstantially or that a producer's actual production may be very different from the plannedproduction due to unexpected variations in weather, pests, diseases, or other circumstances. ", "Derived Nature of Many Agricultural ProductPrices. Demand for agricultural products originates with consumers who use thevarious food and industrial products that are produced from \"raw\" or unprocessed farm commoditiessuch as grains, oilseeds, and fiber. At the consumer level, such final demand is referred to asprimary demand. The term \"derived demand\" refers to demand for inputs that are used to producethe final products. (51) For example, corn and other feedstuffs are important inputs in the livestock industry; wheat is usedto make various bakery products; and cotton is used in the production of textiles. Thus, the demandfor corn, wheat, and cotton is derived from the demand for their various end products. Similarly, thedemand for soybeans is derived from the demand for soybean meal and soybean oil -- the majorproducts obtained from crushing soybeans.", "A diner at a restaurant may be seeking a particular flavor or texture in her steak whichresonates back through the supply chain to the feeding decisions made at the ranch or feedlot wherecattle are fattened and readied for market. As a result, the potential buyers of raw agriculturalcommodities are generally seeking a particular end-use characteristic. For example, a livestockfeeder is generally trying to obtain the least-cost set of feed ingredients that yield a particular balanceof protein, energy, fiber, and other nutrient components. A baker or miller might be looking forparticular baking or milling qualities in their wheat purchases. ", "It is possible for the overall supply of a generic commodity to be in abundant supply, whilea specific variety of that commodity possessing the desired end-use traits may be in short supply. As a result, substantial price premiums and discounts may develop based on the commodities'end-use characteristics. This occurs frequently in the wheat market where the different wheatvarieties have very unique baking and milling characteristics. But it is also not uncommon in othergrain and oilseed markets, e.g., rice (based on grain length), corn (based on color, and oil or starchcontent), soybean (based on protein or oil content), barley (based on malting quality), etc.", "Price-Inelastic Demand and Supply. In general,the demand and supply of farm products, particularly basic grains and oilseeds, are relativelyprice-inelastic (i.e., quantities demanded and supplied change proportionally less than prices). Thisimplies that even small changes in supply can result in large price movements. As a result,unexpected market news can produce potentially large swings in farm prices and incomes. Thisprice dynamic has long been a characteristic of the agricultural sector and a farm policy concern. ", "The supply elasticity of an agricultural commodity reflects the speed with which new suppliesbecome available (or supplies available in the marketplace decline) in response to a price rise (fall)in a particular market. Since most grains are limited to a single annual harvest, new supply flowsto market in response to a post-harvest price change must come from either domestic stocks orinternational sources. As a result, short-term supply response to a price rise can be very limitedduring periods of low stock holdings, but in the longer run expanded acreage and more intensivecultivation practices can work to increase supplies. ", "On the other hand, when prices fall producers might be inclined to withhold their commodityfrom the market. The cost of storage, the length of time before any expected price rebound, theanticipated strength of a price rebound, and a producer's current cash-flow situation combine todetermine if storage is a viable alternative. If a return to higher prices is not expected in the nearfuture, storage may not be viable and continued marketings may add to downward price pressure.", "Similarly, demand elasticity reflects a consumer's ability and/or willingness to alterconsumption when prices for the desired commodity rises or falls. Consumers consider bothown-price and cross-price movements of complementary and substitute products in making theirexpenditure decisions. Willingness to substitute another commodity when prices rise depends onseveral factors, including the number and availability of substitutes, the importance of thecommodity as measured by its share of consumers' budgetary expenditures, and the strength ofconsumers' tastes and preferences. Since the farm cost of basic grains generally amounts to a verysmall share of the retail cost of consumer food products, changes in grain prices generally have littleimpact on retail food prices and therefore little impact on consumer behavior and correspondingfarm-level demand. For example, grain is estimated to account for only a 5% share of the retail priceof a one-pound loaf of bread. (52) A 20% rise in wheat prices would translate into only about a 1%rise in the price of a loaf of bread. Few consumers would notice a 2-cent increase in the price of a$2 loaf of bread.", "Figure 4.

", "Increasing demand for grains and oilseeds by the industrial processing sector, whether fromfood or biofuels processing industries or from expanding industrial hog and poultry operations,further reinforces the general price inelasticity of demand for many agricultural commodities. Industrial use of grains is generally less sensitive to price change since, as with retail food prices, theprice of the agricultural commodity usually represents only a small share of overall production costsof the finished product. Furthermore, industrial users have generally made tremendous investmentsin plant equipment and machinery, and must continue to operate at some minimal level of capacityyear-round as a return on that investment.

Durum wheat is ground intoa coarse flour called semolina that is used for making pastas.

Several factors that aresomewhat unique to the wheat market suggest that the U.S. wheat market structure has greater supplyand demand elasticity than most other field crops. In other words, wheat supply and demand appearto respond faster than the supply and demand of other grains when confronted with some externalshocks such as a crop failure in a competing exporter country or a financial crisis in a majorpurchasing country. Thus, wheat prices are generally subject to less dramatic price swings than mostother grains.

For example, if wheat pricesfall too low, wheat begins to compete with traditional feed grains (e.g., barley, sorghum, oats, andcorn), particularly in the Southern and Northern Plains States where local feed grain production isfrequently insufficient. On the other hand, as wheat prices rise above a certain threshold in relationto feed grains, livestock feeders are quick to reduce the share of wheat in their feed rations thusremoving demand pressure underlying the wheat price rise. ", "Second, U.S. wheat production is marked by two independent seasons, winter and spring,with planting periods nearly six months apart. If it is apparent that winter wheat acreage issubstantially below market expectations due to prevented plantings or that expected yields havesuffered due to unusual winter weather during the October-March period, some of the potentialproduction losses can be offset by increased spring wheat plantings. Given the correct price signalsrelative to other crops, spring wheat can crowd out other spring-planted crops that compete for thesame acreage (e.g., barley, sorghum, sunflowers, soybeans, or corn). Or fallow acreage -- rotatedout of production to rebuild soil moisture -- can be prematurely brought back into production in thespring provided prices are attractive.", "Third, two of the U.S.'s major wheat export competitors -- Australia and Argentina -- are inthe southern hemisphere where their production runs on a cycle that is offset by about six monthsfrom the U.S. cycle. As a result, Argentina and Australia have the opportunity to expand plantedwheat acreage in response to supply and demand circumstances in the United States within the samemarketing year, dampening the potential year-to-year variability of prices in the U.S. andinternational market. While this potential additional supply limits price rises, it may deepen pricedeclines because high storage costs and limited storage capacity in those countries frequently pushtheir surplus production into international markets even when prices are low.", "Fourth, the potential for surplus production to enter agricultural markets from severalcompeting wheat exporter nations (principally Canada, Argentina, Australia, the EU, and the BlackSea region) increases the supply responsiveness of wheat beyond that of other major grains. Forexample, U.S. corn generally faces direct export competition from only two countries, Argentina andChina. ", "Fifth, most government export programs have been directed at wheat and have dampenedprice variability in much the same manner as feed demand -- they introduce an additional source ofdemand that offsets price declines. Because export programs are funded to deliver a fixed value ofcommodities, the volume of U.S. program grain exports rises during periods of excess supply andlower prices, but falls when supplies are tighter and prices higher.", "In summary, the price sensitivity of wheat feeding and government export programs, coupledwith the opportunity for U.S. spring wheat growers and southern hemisphere producers to respondto northern hemisphere winter wheat conditions, provides an important stabilizing effect on U.S.wheat market prices in the face of variable world demand.

For example, an early harvestfreeze in late August in the Canadian prairies has been known to convert a significant portion ofCanada's high-value, high-protein wheat crop into low-priced feed grain in a single night. As such,Canadian feed wheat traditionally has been very competitive in East Asian markets, particularlySouth Korea, at the expense of U.S. corn exports. However, the extent to which corn is crowded outof certain feed markets depends on the feeding operation involved. Some livestock species, e.g.,feeder cattle or dairy, are better able to adjust to feed rations than others, e.g., swine or poultry whichare more corn-dependent. ", "A factor of growing importance in U.S. corn markets is the increasing use of corn for ethanolproduction. This growth has been supported by several national and state programs. (59) An increase in the shareof total demand attributed to industrial use could lead to greater price variability in the face ofweather-driven supply shortfalls. In the 2005-2006 marketing year, USDA projects that 15% of U.S.corn production (or about 1,575 million bushels) will be used for ethanol production. This compareswith a 4% share in 1990/1991 and a 6% share in 2000/01.

Rice quality is oftenassociated with the degree of polishing (removing the hull and bran layers) or whiteness of the grainand the percentage of whole versus broken grains. Both of these attributes are highly dependent onmilling infrastructure -- a market feature that the U.S. rice industry has used to its advantage tocompete in international markets. Parboiling rice (a process of steeping, then precooking rough riceunder pressure with its bran hull rice, then removing the hull through abrasion) results in a productthat is preferred by certain markets (e.g., Saudi Arabia, the Republic of South Africa, and Nigeria)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cotton", "paragraphs": ["Background. Cotton is the single most importanttextile fiber in the world, accounting for over 40% of total world fiber production.

About one-third of annual world production is traded in international markets. The United States, while ranking second to China in production, is the leading exporter, accountingfor over one-third of global trade in raw cotton.", "The U.S. marketing year for cotton runs from August 1 to July 31. The U.S. textile industryhas been in decline for the past decade. As a result, domestic use of cotton has represented adeclining share of annual production and the U.S. cotton sector has increasingly turned tointernational markets to sell its output. Since 2002/2003, slightly more than 60% of the U.S. crophas been exported. ", "Key Market Factors. Cotton competes withseveral other fibers in U.S. and international textile markets. Cotton's principal competitor ispolyester, but rayon, wool, jute, flax, and silk are also used in the production of yarn for fabric. Asa result, local and international market conditions for these substitutes play a role in U.S. andinternational cotton price formation.", "The phaseout of the Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) and other forces have been reshapingworld textile and cotton markets in recent years. (63) The MFA and its predecessor agreements -- through their set oftrade rules and import quotas -- directly influenced world textile and clothing trade patterns (andindirectly influenced world cotton markets) for nearly 50 years. These agreements protected U.S.and European Union (EU) textile and clothing producers from imports, but raised prices and reducedconsumption in both U.S. and EU markets. ", "The elimination of the MFA (concluded on December 31, 2004) is helping reduce clothingprices in the United States and the EU and causing a shift in industrial demand for cotton to China,India, and Pakistan. At the same time, world cotton consumption has accelerated along witheconomic growth since 1999, especially in developing Asia, where an emerging consumer societyis driving increases in household consumption of clothing and other cotton products. In the long run,income growth and technical change are expected to have a greater effect on world cottonconsumption than the elimination of the MFA.", "Government programs such as Step-2 payments for domestic users and exports, have alsoplayed an important role in facilitating both domestic consumption and exports of U.S. cotton. (64) However, following awidely publicized ruling in 2004 (upheld on appeal in 2005) against certain features of the U.S.cotton program in a dispute settlement case brought by Brazil at the World Trade Organization(WTO), U.S. government cotton programs are likely to be altered with important potential marketconsequences. (65) TheAdministration has already announced changes to the U.S. export credit guarantee program designedto accommodate the WTO ruling, and the U.S. Congress has proposed eliminating the Step-2 userpayments in legislation that has passed both chambers ( H.R. 4241 , S. 1932 ). Conference action is pending. The effects of altering U.S. export credit guarantees and theelimination of Step-2 user payments (if enacted) are likely to reduce U.S. cotton exports and, bysoftening demand, put downward pressure on domestic market prices. ", "In addition to the WTO case, intense international pressure has been brought to bear uponcotton subsidies in general and U.S. cotton subsidies in particular at the on-going Doha Round ofWTO trade negotiations. It remains to be seen if these pressures will elicit further changes to theU.S. cotton program. The market effect of further reductions in U.S. cotton program support woulddepend on the specific nature of the changes and how they would be implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Oilseed Complex", "paragraphs": ["Background. The demand for oilseeds is derivedprimarily from the demand for edible oils and protein meals. The international oilseed marketconsists of a large variety of oil-bearing crops produced throughout the world includingtemperate-zone crops such as canola, rapeseed, and sunflowerseed; tropical-zone crops such as palmkernel and coconut copra; and multi-zone crops such as soybeans, cottonseed, and peanuts. Mostof these crops, when crushed for their oil, also yield high-protein meals that are widely used inlivestock and poultry rations. As a result, most of them are relatively close substitutes and theirprices are strongly correlated. ", "Processed soybeans are the largest source of protein feed and vegetable oil in the world. Unlike many other commodity markets, only a few countries tend to dominate soybean productionand trade, making the market sensitive to any supply disruption in one of the major producingnations. Major soybean producers include the United States, Brazil, China, and Argentina whichcombined have accounted for nearly 90% of global production since 2000. Three countries -- UnitedStates, Brazil, and Argentina -- dominate world soybean trade, accounting for about 92% of soybeanexports since 2000; while two countries, the EU and China, have accounted for nearly two-thirds ofworld imports.", "The U.S. marketing year begins on September 1 for soybeans and on October 1 for soybeanmeal and soybean oil. (66) Soybeans equal about 90% of U.S. total oilseed production, while other oilseeds -- such ascottonseed, sunflowerseed, rapeseed, canola, and peanuts -- account for the remainder. The UnitedStates is the world's leading soybean producer and exporter. Soybean and soybean product exportsaccounted for 43% of U.S. soybean production in 2003. In the United States, soybean oil accountsfor about two-thirds of all the vegetable oils and animal fats consumed. Similarly, soybean meal isthe dominant protein meal consumed in the United States. U.S. vegetable oil exports are heavilyinfluenced by concessional food aid to developing nations through such programs as P.L. 480. (67) ", "Soybean meal is the world's most important protein feed, accounting for nearly 65% of worldsupplies. Livestock feeds account for 98% of soybean meal consumption. Similarly, soybean oilis the world's largest source of vegetable oil. An important market development of the past decadehas been the phenomenal growth of soybean output and exports by Brazil and Argentina. Togetherthey currently account for about half of the world soybean export market, up from less than 15%before 1980; they have each surpassed the United States in soybean meal and soybean oil exports. Vast untapped reserves of farmland in Brazil's interior region could permit a continued significantexpansion in soybean area, production, and exports.", "The tropically-produced palm oil accounts for an important and growing share of globalvegetable oil production (USDA projects a 30% share in 2005) and vegetable oil trade (a projected58% share in 2005). Malaysia and Indonesia are the world's leading palm oil producers andexporters. Indonesia still possesses substantial untapped territory for further expansion of palm oilplantations. The rapid growth in Southeast Asian palm-oil output means it will likely surpasssoybean oil's top ranking within a few years.", "Key Market Factors. Because of their primaryprocessed products -- protein meal and vegetable oil -- oilseeds are affected by market conditionsin both the feed-grain and edible oil sectors of U.S. and international markets. Foreign importdemand for whole oilseeds depends on the deficit between a countries' domestic oilseed output andits consumption. Divergent requirements for protein meal and vegetable oil, as well as limits ondomestic processing capacity, determine the ratio of oilseeds to oilseed products that a country willimport. ", "Some oilseeds have higher oil content than others; and some oilseeds yield a higher proteincontent meal with less fiber, making them more easily digestible. For example, a unit of soybeanwhen crushed will yield, on the average, about 18%-19% oil and 74%-80% meal with about 44%protein content. Soybean meal is the most valuable component obtained from processing thesoybean, ranging from 50%-75% of its value (depending on relative prices of soybean oil and meal). As a result, an importer must weight the relative prices for vegetable oils and protein meals againstthe oil and meal yields for each type of oilseed, as well as the protein and fiber content of theresultant meal. Another consideration is fiber content. High-fiber meals are better suited forruminants (e.g., feeder cattle and dairy) than for non-ruminants (e.g., swine and poultry). ", "For soybean crushers, the processing decision involves choosing when to commit to buyingsoybeans (e.g., from farmers), to processing them, and to selling soybean meal and oil (e.g., to foodand feed manufacturers). The main decision variable in making binding commitments on futuredates to sellers and buyers is the gross soybean processing margin. This margin equals theper-bushel revenue of soybeans processed into oil and meal minus the per-bushel soybean price. Ifthe gross soybean-processing margin is high enough, a processor will commit soybean-processingresources for that date. If it is too low, the processor keeps the processing resources available fora future date and a higher margin.", "Compared with trade in other agricultural commodities, trade in whole oilseeds, particularlysoybeans, is relatively unrestricted by tariffs and other border measures. But oilseed meals, andparticularly vegetable oils, typically have higher tariffs. Successful completion of the on-going DohaRound of multilateral trade negotiations could reduce import tariffs and quantitative restrictions toglobal oilseed product markets offering increased growth in demand.", "An important demand-side market development has been the rapid growth of China's andIndia's economies which has spurred their domestic food consumption. China is now the world'sleading soybean importer, and both China and India are among the world's largest vegetable oilimporters. The EU is self-sufficient in vegetable oil production, but its protein deficit still makesit the world's largest importer of soybean meal and second-largest importer of soybeans. Changesin agricultural and trade policies for all three of these countries have greatly influenced world oilseedmarkets.
