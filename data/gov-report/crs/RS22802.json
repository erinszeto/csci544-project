U.S. or Canadian children under the age of 16, however, are allowed to present an original or copy of their birth certificate or other proof of citizenship. Groups of U.S. or Canadian children under the age of 19, when traveling in church or school groups, social groups, or sports teams, and when entering under adult supervision, also can present birth certificates or other proof of citizenship, rather than a passport.

For Americans and Canadians under the age of 18, only proof of citizenship (such as a birth certificate) is necessary.

Many Americans did not differentiate air from land and sea travel in the Western Hemisphere, resulting in many applying for passports who did not need them immediately. Furthermore, the change in passport requirements coincided with passport demands for spring break and families' summer travel plans. Based on work done for the Department of State by Bearingpoint, a private contractor that greatly underestimated passport demand, the Department was caught off guard in meeting the unprecedented numbers of passport applications throughout 2007, causing months of delays in many cases. Because of the backlog of passports, the Department of State hired large numbers of contractors. According to State Department officials, 60% of the 4,400 passport employees were from private contractor firms.
