Analysts also pointed to the changeover in leadership with the departure to Brussels of former Prime Minister Tusk, who was one of the co-founders of Civic Platform in 2001, as a factor in the party's decline. Civic Platform was additionally affected by the so-called \"Waitergate\" scandal involving officials' secretly taped conversations over expensive dinners at upscale restaurants, which caused the resignation of several government ministers and other high-level figures in June 2015. At the same time, the Law and Justice Party appears to have had success in advocating more statist-nationalist economic policies, as opposed to the \"free market\" or \"neo-liberal\" policies pursued by Civic Platform, arguing that the benefits of Poland's economic development have fallen unevenly across society and failed to reach many ordinary citizens.

Critics have charged that the government's changes relating to the country's Constitutional Tribunal undermine the rule of law by subverting institutional checks and balances and placing the court under political control. The role of the Constitutional Tribunal, composed of 15 independent judges appointed by the Sejm to 9-year terms, is to ensure the compliance of laws and state activities with the country's constitution. ", "In October 2015, President Duda refused to confirm the appointment by the outgoing Civic Platform-led government of five new judges to the tribunal. With polls indicating that Civic Platform was on track to lose the upcoming election, President Duda asserted that the appointment of these judges went against democratic principles. The tribunal itself ruled that two of the Civic Platform appointments had been improperly chosen but that three had been legal. In early December 2015, the Law and Justice government moved ahead with the selection of five new judges to the tribunal, who were swiftly sworn into office by President Duda.", "In late December 2015, the government put into effect a substantial reorganization of the tribunal. The new law changes the number of judges required for a ruling from a majority to two-thirds, raises the quorum from 9 judges to 13, requires the tribunal to take cases sequentially, and extends the waiting period from two weeks to six months (three months in exceptional circumstances) before the tribunal can rule on a case brought before it. ", "Observers assert that these changes effectively \"paralyze\" the decisionmaking ability of the court. In response to the controversy, Jaroslaw Kaczynski labeled the tribunal \"the bastion of everything in Poland that is bad\" and a \"band of cronies\" that had denied the party the right to introduce legislation during its previous turn in government. A February 2016 draft opinion of the Venice Commission, the legal advisory body of the Council of Europe, found that \" ... as long as the Constitutional Tribunal cannot carry out its work in an efficient manner, not only is the rule of law in danger, but so is democracy and human rights.\" The Polish government was angered that the draft opinion had been instantly leaked to the press. ", "On March 9, 2016, the tribunal struck down the December 2015 alterations to its composition and functioning as illegal and invalid. The government refused to recognize or publish the ruling, however, arguing that it was made under the old rules and is therefore not a legally binding judgment. ", "Another controversial law adopted in January 2016 granted the Polish government the direct power to hire and fire management of public television and radio stations, a function previously performed by an independent media supervisory committee. Critics argue that this move compromises the independence of state media, and international journalist organizations have described the arrangement as \"wholly unacceptable in a genuine democracy.\" Law and Justice Party officials have complained that public broadcasting tends to be biased against them and a spokesperson for President Duda asserted that the law is necessary to make state media \"impartial, objective, and reliable.\" ", "In addition to the Constitutional Tribunal and public media controversies, critics argue that the Law and Justice government has \"made the civil service more political, replaced the top management at most state controlled companies, expanded police surveillance powers and given the justice minister power over prosecutors.\" Some analysts note that governments in Poland tend to place their own supporters in the public media, public institutions, and state companies, but that Law and Justice is doing so \"faster and further.\"", "In January 2016, the European Commission launched an inquiry into the effects of the changes to the Constitutional Tribunal and public media on the rule of law in Poland, with the results of the initial inquiry to be reviewed in mid-March. If Poland is found to be in breach of the EU's rule-of-law framework, it could theoretically face an \"Article 7\" sanction under which its voting rights in the Council of the EU would be suspended. This measure has never before been enacted. Compared to the other main Polish political parties, the Law and Justice Party has a relatively \"euro-skeptic\" approach that prizes national sovereignty over European integration, and these issues set up a tense relationship between Poland and the EU.", "In addition to outside criticism, concerns over democracy and rule of law in Poland have triggered repeated public protests and demonstrations numbering tens of thousands of people. Social tensions have been further inflamed with the Law and Justice government supporting the publication of documents accusing Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity trade union movement and Poland's first democratically elected president (1990-1995), of having been a secret police informant in the 1970s. Some observers argue that the move is part of a strategy by Law and Justice to discredit previous governments and demonstrate that the post-Communist development of Poland was based on flawed institutions and values that should be rejected and recast.

Under the terms of its EU accession treaty, Poland is bound to adopt the euro as its currency eventually, but there is no fixed target date for doing so. ", "In response to the Eurozone crisis, Poland supported the idea of tighter European integration, signed the EU \"fiscal compact,\" and backed Germany's emphasis on fiscal austerity. On the other hand, Polish leaders have had reservations about proposed steps to increase integration within the Eurozone that might reduce the influence of non-Eurozone members of the EU.

The government's economic policy plans include a new monthly benefit for children in low income families, lowering the retirement age from 67 to 63, and raising the income tax threshold. The government also plans to introduce new taxes on large banks and retailers, many of which are foreign-owned.

In April 2015, the Polish Ministry of Defense announced the selection of Airbus Helicopters H225M Caracal, produced by the European consortium EADS, to replace Soviet-legacy Mi-8s and Mi-17s as the armed forces' new medium-lift utility helicopter. The agreement is worth an estimated $3 billion, although initial plans to purchase 70 new helicopters were decreased to 50 with a decision to keep newer Mi-17s in service to 2026-2027.

The refusal rate for Poland was 6.4% in FY2014 and 10.8% in FY2013. ", "Citing Poland's status as a close U.S. ally, Members of Congress have attempted to change the law governing the VWP to allow Poland to qualify. Most recently, on June 18, 2015, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a Poland Visa Waiver Amendment to the FY2016 Homeland Security Appropriations bill. Proposed by Senator Mark Kirk and Senator Barbara Mikulski, the amendment would permit the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate Poland a VWP country, notwithstanding the statutory criteria for inclusion. On June 4, 2015, Senators Mikulski and Kirk had also introduced a Visa Waiver Program Enhanced Security and Reform Act ( S. 1507 ) that would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, among other provisions, to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive the refusal rate criteria and designate a country eligible for the VWP given the fulfillment of certain other criteria, which Poland likely meets. (The act was introduced in the House of Representatives on June 8 as H.R. 2686 .) Some opponents of extending the VWP to include Poland argue that such a step could allow a significant increase in the number of Poles who remain illegally in the United States (i.e., become an unauthorized alien). Proponents of including Poland argue that such a move would increase U.S. tourism revenue, boost public diplomacy, and strengthen national security by extending the information sharing elements of the VWP to Poland.

Despite a short-lived thaw in the relationship before and after the 2010 crash of the Polish presidential airplane, Polish suspicions about the nature of Putin's Russia persist, and Warsaw tends to view Russia as a potential threat to Poland and its neighbors. Recent events in Ukraine have sharpened long-standing Polish concerns about Russia's intentions and put security at the top of Poland's national agenda.", "Poland's view of Russia remains affected by the experience of Soviet invasion during World War Two and domination during the Communist era, although more recent events such as the 2006 Russian-German agreement to construct the Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea, bypassing the Baltic states and Poland, have also strained relations. The Russian government, in turn, was angered by the Polish government's offer to host U.S. missile defense facilities during the Bush Administration. Warsaw's promotion of the EU's Eastern Partnership initiative to deepen ties with Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, and Azerbaijan has also long annoyed officials in Moscow, who view the region as lying within Russia's traditional sphere of influence. ", "The former Tusk government led calls for a robust response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, including through sanctions and an increased NATO military presence in Central and Eastern Europe. Public opinion backed this approach to a large extent: for example, in the German Marshall Fund of the United States' Transatlantic Trends 2014 survey, 77% of Poles approved of stronger economic sanctions against Russia. The survey was conducted in June 2014, before the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine galvanized the European Union to impose wider sectoral sanctions. ", "The government of Prime Minister Kopacz sought to revise policy on Russia and Ukraine toward a relatively gentler approach. In October 2014, Kopacz told Poland's Parliament she was concerned about \"an isolation of Poland\" due to \"unrealistic goals\" for the Ukraine conflict, adding, \"[t]he goal of my government will be a pragmatic policy toward what's going on in Ukraine.\" Nevertheless, analysts observe that the currents of Poland's Russia policy run deeper than individual leaders. While the Kopacz government slightly softened Poland's overall approach, Poland continued to back robust sanctions and played a major role in coordinating EU and NATO policy in response to Russia's actions. ", "Analysts expect that the Law and Justice government is likely to maintain a comparatively harder line in its approach to Russia and to entrench Poland's position as one of the EU's most hawkish countries with regard to Russia policy. ", "In 2013, trade between Poland and Russia totaled nearly $38 billion, and more than 5% of Polish exports were sold to Russia. Poland has been one of the countries most affected by Russian retaliatory sanctions. As a result of Warsaw's lead role in pushing for EU measures against Russia, Moscow targeted Poland even before the EU's tougher sanctions were adopted in July 2014 by banning the import of certain Polish fruits and vegetables, citing alleged health and sanitary reasons. In August, Russia retaliated against Western sanctions by banning the import of produce, meat, and dairy products from the EU and United States (as well as Canada, Australia, and Norway). In recent years, Polish exports of fruit and vegetables to Russia have been valued at $1 billion to $2 billion annually. ", "One area of particular relevance to Poland's security is Kaliningrad, a 5,800-square-mile Russian exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania (see Table 1 ). Kaliningrad has a heavy Russian military presence, including the Baltic Sea Fleet and two airbases. In addition, Russia has reportedly stationed, or at least threatened to station, Iskander short-range nuclear missiles there."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energy Security", "paragraphs": ["Over half of the natural gas and most of the oil consumed in Poland comes from Russia. Because Poland continues to rely on coal for approximately 90% of its electricity generation, however, Russian gas accounts for less than 10% of Poland's primary energy supply. Overall, as the largest coal producer in the EU, Poland relies on energy imports for 31% of its needs, well below the EU average of 53%. Successive governments have made a priority of efforts to diversify its energy sources to both reduce gas dependence on Russia and increase the use of cleaner fuels that produce fewer CO2 emissions. ", "Poland has also been taking steps such as expanding pipeline interconnectivity with its neighbors and developing the ability to reverse the flow of gas in the Polish section of the Yamal pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany via Belarus and Poland, in order to import natural gas from the West in the case of a crisis such as a cut-off of Russian gas. The construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal on the Baltic Sea coast near the German border (Swinoujscie) has suffered a series of delays, but the facility was declared operational in October 2015 and received its first shipment from Qatar in December 2015. The facility is expected to begin receiving commercial deliveries in May 2016 and reach full capacity by 2018. The Polish government has also begun an initiative to introduce nuclear power to the country's energy mix with the construction of the country's first nuclear plant. These plans have encountered challenges and setbacks, with the first unit possibly operational in 2025 and full completion by 2035. ", "The Polish government has been a leading advocate for a stronger EU energy policy that reduces collective dependence on Russia. In April 2014, then-Prime Minister Tusk suggested the formation of an EU \"energy union\" in which a single European agency would purchase natural gas for all 28 members, rather than the current system of bilateral negotiations and contracts. Such an energy union would also include \"solidarity mechanisms\" for member states to aid one another in cases of supply disruption. The proposal was opposed by several other EU member states and has not advanced.", "Poland has been active in initiatives to link the natural gas grid of the Baltic countries, which are dependent on Russia for 100% of their natural gas, to the rest of the EU. A project to build a pipeline connecting Poland to Lithuania has been launched, although the effort has been complicated by financing obstacles. The pipeline is expected to become operational in 2020. ", "Many U.S. officials and Members of Congress have regarded European energy security as a U.S. interest. In particular, there has been concern in the United States over the influence that Russian energy dominance could have on the ability to present a united transatlantic position when it comes to other issues related to Russia. Successive U.S. administrations have encouraged EU member states to reduce energy dependence on Russia through diversification of supply and supported European steps to develop alternative sources and increase energy efficiency.
