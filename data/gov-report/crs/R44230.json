For the southern border, the bill would require that certain elements be met within a specified time period in order for the Secretary to attest that he has achieved operational control. In addition, H.R. 399 would create a Border Security Verification Commission (BSVC) to certify whether DHS has established situational awareness and operational control of the border.

Other states and localities, in contrast, have proscribed activities (e.g., sharing information, honoring federal requests to hold aliens) that could assist in federal immigration enforcement, sometimes because such jurisdictions disagree with federal enforcement priorities. ", "At least until 2012, there had been considerable debate regarding the ability of states and localities to act independently to enforce federal immigration law, or to impose criminal sanctions upon activities that facilitate unauthorized immigration, apart from any sanctions imposed under federal law. In its decision in the case of Arizona v. United States , however, the Supreme Court found that existing federal law contemplates states and localities having a limited role in immigration enforcement. The Court indicated that the ability of states to criminally sanction immigration-related activities is limited, even when these sanctions mirror those of the federal government. The Court also ruled that states generally cannot arrest aliens on the basis of suspected removability except with express federal statutory authorization or pursuant to the request, approval, or instruction of federal immigration authorities.", "H.R. 1148 , as ordered to be reported by the House Judiciary Committee, includes several provisions that seem intended to override aspects of the Supreme Court's ruling in Arizona and provide states and localities with express statutory authorization to engage in immigration enforcement activities.

Employers are further required to participate in a paper-based (I-9) employment eligibility verification system in which they examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work eligibility, and to complete and retain I-9 verification forms. Employers violating prohibitions on unlawful employment may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.

The requirements with respect to recruitment and referral would apply one year after the date of enactment. The bill also would provide for mandatory reverification of workers with temporary work authorization, which would be phased in on the same schedule as the verification requirements for hiring. Special provisions would apply to agriculture; the hiring, recruitment and referral, and reverification provisions would not apply to agricultural workers until two years after the date of enactment. Prior to these phase-in dates, existing requirements to use E-Verify would remain in effect.", "H.R. 1147 would require or permit electronic verification in ways not currently allowed under E-Verify. Employers could conduct electronic verification after making an offer of employment but before hiring, and could condition a job offer on final verification under the system. Verification of previously hired individuals would be mandatory in some cases (such as federal, state, and local government employees). DHS could authorize or direct a critical infrastructure employer to use the system to the extent DHS determines is necessary for critical infrastructure protection. In addition, employers could verify current employees on a voluntary basis.

It would make it a violation of the prohibition on unauthorized employment to fail to seek electronic verification as required or to knowingly provide false information to the electronic system. H.R. 1147 would provide for the blocking of social security numbers from use in the verification system in cases of misuse and in other specified circumstances. It also would enable individuals to limit use of their social security numbers or other information for verification purposes.", "In addition, H.R. 1147 includes language to expressly preempt any state or local law that relates to the hiring, employment, or verification of the employment eligibility of unauthorized aliens. At the same time, a state or locality could exercise its authority over business licensing and similar laws as a penalty for failure to use the verification system, and a state, at its own expense, could enforce the revised INA Section 274A provisions, under specified terms. The bill also would require DHS to establish an office to receive complaints from state and local agencies about potential violations.

All foreign nationals seeking visas must undergo admissibility reviews performed by DOS consular officers abroad. These reviews are intended to ensure that applicants are not ineligible for admission to the United States under the grounds for inadmissibility spelled out in INA Section 212.

Records of all visa applications are now automated in the CCD, with some records dating back to the mid-1990s. The CCD has stored photographs of all visa applicants in electronic form since February 2001 and 10-finger scans since 2007.

Applications for immigrant visas would be required to be signed in the presence of a consular officer. H.R. 5203 would specify that no application for a visa could be approved unless it is complete, and no document accompanying an application could be accepted unless it is either in English or translated into English and is certified as complete and accurate. Visa applications also could not be approved unless a background check is performed for the applicant and any derivatives. And the background checks would need to include a review of the applicant's social media activity. By comparison, the similarly named Strong Visa Integrity Secures America Act ( H.R. 5253 ), as ordered to be reported by the House Homeland Security Committee, would require that DOS, to the greatest extent practicable and in a risk-based manner, review the social media accounts of visa applicants who reside in high-risk countries. This bill would also raise the burden of proof for foreign nationals to prove that they are entitled to visas or any other type of entry document from the current standard of \"to the satisfaction of the consular officer\" to \"by clear and convincing evidence.\" ", "H.R. 5203 would require that any applicant for a visa based on a biological relationship undergo DNA testing to confirm the biological relationship.

There was discussion of assigning all visa issuance responsibilities to DHS when the department was being created, but the Homeland Security Act of 2002 drew on compromise language stating that DHS would issue regulations regarding visa issuances and DOS would continue to issue visas. The question of which agency should take the lead in visa issuances continues to be debated.", "Along these lines, Title IV of H.R. 1148 , as ordered to be reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary, would give the Secretary of Homeland Security \"exclusive authority to issue regulations, establish policy, and administer and enforce the provisions of the [INA] and all other immigration or nationality laws relating to the functions of consular officers of the United States in connection with the granting and refusal of a visa.\" The bill would broaden the exception to the confidentiality requirement relating to the sharing of information with foreign governments, including by allowing such sharing for purposes of \"determining a person's deportability or eligibility for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit,'' or any other instance when \"the Secretary of State determines that it is in the national interest.\" A provision in S. 1635 (\u00a7403), as passed by the Senate, would broaden the conditions under which the Secretary of State may release records pertaining to visa applications.

The legislation also would give consular officers the authority not to interview visa applicants deemed to be ineligible for the visas they are seeking. In addition, H.R. 1148 would give DHS the authority to refuse or revoke any visa if the Secretary determines that such refusal or revocation is necessary or advisable in the security interests of the United States.", "Some in Congress have been particularly interested in the Visa Security Program (VSP), which the ICE Office of International Affairs (OIA) operates in certain high-risk consular posts. As described by DHS, the VSP sends ICE special agents with expertise in immigration law and counterterrorism to foreign consulates, where they perform visa security activities that complement the DOS visa screening process. According to DHS, the VSP provides law enforcement resources not available to consular officers. One of the major tasks for VSP agents is to screen visa applicants to determine their risk profiles. In 2011, however, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released an evaluation of the VSP that identified several shortcomings. Most importantly, perhaps, GAO stated that ICE has not expanded the VSP to key high-risk posts despite well-publicized plans to do so. ", "Several bills that have received action have provisions related to the VSP. H.R. 1148 would seek to expand the VSP by requiring DHS to conduct an onsite review of all visa applications and supporting documentation before adjudication, at the top 30 visa-issuing posts designated jointly by the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security as high-risk posts. It also would call for expedited clearance and placement of DHS personnel at overseas embassies and consular posts.

The employees of these Visa Security Units would, among other duties, screen visa applicants against appropriate criminal, national security, and terrorism databases. At not fewer than 50 posts where DHS employees are not assigned, the bill would require the Secretary of DHS, in a risk-based manner, to assign employees to remotely perform the duties of the Visa Security Units.

The H-2B program is administered by USCIS and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). By law, the H-2B visa is subject to an annual numerical cap. Under the INA, the total number of aliens who may be issued H-2B visas or otherwise provided with H-2B nonimmigrant status in any fiscal year may not exceed 66,000. After several years in which fewer than 66,000 H-2B visas were issued, the H-2B cap was reached in FY2014 and in FY2015.
