The PA defines a collective, long-term objective to hold the GHG-induced increase in temperature to well below 2o Celsius (C) and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5o C above the pre-industrial level. A periodic \"global stocktake\" will assess progress toward the goals. Single GHG mitigation framework. The PA establishes a process, with a ratchet mechanism in five-year increments, for all countries to set and achieve GHG emission mitigation pledges until the long-term goal is met. For the first time under the UNFCCC, all Parties participate in a common framework with common guidance, though some Parties are allowed flexibility in line with their capacities. This largely supersedes the bifurcated mitigation obligations of developed and developing countries that held the negotiations in often-adversarial stasis for many years. Accountability framework. To promote compliance, the PA balances accountability to build and maintain trust (if not certainty) with the potential for public and international pressure (\"name-and-shame\"). Also, the PA establishes a compliance mechanism that will be expert-based and facilitative rather than punitive. Many Parties and observers will closely monitor the effectiveness of this strategy. Adaptation. The PA also requires \"as appropriate\" that Parties prepare and communicate their plans to adapt to climate change. Adaptation communications will be recorded in a public registry. Collective financial obligation. The PA reiterates the collective obligation in the UNFCCC for developed country Parties to provide financial resources\u2014public and private\u2014to assist developing country Parties with mitigation and adaptation efforts.

Some experts and observers, noting the PA's largely procedural nature and lack of binding quantitative GHG obligations, have questioned whether the PA marks significant change. Others note a number of substantive differences from prior commitments, specifically for some Parties. Below are several ways in which the PA embodies change under the UNFCCC.", "Common process for all Parties . For the first time under the UNFCCC, all Parties will participate in a common framework with common guidance, although some Parties will have flexibility in line with their capacities. The commonality largely supersedes the bifurcation into wealthier and developing countries that has held the negotiations in often-adversarial stasis for many years. Ratcheting process to ward quantified objective . The PA defines a quantitative (though collective) long-term objective to hold the GHG-induced increase in temperature to well below 2 o Celsius (C) and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 o C above the pre-industrial level. The PA establishes a process, with a \"ratchet mechanism\" in five-year increments, for countries to set and achieve GHG abatement targets until the long-term goal is met. Greater subsidiarity . The PA embodies greater decentralization than, for example, the Kyoto Protocol. The PA increases reliance on decisionmaking and strategy by individual countries or countries cooperating among themselves, not necessarily through central decision mechanisms. Examples of subsidiarity include the nationally determined contributions (pledges) that set countries' GHG targets, and recognition that Parties will use market-based mechanisms (e.g., emissions trading) to transfer emission reduction credits to meet their commitments. Growing role of non-state entities . The negotiations leading to the Paris conference and the PA grew more inclusive of non-state entities (including the private sector) as observers and influencers. Parties recognized them as key decisionmakers and implementers of activities expected to be necessary to achieve the GHG abatement and increased resilience to climate change envisioned in the PA. The government of France established a website for non-state actors to make pledges and share information. Moderate compliance incentives for all. For the first time, all countries agreed to a single system for transparency, accountability, and public accessibility to emissions and policy information to promote compliance with the PA. The UNFCCC lacks universal obligations for transparency and review; the Kyoto Protocol's more intrusive non-compliance provisions may have discouraged participation in commitments by some Parties. To promote compliance, the PA works to balance accountability necessary to build and maintain trust (if not certainty) with the potential for public and international pressure (\"name-and-shame\").

As examples of application of these considerations, if the PA were to contain new legal obligations for the United States, or if the United States were unable to meet its obligations without additional authority from Congress, those factors would favor regarding the PA as requiring congressional action.

Some analysts suggest that economic and technological factors may continue to reduce U.S. GHG emissions through 2025, with a few suggesting that the NDC targets could be met through continuing market forces along with state, local, and philanthropic programs. Plentiful natural gas supplies have continued to offer an attractive alternative to coal-fired electricity, and falling costs of electricity from wind and solar\u2014along with federal tax incentives\u2014have expanded investment in these more advanced technologies. Any projection of future emissions is contingent on assumptions about future economic conditions and consumer preference, the size and structure of the energy sector, the influence of existing and new policy measures, and the modeling methods. Strategies being undertaken by states and localities and many in the private sector could also limit GHG emissions. Rapid technological change in the energy sector may have an even greater influence.

California has also enacted laws to reduce its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and has set a goal to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. This will require GHG reductions beyond what was counted in earlier projections of California's Climate Action Plan.

If all countries were to comply fully with the vision and obligations of the PA, they would reduce their aggregate net GHG emissions nearly to net zero emissions in the second half of this century (Article 4.1), thereby stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. Scientists expect that near-zero GHG emissions could curtail GHG-induced global warming and other climate changes on a multicentury timescale. Article 2 spelled out a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to \"well below\" 2 o C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 o C. ", "In principle, Parties could achieve the PA's long-term temperature limits\u2014but only if they ratchet their GHG reductions at a faster rate than was reflected on average in the INDCs. The UNFCCC Secretariat assessed that full compliance with the INDCs (mostly set to 2025 or 2030, including the conditional pledges) would show global GHG emission trajectories still rising in 2030, though the curve could be bending significantly toward a plateau. A few Parties submitted INDCs that envisioned continued downward GHG emission trajectories to 2050, but none pledged to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century. ", "The UNFCCC Secretariat presented an analysis comparing the INDCs with externally developed GHG scenarios illustrating least-cost paths to a 2 o C temperature limit. (See Figure 2 .) The assessment concluded that the INDCs would reduce GHG emission below the pre-INDC paths (which included policies to which countries had previously committed) and that full compliance with INDCs would result in emission levels well above many identified least-cost paths to achieving the temperature target: ", "[G]lobal GHG emissions resulting from the implementation of the communicated INDCs are generally expected to be lower than the emission levels according to pre-INDC trajectories, by 2.8 (0.0 to 6.0) Gt CO 2 eq in 2025 and 3.3 (0.3 to 8.2) Gt CO 2 eq in 2030.\u2026 If all conditional components of the INDCs are implemented, the resulting global total emissions are expected to be even lower, by 3.7 (1.2 to 6.0) Gt CO 2 eq in 2025 and 5.3 (0.9 to 8.2) Gt CO 2 eq in 2030 compared with emissions consistent with pre-INDC trajectories, while considering only the unconditional components of the INDCs reduces the emission difference from pre-INDC trajectories to 2.1 (\u20130.4 to 4.3) Gt CO 2 eq in 2025 and 2.8 (\u20130.4 to 5.9) Gt CO 2 eq in 2030.

The Secretariat established a public, interim NDC Registry containing NDCs communicated by Parties. The CMA is tasked with agreeing on guidance to ensure measurement of PA Parties' performance on their NDCs. Elements of this guidance may consider criteria in the PA that NDCs should promote environmental integrity, transparency, accuracy, completeness, comparability, and consistency and avoid double counting. Countries were invited to communicate, by 2020, their mid-century, long-term low GHG emission development strategies. The Executive Committee of the Warsaw Mechanism was charged with reviewing work in September 2016 to develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimize, and address displacement of people related to the adverse impacts of climate, and for a repository for information on insurance and risk transfer to help Parties develop and implement comprehensive risk management strategies. Associated with \"cooperative approaches,\" the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice under the UNFCCC is tasked with developing guidance for market-based systems that the PA recognizes will be used by Parties to meet their NDCs. The bodies will also develop a work program for considering other cooperative approaches, including non-market-based approaches, to GHG emissions reductions. The Adaptation Committee under the COP must develop methods to recognize the adaptation efforts of developing countries and for communication of Parties' priorities, implementation, support needs, plans, and actions and for recording them in a registry maintained by the Secretariat. The CMA will, in the 2020s, negotiate to set a new collective, quantified goal for climate finance by 2025.", "In addition, there will be many requests for submissions of Parties' views, development of rules and guidance, and reviews of existing approaches and mechanisms in the period to 2020.
