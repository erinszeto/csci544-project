This report is intended to inform Congress of existing statutory and regulatory provisions that may aid in responding to future disasters and national emergencies that may affect the provision of or access to education and highlight the actions of previous Congresses to provide additional recovery assistance. This report reflects the most recently available guidance, as of the date of publication, related to education-related disaster response and flexibilities. It will be updated should new or additional statutes be enacted or guidance be issued.", "The majority of federal aid for disaster management is made available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act; P.L. 93-288). Under the Stafford Act, public school districts, charter schools, private nonprofit educational institutions, public institutions of higher education (IHEs), and federally recognized Indian tribal governments are eligible to receive assistance for activities such as debris removal, infrastructure and equipment repair and replacement, hazard mitigation, and temporary facilities.", "In addition to the assistance available through the Stafford Act, assistance is available through numerous provisions in education laws. At the elementary and secondary level, there are several existing provisions that may be helpful in providing assistance in response to a disaster. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) grants the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) authority to issue waivers of any statutory or regulatory requirement of the ESEA for a state educational agency (SEA), local educational agency (LEA), Indian tribe, or school that receives funds under an ESEA program and requests a waiver. In response to past disasters, waivers have been granted to address funding flexibility issues and accountability requirements. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) grants the Secretary authority to waive state maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements and requirements to supplement, not supplant, federal funds under certain circumstances. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act grants the Secretary authority to waive certain accountability metrics and provides some flexibility with regard to MOE requirements. The Secretary is not, however, able to waive all statutory and regulatory requirements with respect to the acts. Under the ESEA, for example, the Secretary may not waive civil rights requirements or prohibitions against the use of funds for religious worship or instruction. Under IDEA, for example, the Secretary may not grant waivers from the right to a free appropriate public education.", "At the postsecondary level, various provisions exist to ensure continuity of operations and continuity of federal funding following a disaster. Under the Higher Education Act (HEA), the Secretary of Education has authority to waive several of the requirements for aid recipients, IHEs, and financial institutions when a disaster has been declared. In particular, waivers have been provided from various requirements related to the disbursement, repayment, and administration of federal student aid. Under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may extend payment of veterans educational assistance benefits to cover periods when enrollment is interrupted.", "In addition, various provisions exist to provide flexibilities in other Department of Education-administered programs. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) and accompanying regulations grant the Secretary the authority to waive state MOE and reporting requirements for AEFLA state grants due to uncontrollable circumstances such as natural disasters. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and accompanying regulations grant the Secretary the authority to waive state MOE and reporting requirements for state vocational rehabilitation grants due to uncontrollable circumstances, such as natural disasters.", "In response to the multiple hurricanes and tropical storms in 2017, Congress enacted the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017, P.L. 115-64, which amended the ESEA to make private schools eligible for funds under the Project School Emergency Response to Violence Program, which provides funds to help schools recover from violent or traumatic events in which the learning environment has been disrupted. The act also provided short-term authority for the Secretary to waive or modify statutory or regulatory requirements to ensure funds were targeted to affected populations and institutions at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. On February 9, 2018, the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 (Division B, Subdivision 1 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, P.L. 115-123) was enacted.

The report also reviews several no-longer-authorized temporary provisions that were enacted by Congress to provide additional assistance to support education-related disaster recovery.", "Some of the initial education-related problems that may need to be addressed following a disaster relate to utilities outages, displaced students, homeless students, damage to buildings and school property, and school closures. To address such problems, the federal government has responded in various ways to disasters that have affected the provision of education. These responses have included the provision of financial support, waivers of existing statutory and regulatory provisions, and the creation of new programs. ", "The majority of federal assistance for disaster management is made available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as authorized under the Robert T.

The public assistance available under the Stafford Act largely provides funds for disaster relief activities such as debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair, replacement, or restoration of public facilities damaged during the disaster. On several occasions, Congress has also enacted legislation to create temporary targeted assistance programs to support Department of Education (ED) administered programs at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education levels. Such assistance was authorized to meet the needs of students, schools, and states during specific disasters. For example, temporary programs have provided funds to restar t school operations, reopen schools, and re-enroll students.", "In addition to the assistance authorized by the Stafford Act and temporary targeted assistance programs, a wide range of disaster aid is provided by ED under statutory authority that specifically refers to disaster assistance, as well as under general assistance provisions.", "At the elementary and secondary education level, schools, local educational agencies (LEAs), and states have needed assistance in complying with various educational accountability requirements included in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and in meeting fiscal requirements. A number of statutory flexibilities can be triggered to provide adjustment to, and in some instances exemptions from, such requirements during periods of disaster. ", "At the postsecondary education level, institutions of higher education (IHEs) have needed assistance complying with the statutory requirements pertaining to the disbursement and reimbursement of federal student aid (e.g., Pell Grants and Direct Loan program loans), and students have needed assistance in securing, maintaining eligibility for, and repaying federal student aid. Where federal student aid is concerned, relief has been provided related to the interruption or cancelation of periods of study and ensuing challenges associated with reimbursement of funds for the federal government from IHEs and/or students and portability of aid should students need to be relocated.

Title I-A of the ESEA authorizes aid to LEAs for the education of disadvantaged children. Title I-A grants provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending prekindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. Title I-A has also become a vehicle to which a number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public K-12 education for all students have been attached as conditions for receiving Title I-A grants.

States were required to apply to receive funds, and the funds were allocated based on the number of public elementary and secondary schools that were closed for 19 days or more from August 29, 2005, through December 31, 2005. P.L. 110-28 provided $30 million for these purposes. Funds were provided to Louisiana and Mississippi only. This program is no longer authorized.

ED was required to distribute the funds through the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act based on demonstrated need. These funds provided assistance to LEAs in Gulf Coast states affected by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, as well as LEAs affected by natural disasters in other parts of the nation, such as flooding in the Midwest. Of the $15 million provided, $13.5 million was provided to Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.

The majority of the funds were provided to LEAs in Louisiana.

The waivers could be provided at the Secretary's discretion to ease the fiscal burdens of entities in an affected state in which a major disaster has been declared in accordance with Section 401 of the Stafford Act. It is important to note that the waivers of MOE did not reduce the level of effort required for the subsequent year. It should also be noted that this additional authority to waive fiscal accountability requirements did not permit the Secretary to waive or modify any provision under IDEA.", "In response to multiple disasters, Congress has required the Secretary to hold affected LEAs harmless at 100% of their prior-year grant amount under Title I-A of the ESEA. It appears that these provisions may have been enacted as a means of preventing affected LEAs from experiencing a decrease in funding due to the displacement of students.", "Temporary Flexibilities under the IDEA", "P.L. 109-148 also provided the Secretary with the temporary authority to extend certain administrative deadlines under the IDEA, such as the deadline for submission of an annual report on the progress of the state and of children with disabilities in the state for the 2005-2006 academic year. In addition, the Secretary was authorized to extend the deadline for the initial evaluation of children to determine their eligibility for services under IDEA. In providing the Secretary with the authority to extend these deadlines, Congress also included statutory language that clarified that this new authority should not be interpreted as granting the Secretary waiver authority over key IDEA provisions, such as the right to a free appropriate public education or procedural safeguards granted under the act.", "Higher Education", "Appropriations to support IHEs following the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 (i.e., Hurricanes Katrina and Rita) were provided in 2005 through P.L. 109-148 ($200 million), in 2006 through P.L. 109-234 ($50 million), and in 2007 through P.L. 110-28 ($30 million).

P.L. 109-234 authorized the Secretary to waive or modify statutory or regulatory provisions to ensure that the calculation of financing for an HBCU reflected changes in the financial condition of the institution as a result of the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and to ensure that those affected institutions that were not receiving assistance under the program before the Gulf hurricane disasters were eligible to apply. The law also relaxed several program financing requirements. The Secretary's authority to waive or modify statutory or regulatory requirements of this program is no longer authorized. In 2018, the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 (Division B, Subdivision 1 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, P.L. 115-123 ) authorized the Secretary to forgive any outstanding loan balance owed to ED by institutions that secured funding under this program in the wake of the Gulf Cost Hurricanes.", "Waiver of Vocational Rehabilitation State Grant Matches", "The Assistance to Individuals with Disabilities Affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-82 ) provided the Secretary with the authority to waive the nonfederal match requirements for disaster-affected states.
