As early as the 1980s, states began enacting laws that required the collection of DNA samples from offenders convicted of certain sexual and other violent crimes. The samples are analyzed and their profiles entered into state databases. In the late 1980s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory convened a working group of federal, state, and local forensic scientists to establish guidelines for the use of forensic DNA analysis in laboratories. The group proposed guidelines that are the basis of current national quality assurance standards, and it urged the creation of a national DNA database.

The samples were then analyzed and their profiles entered into state databases. In the late 1980s, the FBI Laboratory convened a working group of federal, state, and local forensic scientists to establish guidelines for the use of forensic DNA analysis in laboratories. The group proposed guidelines that are the basis of current national quality assurance standards, and it urged the creation of a national DNA database. In 1994, Congress authorized the FBI to establish and oversee the National DNA Index System (NDIS). When the NDIS launched in 1998, nine states participated. Currently, laboratories in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the federal government, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory participate in the NDIS. The NDIS contains the DNA profiles provided by federal, state, and participating local crime laboratories. ", "DNA profiles generated by laboratories operated by local law enforcement agencies are stored in Local DNA Index Systems (LDIS). DNA profiles generated by state laboratories, along with authorized profiles stored in participating LDIS, are uploaded into State DNA Index Systems (SDIS). Each state has its own laws specifying which profiles can be included in the SDIS. DNA profiles generated by federal laboratories, along with authorized DNA profiles in participating SDIS, are uploaded into the NDIS. Federal law dictates which DNA profiles can be stored in the NDIS (see below). The NDIS allows participating laboratories to compare DNA on the national level while the SDIS allows each state to compare DNA profiles stored at the state level. Federal, state, and local laboratories upload and compare DNA profiles using the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) software produced and distributed by the FBI.", "CODIS searches three indexes (convicted offenders, arrestee, and forensic) to generate investigative leads. The convicted offender index contains DNA profiles developed from samples collected from convicted offenders; the arrestee index contains DNA profiles developed from samples collected from arrested but not yet convicted individuals; and the forensic index contains DNA profiles developed from samples collected at crime scenes. CODIS searches across these indexes to look for potential matches (also referred to as \"hits\"). Matches can occur between either the convicted offender or arrestee indexes and the forensic index, thereby providing law enforcement with the identity of one or more suspects. Also, matches can occur between DNA profiles in the forensic index, thereby linking crime scenes to each other and identifying serial offenders. Matches between multiple samples in the forensic index can allow law enforcement agencies in different jurisdictions to coordinate their efforts and share leads. No names or other personal identifiers for offender and arrestee DNA profiles are stored in the NDIS, so when a match is made in CODIS, the laboratories that submitted the DNA profiles to the NDIS are notified of the match and they contact each other to verify the match and coordinate their efforts. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DNA Profiles", "paragraphs": ["DNA profiles entered into CODIS are based on 13 core short tandem repeat (STR) loci selected by the FBI. Currently, the 13 STR loci used by the FBI are non-coding, meaning that they have not been shown to be associated with human attributes such as height, eye or skin color, or susceptibility to a particular disease. Each locus has two alleles, and it is these 13 pairs of alleles that are compared to match samples in the forensic index with profiles in either the offender or arrestee indexes. The 13 core loci chosen by the FBI provide a high level of discriminatory power. The probability that two unrelated individuals would share all 13 pairs of alleles is estimated to be one in several hundred billion. Two random Americans will, on average, share two or three alleles. ", "It is important to ensure the quality of the DNA profiles entered into the NDIS. If the profiles are not accurate, they are of little use for making matches between forensic and offender or arrestee profiles. The FBI helps ensure the quality of DNA profiles included in the NDIS by signing memorandums of understanding with state laboratories whereby the laboratory agrees to adhere to the FBI's Quality Assurance Standards (QAS, see below). Laboratories submitting DNA profiles to the NDIS must be accredited and audited annually. Annual audits can be conducted by either an internal or external auditor, but laboratories must be audited by an external agency at least once every two years. Laboratories that do not pass the annual audit can be prevented from entering DNA profiles in CODIS. Currently, most labs in the United States are to be audited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors and its Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB) and Forensic Quality Services (FQS). In addition, DNA analysts must undergo semiannual proficiency testing. DNA analysts who do not pass their semiannual proficiency tests are not to be allowed to enter profiles into CODIS. Laboratories are also required to conduct two reviews of all DNA profiles before they are entered into CODIS.", "Currently, as prescribed by federal law (see below), only public laboratories that comply with the QAS can submit DNA profiles to the NDIS. However, public laboratories are allowed to outsource casework to private laboratories. All private laboratories that conduct DNA testing for public laboratories must be accredited, be audited annually, and adhere to the requirements of the QAS. Public laboratories are required to conduct an initial site visit to each private laboratory they contract with to conduct DNA analyses. If the public laboratory signs a contract with a private laboratory that is longer than one year, the public laboratory must conduct an annual site visit. Public laboratories are also required to review all outsourced DNA profiles generated by private laboratories. The review by the public laboratory is in addition to the two reviews private laboratories are required to conduct per the QAS.", "An offender or arrestee profile in a DNA database consists of 26 numbers representing each of the two alleles for the 13 STR loci, an agency identification number, a sample identification number, and an identifier for the analyst that entered the information. However, most jurisdictions retain the DNA sample used to generate the profile placed in CODIS. DNA samples are usually retained for quality assurance purposes, such as confirming a hit made using the NDIS, and it allows jurisdictions to retest the sample if new technology is developed in the future. Privacy advocates are concerned that stored DNA samples include a wealth of genetic information that could be misused. States and the federal government have sought to prevent the unauthorized use of DNA samples. Some states have criminal penalties in place for individuals who misuse DNA samples collected for law enforcement purposes. Under current law, anyone who misuses a DNA sample collected under federal authority is subject to a fine of up to $250,000, or imprisonment for up to one year.", "The number of offender profiles included in the NDIS has increased as Congress has allowed states to include DNA profiles from a broader range of convicted offenders and persons arrested for certain crimes to be included in the database. States have also amended their DNA collection laws to reflect this expanded authority. Approximately 15.6 million new convicted offender and arrestee profiles have been added to NDIS since 2000. In addition, approximately 795,000 new forensic profiles have been included in the NDIS since 2000. The additional offender and forensic profiles have increased the number of investigative leads generated by DNA databases. Since the creation of NIDS, hits generated by searches of the NDIS have aided in the investigation of nearly 381,000 crimes.

Not analyzing or collecting DNA samples for minor offenses could prevent law enforcement from apprehending offenders who may go on to commit more serious crimes. ", "Context is important when evaluating data on DNA backlogs. Backlogs are best considered in the context of each crime laboratory's capacity, size, and workload. For example, if there are two laboratories and the first laboratory has a backlog of casework that is three times the size of the casework backlog in the second laboratory, the backlog for the first laboratory might not be as daunting if the first laboratory's turnaround time is twice as fast as the second laboratory and the analysts in the first laboratory are more productive (i.e., each analyst analyzes more cases per month).

The protocols and practices are required to address (1) what evidence should be collected by law enforcement and forwarded for testing and the order in which that evidence should be tested, (2) a reasonable period of time for evidence to be forwarded to a laboratory for testing, (3) a reasonable period of time in which each stage of laboratory testing should be conducted, (4) a system to encourage communication between actors in the criminal justice system (e.g., law enforcement, courts, and laboratory personnel and crime victims) about the status of evidence testing, and (5) standards for audits of sexual assault evidence in the possession of state and local governments.
