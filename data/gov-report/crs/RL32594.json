Communications, often wireless radios, are vital to these agencies' effectiveness and to the safety of their members and the public. Wireless technology requires radio frequency capacity in order to function, and existing wireless technology is designed to work within specified frequency ranges.", "Different operations, different applications, different rules and standards, and different radio frequencies are among the problems first responders face in trying to communicate with each other. Interoperability, also referred to as compatibility or connectivity, refers to the capability for different systems to readily connect to each other. Facilitating interoperability has been a policy concern of public safety officials for a number of years. However, public safety agencies\u2014especially at the local level\u2014tend to rely on vendors for technical expertise. Interoperable solutions, therefore, are often based on proprietary systems, limiting the scope of connectivity. One way to bypass the vendor-driven planning that characterizes, and limits, public safety communications could be to implement a national plan that encouraged resource-sharing and standardized interfaces, while promoting the transition to open source architecture. At the level of national policy for emergency planning and response, for example, goals for interoperability could include interchangeability, assuring that equipment from any agency, state, or community could be used to replace or supplement equipment in any area of the country, as needed.", "Since September 11, 2001\u2014when communications failures added to the horror of the day\u2014achieving interoperability for public safety communications has become an important policy concern for Congress. The damage to communications infrastructure caused by Hurricane Katrina and subsequent flooding has revealed the extent to which the concerns of Congress, as expressed in legislation, have yet to be acted upon. Although many replacements for lost communications equipment were rushed to critical sites in the Gulf Coast states, they were usually different systems using different radio frequencies, with little or no capability for cross-communication. Although interoperability in communications is correctly perceived as a subset of the larger problem of providing comprehensive communications support, it is a pivotal solution. Interoperability provides redundancy and back-up capacity, key elements for a robust network. Some have suggested that the current definition widely used in discussing interoperability may be too general, and that a fuller articulation of planning goals should be developed to guide policy. Many experts agree that\u2014at this point in what can only be described as an ongoing crisis in communications capacity\u2014a critical missing element is planning at the national level. In this view, national planning\u2014whether undertaken at the federal level, through a consortium of states, or other means\u2014is needed to transcend proprietary solutions and bring about consensus on common interfaces with uniform standards that permit full interoperability and interchangeability for newer, digital equipment. Federal policy also could guide public safety communications purchases toward a transition to open source platforms. Standardized interfaces can link existing, non-standard (e.g. proprietary) systems and networks; for planning purposes this could require, for example, a federal mandate for interoperable standards for \"cross talk\" systems provide by companies such as M/A Com, Motorola and Raytheon.

The destructive chaos that followed in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita revealed many weakness in current assumptions and plans, such as those in the National Response Plan and the National Incident Management System. Two critical pieces of infrastructure failed early on: electrical power and communications. A well-planned and robust emergency communications system should be sustainable at reasonable levels of operation even after electrical power is lost.

The difficulties in coordination placed an extra burden on relief efforts. Rescue efforts improved after military forces arrived in part because of their units' superior communications resources. Effective command-and-control operations depend on communications links. Just as the 9/11 Commission looked at the Army Signal Corps as a possible resource for improving interoperable communications, many are now weighing the possibility of giving a greater role to the military for emergency response within the United States. Bottom line, in this view, today the military has the communications equipment to do the job of emergency response while FEMA, the states, and first responders do not.

The fragmentation of spectrum assignments for public safety is a significant barrier to achieving needed capacity for the future, and is presently among the technical problems that plague public safety communications, such as out-of-date equipment, proprietary solutions, congestion, and interference. An immediate barrier to interoperability is\u2014simply put\u2014that UHF and VHF frequencies cannot connect directly with each other, and that older, analog equipment widely used below 512 MHz cannot connect with newer digital equipment at 800 MHz. Technology for new frequencies at 4.9 GHz is still in the early stage of development but these frequencies appear suitable primarily for local-area (short-range) transmission. None of the above frequency assignments can, using current technology, support wide-area communications relying on high-speed, data-rich transmissions. Providing new spectrum at 700 MHz for broadband communications capabilities, including interoperable connections, is viewed by many as the optimal solution for overcoming problems caused by incompatible radio frequencies and technologies.", "With the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, Congress achieved an important milestone in providing a date certain for the release of spectrum at 700 MHz for public safety use by February 2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improving Spectrum Capacity for Public Safety", "paragraphs": ["The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act required the FCC, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), to conduct a study on the spectrum needs for public safety, including the possibility of increasing the amount of spectrum at 700 MHz. This provision is responsive to the many public safety officials who believe that additional spectrum should be assigned for public safety use\u2014and not exclusively for first responders. In addition to providing spectrum for other types of users, the spectrum available for public safety should be able to support high-speed transmissions capable of quickly sending data (such as photographs, floor plans and live video). This requires providing frequencies with greater bandwidth to enable wireless broadband and new-generation technologies. Although radio frequencies have been designated for state and local public safety use in the 700 MHz range, there are no allocations specifically for federal use at 700 MHz and the bandwidth assignments are judged by most experts to be too narrow for full broadband. Many have advocated that additional spectrum be allocated at 700 MHz to accommodate federal users and to support newer, broadband wireless technologies as part of a nationwide network for public safety communications. The Spectrum Coalition for Public Safety, for example, has circulated proposals that would allocate additional spectrum at 700 MHz for use by state and local first responders, critical infrastructure industries, and federal public safety agencies.", "In the study requested by Congress, the FCC sought comment on whether additional spectrum should be made available for public safety, possibly from the 700 MHz band. Comments received from the public safety community overwhelmingly supported the need for additional spectrum, although other bands besides 700 MHz were also mentioned. The FCC did not make a specific recommendation for additional spectrum allocations in the short-term although it stated that it agreed that public safety \"could make use of such an allocation in the long-term to provide broadband services.\" It qualified this statement by observing that spectrum is only one factor in assuring access to mobile broadband services for emergency response. It further announced that it would move expeditiously to see whether the current band plan for the 24 MHz at 700 MHz currently designated for public safety could be modified to accommodate broadband applications. On March 17, 2006, the FCC issued a request for comment on a new band plan that would allocate spectrum for broadband use by first responders within the 24 MHz currently assigned for public safety. The same proposed rulemaking also asked for additional comment on the possible adaptation of a wireless broadband standard for interoperability.", "The FCC received over 1,000 responses by December 2006, with many comments from the public safety community and commercial wireless interests. One petition, from a company called Cyren Call Communications Corporation, received widespread publicity in the press and through lobbying to Congress. The petition requested the reallocation of 30 MHz (half of the 60MHz currently designated for auction for commercial use by the Deficit Reduction Act) to a \"Public Safety Broadband Trust.\" According to the proposal, the trust would lease capacity not used by public safety to commercial operators that would provide the network infrastructure. The FCC denied Cyren Call's petition, citing, among other reasons, the Congressional mandate to auction the spectrum Cyren Call proposed to use. Other proposals for joint operations were also submitted. One proposal, developed by Access Spectrum and Pegasus Communications Corporation, suggested accommodating broadband wireless by rebanding the 24 MHz allocated to public safety and adding 3 MHz from existing guardband allocations, with some of the spectrum shared with commercial operators. Verizon Wireless reportedly proposed to build a broadband network for public safety use on half of the 24 MHz of spectrum assigned to public safety, using the other 12 MHz for mixed use, with the cost of building the infrastructure recovered through leasing arrangements and fees.", "In December 2006, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposed to turn over management of the 24MHz of spectrum designated for public safety to a not-for-profit group that would, among other responsibilities, hold a national license that would support public safety with a broadband wireless backbone. In the NPRM, the FCC states that it is responding to \"an opportunity to put in place a regulatory framework that would ensure the availability of effective spectrum in the 700 MHz band for interoperable, public safety use.\" To achieve this, the FCC is presenting a \"plan that we believe may best promote the rapid deployment of a nationwide, interoperable broadband public safety network ...[with] a centralized and national approach to maximize public safety access....\"", "The NPRM outlines seven points.", "Allocate 12 MHz from the 700 MHz band assigned to public safety for broadband use by state and local public safety members. Assign this 12 MHz of spectrum to a single licensee, nationwide. Permit this licensee to operate commercially on the remaining 12 MHz allotted to public safety with public safety having priority access when needed. Permit the licensee to provide public safety broadband access on a fee for service basis. Permit the licensee to provide unconditionally preemptible access to commercial operators. Facilitate the shared use of commercial mobile infrastructure. Establish \"performance requirements for interoperability, build out, preemptibility of commercial access, and system robustness.\"", "In the NPRM, the FCC states its case for how the proposal meets objectives for \"public safety communications in the twenty-first century\" and provides some information about the selection of a national licensee and the license-holder's obligations. The FCC proposes that the licensee should meet criteria such as not-for-profit status, experience with public safety frequency coordination, and the ability to directly represent all public safety interests. Responsibilities would include the design and implementation, build-out, and maintenance of a national network, the coordination of eligibility for access for public safety, and the leasing of capacity to commercial users. The licensee would be able to charge fees for the use of its services, such as access to the network, to both public safety and commercial users.", "The NPRM also seeks comments on secondary operations by commercial users on the remaining 12 MHz of spectrum assigned by Congress for public safety use. Currently the FCC permits public safety licensees to lease spectrum assigned to them only for use by other public safety entities. The FCC uses the NPRM to propose exempting the new, national public safety licensee from limitations it imposes on existing public safety entities.", "Public safety's demand for spectrum fluctuates from modest during routine operations to high during times of crisis. Many would agree that sharing frequencies and access to networks with commercial operations makes sense. The FCC is proposing to share spectrum by halving public safety's allotment of exclusive spectrum from 24MHz to 12MHz in the 700 MHz band.

No time line for accomplishing these planned steps has of yet been provided.", "SAFECOM", "With the support of the Administration, Project SAFECOM was designated the umbrella organization for federal support of interoperable communications. It was agreed within DHS that SAFECOM would be part of the Science and Technology Directorate, in line with a policy for placing technology prototype projects under a single directorate; this decision was reportedly based on the research-oriented nature of the programs envisioned for SAFECOM by its administrators. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act affirmed this decision by giving DHS the authority to create an office for interoperability within the Science and Technology Directorate and to manage SAFECOM as part of that effort. SAFECOM has released a template for interoperability planning that can be used by states to establish a strategy for interoperability. It prepared a methodology to establish a baseline for interoperability achievements as an evaluation tool to measure the success of future interoperability programs. The methodology was applied in a study with voluntary participation. The study sent surveys to fire response/emergency services and law enforcement in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The agencies were asked to rate the level of interoperability within their jurisdictions, not including federal authorities. The findings from this survey were published in December 2006.", "SAFECOM absorbed the Public Safety Wireless Network (PSWN) Program, previously operated jointly by the Departments of Justice and the Treasury. PSWN was created to respond to recommendations made by the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee regarding the improvement of public safety communications over wireless networks. PSWN operated as an advocate for spectrum management policies that would improve wireless network capacity and capability for public safety. SAFECOM, however, has no authority over spectrum management decisions.

Unfortunately, State and local public safety representatives are frequently not included in spectrum policy decisions, despite their majority ownership of the communications infrastructure and their importance as providers of public and homeland security. SAFECOM will hence play a role in representing the views of State and local stakeholders on spectrum issues within the Federal Government. Last year, SAFECOM was appointed to an interagency Spectrum Task Force to contribute such views, and the ongoing working relationship that has developed between SAFECOM and the FCC will, we believe, pay huge dividends in the future.", "SAFECOM was chosen in October 2001 as one of 24 e-government initiatives. It was categorized as a government-to-government initiative in the original strategizing for e-government programs. When SAFECOM was created in 2001, the managing partner for SAFECOM was the Department of the Treasury. Subsequently, the program was assigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), following FEMA when it moved to the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Once at DHS, SAFECOM was assigned to the Directorate of Science and Technology. As the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted in testimony and reports, the change in leadership has delayed progress at SAFECOM. The GAO has also expressed concern over a lack of leadership and focus and raised questions of governance. Testimony by David Boyd has stressed the importance to SAFECOM of more authority in certain funding decisions and in its interactions with other federal agencies, and the need for an in-depth gap analysis\u2014the assessment of current levels of interoperable communications capability compared to requirements.", "The GAO has recommended that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget work with DHS to review SAFECOM's functions and establish a long-term program with appropriate authority and funding to coordinate interoperability efforts across the federal government.", "Other notable observations from the GAO include:", "The fragmented federal grant structure for first responders does not support statewide interoperability planning. SAFECOM has developed grant guidance for interoperability, but cannot require that consistent guidance be incorporated in all federal first responder grants. The federal government can provide the leadership, long-term commitment, and focus to help state and local governments meet interoperability goals. For example, the federal government can provide the leadership and support for developing (1) a national database of interoperable communications frequencies, (2) a common nomenclature forthose frequencies, (3) a national architecture that identifies communications requirements and technical standards, and (4) statewide interoperable communications plans.", "SAFECOM, however, articulated a different approach in testimony and its 2003 Strategy Planning Session. In its strategy summary, it reported that it intends, over the course of 10 to 20 years, to \"Adopt a national strategy from the bottom up to incorporate effective public safety communications.\" Boyd also reaffirmed his belief that \"any effort to improve communications interoperability must be driven from the bottom up.\" This approach necessitates a focus on communications at the incident level. At this level, SAFECOM appears to be giving the greatest attention to improving radio interoperability, particularly through the deployment of cross-talk hardware. This decision in turn leads to an emphasis on increasing the amount of equipment standardization, improving operating standards and protocols, and consulting on how to install and use new equipment. According to Boyd's testimony, the focus for SAFECOM is on three areas: creation of an architectural framework, the development of standards, and the coordination of federal activities. The architectural framework is intended to aid SAFECOM in determining priorities for the development of standards. The framework \"will reflect a system-of-systems approach to develop interface standards to help improve the problem of communications interoperability.\" It appears that it will be modeled along the lines of a pyramid, with decision-making starting at the base and building up. The organic nature of the SAFECOM model for infrastructure development apparently requires a long time-line (usually extending, in testimony, to 20 years) and resists description in terms of long-term goals and deadlines. By describing its achievements and plans within the framework of short-term milestones, many of which involve the preparation of studies by outside consultants, SAFECOM appears to have avoided addressing many of the strategic goals originally envisioned for its mission, without an official explanation for the shift in emphasis.", "SAFECOM Strategy as an E-Government Initiative", "In 2002 and 2003, OMB sequentially described SAFECOM's mission, milestones and goals. It appears that many of these goals have not been met, or have been modified.

This initiative would address the Nation's critical shortcomings in efforts by public safety agencies to achieve interoperability and eliminate redundant wireless communications infrastructures. At the same time, it would assist state and local interoperability and interoperability between federal public safety networks.", "Value to Citizen: Coordinated public safety/law enforcement communication will result in saved lives, as well as better-managed disaster response. Consolidated networks will yield cost savings through reduction in communication devices, management overhead of multiple networks, maintenance and training.", "Value to the Government: Billions of dollars could be saved through a right-sized set of consolidated, interoperable federal networks, linked to state wireless networks, resulting in a reduction in communications infrastructure, overhead, maintenance and training.", "Milestones - 2002", "In February 2002, SAFECOM milestones, all planned for completion by the end of that year, included the following:", "Define the communications concept of operations for interaction that identifies the communications requirements to address the two highest probable threat scenarios: Bio terrorism and natural disasters. Develop an integrated public safety response solution that addresses the top two threat scenarios by using existing infrastructure augmented by available commercial capability.

Identify gaps between existing wireless systems and interoperability requirements. Develop national architecture Develop concept of operations for interoperability.", "Many Goals Not Met", "Comparing the stated goals of SAFECOM as an e-government program, with its current progress and programs, it appears that the emphasis has been on short-term goals. There is virtually no indication, in testimony, of long-term planning for national interoperability. Among its accomplishments, SAFECOM has partly met the goal of developing a requirements statement with the qualitative assessment of communications needs at the incident level, as provided in the March 2004 \"Requirements\" document. A gap analysis is reportedly underway, a delivery date of late 2005 has been extended to mid-2006. The \"concept of operations\" for \"interaction\" (2002) or \"interoperability\" (2003) could be equated with the pyramid structure advocated by SAFECOM, discussed below, and this may provide the framework for an \"integrated public safety response solution.\" An integrated response solution and a national architecture are promised for the future. The 2002 milestone of providing a plan to use \"existing infrastructure augmented by available commercial capability\" is being addressed if infrastructure is defined as local radio communications equipment bolstered by cross-patch hardware. It is not being met, and seems to have been rejected by SAFECOM, if infrastructure is meant to include wide-area networks, Internet communications backbones and other regional or national communications capacity that would provide broad-based communications the support.", "In testimony, OMB described SAFECOM goals as including the provision of \"interoperable wireless solutions for Federal, state, and local public safety organizations,\" that would include \"coordination of all Federal interoperability efforts.\" In OMB's description of long-term strategic goals, as outlined in the 2003 e-gov plan, there appears to be an implicit assumption that there are redundant wireless communications infrastructures that can be identified and eliminated. This planning document describes the SAFECOM initiative as addressing \"critical shortcomings,\" including two significant points where communications interoperability is lacking; interoperability between state and local authorities, as well as interoperability between federal public safety networks. The plan indicates that some (unidentified) networks would be consolidated to yield costs savings. Further \"Billions of dollars\" in savings are presumed by creating a right-sized set of consolidated, interoperable federal networks, linked to state wireless networks. To date, there appears to be no information on SAFECOM plans for improving wireless communications networks at the national or regional level; the focus of the program on hardware solutions at the incident level would seem to preclude plans for network interoperability or the establishment of standards for new interoperable technologies such as mesh networks or cognitive radios. Work at the incident level is primarily local, focused on short-range interoperability solutions. Wide area networks and nationwide, end-to-end communications rely on technologies not being tested or evaluated by SAFECOM at the incident level.", "In particular, the build-from-the-bottom-up approach for interoperability, advocated by SAFECOM, would appear to be at odds with the e-government goal of achieving efficiencies at the communications network level. Modern networks, with their incorporation of software programs on chips, other software-programmable technologies, nanotechnology, and meshed communications systems, to cite some examples, are generally built out from a common design, requiring some degree of centralization. In that respect, the goals of the IWN appear to be more aligned to the original goals of the e-government strategy. Its intentions include the construction of a national network, the identification and prioritization of end-user functional requirements, and the use of open standards that would be adapted by other public safety agencies.", "Evolution of SAFECOM's Goals", "The explanation of SAFECOM provided in 2002 by OMB, would suggest that the original mission was much broader than the milestones that have been used to chart progress. It is possible, therefore, that SAFECOM has not merely suffered delays because of changes in the managing partner, as the GAO has observed, but also because it has changed course, redefining its purpose.", "Regional Technology Integration Initiative", "In June 2004, the Directorate of Science and Technology introduced a new initiative to facilitate the transition of innovative technologies and organizational concepts to regional, state, and local authorities. The initiative has selected four urban areas from among those currently part of the Homeland Security Urban Area Security Initiative. Two of the areas that have been reported as choices are Cincinnati, Ohio and Anaheim, California. Each area will reportedly receive $10 million to expand new systems that test more advanced technologies for public safety communications, including interoperability. Anaheim, for example, reportedly has created a virtual operations center (instead of a building), relying on network technology to connect police, fire, medical services and public utilities in case of an emergency. The announced goal is to get all who respond to disasters and other emergencies to work from a common base.", "National Incident Management System (NIMS)", "NIMS also has announced plans to address questions of interoperability and communications, although no mention of spectrum policy is mentioned in the DHS report on NIMS issued March 1, 2004.

Many of these programs include state committees and national associations such as the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials - International (APCO). Part of the National Coordination Committee's mission was to encourage the creation of Statewide Interoperability Executive Committees (SIEC), to take part in coordination efforts. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) is another important coordinating body. NPSTC unites public safety associations to work with federal agencies, the NCC, SIECs and other groups to address public safety communications issues. It has been supported by the AGILE Program, created by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). AGILE has addressed interim and long-term interoperability solutions in part by testing standards for wireless telecommunications and information technology applications. The AGILE Program also has provided funding to Regional Planning Committees for start-up costs and the preparation and distribution of regional plans. AGILE has been restructured, replaced by a more limited function in Communications Technology, CommTech. CommTech is not designed to play a primary role in coordinating interoperability policy within the public safety community.", "The SIECs, NPSTC, Regional Planning Committees and other federally-supported but not federally-directed organizations play key roles as facilitators in advancing programs for public safety communications. In recent testimony quoted above, both SAFECOM and the FCC have described their roles primarily as facilitators also. SAFECOM and DHS, in its plans for the Office of Interoperability and Cpatibility, seem to place a high priority on consultative functions. It appears that OIC policy will focus on portfolios of recommendations for achieving interoperability at an incident site and not on establishing the higher levels of interoperability provided by network support and back-up from regional communications command centers. In its discussions of Emergency Operations Centers and Incident Command Systems, however, NIMS seems to indicate the need for a national network architecture and fixed as well as mobile operations centers for communications network support. The Regional Technology Integration Initiative has been established to Act as a catalyst between existing technology used by first responders and the innovative technology needed in the future. It seeks to work at the local, state and regional levels but appears to favor solutions that can be applied on a regional basis."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
