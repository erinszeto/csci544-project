Six incoming Presidents\u2014Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan\u2014revised their predecessor's budget shortly after taking office, while only two Presidents during this period, Lyndon Johnson and George H. W. Bush, chose not to do so.", "The deadline for submission of the President's budget, which has been changed several times over the years, was set in 1990 as \"on or after the first Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year.\" The change made it possible for an outgoing President, whose term ends on January 20, to leave the annual budget submission to his successor.", "The three outgoing Presidents since the 1990 change\u2014George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush\u2014exercised this option. Accordingly, the budget was submitted in 1993, 2001, and 2009 by the three incoming Presidents (Bill Clinton for FY1994, George W. Bush for FY2002, and Barack Obama for FY2010).", "Before President Barack Obama, the last three incoming Presidents that submitted a budget or revised their predecessor's budget (Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush) did not submit detailed budget proposals during their transitions until early April; however, each of them advised Congress regarding the general contours of their economic and budgetary policies in a special message submitted to Congress in February concurrently with a presentation made to a joint session of Congress.", "President Barack Obama followed a comparable approach. He delivered an address on his economic and budget plan to a joint session of Congress on February 24, 2009, and submitted an overview document two days later. He submitted his detailed budget proposal on May 7, 2009, and submitted additional supplemental volumes four days later, on May 11, 2009.", "This report will be updated as developments warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["When a new Congress convenes in January, one of its first orders of business is to receive the annual budget submission of the President.

Therefore, under the legal framework for the beginning of a new Congress, the beginning of a new President's term, and the deadline for the submission of the budget, all outgoing Presidents prior to the 1990 change were obligated to submit a budget.", "The 1990 change in the deadline made it possible for an outgoing President to leave the annual budget submission to his successor, an option which the three outgoing Presidents since then (George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush) took.", "Because President George H.W. Bush chose not to submit a budget for FY1994 (and was not obligated to do so), President Bill Clinton submitted the original budget for FY1994 rather than budget revisions. Similarly, the budget for FY2002 was submitted by the incoming President George W. Bush, rather than by outgoing President Bill Clinton. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided considerable advance notice of the plan for FY2002. President George W. Bush indicated early on that he would not submit a budget for FY2010.
