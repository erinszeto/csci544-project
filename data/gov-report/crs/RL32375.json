(22) The WTO Agreement requires its signatories toallow goods and services providers from the other signatory countries to bid on contracts valuedabove a threshold level on an equal, nondiscriminating basis with domestic suppliers, thus waivingany \"buy national\" requirements. For example, the U.S. \"Buy America Act\" gives preferentialtreatment to U.S. domestic suppliers vis-a-vis non-GPA signatories.

Australia has used Annexes I and II topreserve its right to screen foreign investments. All foreign investments in Australia are subject togovernment screening and approval. While this process has apparently not stopped U.S. investorsfrom establishing successful operations in Australia, representatives of the U.S. business communityinsisted that the process does not conform to the principle of \"national treatment,\" that is, treating foreign investors no less favorably than domestic investors.

(24) The Australiangovernment had indicated that changing the process might be difficult. (25) However, in a compromise,the United States has allowed Australia to maintain its screening process. Australia agreed toeliminate screening of U.S. investment in new entities (\"greenfield investments\"). It also agreed toincrease the threshold value from $A50 million to $A800 million above which U.S. acquisitions ofestablished entities in Australia will have to be screened.

Australia argued that such a mechanism will not be necessary because U.S. and Australian legal traditions regarding investment were very similar, andU.S. investors will receive fair treatment in Australian courts.

The provisions on labor (Chapter18)and environment (Chapter 19) are structurally similar. Because the Australian and U.S.economiesare both modern and industrialized and are at similar levels of development, with similar averagewage levels and environmental standards, labor and environment issues have not been a cause ofbilateral trade friction. Nevertheless, the USAFTA commits the two countries to enforce their respective labor rights laws, that is those laws that are directly related to the internationallyrecognized labor principles and rights, and to enforce laws to protect the environment. If eithergovernment ascertains that the other FTA partner is not adhering to these provisions, it will be ableto raise the issue through the USAFTA's dispute settlement mechanism (described below).

Governments use these regulations to ensure that the goods sold in their territory do not impair thehealth and safety of their residents.

The ACTPN's membership cutsacross virtually all sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, agriculture, labor, services, andthe environment. With the exception of one member (see below), the ACTPN has endorsed theU.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The vast majority of the committee's membership concludedthat the agreement fulfills U.S. trade objectives that Congress set down in the Trade Act of 2002, andthe membership supports the trade liberalizing measures to which the agreement commits the UnitedStates and Australia. (28)", "Although, endorsing the agreement, the majority of the ACTPN expressed some concerns: ", "that some issues regarding Australia's sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) regime still needed to be resolved before U.S. agricultural exporters will be able to take full advantage ofthe agreement;", "that the agreement does not include an investor-state dispute provision and calls for the U.S. government to ensure that such a provision be added if it proves warranted;and", "that the environmental provisions in the agreement are adequate for Australia, since Australia has a strong record on environmental protection, but they should not be considereda model for other U.S. FTA agreements where the partners' records on the environmental protectionis not so strong. (29)", "The ACTPN member representing labor, James P. Hoffa, Jr., General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, filed the lone dissenting view against approval of theagreement. He argued that the agreement's labor provisions only require Australia to enforce itslabor laws. Hoffa claims, \"While Australia is a developed country with a relatively high standardof living and a vibrant, independent labor movement, it has an imbalanced, inadequate system oflabor laws that fail to fully protect workers' rights.\" (30)", "The agricultural negotiations were the most difficult and the results somewhat ambiguous. The reactions of agricultural and food producers reflect the ambiguity. U.S. sugar producers wererelieved that the agreement did not include liberalization of sugar imports, while sugar-usingprocessors were critical. U.S. wheat exporters oppose the agreement because Australia will bepermitted to retain its single-desk monopoly on wheat exports. Pork producers have indicated thatthey will not support the agreement until Australia implements a final risk assessment on U.S. porkfor import into Australia and U.S. pork exports to that market begin to increase. The reaction of beefproducers has been mixed. They are disappointed that greater access to the U.S. market forAustralian exporters was not matched by openings in other foreign markets for U.S. beef exportersthrough the WTO negotiations. They are pleased that the U.S. beef market will be opened graduallyto Australian exporters over an 18-year period. The American Farm Bureau supports the USAFTAas long as the SPS issues and other issues that affect U.S. agricultural exports are resolved beforethe Congress votes on the agreement.

Because tariffs on most manufactured goods and manyagricultural products were already low, one can conclude that the removal of the tariffs and otherrestrictions will not result in major shifts in trade patterns, in large increases in the total volume oftrade, or in significant trade diversion. An analysis of the potential economic effects of the USAFTAconducted by the United States International Trade Commission concluded that the largestpercentage increases in U.S. exports to Australia will occur in coal, oil, gas, and other mineralproducts; textiles, apparel, and leather products; and other processed food and tobacco products,although these increases will occur from small bases. The largest value increases in U.S. exports toAustralia will occur in other machinery and equipment and motor vehicles and parts. The largestpercentage increases in U.S. imports from Australia will occur in textile, apparel, and leatherproducts; meat products; and other processed food and tobacco products. The greatest increase invalue of U.S. imports from Australia will occur in meat products.

In some cases, such as U.S.restrictions on beef and dairy and Australian investment screening, the two sides agreed to loosenrestrictions. In the case others, such as the Australian SPS measures and state-sanctionedmonopolies, they agreed to establish mechanisms for further discussion. However, in the case ofsome irritants, such as U.S. import controls on sugar, the two countries agreed no change waspossible.

Enactment of the agreement will build on the increased U.S. use of FTAs, especially by the BushAdministration, as a trade liberalization tool. For some observers, FTAs act as building blocks toglobal trade liberalization, especially at a time when the multilateral negotiations in the WTO areproceeding slowly at best. Others have argued that FTAs undermine multilateral trade liberalizationefforts and create a confusing web of intertwining economic relationships.", "If approved by Congress, the USAFTA may also set precedents for other FTAs the United States might form. For example, the steps that Australia agreed to take to make the PharmaceuticalBenefits System more transparent may be a model for the United States in future FTAs withcountries that have similar government- subsidized drug programs. Some observers have alsosuggested that the exclusion of U.S. sugar import restrictions from the USAFTA will encourageother trading partners to exclude politically-sensitive products from agreements with the UnitedStates or encourage other U.S. import-sensitive industries to push for exclusion in future tradeagreements.
