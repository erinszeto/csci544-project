The conflict of interest provisions applicable after one leaves government service to enter private employment are often referred to as \"revolving door\" laws."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background: Legislative History and Intent of Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Post-employment, \"revolving door\" statutes restricting certain subsequent private employment activities of former federal officers and employees were enacted as early as 1872, and again in 1944. A portion of the current statutory provision, at 18 U.S.C. Section 207, was enacted in 1962 as part of a major revision and recodification of the federal bribery and conflict of interest laws. That post-employment conflict of interest law was then amended and broadened by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which added certain one-year \"cooling-off\" periods for high-level executive branch personnel, limiting their post-employment advocacy activities before the federal government for one year after leaving office. After President Reagan vetoed a major congressional revision of the post-employment law which had been passed by Congress in 1988, Congress adopted as part of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 most of the changes in the vetoed legislation. The statute has been amended several times since 1989, including extensive technical amendments in 1990. In 2007, as part of legislation dealing with lobbying laws and internal congressional rules on gifts, changes were made to the revolving door statute increasing the one-year \"cooling off\" period for \"very senior\" executive officials and for U.S. Senators to two years, and broadening the one-year \"cooling off\" restrictions for covered senior Senate staff.", "One of the initial and earliest purposes of enacting the \"revolving door\" laws was to protect the government against the use of proprietary information by former employees who might use that information on behalf of a private party in an adversarial type of proceeding or matter against the government, to the potential detriment of the public interest. As noted by the United States Court of Appeals in upholding the constitutionality of the \"switching sides\" prohibition of 18 U.S.C. Section 207(a), \"the purpose of protecting the government, which can act only through agents, from the use against it by former agents of information gained in the course of their agency, is clearly a proper one.\"", "Another interest of the government in revolving door restrictions was to limit the potential influence and allure that a lucrative private arrangement, or the prospect of such an arrangement, may have on a current federal official when dealing with prospective private clients or future employers while still with the government, that is, \"that the government employee not be influenced in the performance of public duties by the thought of later reaping a benefit from a private individual.\" In a case dealing with another federal statute which relates in part to potential future private employment of a current federal official, the court noted that the statutory scheme was intended to deal with the \"nagging and persistent conflicting interests of the government official who has his eye cocked toward subsequent private employment.\" Additional interests asserted in the proposed amendments to 18 U.S.C. Section 207 in the 99 th and 100 th Congresses were to prevent the corrupting influence on the governmental processes of both legislating and administering the law that may occur, and the appearances of such influences, when a federal official leaves his government post to \"cash in\" on his \"inside\" knowledge and personal influence with those persons remaining in the government. As noted in the post-employment regulations promulgated under the statute by the Office of Government Ethics, the provisions of the law and regulation are directed at prohibiting \"certain acts by former Government employees which may reasonably give the appearance of making unfair use of prior Government employment and affiliations\"", "These purposes in adopting limitations on former employees' private employment opportunities must, however, also be balanced against the deterrent effect that overly restrictive provisions on career movement and advancement will have upon recruiting qualified and competent persons to government service. Furthermore, unduly restrictive provisions on the \"revolving door\" (that is, movement of government personnel into the private sector, and private sector employees into the government) may tend to isolate, or at least insulate government employees from private sector concerns, considerations, and experiences of the general public to a degree not desirable for public policy reasons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Executive Branch\u2014Representational Activities", "paragraphs": ["A criminal statute, codified at 18 U.S.C.

This lifetime ban is a fairly narrow and case-specific restriction which in practice would apply to one who, after working substantially on a particular governmental matter such as a specific contract, a particular investigation, or a certain legal action involving specifically identified private parties, then leaves the government and attempts to represent those private parties before the government on that same, specific matter. The \"switching sides\" prohibition does not generally apply to broad policy making matters, including rulemaking of an agency, but rather, as noted by the Office of Government Ethics, \"typically involves a specific proceeding affecting the legal rights of the parties or an isolatable transaction or related set of transactions between identifiable parties.\"", "This provision does not prohibit a former government official from doing all work for a private company or firm merely because the firm had done business with or had been regulated by the official's agency, or even had been directly affected by the former official's duties or responsibilities on a particular matter such as a contract. Rather, this particular prohibition is upon subsequent representational or professional advocacy types of activities, that is, where the former official makes \"any communication or ... appearance\" to or before the government \"with the intent to influence\" the government on the same matter on which the former official had personally and substantially worked while with the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2.

However, under the Rules of the House of Representatives, former Members of the House are not to be entitled to floor privileges if they have any \"direct or pecuniary interest in any legislative measure pending before the House or reported by any committee,\" and are not entitled to admission if they are registered lobbyists or agents of a foreign principal, or employed by or otherwise represent \"any party or organization for the purpose of influencing, directly or indirectly, the passage, defeat or amendment of any legislative measure pending before the House, reported by any committee\" or under consideration of a committee. The Senate rules have also been changed to withdraw floor privileges from a former Member or officer who is a registered lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal, or is in the employ of an organization for the purpose of influencing, directly or indirectly, the passage or defeat of legislation or any legislative proposal. The House and Senate have both limited the access of such former Members, if those former Members are registered lobbyists or foreign agents, to the athletic and exercise facilities in the House and Senate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "6. Acceptance of Civil Office by Retiring Member of Congress", "paragraphs": ["A Member of Congress may not, before the expiration of his or her term, accept a civil office in the U.S. government if that office was created, or the salary for the office had been increased during the Member's current term. This constitutional provision would by its terms prevent a Member of Congress from retiring from Congress before his or her current term has expired, and accepting such a civil position with the federal government. It may be noted that the disqualification has on many occasions been avoided in regard to an office for which the salary was increased during the Member's term, by enacting legislation lowering the salary of that particular office back to its previous level."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
