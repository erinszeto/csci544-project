A child with a disability may be placed in a private school by the local educational agency (LEA) or the State Educational Agency (SEA) and costs are paid by the agency. Children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools are treated differently; generally, they are to be provided special education and related services to the extent consistent with the number and location of such children in the school district served by a LEA pursuant to several requirements. These requirements include provisions relating to direct services to parentally placed private school children with disabilities, the calculation of the proportionate amount of funds, and a requirement for record keeping. Compliance procedures for these requirements were added by the 2004 reauthorization. For a general discussion of the changes made by P.L. 108-446, see CRS Report RL32716, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): Analysis of Changes Made by P.L. 108-446, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].

If a state receives funds under IDEA, it must make available a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) for all children with disabilities in the state. Under the law prior to the enactment of P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states were required to set forth policies and procedures to ensure that provision was made for the participation of children with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools by their parents consistent with the number and location of these children. These requirements were further detailed in regulations which required that local education agencies (LEAs) provide private school students an opportunity for equitable participation in program benefits and that these benefits had to be \"comparable in quality, scope, and opportunity for participation to the program benefits\" provided to students in the public schools. The vagueness of the statute and the \"equitable participation\" standard led to differences among the states and localities and to differences among the courts. Prior to P.L. 105-17 , the courts of appeals that had considered these issues had sharply divergent views. Some courts gave local authorities broad discretion to decide whether to provide services for children with disabilities in private schools which generally resulted in fewer services to such children while others attempted to equalize the costs for public and private school children. The Supreme Court had granted certiorari in several of these cases but when Congress rewrote the law in 1997, the Court vacated and remanded these cases.", "The IDEA Amendments of 1997 rejected the \"equitable participation\"standard and provided that to the extent consistent with the number and location of children with disabilities in the state who were enrolled in private schools by their parents, provision was made for the participation of these children in programs assisted by Part B by providing them with special education and related services. The amounts expended for these services by an LEA were to be equal to a proportionate amount of federal funds made available to the local educational agency under Part B of IDEA. These services could be provided to children with disabilities on the premises of private schools, including parochial, elementary and secondary schools. There was also a requirement that the statutory provisions relating to \"child find,\" identifying children with disabilities, are applicable to children enrolled in private schools, including parochial schools.", "More changes to these provisions were made by the 2004 reauthorization. The Senate report observed that \"the intent of these changes is to clarify the responsibilities of LEAs to ensure that services to these children are provided in a fair and equitable manner.\" In addition, the Senate report stated that \"many of the changes reflect current policy enumerated either in existing IDEA regulations or the No Child Left Behind Act.\" The House report noted that \"the bill makes a number of changes to clarify the responsibilities of local educational agencies to children with disabilities who are placed by their parents in private schools. The Committee feels that these are important changes that will resolve a number of issues that have been the subject of an increasing amount of contention in the last few years.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private School Placement under P.L. 108-446", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Types of Private School Placements", "paragraphs": ["A child with a disability may be placed in a private school by the LEA or the State Educational Agency (SEA) as a means of fulfilling the FAPE requirement for the child.

In this situation, the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the LEA unless a hearing officer or a court makes certain findings. However, IDEA does require some services for children in private schools, even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents.

A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this report; however, several of the issues raised include the disproportional effect on LEAs with large concentrations of private schools, the lack of change in the funding formula to reflect the change, and potential conflicts with state laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Specific Requirements for Parentally Placed Children", "paragraphs": ["There are five requirements regarding children parentally placed in private schools. The first is that the funds expended by the LEA, including direct services to parentally placed private school children, shall be equal to a proportionate amount of federal funds made available under part B of IDEA. The 2004 reauthorization added the phrase regarding direct services. The Senate report stated that \"it is the committee's intent that school districts place a greater emphasis on services provided directly to such children\u2014like specifically designed instructional activities and related services\u2014rather than devoting funds solely to indirect services such as professional development for private school personnel.\"", "Second, a new provision relating to the calculation of the proportionate amount is added. In calculating this amount, the LEA, after timely and meaningful consultation with representatives of private schools, shall conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of children with disabilities who are parentally placed in private schools. The final regulations provide a discussion and example of the proportionate share calculation.", "Third, the new law keeps the previous requirement that the services may be provided to children on the premises of private, including religious schools, to the extent consistent with law. P.L. 108-446 added the term \"religious\" while deleting the term \"parochial.\"", "Fourth, a specific provision regarding supplementing funds, not supplanting them, is added. State and local funds may supplement but not supplant the proportionate amount of federal funds required to be expended.", "Fifth, each LEA must maintain records and provide to the SEA the number of children evaluated, the number of children determined to have disabilities, and the number of children served under the private school provisions. The House report stated that \"such requirement ensures that these funds are serving their intended purpose.\" The general requirement regarding child find is essentially the same as previous law. The requirement for finding children with disabilities is the same as that delineated in \u00a7612(a)(3) for children who are not parentally placed in private schools, including religious schools. As was done in the previous section, the former use of the term \"parochial\" is replaced by the term \"religious\" in the new law. New provisions are added concerning equitable participation, activities, cost and the completion period. Child find is to be designed to ensure the equitable participation of parentally placed private school children with disabilities and their accurate count. The cost of child find activities may not be considered in meeting the LEA's proportional spending obligation. Finally, the child find for parentally placed private school children with disabilities is to be completed in a time period comparable to that for students attending public schools (\u00a7612(a)(10)(A)(ii))."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consultation Between the Local Educational Agency and Private School Officials", "paragraphs": ["P.L. 108-446 adds requirements concerning LEA consultation with private school officials and representatives of the parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities.

Generally, a private school official has the right to submit a complaint to the SEA alleging that the LEA did not engage in meaningful and timely consultation or did not give due consideration to the views of the private school official. If a private school official submits a complaint, he or she must provide the basis of the noncompliance to the SEA, and the LEA must forward the appropriate documentation. If the private school official is dissatisfied with the SEA's determination, he or she may submit a complaint to the Secretary of Education, and the SEA shall forward the appropriate documentation to the Secretary (\u00a7612(a)(10)(A)(v))."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Equitable Services", "paragraphs": ["The 2004 reauthorization contains a specific subsection regarding the provision of equitable services.
