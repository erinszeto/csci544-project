To be eligible for SNF coverage, a Medicare beneficiary must have been an inpatient of a hospital for at least 3 consecutive calendar days and transferred to a participating SNF usually within 30 days after discharge from the hospital. Beneficiaries must also receive treatment at the SNF for a condition they were receiving treatment for during their qualifying hospital stay (or for an additional condition that arose while in the SNF). For beneficiaries who meet these requirements, Medicare Part A may provide up to 100 days of coverage for the SNF stay.", "Under Medicare Part A, SNFs are reimbursed under a prospective payment system (PPS), which began on July 1, 1998.

Determination between an urban or rural base rate depends on whether the SNF is located within a core-based statistical area (CBSA). For SNF billing purposes, providers within CBSAs are reimbursed at an urban rate, while providers outside of CBSAs are reimbursed at a statewide rural rate. ", "As shown in the left portion of Figure 1 , the urban and rural base rates are broken down into four separate components: noncase-mix, noncase-mix therapy, nursing case-mix, and therapy case-mix. The noncase-mix component reflects the administrative and room-and-board costs of providing SNF care, whereas the noncase-mix therapy component reflects the costs for minimal therapy use (e.g., rehabilitation evaluations). The base rate's nursing and therapy case-mix components respectively reflect the national average costs of nursing and more intensive therapy for a one-day stay in an SNF. Breaking down the base rate into four rate components allows the PPS to adjust the base rate by RUGs, which classify beneficiaries by varying levels of expected nursing and therapy intensity. Every RUG has a noncase-mix component and nursing case-mix component and either a noncase-mix therapy component or therapy case-mix component.", "The base rates were developed from FY1995 SNF cost reports and are updated annually for inflation by the percentage change in the SNF market basket index. The SNF market basket index is a composite of weighted price levels, based on FY2010 prices, which are estimated to capture an accurate picture of an average SNF provider's total costs. The change in the SNF market basket index from the prior year is referred to as the market basket update and is provided by IHS Global Insight, Inc. In the event actual cost report data shows the percentage change in SNF costs to be at least \u00bd percentage point greater than the market basket update, the base rate will receive an additional forecast error cor rection for the difference the following fiscal year. In addition to any forecast error correction, as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, as amended; P.L. 111-148 ), the market basket update is offset by a productivity adjustment rate that is equal to an average of the previous 10-year productivity rates in the broader economy. The SNF productivity adjustment began with the start of FY2012.

After admission to an SNF, a beneficiary is classified into a RUG, which can change over the course of his or her stay. The RUG is designed to be an accurate reflection of the beneficiary's SNF accommodation and service costs, given the beneficiary's medical conditions and current medical practices. The most recent version of the RUG classification system has 66 different groups within eight major categories: (1) Rehabilitation Extensive Services (Ultra High, Very High, High, Medium, Low); (2) Rehabilitation (Ultra High, Very High, High, Medium, Low); (3) Extensive Services; (4) Special Care High; (5) Special Care Low; (6) Clinically Complex; (7) Behavioral Symptoms and Cognitive Performance; and (8) Reduced Physical Function. ", "The information used to assign a beneficiary into a RUG is gathered from the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS). The MDS is one of three parts of the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI), which must be completed for all residents in Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes. The additional two parts are the Care Area Assessment (CAA) and RAI Utilization Guidelines. The RAI is designed to help with \"gathering definitive information on a resident's strengths and needs, which must be addressed in an individualized care plan.\" The MDS portion of the RAI gathers data over 15 different criteria: (1) hearing, speech, and vision; (2) cognitive patterns; (3) mood; (4)\u00a0behavior; (5) preference for customary routine activities; (6) functional status; (7) bladder and bowel; (8) active diagnoses; (9) health conditions; (10) nutritional status; (11) dental status; (12)\u00a0skin conditions; (13) medications; (14) special treatments, procedures, and programs; and (15) restraints. ", "SNFs are required to complete the MDS for a beneficiary to receive reimbursement under Part A. The MDS assessments for Medicare payment are required to be completed on or about the 5 th day, 14 th day, 30 th day, 60 th day, and 90 th day of a patient's stay. For the most part, the MDS assessments' \"look back\" period, the time frame for gathering the patient's clinical information, is the seven days prior to the MDS payment assessment requirement dates. In addition to Medicare-required MDS assessments, federal law requires SNFs (as well as nursing homes) to complete the MDS and CAA for dual-eligible Medicare- and Medicaid-covered residents. These assessments must be completed near the beneficiaries' 92 nd day of stay, 366 th day of stay, and in the event of a significant change or correction in the beneficiary's status. Such assessments may be combined with the Medicare-required assessment dates when applicable.", "The most recent version of the RUG classification system is RUG-IV, which replaced the RUG-53 system on October 1, 2010 (start of FY2011). There are 66 RUGs; each RUG has a nursing case-mix index, and some RUGs have an additional therapy case-mix index, together known as RUG weights. The RUG weights are used to adjust the federal base rate for different levels of expected nursing and/or therapy intensity provided to the beneficiary. The federal base rate adjusted for a specific RUG is referred to as the case-mix adjusted rate.", "To create the case-mix adjusted rate, the relevant components of the urban or rural base rate must be added together. For each base rate, each RUG will have a noncase-mix component and a nursing component. The third and final component will be either a therapy case-mix component or a noncase-mix therapy component. The sum of all three components is the case-mix adjusted rate, which reflects the beneficiary's daily resource use before adjusting for area wage differences. The base rate's noncase-mix component is the same amount for every RUG. As shown in Figure 1 , the nursing component is determined by multiplying the base rate's nursing case-mix by the RUG-specific nursing case-mix index. Depending on the RUG, the third component will either be the base rate's non-casemix therapy amount, which is the same across RUGs, or the base rate's therapy case-mix multiplied by the RUG-specific therapy case-mix index, if applicable.

In order to calculate the area wage adjustment, the case-mix adjusted rate must be split into a labor-related share and a non-labor-related share. The labor-related share represents the amount of labor-related costs relative to total costs for providing SNF services to the average beneficiary. This labor-related share has historically been roughly 70% of the case-mix adjusted rate, with the remaining 30% allocated as the non-labor-related share. ", "As shown in Figure 1 , the labor-related share of the case-mix adjusted rate is multiplied by a hospital wage index specific to the location of the SNF to account for differences in area wages. The SNF wage index is calculated from a survey of wages and wage-related costs from acute care hospitals (because specific SNF wage data does not exist). For areas with no hospitals and wage-related data available, adjacent areas are used as a proxy measure for the missing cost information. The wage index is updated every year but receives an adjustment so the updated wage index does not increase or decrease aggregate Medicare SNF payments.", "After the wage index number has been determined and multiplied by the labor-related portion, the product is added back to the non-labor-related share. Finally, as shown in Figure 1 , the global per diem rate is the sum of the labor-adjusted product and non-labor-related share. The global per diem rate is the final reimbursement rate of daily SNF care reimbursed through Part A.

While MedPAC has found that Medicare reimbursements appear to be well above costs for SNFs in the aggregate, Medicare contributes 21% of the median nursing care facility's total revenue, with Medicaid payments comprising the largest share of revenue. Therefore, MedPAC's analysis on the financial performance of Medicare payments for SNF care may capture only about a fifth of the financial picture of an average nursing facility. ", "However, Medicare margins are only one factor that MedPAC considers when assessing the adequacy of Medicare's payments and determining its annual payment update recommendation. MedPAC weighs other indicators, such as beneficiaries' access to care (the capacity and supply of providers and the volume of services rendered), quality of care, and providers' access to capital as well.

Evidence suggests payments from non-Medicare payers do not cover the costs of their residents. In 2014, the non-Medicare margin (nursing facility payments from Medicaid, private, and other public payers less costs) was -1.5%. When including Medicare, however, the nursing facility industry's total margin was 1.9%.", "MedPAC has examined potential implications of targeting Medicare SNF reimbursements to compensate for inadequate payments from other providers. According to MedPAC, this strategy results in poorly targeted subsidies.
