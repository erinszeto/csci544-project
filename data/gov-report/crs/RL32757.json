While all qualified unemployed workers may receive unemployment compensation, older workers may replace lost earnings (conditional on age) with retirement savings and pension programs. For example, workers who are at least 59\u00bd years old may begin to take funds out of their IRA based savings without incurring the 10% early withdrawal penalty. At age 60, qualified widows and widowers may begin to receive their widow(er)s' Social Security benefits. At age 62, all workers may receive a reduced, or \"early,\" Social Security benefit. Finally, at some age between 65 and 67 (depending on their birth year) workers can receive their \"full,\" or non-reduced, Social Security benefit.", "Thus, depending on the age of the older unemployed workers, new options are incorporated into their labor force participation decisions and UC benefits for unemployed workers become relatively less important in income replacement. Previously, these workers were motivated to stay in the labor market and use UC benefits to give themselves adequate time to engage in an effective job search. As they age, the older workers' job searches change. In order to attain new employment, older workers may (1) need to form new (potentially lower) expectations of wages that reflect the loss of tenure and firm specific knowledge, (2) need to obtain new skills through training programs in order to remain competitive in the labor market, or (3) wish to use a spell of unemployment as a bridge to easing into retirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Aging Demographics of the Population", "paragraphs": ["The pattern of unemployment leading to unexpectedly early retirement is not a new development.

The shifting demographics of the workforce have made what was once a fairly small policy issue grow in importance. Over the next 25 years, the age profile of the U.S. population and the U.S. workforce will change dramatically. Members of the \"baby boom\" generation, those who were born between 1946 and 1964, are currently between 40 and 59 years old. This boom creates a peak in the U.S. population chart presented in Figure 1 .

In 2000, this group comprised 12.0% of the total population. Predictions for 2030 increase its proportion to 18.0%. This 6 percentage point increase is equivalent to just under a 50% growth in the demographic group's share of the population.

Research suggests that the educational and health services industries will be disproportionately affected when workers in those industries begin to retire since they currently have an age distribution which is older than that of other industries.", "Federal policy has recognized the problems that this demographic trend may create by encouraging workers to extend their labor force participation through increasing the full-retirement age for Social Security benefits while decreasing the rate at which earnings offset benefits and through abolishing mandatory retirement ages for most jobs.", "These federal efforts to encourage workers to work longer have not been mirrored by supports to keep older unemployed workers in the workforce. With a few exceptions, the UC system generally does not treat common older worker employment patterns favorably. Depending on the particular state, a desire for part-time work or self-employment may disqualify a worker from receiving UC benefits. At the same time, retirement income may lower UC benefits, which are especially important for those workers who are bridging into retirement. This retirement income offset in the UC program will decrease the amount of income connected with an older worker's job search and may cause unemployed older workers to completely exit the labor market.

Labor force participation rates climb rapidly in the population aged 20-24 as formal schooling is finished and students enter the labor market. Between the ages of 25 and 54, labor force participation is fairly consistent and high with approximately 83% being actively engaged in the labor market. Rates begin a substantial decline as workers reach age 55. Just under 62% of those between the ages of 55 and 64, and just over 13% of those 65 and older are actively working or searching for work.", "The unemployment rate is the ratio of those workers who did not have a job but had searched for a job in the previous four weeks to all workers active in the labor market (either searching or employed). Typically, unemployment is a large social concern for the youngest and least skilled of workers. As workers age and gain skills and tenure, the likelihood that they are unemployed decreases. In fact, one study found that the aging labor force accounted for half of the decrease in unemployment in the 1990s. In 2003, 4.8% of prime-age (35-54 years of age) workers were unemployed on average. Older workers continued to have lower rates of unemployment: 3.9% for those aged 55-64 and 3.6% for those 65 and older. However, between 2000 and 2002, older workers experienced rising unemployment rates that were greater in relative magnitude than those for younger workers during the same period.", " Table 1 lists the participation and unemployment rates for workers aged 35 and older in 2003. Notice that labor force participation rates are heavily influenced by the age at which older Americans become eligible for programs such as early retirement for Social Security (age 62). The unemployment rates do not vary substantially for older Americans; this may be in part due to older unemployed workers choosing to declare themselves out of the labor force. For example, it is unlikely that all of the 56.2% of the Americans aged 62-64 who are out of the labor force would prefer not to have a job. Some may choose to declare themselves retired rather than admit to being unemployed. There is weak evidence that this may be true from the otherwise unexplained 10% decrease in the reported unemployment rate from 4.4% for Americans aged 60-61 to 4.0% for those aged 62-64.", " Table 1 demonstrates that workers aged 35-54 (prime-age workers) have the highest labor force participation rates with more than 80% of the non-institutionalized civilian population active in the labor market. There is a rapid decline of labor force activity as workers reach their late 50s (55-59)\u2014the approximate age when many buy-outs and some private pension plans allow for early retirement. This is reflected in a pronounced drop in labor force participation of 8.4 percentage points (from 79.4% to 71.4%) from what was reported for workers in their early 50s. This drop is followed by a subsequent 19.8 percentage point drop as workers enter their early 60s, when widow(er)s' Social Security benefits (age 60) and early retirement (age 62) become available.", "In the span from the 50-54 age group to the 60-64 age group, the labor force participation rate falls to just under two-thirds of what it had been. This is not, perhaps, surprising given that at age 62 a reduced Social Security benefit becomes available. This reduction in Social Security benefits has been constructed to be actuarially fair on average. (That is, it does not set a penalty for early participation but rather reduces the Social Security benefit so that the discounted value of the benefit is equal to that of the full retirement benefit for an average worker.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Definitions of Retirement and Labor Force Participation", "paragraphs": ["For the purposes of this report, the term worker refers to all participants in the labor market. Individuals who are not employed or not actively searching for a job and are at least 55 years old are labeled as being retired, regardless of pension or Social Security benefit income. This is substantially different from the definition often used in retirement analyses. Generally, retirement is defined with reference to two characteristics: nonparticipation in the labor force, and receipt of income from pensions, Social Security, or other retirement savings vehicles. An individual who does not work for compensation and who receives income only from these retirement-based income replacements would meet this definition of retirement.", "Between these two extremes, however, are those who might be considered to have retired based on one part of the definition but not the other. For example, of recipients of employer pensions and retirement savings plans, 40% of the male recipients and 34.5% of the female recipients were employed. Sometimes, these workers are employed in \" bridge\" jobs that help to transition them from full labor force participation into retirement. Other workers may be fully employed in another career while enjoying the retirement benefits from a previous job. In such cases, retirement from a particular job does not necessarily signal that the worker has withdrawn from the workforce and moved into the strict definition of retirement.", "On the other hand, some of those who retire from full-time employment continue to work part-time to supplement their retirement-based income but receive the majority of their income through Social Security, pensions, and savings.

These transitional steps may include creating alternative work arrangements (moving from full-time to part-time status) or switching to less demanding positions\u2014which may not be in the same occupation or industry (a bridge job).

Dislocated workers have a lower chance of finding new employment. In addition, those who do find employment typically earn substantially less than they did in their previous job. For older workers a job dislocation has more of an impact on earnings than for younger workers. A significant proportion of their previous high salaries may be attributed to job tenure; thus, wages from new jobs may be substantially lower. Likewise, facing lower levels of replaced earnings, older workers are also less likely to continue to work after job dislocation.

For example, after approximately 15 to 18 months of reemployment, a worker's UC benefit is strictly determined by the new employment activity. However, workers who are bridging to retirement through part-time work or self-employment are sometimes excluded from receiving UC benefits and workers receiving some pension or other retirement benefits may have their UC benefits substantially offset.

Those workers who are receiving early retirement benefits now have a greater amount of money they may earn before their Social Security benefit is subject to reduction and the rate at which their Social Security benefit is offset is smaller. Workers who are at or above full retirement age (age 65 and six months if born in 1957) may keep all of their Social Security benefits, with no earnings tests. Workers younger than the full-retirement age for the entire year, have an earnings limit. For every $2 earned above $12,960 (in 2007) there is a $1 deduction in the benefit.

An expected result of this degradation of benefit level would be that workers would work longer and save more to replace their reduced benefits.", "The changes in the earnings test and the increase in the full-retirement age are fairly new and have only recently been analyzed. Before the elimination of the earnings test for individuals at or above the full retirement age, most studies, such as that by produced by Gruber and Orzag (2000) suggested that eliminating the test would have a modest effect on labor supply. One study, Friedberg (2000), predicted that eliminating the earnings test would increase the hours worked by 65-69 year old men by about 5%. The first study to investigate the preliminary effects of removing the test, Song (2003), concludes that while the removal increased hours worked for those with higher earnings, the effect on lower earners is not statistically significant and there is no clear evidence of the effect of the removal on the labor force participation rate.

However, viewing these same offset rules from the vantage point of an early retiree, these offsets also erode the incentives for those early retirees to re-engage themselves in the labor market."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
