The statutory provisions of the FFDCA that address cosmetics include adulteration and misbranding provisions. In addition to the FFDCA, cosmetics are regulated under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) and related regulations. The cosmetics provisions were amended by the Color Additive Amendments Act of 1960 and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, but remain basically the same as the provisions in the 1938 FFDCA.", "FDA's authorities over cosmetic products include some of those applicable to other FDA-regulated products, such as food, drugs, medical devices, and tobacco. For example, FDA has the authority to take certain enforcement actions\u2014such as seizures, injunctions, and criminal penalties\u2014against adulterated or misbranded cosmetics. Additionally, as with drug and food companies, FDA may conduct inspections of cosmetic manufacturers and prohibit imports of cosmetics that violate the FFDCA. The agency also has issued rules restricting the use of ingredients that the agency has determined are poisonous or deleterious.", "However, FDA's authority over cosmetics is less comprehensive than its authority over other FDA-regulated products with regard to registration; testing; premarket notification, clearance, or approval; good manufacturing practices; mandatory risk labeling; adverse event reports; and recalls. For example, FDA does not impose registration requirements on cosmetic manufacturers. Rather, cosmetic manufacturers may decide to comply with voluntary FDA regulations on registration. With the exception of color additives, FDA does not require premarket notification, safety testing, review, or approval of the chemicals used in cosmetic products. Cosmetic manufacturers also are not required to use good manufacturing practices (GMP)\u2014although FDA has released GMP guidelines for cosmetic manufacturers\u2014nor required to file ingredient information with, or report adverse reactions to, the agency. Instead, under a voluntary FDA program, cosmetic manufacturers and packagers may report the ingredients used in their product formulations. FDA does not have the authority to require a manufacturer to recall a cosmetic product from the marketplace, although the agency has issued general regulations on voluntary recalls. The agency's ability to issue regulations on cosmetic products is limited by the agency's statutory authorities or lack thereof.", "As a result, cosmetics are arguably more self-regulated than other FDA-regulated products. The manner in which a cosmetic product could or should be regulated, however, is not always clear. FDA's guidelines have provided the cosmetic industry with considerable flexibility for product development and claims. The question remains as to whether that flexibility and the extent of government oversight of cosmetic products are still appropriate."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. cosmetic, beauty supply, and perfume retail industry consists of approximately 13,000 establishments, with annual revenue of about $10 billion.

Drugs must either receive the agency's premarket approval of a new drug application or conform to a set of FDA regulations known as a monograph. Monographs govern the manufacture and marketing of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and specify the conditions under which OTC drugs in a particular category (such as antidandruff shampoos or antiperspirants) will be considered to be generally recognized as safe and effective. Monographs also indicate how OTC drugs must be labeled so they are not deemed to be misbranded. Such labeling includes a Drug Facts panel, which provides a listing of the active ingredients in the product as well as the drug's purposes, uses, and applicable warnings, directions, inactive ingredients, other information, and a telephone number for questions about the product.

", "The determination of whether a cosmetic is also a drug, and therefore subject to the additional statutory requirements that apply to drugs, is based on the distributor's intent or the intended use. The intended use of a product may be established in several ways, such as claims on the labeling or in advertising or promotional materials, or through the inclusion of ingredients that will cause the product to be considered a drug because of a known therapeutic use. For example, if a lipstick (a cosmetic) contains sunscreen (a drug), the mere inclusion of the term \"sunscreen\" in the product's labeling will cause the product to also be regulated as a drug.

A cosmetic is considered to be misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading, if it does not bear the required labeling information, or if the container is made or filled in a deceptive manner. ", "Prior to the enactment of the FFDCA in 1938, cosmetics were not regulated by the federal government, but were regulated under a collection of state laws that had been enacted to regulate food and drugs. At that time, several \"cosmetics and drugs were made from the same natural materials\" and the \"laws did not include explicit definitions of the products regulated.\" Following several incidents in which cosmetics were allegedly the cause of serious health problems, as well as industry concerns about states enacting their own laws, provisions were included in FFDCA that prohibited the sale of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce. The FFDCA also established uniform regulation of FDA-regulated cosmetic products throughout the country.", "In addition to the FFDCA, cosmetics are regulated under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) and related regulations.

However, concerns of consumer and industry groups today are similar to those expressed prior to the enactment of the FFDCA. Consumer groups have raised concerns about particular ingredients, and states have considered legislating in areas not covered by the FFDCA or federal regulations.", "If a cosmetic that is introduced into, in, or held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce is found to be adulterated or misbranded, FDA may take enforcement actions, such as seeking an injunction (which could prevent a company from making or distributing the violative product), seizing the violative product, or seeking criminal penalties. Additionally, FDA has authority to prevent imports of violative cosmetic products from entering the United States.", "FDA's authority to regulate cosmetics also includes the authority to conduct inspections of cosmetic establishments, without notifying the establishments in advance, as long as the inspections occur \"at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner.\" FDA conducts inspections to assure product safety and to evaluate cosmetic products for potential adulteration or misbranding violations. The agency may decide to inspect a facility based on consumer or industry complaints, the establishment's compliance history, or FDA surveillance initiatives. The agency may collect samples for examination and analysis during plant and import inspections, and follow up on complaints of adverse events alleged to be caused by a given cosmetic product. The agency does not have a required schedule for inspecting cosmetic facilities. ", "FDA has certain regulations and procedures for cosmetics with which manufacturers voluntarily may choose to comply, even though similar regulations and procedures are mandatory for other FDA-regulated products. For example, FDA has regulations on voluntary facility registration and voluntarily reporting for ingredients used in cosmetic products and adverse reactions to cosmetics. In contrast, registration requirements exist for other FDA product manufacturers. Additionally, cosmetic manufacturers are not required, as drug manufacturers are, to \"file data on ingredients, or report cosmetic-related injuries to FDA.\" Instead, under a voluntary FDA program, cosmetic manufacturers and packagers may report the ingredients used in their product formulations. Furthermore, consumers and cosmetic manufacturers may voluntarily report adverse reactions to cosmetics to FDA. Finally, FDA does not have mandatory recall authority to require a cosmetic manufacturer to recall a product from the marketplace. However, the agency may request a voluntary recall, and FDA has issued general regulations on the conduct of voluntary recalls that outline the agency's expectations of manufacturers during a recall.

", "In August 2011, FDA issued a warning letter to the CEO of Brazilian Blowout, noting that the product was both adulterated and misbranded under the FFDCA. FDA asserted that the product was adulterated because the cosmetic \"bears or contains a deleterious substance [methylene glycol] that may render it injurious to users under the conditions of use prescribed in your labeling.\" Additionally, FDA stated that the product was misbranded because \"its label and labeling (including instructions for use) makes misleading statements regarding the product's ingredients and fails to reveal material facts with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the product.\" FDA advised the CEO to take corrective actions or face potential enforcement actions, including seizures and injunctions, and emphasized that manufacturers have a duty to ensure the products they market are safe and in compliance with FDA requirements.", "Depending on how \"formaldehyde free\" hair keratin products have been advertised, the Federal Trade Commission also may be authorized to initiate an action for deceptive advertising. Action by state attorneys general may also be possible. The California Attorney General's office filed a lawsuit against one company for labeling violations, deceptive advertising, and violations of state cosmetics and toxics acts. The lawsuit resulted in a settlement with the manufacturer requiring a \"CAUTION\" warning on two of its products (including a California Proposition 65 cancer warning); the production of a Material Safety Data Sheet and its posting on the company's website; the end of deceptive advertising, including modifications to the company's website; retesting of products at approved laboratories; reporting to the California Department of Public Health Safe Cosmetics Program; the disclosure of refund policies; proof of professional licensing before sale of professional use only products; civil penalties; and attorneys fees.

Additionally, FDA cannot mandate that a company recall a product that may violate the FFDCA or FPLA, but the agency can request that a manufacturer voluntarily recall a cosmetic product. Nor does the agency have the authority to mandate adverse event reports for interactions that consumers experience from the use of a company's products. However, as indicated earlier, FDA has encouraged consumer reporting of adverse events associated with cosmetics.
