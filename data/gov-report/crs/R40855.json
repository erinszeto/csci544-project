Currently, federal agencies may contract with ANCs or their subsidiaries under several different statutory authorities. These include (1) the Armed Services Procurement Act (ASPA) and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA); (2) Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act; and (3) Section 15 of the Small Business Act. The identity of the procuring agency and the size of the ANC or ANC-owned firm, in part, determine which authority is used in particular circumstances.", "ASPA and FPASA, for example, generally give defense and civilian agencies, respectively, broad authority to contract with any qualified, responsible source, including ANCs and their subsidiaries. Contractors do not need to be \"small\" in size, or for-profit entities, as they generally must be to receive contracts under the Small Business Act. ASPA and FPASA also authorize agencies to make sole-source awards in certain circumstances (e.g., unusual and compelling urgency), although such awards must be justified in writing and approved by agency officials.", "Two sections of the Small Business Act also permit contracts with certain ANCs or their subsidiaries. Section 8(a) of the act authorizes agencies to contract with small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or groups participating in the \"8(a) Program.\" ANCs are deemed to be socially and economically disadvantaged, and ANC-owned firms may participate in the 8(a) Program. Under Section 8(a), agencies may conduct competitions in which only 8(a) firms may compete (i.e., set-asides), as well as make sole-source awards in circumstances where such awards would not be permitted under ASPA or FPASA. 8(a) contracts valued in excess of $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts) must generally be competed among 8(a) firms. However, Section 8(a) authorizes sole-source awards of such contracts to 8(a) firms if (1) the contracting officer does not reasonably expect that at least two 8(a) firms will submit offers at a fair market price; or (2) the Small Business Administration accepts the requirement on behalf of an 8(a) firm owned by an ANC or other disadvantaged group. Sole-source contracts under the authority of Section 8(a) historically did not need to be justified or approved. However, since 2009, agencies have been required to justify and obtain approval for sole-source 8(a) contracts valued in excess of $20 million (base plus options). Section 15 of the Small Business Act also authorizes set-asides (but not sole-source awards) for various types of small businesses. ANC-owned small businesses not participating in the 8(a) Program could receive awards under the authority of Section 15.", "In addition, several other statutes create incentives for agencies to contract with ANCs or their subsidiaries by, for example, allowing contracts with \"large\" ANCs to count toward federal prime contractors' goals for subcontracting with small businesses. Similarly, various appropriations riders permit the Department of Defense to contract out functions performed by government employees to ANCs without going through the customary competitive sourcing process.", "Members of the 112th Congress have introduced legislation (H.R. 598, S. 236) that would generally subject ANC-owned firms participating in the 8(a) Program to the same treatment as individually owned firms.

The dollars awarded to ANC-owned firms through the 8(a) Program, in particular, reportedly tripled between FY2004 ($1.1 billion) and FY2008 ($3.9 billion). Critics are concerned about the impact of these increases on other minority-owned businesses participating in the 8(a) Program, as well as the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse when agencies make sole-source awards to ANCs or their subsidiaries. However, supporters of contracting programs for ANCs point out that, even with the recent increases, contracting with ANCs and their subsidiaries represents a small percentage of federal contract dollars.

The settlement lands were to be divided among the 12 regional corporations based on the acreage of their regions and among the village corporations based chiefly on their populations. Group and urban corporations were to receive a set number of acres apiece. (Conveyance of title to the ANCs is the responsibility of the Bureau of Land Management, which reported in its FY2013 budget justifications that 59% of the lands to be conveyed had been surveyed and patented to the ANCs.) The settlement funds were to be paid out over a number of years and divided among the regional corporations (including the 13 th corporation) based on their population. Each regional corporation was to distribute at least half of its share of these funds to the village corporations in its region.

While most of these enactments in some way limited DOD's ability to contract out functions using the A-76 process, one rider attached to every DOD appropriations act since 1989 has permitted DOD to avoid the A-76 process and its restrictions on outsourcing by contracting functions out to firms owned by ANCs, Indian tribes, or NHOs. ", "The original version of this rider generally restricted outsourcing using the A-76 process, but exempted so-called \"direct conversions\" to \"qualified firm[s] under 51 percent Native American ownership,\" among others. Such firms included those owned by ANCs, Indian tribes, or individual Native Americans. The 106 th Congress later made two modifications to this provision. First, it exempted direct conversions to \"qualified firms\" from requirements concerning federal employee comments and congressional notification codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72461(b)-(c), as well as from the A-76 process codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72461(a). Second, while it maintained the exemption for direct conversion to firms owned by ANCs and Indian tribes, it removed the exemption for direct conversions to firms owned by Native American individuals and replaced it with one for direct conversions to NHO-owned firms. The exemptions for direct conversions remained unchanged since the 106 th Congress. ", "However, while these appropriations riders allowed DOD to avoid the A-76 process when contracting out functions to ANCs or ANC-owned firms, they did not authorize DOD to make noncompetitive awards to such entities. For this reason, DOD has used the authority to make sole-source awards above the competitive threshold to ANC-owned firms codified in Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act in conjunction with its authority under the appropriations riders.

The proposed legislation would accomplish this, in part, by amending the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) so that ANCs are no longer deemed to be socially or economically disadvantaged for purposes of Sections 7(j) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act. It would also amend the definition of \"Indian tribe\" contained in Section 8(a)(13) of the Small Business Act so that ANCs no longer constitute \"Indian tribes\" for purposes of the 8(a) Program. By doing so, H.R. 598 and S. 236 would preclude ANCs from receiving sole source awards in excess of $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts) under the authority of the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act (BODRA) of 1988. Section 602(a) of BODRA currently provides that the \"competitive thresholds\" contained in Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act do not apply to entities defined as \"Indian tribes\" in Section 8(a). Excluding ANCs from Section 8(a)'s definition of \"Indian tribe\" would, thus, subject them to the competitive thresholds, as well as require that all affiliations of ANC-owned firms count when the firms' size is determined and that an ANC may participate in the 8(a) Program only one time.", "The proposed legislation would also amend Section 8(a) to (1) prevent ANC-owned firms from receiving additional sole-source awards when the total amount of competitive and sole-source awards they have received in any year exceeds the total amount of competitive and sole-source awards that individually owned firms may receive (currently, $100 million); (2) prohibit the SBA from exempting ANC-owned firms from any time limitations on participation in the 8(a) Program to which individually owned 8(a) firms are subject; and (3) require ANCs to report annually to the SBA on their total revenue, the amount of this revenue attributable to the 8(a) Program, and the \"total amount of benefits paid to shareholders.\" H.R. 598 and S. 236 would also require the SBA to amend the regulations for the 8(a) Program so as to preclude SBA from waiving the requirement that the management and daily business operations of ANC-owned firms be controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; prohibit ANCs from conferring eligibility to participate in the 8(a) Program on more than one firm at a time; and preclude ANC-owned 8(a) firms from acquiring ownership interests in other 8(a) firms that exceed the ownership interests that individually owned 8(a) firms may acquire. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Developments", "paragraphs": ["On February 11, 2011, SBA amended its rules to change certain eligibility and other requirements pertaining to the 8(a) Program. Several of these changes apply specifically to ANC-owned firms. Under the new rules, ANC-owned 8(a) firms (1) may not receive a sole-source 8(a) contract that is a follow-on contract to an 8(a) contract that was performed immediately previously by a firm owned by the same ANC; (2) must report annually to the SBA on the benefits provided to Alaska Natives from the ANC's participation in the 8(a) Program; and (3) may be found to have potential for success if the ANC pledges to use its resources to support the firm and to not allow the firm to cease operations. The rule also generally prohibits non-8(a) firms that form joint ventures with 8(a) firms to perform sole-source contracts in excess of $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts) from serving as subcontractors (at any tier) on the contract. In addition, the rule indicates that it is the SBA's policy to have ANC-owned firms' applications for the 8(a) Program processed at the San Francisco Division of Program Certification and Eligibility whenever possible. These applications had previously been processed in the Anchorage District Office.", "These changes generally took effect on March 14, 2011, although the SBA has delayed implementation of the requirement that ANCs report on the benefits provided to Alaska Natives through their participation in the 8(a) Program."], "subsections": []}]}}
