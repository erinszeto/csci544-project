Extension for Community Health Centers, The National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Centers that Operate GME Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Law", "paragraphs": ["The health center program, authorized by Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), provides grants to not-for-profit or state and local government entities to operate outpatient health centers. These centers are required to be located in medically underserved areas (MUAs) or to provide care to a population that is designated as underserved. Grants are awarded competitively, with some preference given to sites in rural areas. The program has a number of grant programs, including, but not limited to, grants to support health center operations, grants to enable health centers to expand services, and grants for health centers to engage in quality improvement activities. The health center program supports four types of health centers: (1) community health centers, (2) health centers for the homeless, (3) health centers for residents of public housing, and (4) migrant health centers. Community health centers (CHCs) are the most numerous because they provide care to a generally underserved population. The remaining three types are less common because each serves more targeted subpopulations of the underserved than do CHCs. ", "All four types of health centers are required to provide primary health services and preventive and emergency health services. Primary health services are those provided by physicians or physician extenders (physicians' assistants, nurse clinicians, and nurse practitioners) to diagnose, treat, or refer patients. Primary health services include relevant diagnostic laboratory and radiology services. Preventive health services include well-child care, prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family planning, health education, and preventive dental care. Emergency health services refer to the requirement that health centers have defined arrangements with outside providers for emergent cases that the center is not equipped to treat and for after-hours care. Health centers are also required to provide additional health services that are not primary health services but are necessary to meet the health needs of the service population. This includes, but is not limited to, behavioral health services and environmental health services. ", "Historically, the health center program had generally been supported with discretionary appropriations; however, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , as amended) created the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), which provided mandatory funding for the program. The ACA appropriated a total of $9.5 billion to the fund from FY2011 through FY2015, as follows: ", "$1 billion for FY2011, $1.2 billion for FY2012, $1.5 billion for FY2013, $2.2 billion for FY2014, and $3.6 billion for FY2015.", "Funding for the CHCF was subsequently extended as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA, P.L. 114-10 ), which provided $3.6 billion for each of FY2016 and FY2017. The mandatory CHCF appropriations are provided in addition to discretionary funding for the program; however, the CHCF comprised approximately 72% of health center programs' appropriations in FY2017. ", "The CHCF also provides mandatory funding for the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), authorized in Title III of the PHSA. The NHSC provides scholarships and loan repayments to certain health professionals in exchange for providing care in a health professional shortage area (HPSA) for a period of time that varies based on the length of the scholarship or the number of years of loan repayment received. This program last received discretionary appropriations in FY2011; since that time, CHCF funds have been the sole source of NHSC funding.", "The ACA also created and provided mandatory funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program (THCGME). The program provides direct and indirect graduate medical education (GME) payments to support medical and dental residents training at qualified teaching health centers, which are outpatient health care facilities that provide care to underserved patients. The program was established in the ACA, which appropriated $230 million for direct and indirect GME payments for the period of FY2011 through FY2015. Program funding was subsequently extended in MACRA, which appropriated $60 million for each of FY2016 and FY2017 for direct and indirect GME payments for teaching health centers. MACRA funds were used to fund residents at existing teaching health center programs; no new teaching health centers were added to the program. MACRA funds ended at the end of FY2017. Program funding was extended for the first quarter of FY2018 in the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-63 ), which provided $15 million for the first quarter of FY2018.
