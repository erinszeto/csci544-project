Generally, they visit the homes of eligible families on a regular basis (e.g., weekly or monthly) over an extended period (e.g., six months or longer) to provide support to caregivers and children, such as guidance on creating a positive home environment and referrals to community resources. Families participate on a voluntary basis. Research on the efficacy of home visiting has shown that some models can help improve selected child and family outcomes, such as reducing child abuse.

The ACA, and amendments to the act, have directly appropriated mandatory funding for the program.

In practice, HHS has distributed MIECHV funding based on a formula that accounts for poverty and based on a competitive award process. States, territories, and tribes must carry out their home visiting programs as specified in the law. Among other requirements, these jurisdictions had to carry out a needs assessment by September 20, 2010, to identify communities with concentrations of poor infant health and other negative outcomes for children and families; the availability and use of home visiting services; and the capacity for providing substance abuse treatment and counseling in the jurisdiction. BBA 2018 directs jurisdictions to update this assessment by October 1, 2020.

The federal government has long supported early childhood programs in which home visiting is a major component or is otherwise permitted. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program is the primary federal program that focuses exclusively on home visiting. The program was implemented in March 2010, following the Obama Administration's budget request for a national home visiting program and a home visitation pilot program carried out in 15 states that had been initiated by the George W. Bush Administration. Congress considered proposals to establish home visiting programs as part of health care reform in 2010 and in prior years. ", "HHS provides MIECHV funding to states, territories, and tribal entities for home visiting services in at-risk communities, as identified by these jurisdictions. MIECHV prioritizes certain populations, including low-income families, young mothers, or individuals who have a history of substance abuse, among other risk factors. Families participate on a voluntary basis. In FY2017, the MIECHV program served 156,297 individual parents and children who participated in 942,676 home visits. Jurisdictions that carry out home visiting programs under the program must adhere to specific requirements.

For some home visiting models, the number of visits becomes more infrequent over time. Depending on the program model, visits may be conducted by nurses, mental health clinicians, social workers, or paraprofessionals who have received specialized training. These visitors provide services such as parenting education and they refer families to other services in the community.", "To a large extent, parents shape their children's earliest experiences. Home visiting programs seek to help parents better understand the development of their children. For example, home visitors can help parents facilitate learning opportunities through playing games, talking to their children frequently, and reading to them. Home visitors can also provide information to parents about child health, such as the value of well-child visits, car seat safety, and brushing teeth. Home visiting can directly help parents identify outside supports, such as referrals for health insurance and substance abuse resources. The programs can help achieve positive benefits for children, parents, and possibly their communities.", "For many years, greater attention has been focused on early childhood home visitation as a way to improve child and family outcomes.

They caution, however, that while visiting programs can lead to improvements, the difference is small between observed outcomes for families that received home visits versus those who did not. Further, while one or more individual studies may have shown positive effects with regard to the desired outcomes, those effects have not necessarily been studied and/or achieved across more than one study or program site. Nonetheless, some models or aspects of models have been shown to be particularly effective. Overall, while researchers have cautioned that home visiting is not a panacea, they have generally encouraged its implementation as part of a range of strategies intended to enhance and improve early childhood development.
