These amendments also required all Members of Congress to participate in Social Security as of January 1, 1984, regardless of when they first entered Congress.

Coverage under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) was extended to Congress in January 1942 by P.L. 77-411. That law was repealed just two months later in response to adverse public opinion. In 1946, P.L. 79-601 again extended CSRS coverage to Congress, at the option of Members, with higher contributions and greater benefits than those applicable to regular federal employees. In its report on that legislation, the Special Committee on the Organization of Congress stated that a retirement plan for Congress", "would contribute to independence of thought and action, [be] an inducement for retirement for those of retiring age or with other infirmities, [and] bring into the legislative service a larger number of younger Members with fresh energy and new viewpoints concerning the economic, social, and political problems of the Nation.", "The Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ) required all federal employees hired in 1984 or later to participate in Social Security. These amendments also required all Members of Congress to participate in Social Security as of January 1, 1984, regardless of when they first entered Congress. Requiring federal workers to participate in both CSRS and Social Security would have duplicated some benefits and would have resulted in employee payroll deductions for the two programs that would exceed 13% of pay. After mandating Social Security coverage of new federal employees beginning in 1984, Congress directed the development of a new retirement plan for federal workers with Social Security coverage as its foundation. The result of this effort was the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-335 ).", "The Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) went into effect in 1987, and employees first hired in 1984 or later were automatically enrolled in this plan. Employees who had been in the federal government before 1984 were given the option to remain in CSRS\u2014without Social Security coverage\u2014or to switch to FERS. The options for Members of Congress differed from those available to other federal employees because the 1983 amendments required all Members of Congress to participate in Social Security. Members first elected in 1984 or later were given the option to enroll in FERS as well as being covered by Social Security, or to be covered only by Social Security. Members who had been in Congress before 1984 could elect to stay in CSRS in addition to being covered by Social Security; to elect coverage under an \"offset plan\" that integrates CSRS and Social Security; to elect coverage under FERS in addition to being covered by Social Security; or to be covered only by Social Security.", "Because of the uncertain tenure of congressional service, FERS was originally designed, as CSRS had been, to provide a larger benefit for each year of service to Members of Congress and congressional staff than to most other federal employees. Prior to P.L. 112-96 , all Members of Congress also became eligible for retirement annuities at an earlier age and with fewer years of service than most other federal employees. However, all Members of Congress and congressional staff also paid a higher percentage of salary for their retirement benefits than do most other federal employees before P.L. 112-96 was enacted.", "The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ) made two significant changes to the retirement benefits of Members of Congress who are first covered by FERS after December 31, 2012.

Therefore, the larger benefit per year of service is no longer available to Members (or congressional employees) first covered by FERS after December 31, 2012.", "Second, P.L. 112-96 also increased the FERS employee contributions by 1.8 percentage points for Members of Congress first covered by FERS (or reelected with less than five years of FERS service) after December 31, 2012. Therefore, Members newly covered by FERS in 2013 are required to contribute 3.1% of pay to FERS. Subsequent to P.L. 112-96 , the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-67 ) further increased the FERS employee contributions by an additional 1.3 percentage points for all individuals, including Members of Congress, first covered by FERS (or rehired/reelected with less than five years of FERS service) after December 31, 2013. Therefore, under P.L. 113-67 , Members of Congress and other federal employees first covered by FERS beginning in 2014 are required to contribute 4.4% of pay to FERS.", "Thus, for individuals first covered by FERS after December 31, 2012, there is no longer a larger employee contribution under FERS required for Members and congressional employees in comparison with regular FERS employees; all of these groups contribute 3.1% of pay toward their FERS annuity if first covered in 2013 or 4.4% of pay if first covered by FERS after 2013.
