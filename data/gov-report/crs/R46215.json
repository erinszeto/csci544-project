Large families in developing countries are the result of complex social and economic factors which change relatively slowly among the poor majority least affected by economic progress, as well as the result of a lack of effective birth control. Therefore, effective family planning depends upon economic and social change as well as the delivery of services and is often a matter of political and religious sensitivity. While every country has the right to determine its own policies with respect to population growth, voluntary population planning programs can make a substantial contribution to economic development, higher living standards, and improved health and nutrition.", "Section 104 goes on to authorize U.S. assistance to address the impact of population growth on development through family planning activities:", "In order to increase the opportunities and motivation for family planning and to reduce the rate of population growth, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for voluntary population planning.

This broader scope is reflected in the common categorization of these activities as reproductive health/family planning (RH/FP) assistance. Reproductive health refers to \"all matters relating to the reproductive processes, functions, and system at all stages of life.\"", "The United States is the largest country donor to international FP/RH programs, providing $575 million dollars annually in recent years. Although U.S. funding for FP/RH activities has been consistent for years, the programs remain a subject of intense congressional debate. While the law explicitly prohibits the use of funds to provide abortion or involuntary sterilization, some Members of Congress continue to express concern that FP/RH may indirectly support such activities as a result of funding fungibility.

According to USAID, a key aspect of these programs is family planning, as some 885 million women worldwide would like to avoid or delay pregnancy. Of those women, 212.4 million (24%) lack access to FP/RH services. Supporters of FP/RH programs assert that access to such services is necessary for safe motherhood. They cite evidence that bearing children too close together, too early, or too late in life can threaten the health of the mother and her baby. In addition, lack of access to family planning services can have negative social and economic impacts that undermine broader global development goals. For example, some experts note that improving access to family planning services has been shown to have benefits for children's health, women's empowerment, and sustainable growth and development. ", "Critics of international family planning programming have expressed concern that despite existing restrictions, U.S. dollars could be used indirectly to support abortion or involuntary sterilization if implementing partners use U.S. funds for approved services, freeing up funding from other sources to support abortion or involuntary sterilization. Other detractors argue that U.S. foreign assistance for contraceptive provision is an inappropriate imposition on local cultural or religious norms, further asserting that abstinence education is a more effective form of family planning. Critics have also questioned the practice of allocating specific resources for FP/RH programs rather than allocating aid to broader women's health programs or for other development priorities that they argue would be a more effective use of U.S. funds.

Initial programs focused on procuring contraceptive supplies for distribution in developing countries. At the time, the rationale for these programs was that high birth rates \"significantly increase the cost and difficulty of achieving basic development objectives by imposing burdens on economies presently unable to provide sufficient goods and services for the growing population.\" From the 1970s through the 1990s, USAID expanded international family planning assistance to include programs on fertility, reproductive and women's health, and maternal and child health, ultimately reorganizing the program into an Office of Population and Reproductive Health (PRH). The expansion of activities reflected changing attitudes and development strategies. Concerns about managing population growth were largely supplanted by a focus on advancing women's status and enhancing their individual health and empowerment.

For example, a mother bringing her child to a routine vaccination appointment might also be able to receive maternal health services and counseling on contraceptive options. Fourteen USAID-supported countries highlight integration of FP/RH and MCH as an approach to community health service delivery in their national government policies. However, USAID MCH programs are funded separately from FP/RH programs, as there are also FP/RH programs that focus on issues outside the realm of MCH (e.g., programs addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health, prevention of FECM, GBV, FGM/C and obstetric fistula).

Countries receiving family planning assistance may \"graduate\" once they have met certain criteria and a country program has achieved its stated goals. According to USAID, a country is eligible for graduation once it ", "reaches a modern contraceptive prevalence rate of at least 51%; and reaches a level of fertility at or below 3.1 children per woman.", "USAID also considers additional issues when evaluating a country's readiness for graduation. Countries who reach both criteria but lack the capacity to implement family planning programs or face other constraints may continue to receive assistance (e.g., India). USAID may also evaluate whether governments are allocating sufficient public funds for contraception procurement and whether their Ministries of Health demonstrate adequate capacity to manage the associated logistics and supply chain processes. Additional indicators considered for graduation include ", "at least 80% of the population can access at least three methods of FP; no more than 20% of FP products, services and programs offered in the public and private sectors are subsidized by USAID; and major service providers in all sectors (public, non-governmental, commercial) can meet and maintain standards of informed choice and quality of care.", "To date, USAID 25 countries have graduated, half of which are in Latin America and the Caribbean ( Table B-4 ). For example, Brazil graduated in 2000, after the government, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector invested substantially in family planning assistance, and as the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased. USAID partners worked to build capacity in Brazil's civil sector and Ministry of Health programs, by focusing on outreach, education, and improved access to care. According to USAID, \"the program worked with the government to reduce Brazil's legal obstacles and tariff barriers to the importation of medical equipment, foam, jellies, and oral contraceptives, as well as quality intrauterine devices and condoms not manufactured in Brazil.\" Perhaps reflecting these efforts, Brazil's contraceptive prevalence rate increased from 34% in 1970, to 72% in 2000.

Bush and rescinded by President Clinton in 1993. It was then reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001, who expanded the policy in 2003. President Obama rescinded the policy upon taking office in January 2009.

They assert that the policy has rendered programs cumbersome and ineffective due to administrative and operational burdens associated with ensuring compliance, which divert resources from the health workforce, health information systems, and service delivery. Some field reports indicate that individual providers may not be aware of the restrictions because MCP/PLGHA is \"embedded\" in funding agreements, similar to \"fine print,\" which can create barriers to care during a provider-patient interaction.

For FY2020, Congress appropriated $575 million to international family planning programs. Some advocates have argued that global FP/RH funding levels would need to be doubled in order to make family planning and reproductive services accessible to all women who currently want and lack access to them. Proponents say that consistently flat funding is equivalent to FP/RH spending cuts, and this undermines U.S. global development goals on maternal and child health. Advocates note that the U.S. government would need to invest $1.5 billion to meet its appropriate share of the burden for foreign assistance for FP/RH funding, and other donor countries cannot fill the gap. Opponents of the aid have questioned the extent of international demand for family planning services and have suggested that international family planning resources could be better used on other development activities. Further, opponents argue that international family planning services are controversial in some countries due to religious and moral beliefs, which, in their views, raises questions about whether increased donor funding would lead to increased use of contraceptives and reproductive health care services or to better maternal health outcomes. Some observers also question whether the programs have been efficient and cost-effective, given the scale of U.S. spending on bilateral family planning programs, compared to other types of U.S. assistance. While data appears to show positive program impact in some countries, the attribution of results specifically to U.S. programming can be debated given the many factors that influence contraceptive use, including social and economic change and the activities of other international donors.

Proponents of further program integration want to combine FP/RH and MCH services; they note that integration of these services has been shown to increase women's use of contraception, improve maternal health outcomes, and build health systems capacity. Integration of these funding streams may also provide more flexibility to implementing agencies to prioritize funding across a broader range of programs. ", "On the other hand, eliminating funding directives specific to FP/RH and MCH may also reduce congressional control over how funds are used. Furthermore, opponents note that respect for local cultural norms must be considered; in some contexts, service integration could be detrimental to MCH activities if they are associated with less socially acceptable family planning programs. Aid-recipient countries may also resist integration of these programs when separate government health units administer international FP/RH and MCH services and may fear losing prioritization and resources. Others have also raised concerns that embedding FP/RH programs in MCH services would limit USAID programs to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health, and prevent CEFM, GBV, and obstetric fistula - that are distinct from family planning.
