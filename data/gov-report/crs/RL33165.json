Also, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, theUnited States agreed to voluntary limits on CO 2 emissions. The current BushAdministration has rejected the Kyoto Protocol, which would impose mandatorylimits, in favor of a voluntary reduction program.

For all threepollutants, the final Clear Skies deadlines would be 2018, but the actual 70%reduction targets might not be met for as long as a decade after that. The reason forthe delay is the use of what are called \"banking\" provisions in the regulatory scheme. Because the deadlines are far in the future, utilities would be likely to \"overcomply\"in the early years of the program, building up credits that could be used in place offurther emission reductions in later years. The Administration uses the projectedovercompliance as a selling point for its approach, arguing that it will achievereductions sooner than would a traditional regulatory approach with similardeadlines. But overcompliance in the early years would lead to large holdings ofbanked emission allowances to be used in place of actual reductions in later years,delaying achievement of emissions caps. In its analysis of the Clear Skies bill, EPAdoes not expect to see the full 70% emission reductions until 2026 or later. ", "The Jeffords and Carper bills also allow banking and trading of allowances;but, with earlier and more stringent caps on emissions, utilities would be unable tobank so many allowances and, thus, would reach full compliance at least a decadesooner than under Clear Skies.", "With respect to carbon dioxide, Clear Skies would not impose controls on it,whereas the Jeffords and Carper bills would.

This report uses that analysis,the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR (11) case, for its baseline because it most accuratelyportrays the status of current and future clean air regulation with respect to thesepollutants. Arguably, the uncertainty with respect to those rules (and others) is nomore than the uncertainty about the specific provisions and implementation of anymulti-pollutant legislation.

This choice is a compromise based on the three factors and lack ofalternative combinations. Each of the scenarios raises questions; however, thestrongest case can be made for including a short-term demand response function inthe modeling. Electricity price elasticities are well established in the literature,particularly short-term elasticities. (13) The short-term price elasticities chosen by EPAto incorporate ", " Figure 1. EPA's FourScenarios ", "into their Demand Response Scenario (the only scenario to contain the demand function) are well within the range suggested by the literature. Why EPA did not choose to include this refinement in all of the scenarios is unclear. However, EPAonly included it in the one, so CRS chose it.", "This is not to suggest that the other assumptions incorporated in the DemandResponse Scenario are not debatable, particularly EPA's assumption with respect toboilermaker labor. EPA assumes in three of the four scenarios above that there willbe limited boilermaker labor for constructing SO 2 and NOx control equipment until2010, following which unlimited labor would be available. (14) This is anassumption EPA incorporated into its regulatory rulemaking on the Clean AirInterstate Rule (CAIR), also called the Interstate Air Quality Rule (IAQR). Thisconstraint has been questioned by some, including the Institute of Clean AirCompanies (ICAC), the trade association that represents the air pollution controlindustry. During the rulemaking on CAIR, ICAC conducted their own analysis ofboilermaker labor availability and found no constraint on construction, even if the2015 deadline of CAIR was moved to 2010. As stated by ICAC: ", "In summary, the air pollution control industry has demonstrated thatthey are able to install significant amounts of air pollution controlequipment in short periods of time. This has been demonstrated morerecently with the installation of SCRs [selective catalytic reductioncontrols] for the NOx SIP call as well as for control installations inboth Germany and Japan. The resources required for the projectedinstallations under the IAQR will also require a significant number ofair pollution control installations but the resources required tocomplete them are not expected to be limiting. Factors such as theuse of modular construction methods and non-union craft labor willreduce the demand for union boilermakers. This reduction inboilermaker demand combined with the six month increase incompliance time window will further reduce the demand onboilermaker labor. In the event of a shortage, additional boilermakerlabor is available through the Canadian boilermaker union as well asfrom ship builders' and iron workers' labor pools. In conclusion, therewill be more than sufficient boilermaker capacity to carry out theprojected IAQR and control installation for 2010 and 2015. Evenmore significantly, it will be possible to complete the 2015requirements in the 2010 timeframe. (15) ", "The assumption of limited boilernaker availability, which only affects the twomost stringent alternatives ( S. 843 and S. 150 ) is includedin three of the four scenarios used by EPA in its analysis. The one scenario thatremoves this constraint simultaneously assumes zero price elasticity for electricitydemand. Thus, despite questions with respect to this assumption, one is forced tochoose whether to address it or to address the demand elasticity assumption. CRSbelieves that given the lack of an EPA alternative that includes both demandelasticity and no boilermaker constraint, it is more important to include a demandelasticity function in the benchmark analysis than to remove the questionablefeasibility constraint. (16) Thus, we chose EPA's demand response scenarioas our base case. ", "Finally, there is the important issue of future natural gas supply. There areno facts about the future and, therefore, sensitivity analysis is very important tounderstand the robustness of cost estimates. The natural gas supply curves developedfor the EPA's model generally project more natural gas availability at lower pricesthan the natural gas supply curves developed by EIA. EPA provides one scenariowith the steeper EIA supply curves -- Higher Electricity Growth and Natural GasScenario -- along with the short-term feasibility constraint and zero short-term priceelasticity. In the current market climate, it is difficult not to argue that the EIAcurves may be more representative of future supplies than EPA's estimates. However, natural gas supply has a long history of volatility and the 15-year timeframe of the analysis leaves plenty of room for debate.

Compared to the other bills, it has less stringent requirements and laterdeadlines, so, particularly in the early years, there is a vast difference in the annualcosts of the three approaches. In particular, the provisions with respect to Hg areweak compared with the other two bills and there are no provisions for CO 2 .

In 2010, the Clear Skies bill would provide $6 billion in annualbenefits, according to EPA, compared to benefits of $51 billion (Carper) and $83billion (Jeffords). The benefits of Clear Skies almost merge with the baselineincrease in later years, and continue to lag the two other bills, which have benefits of$19 billion and $66 billion annually in 2020. The higher benefits for the Carper andJeffords bills reflect the fact that Clear Skies' required pollution caps are lessstringent, and the implementation schedule is more relaxed.", "As noted, EPA compares the three bills' effects to a baseline that does notinclude current Clean Air Act requirements. If one adjusts the baseline to reflectcurrent Clean Air Act requirements (including the CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR rules,promulgated earlier this year), Clear Skies has essentially no incremental cost. Itsbenefits are also relatively small -- equal to an additional 10% of the benefits of thenewly promulgated rules in 2010 and only 2% of the benefits in 2020.

EPA maintains that a shortage of skilledlabor will limit the number of scrubbers that can be installed by 2010. Lackingscrubbers, coal-fired power plants are forced to shut down in the agency's analysisof the bill. The Jeffords bill would reduce coal production and coal-fired electricgeneration by about 40%, according to EPA. Vast numbers of natural-gas-fired andrenewable fuel generators would be required in their place, at great cost: the Jeffordsbill would lead to an additional 65 gigawatts of generation from renewable sources(about 6 times the amount projected under either of the other options) and nearly 100gigawatts of additional oil- and gas-fired capacity.

The air pollution control industry maintains that the cost ofactivated carbon injection (ACI) controls, which the model assumes would beimposed on about 40% of coal-fired plants under the Carper bill, is now onlyone-fourth what the cost would have been in 2003. (19) ", "EPA's Hg control cost assumptions have less of a distorting effect in itsanalysis of S. 150 , simply because its other assumptions (discussedearlier) lead it to conclude that 40% of coal-fired plants would be shut down by 2010under the bill."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits Estimates", "paragraphs": ["EPA's analysis and CRS's reanalysis of the data show benefits substantiallyoutweighing costs for both S. 150 and S. 843 . The benefitsrepresent the monetized human health effects (principally reduced mortality) fromreducing emissions of SO 2 and fine particles. Some of these benefits are summarizedin Table 6 below.", " Table 6: Selected Heath Effects Avoided byProposals Over Baseline", "(in annual incidences avoided)", "Note: These effects are incremental to the effects of the CAIR, CAMR, and CAVRrules.", "Three other sets of likely benefits were not estimated, at least in part because of the methodological difficulty of doing so. First, the analysis makes no attempt tomonetize environmental benefits, which are significant in the case of sulfur dioxideand mercury controls. SO 2 emissions are the primary cause of acid deposition, whichharms aquatic life and affects forest growth, as well as damaging building materials. Reductions in SO 2 emissions could have significant environmental benefits, whichare not estimated in the analysis. The emissions are also a significant factor in theformation of regional haze, the effects of which were also not monetized. Mercurydeposition, as noted earlier, has led to widespread fish consumption advisories, withattendant economic impacts. The omission of environmental benefits has its greatesteffect on S. 150 and S. 843 which have more aggressiveSO 2 , NOx, and Hg control schemes.", "Second, the analysis does not model mercury heath effects. Agency analysesof the economic benefits of reducing Hg health effects have ranged from a fewmillion dollars per year to several billion dollars per year. (20) The impactof omitting these benefits would be significant if one accepts the latter estimate. Onceagain, this omission has its greatest effect on S. 150 and S. 843 , which have more aggressive Hg control schemes.", "Finally, the analysis did not attempt to estimate the possible benefits ofcontrolling CO 2 emissions. There is no accepted methodology for making such anestimate. Still, the absence of such a factor in the analysis may be a significantomission, which understates the potential benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills. The Jeffords bill is the most aggressive of the three in regard to controlling CO 2 (whereas Clear Skies does not cap CO 2 emissions at all). Thus, the Jeffords bill maybe most disadvantaged as a result of this factor.

As a result, after adjusting for those rules, EPA'sanalysis finds little cost and a small benefit associated with passage of Clear Skieslegislation. The Jeffords and Carper bills, however, set more stringent standards thanthe promulgated rules. For both bills, the analysis shows benefits far outweighingadditional costs.", "Carbon dioxide costs depend on the amount and schedule ofany proposed reductions. The modest reduction requirement and relaxedimplementation schedule of S. 843 results in nominal carbon dioxidereduction costs. As reduction requirements increase and implementation schedulestighten, costs rise. ", "Mercury control costs are dependent on the timeliness of thedata. The EPA analysis does not reflect current data on costs of Hgcontrols.", "EPA's benefit analysis is limited and incomplete, which worksto the disadvantage of alternatives to Clear Skies that include more stringentstandards. ", "Although it represents a step toward understanding the impacts of thelegislative options, EPA's analysis is not as useful as one could hope. Thecombination of assumptions used in the analysis works in favor of the various ClearSkies alternatives by overstating the Hg control costs of the alternatives, and --through its assumption of constraints on labor availability -- heavily penalizingshort-term pollution reduction schedules. In addition, the analysis does notadequately analyze the effect that natural gas price volatility may have onimplementation strategies and costs. The analysis suffers from being based on 2003assumptions, both in terms of natural gas markets and Hg control costs.
