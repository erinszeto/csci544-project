Physician supply is a function of the number of physicians trained, how long they remain in practice, their productivity, and the hours they work. Policymakers have demonstrated a long-standing interest in access to care (in general and for specific populations). The federal government has identified certain health workforce concerns and creates programs that seek to address these concerns. Specifically, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers 72 health workforce programs. Among these programs are those that seek to increa se access to physician services, including programs that e ncourage people to enter primary care to address identified concerns that there are too few primary care physicians relative to the number of physician specialists. ", "Federal programs also exist to recruit and retain physicians in rural areas because o f concerns that the populations that reside in these areas lack access to care. Specifically, the federal government designates some areas as medically underserved or as health professional shortage areas (HPSA) and provides benefits (e.g., higher Medicare payment rates) to providers who practice in these areas. In addition to these programs and policies, the federal government provides support for medical residency training (a.k.a., graduate medical education [GME]). Specifically, through payments that are generally made to hospitals, the federal government pays some of the costs that hospitals and other health providers incur when training residents. Such costs include, but are not limited to residents' and supervisors' salaries, and the costs of extra medical tests that residents may order as part of their training. ", "The federal government makes a significant investment in GME\u2014according to GAO, GME programs account for nearly three-quarters of HHS's health workforce expenditures \u2014and GME may be a strong policy lever to impact access because the number of medical school graduates who obtain and complete a residency determines the size of the physician workforce, and the types of residencies they complete determine its specialty composition. Finally, where physicians complete their residencies often affects where they establish their practices. Given the influence of residency training on the physician population, policies that alter federal funding for GME may affect future physician supply and could be used to address identified workforce concerns.", "This report provides an overview of federal GME support; it discusses whether a particular source of federal GME support is actively used to further workforce goals such as altering the geographic or specialty distribution of residents trained. A number of GME critiques have raised concerns about the data that the federal government collects on these programs; for example, whether the data available are sufficient to determine program effectiveness. This report details programmatic data gaps where they have been identified. It does not summarize recent GME critiques in detail; for readers interested in such critiques, Appendix A provides some sources for further reading. ", "Some federal programs use GME to support training for non-physician health providers; however, this report focuses only on the training of physicians. To be licensed to practice independently in a state, physicians in the United States must complete a minimum of three years of GME , with additional years required depending on their specialty. In Academic Year (AY) 2016-2017, approximately 124,000 individual residents were in training, including approximately 21,000 fellows \u2014medical school graduates who have completed their initial residency training and are continuing their training in a fellowship in a subspecialty. (See text box for definitions.) GME generally takes place in hospitals that sponsor residency programs in specific specialties (e.g., pediatrics or surgery). Hospitals choose the number and specialties of the residents they train, but must meet accrediting body standards that attempt to assure that hospitals have the facilities, staffing, and patient load necessary to ensure that residents will receive adequate training in their chosen specialty (see text box). During their residency, residents rotate to outpatient facilities or other hospitals to gain experience treating different populations in different settings. Specific residency training requirements vary by specialty and are determined by the accrediting bodies .

In FY2012, the last year of data available for all federal sources of GME payments, the federal government spent an estimated $15 billion on GME, which was the largest federal investment in the health care workforce. More recent data analyzed by GAO found that GME programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) spent $14.5 billion on GME in 2015, but their work did not analyze Department of Defense GME spending. As such, 2012 remains the most recent year of a total federal GME estimate. Using their 2012 estimate, GAO found that 78% of government-wide health workforce funding was for GME; with Medicare payments accounting for 85% of this funding. Similarly, a GAO analysis of HHS programs in FY2014, found that HHS supported 72 health workforce programs, but that nearly three-quarters of all spending was from Medicare GME payments. ", "The federal government supports GME", "through payments made by the Medicare and Medicaid programs, both administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) located in HHS; by training medical residents at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) facilities; and by funding programs administered by HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) that support primary care training in outpatient facilities, rural GME program development, and training in children's hospitals.", "The federal government's primary role in GME has been as a payer. In this role, it has a significant influence on the physician workforce, but this role has generally been passive, because, with some exceptions, the federal government has little involvement through its support of GME in the content of training, the specialties it pays for, or training locations. In addition, the government's role in GME has generally not been linked to other federal health workforce investments, such as investments made to train non-physician providers whose work could complement or, where appropriate, replace that of physicians and who could be trained at a lower cost. ", "These critiques have been raised particularly with regard to Medicare's GME support because it is the largest source of federal GME support, estimates of Medicare GME payments range from approximately $10.3 to $12.5 billion in FY2015. Medicare is also frequently discussed because, unlike other sources of GME support, it explicitly limits (i.e., caps) the number of residents it supports. Some argue that this limit makes increasing the number of residents and changing the locations where they train difficult. This argument generally does not take into account GME growth that occurred despite the Medicare cap. For example, recent work by GAO found that the number of residents in training grew by 22% over the 10-year period they examined (2005 to 2015), although the geographic areas where residents trained remained largely unchanged. Another analysis estimates that the number of residents in training grew by 27% during the 20-year period since the Medicare limit on GME support was enacted. This may be the case because the Medicare cap is not an absolute, and other sources\u2014for example, other federal programs, state and local government funds, or hospital funds\u2014can be used to expand or alter the number and types of residents in training. In addition, new hospitals can begin training residents and receive Medicare payment for doing so. ", "Some argue that Medicare's residency limit should be partially or fully removed to address physician shortages in certain geographic areas and medical specialties. And Members of Congress have introduced legislation that would do so. Others argue that expanding Medicare support, unless done in a way that is directive; for example, by explicitly allocating positions to hospitals in specific geographic areas or requiring hospitals to fund residency positions in certain specialties, would not address identified workforce issues such as too few physicians in certain areas or practicing primary care. GAO also found that although there are incentives within Medicare and other programs to increase training in rural areas, hospitals frequently did not take advantage of them.

Such data are necessary inputs for GME policy but are not sufficient. Determining the appropriate GME policy is inherently challenging because training a new physician is a long process; as such, attempting to change the physician workforce through changes to GME requires a long time horizon and good initial data to project the future need for physicians. This process of projection is particularly challenging because policy changes may occur in the interim that alter the assumptions used in the projections. ", "Recent projections conducted by the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis, at HRSA, demonstrate the challenges of making projections concurrent with policy changes. In their 2013 projections, they projected that there would be a primary care physician shortage in 2020, but that the magnitude could vary greatly depending on assumptions about the role of non-physician providers. Specifically, they projected that the number of primary care physicians would grow by 8% between 2010 and 2020, but that the demand for their services would grow by 14%. They based this on the demand for services at the time of the study and assumptions about the future aging of the population, and the expected increase in insurance coverage driven by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , as amended). These projections do not reflect more recent policy changes and stakeholder responses to the implementation of the ACA that may have affected insurance coverage and related demand for health services. The projections assumed that all states would expand Medicaid under the ACA, that full Medicaid expansion has not occurred, and that these projections also do not account for changes in federal policy related to the private insurance market. For example, beginning in 2019 individuals will no longer have to maintain insurance coverage or pay a penalty (i.e., the ACA's individual mandate), which experts predict will reduce insurance coverage. These policy changes may mean that HRSA's projected 2020 shortages may not occur or may be less than were estimated in 2013. ", "Another source of uncertainty in physician projections is the size and role of non-physician providers. Specifically, the HRSA model that predicted the most extreme shortages projected that there would be a shortage of 20,400 primary care physicians in 2020, while other HRSA models that include full use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants project that the shortage would be 6,400. Estimates commissioned by the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC)\u2014a private, nonprofit organization that represents U.S.-accredited medical schools and some teaching hospitals\u2014vary depending on assumptions made about the ability of nurse practitioners and physician assistants to augment physician supply. Specifically, in projections to 2030, the shortage of primary care physicians ranged between 7,300 and 43,100. Others have suggested that increasing the role of these providers and the use of new care models may be sufficient to avert shortages. ", "Experts also project geographic shortages both overall and of specific provider types and specialties. As noted, some areas are currently designated as being in shortage. GAO also found that there has been little change in the areas where GME training occurs, which may affect where physicians ultimately practice. As with general estimates of physician supply, the role of nurse practitioners and physician assistants may alter predicted geographic area shortages. It is also possible that targeted policy changes either already enacted or if enacted at the federal or state levels could alleviate geographic shortages in the areas they target.", "The uncertainty inherent in projecting supply and demand under changing policy conditions demonstrates the need to regularly update these projections to incorporate the latest data and policy conditions. The general uncertainty about the future need for physicians makes it challenging to develop and implement GME policy. However, it is relatively clear that good data are needed both to examine the overall health workforce and to determine how GME investments can be better aligned to achieve overall health workforce goals.

Generally, these increases have been in subspecialties (i.e., for fellowship training); subspecialty services tend to generate higher revenue or impose lower cost burden on hospitals.

However, Medicare does not reimburse the teaching hospital for the actual costs incurred by the residency program, but is instead the product of the total approved DGME costs and the hospital's Medicare patient load percentage (see Figure 1 ). Under this methodology, Medicare pays for its share of the approved program costs associated with the residency program, whereas non-Medicare payers (e.g., a private insurer) would theoretically cover the remaining costs of the residency program based on their patient share at the teaching hospital.

", "The program must make payments to all children's hospitals that meet the program's definition and have an eligible training program. Therefore, as the number of children's hospitals or eligible training programs increases, the program will provide lower payment levels per resident, unless the amount of funding appropriated to the program increases. This also means that HRSA does not have the authority to use this program to affect the geographic distribution of pediatric trainees. ", "Unlike CMS programs, HRSA does require CHGME funding recipients to report data on a number of program elements. They are required to report financial data; specifically, they must detail the support they receive from other sources to prevent duplication of payment and programs are required to return duplicate payments. CHGME programs are also required to report programmatic data including data on the number of residents they train, the specialties they train in, and whether individuals who complete their training care for children within the hospital's service area or state. HRSA also uses these data to track former trainees as they progress in their careers to examine outcomes such as whether these trainees serve patients who are covered by Medicaid. ", "The 2013 program reauthorization also includes a new authority for HRSA to develop a quality bonus system where a percentage of the program's appropriation is reserved and then allocated to hospitals that meet specified quality targets. The program is collecting baseline data in FY2019 about CHGME resident involvement in hospital quality initiatives (e.g., integrated care models and social determinants of health). These data will be used as a baseline to establish standards for implementation in FY2021. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Teaching Health Center GME", "paragraphs": ["HRSA administers the teaching health center GME program (or THCGME), which provides payments to outpatient facilities to support the training of primary care medical and dental residents at these facilities. Because residency training has been, in general, hospital-based, experts have raised concerns that physicians are not prepared to treat patients in outpatient settings, where care is increasingly being delivered. Under the THCGME program, HRSA provides DGME and IME payments to outpatient facilities, such as federal health centers (a.k.a. FQHCs), to support the costs associated with residency training. The program started in FY2011, supporting residents who began their training in AY2012. The program has been funded by direct appropriations enacted in three successive laws: (1) the ACA, which provided funding from FY2011-FY2015; (2) the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which provided funding for FY2016 and FY2017 ( P.L. 114-10 ); and (3) the Bipartisan Budget Act of FY2018 ( P.L. 115-123 ), which provides funding for FY2018 and FY2019. The most recent extension included expanded program funding to both increase the number of training programs operating and the number of trainees supported at existing programs. Table 3 shows the program's funding and number of residents trained since its inception. ", "HRSA awards THCGME funds to all facilities eligible for payments under the statutory definition of a teaching health center. In statute, the program's funds must be used to support primary care residents (defined as residents training in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, combined training in internal medicine-pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, general dentistry, pediatric dentistry, or geriatrics). Programs were paid $150,000 per FTE under the ACA funding, and $95,000 per FTE using the MACRA funds. This decrease occurred because there are now more residents in training than when the program began. The program's per resident funding level under BBA 2018 is not yet known; however, a 2015 survey of active programs by HRSA indicate that the cost of training a resident at a teaching health center was $157,602 per resident. This amount is higher than estimated in other programs, in part, because THGME programs are small, which lessens economies of scale and because the programs estimate higher costs for training in outpatient facilities. To determine the cost of training at THCs, HRSA contracted with George Washington University to develop a THCGME cost reporting instrument to better reflect the costs that THCs incur when operating GME programs. The instrument includes both the costs that THCs incur while training and the revenues that residents generate. Though some THCs had challenges reporting all of the data elements, this information provided a more comprehensive accounting of costs than are available for most federally support GME programs. ", "The THCGME program is required to collect data on various aspects of the residents it trains and the BBA 2018 included additional data collection requirements. Specifically, it required HRSA to report on (1) the number of patients treated by THC residents; (2) the number of visits by patients treated by THC residents; and (3) the number of THC residents who completed a residency in the reporting year, and the number and percentage of these residents who (1) entered primary care practice and (2) entered practice at a health care facility in a HPSA or a rural area. Finally, the law requires the HHS Secretary to submit a report to Congress, by March 31, 2019, on the costs that THCs incur while training residents. ", "The first THCGME class completed it training in 2014; as such, outcomes associated with the program are preliminary. HRSA's data suggest that the program is successful at training residents who enter primary care and that its graduates are more likely to enter into primary care practice at safety net facilities (such as the facility types that are eligible to sponsor a THCGME program). Follow-up studies showed that 69% of all THCGME graduates were currently practicing in a primary care setting and 55% were in a medically underserved community and/or rural setting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Department of Defense (DOD)", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) trains residents who have acquired a uniformed service obligation through a DOD physician training program. Examples include the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and the Health Profession Scholarship Program. USUHS students enter active uniformed service as medical students, receive the pay and benefits of an officer at the O-1 level, and incur a seven-year service obligation upon graduation. Under the scholarship program, DOD pays tuition and fees, plus a monthly stipend for students enrolled in civilian medical schools. In return, the students incur an obligation to serve a year of active duty service for each year of benefits received, with a two-year minimum obligation. Upon graduation, most scholarship program participants (regular program participants) go on active duty and begin GME in military hospitals. Other scholarship program participants (deferred program participants) are granted deferments while they pursue civilian GME. ", "In FY2017, DOD administered residency programs at 26 DOD hospitals and trained an estimated 1,455 FTE residents in over 100 specialties. DOD residency programs are accredited by ACGME and managed by each respective military service. The military services generally partner with civilian teaching hospitals, where residents rotate for training in areas or populations not seen at a DOD hospital. Residents from civilian partner facilities may also rotate to DOD facilities. DOD exercises control over the type of residents it trains and the facilities where they train. Specifically, each of the military services determines its workforce requirements and then coordinates with the DOD Comptroller to ensure adequate funding. ", "Within the Army, the GME Program Office in the Medical Education Directorate of the Office of The Surgeon General develops policy, manages the tri-service Medical Occupation Data System GME database, serves as the Army primary point of contact for GME, and coordinates the Army responsibilities for an annual selection board. The number, specialty, and location of specific training program slots are specified in an annual school year plan approved by the Surgeon General of the Army that serves as a blueprint for the Joint Services GME Selection Board (JSGMESB). This board convenes annually to select trainees for all programs. ", "Within the Air Force, the number and specialty type of training slots are determined through the Air Force Health Professions Education Requirements Board (HPERB). This annual process models expected attrition, identifies health care workforce needs, and plans and programs for GME needs. The HPERB receives GME training requests from medical commands each March. Since Air Force medical billets are frequently integrated into sister service facilities, the Air Force commands collaborate with the other services in developing these requests. ", "Within the Navy, the Chief of the Navy Medical Corps determines the number and specialty of training slots during an annual training plan meeting. Input from manpower and personnel planners, clinical specialty leaders, and the Office of the Chief of the Navy Medical Corps are used in developing the annual Training Plan. Similar to the other services, the process culminates in selections made at the annual JSGMESB.", "Because many DOD training programs are either integrated or collocated, the service GME chiefs collaborate throughout the year to ensure the integrity, efficiency, and quality of the military GME process. This involves aligning training slots to DOD hospitals that have adequately large and diverse patient populations to sustain the training requirements.", "GME is funded through the annual DOD appropriation in the Defense Health Program budget account under Operations & Maintenance in the Education and Training budget activity group. For FY2018, Congress appropriated $692.6 million for DOD health care education and training. While the GAO estimated in FY2012 that DOD spent $16.5 million on GME, the military departments report that attempts to determine the actual cost of GME have been unsuccessful. The military departments agree that the data necessary \"to do a valid calculation are not available.\" This assessment is consistent with data collection variances in non-DOD administered GME programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The federal government funds a number of programs that support medical residency training. These programs are operated by different departments across the federal government, and each has its own stated program goals. The rules governing these programs and the purposes of federal support vary. These programs have generally not been examined in conjunction with one another and may have goals that are contrary, duplicative, or otherwise not aligned. For example, in a 2015 report, GAO specifically noted that CMS's GME programs (i.e., Medicare and Medicaid) do not target areas that HHS has identified as workforce needs, nor do they align with workforce goals included in HHS's strategic plan. A 2018 report GAO issued reconfirmed this finding. The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), the federal advisory group tasked with examining GME policy, also noted a lack of alignment across programs and in its 2017 report called for \"a national strategic plan for graduate medical education\" to be created by a non-partisan strategic planning committee. ", "One of the major challenges for GME policymakers is that data to evaluate programs are lacking. This lack of program transparency has been a consistent theme in a number of recent GME evaluations. In the 2018 GAO report noted above, GAO found that HHS and VA GME programs did not collect sufficient data to properly evaluate the federal government's GME investments. This report did not evaluate DOD GME. GAO recommended that HHS and the VA identify information needed to evaluate their GME investments and improve the quality and consistency of data collected. Their study found among HHS and VA GME programs that the data collection was generally done at the individual program level and was generally collected to determine hospital compliance with program statute and were not sufficient to determine program costs. In addition, because the data collected were to determine compliance with different program statutes, these data were not consistent across programs. GAO did state that collecting GME data may be difficult because some aspects of the costs of GME training are difficult to quantify (e.g., faculty teaching salaries) and that GME costs vary by site (e.g., costs would differ between a hospital and a clinic where residents rotate for training). Despite these challenges, GAO has consistently recommended better data collection for GME programs. The HRSA THCGME supported the development of a data collection instrument to quantify both teaching costs and revenue generated by residents. As part of this analysis, they surveyed THC programs to attempt to identify these data elements (including services and space that were donated to programs). Overall, they found that most programs were able to quantify the expenses associated with training, but that examining the revenue generated was more difficult. Despite these challenges, the data collection instrument because of its scope might be useful to better quantify the costs of residency training at other facility types and by other payers. ", "Although efforts are underway to improve data collection, they are largely at beginning stages and are not coordinated across programs. As mentioned, the CHGME program is collecting baseline data to develop quality measures for its program. As part of the development of standards, HRSA sought public comments. In general, the commenters noted that there were no generally accepted standards for measuring residency program quality, and that the lack of accepted measures made it difficult to judge relative program performance or change over time. As such, the agency is collecting baseline data, including detailed curriculum data, in FY2019 and is focusing on hospital quality initiatives that have direct resident involvement. Another effort in its early stages is being undertaken by the National Academy of Medicine, which sought expert input about how to develop metrics to evaluate individual residency program outcomes at a meeting held in 2017. Although workshop participants overall agreed that GME quality measures are needed, most noted that developing and collecting these measures would be challenging. For example, if one of the outcomes of interest is the quality of care that a training program's graduates provide, it is difficult to attribute whether a program graduate's ability to provide quality care is due to the training received during medical school, residency, or from peers while in practice. Some academic research has been undertaken in this area, which has shown that residency training can affect the quality of care its residents deliver and the cost of that care. Despite progress in this area, efforts are generally preliminary and data available are limited. ", "The current lack of data (overall or for specific programs) makes it difficult for policymakers seeking to amend GME payments, because data are not available to evaluate the relative success or weakness of the current payment systems. This may be particularly challenging for those who wish to expand payments, because the limited data that do exist indicate that payments\u2014in particular, Medicare's IME payments\u2014are higher than can be empirically justified. As such, some argue that Medicare payments should be reduced; this was suggested by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, by CBO in their Options for Reducing the Deficit, and in various years of the President's budget, including a proposal in the FY2019 President's Budget. Others argue that payments should be expanded to reduce or avert physician shortages, though such shortages themselves have been debated.", "Congress may consider using federal GME support to encourage training in specific specialties and may consider doing so by amending how payments are allocated through existing federal programs, as some of these programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) exercise little control over the specialties they support. Researchers have found that when hospitals expand residency training, they tend to do so in specialties where the benefits derived from residents' labor exceed the cost of their training (i.e., it is profitable for the hospital to train additional residents). Current data collected on federal programs make it difficult to determine when a hospital requires an incentive (e.g., a payment from a federal program) to operate a residency program or when it is profitable for a hospital to train residents without an incentive. Recent research found that it may be cheaper for a hospital to use resident services than to hire nonphysician providers to replace resident labor and that the outcomes provided by resident were similar or better. ", "Congress could pursue policy options to encourage additional training in specific specialties, as it has in the past. These options have not always been successful because incentives are generally given to the hospital and often measure the specialty when the resident begins training, which may miss residents who choose to subspecialize. Designing policies to affect the specialty composition of the future workforce may be also challenging, because residents may move to a different hospital to pursue further training, because GME incentives are given to the hospital but not to residents, and because current specialty needs, shortages, and surpluses may change. ", "A related challenge is that currently most federal programs pay the same amount for residents across specialties and by year of training (with the exception of fellows). Some have speculated that a hospital's cost of training a resident may differ by specialty or by the year that the resident is in training. The relative cost to a hospital for operating a residency program may also vary by a number of factors, such as the size of the residency program, the specialty of the program, the total number of residency programs that the hospital operates, and the availability and cost of alternative providers who would be needed to replace the resident's labor. Residents may also generate revenue for a hospital directly (e.g., because they provide additional labor) or may do so indirectly (e.g., because the prestige of a teaching hospital may make it more attractive for some patients). Determining these \"costs,\" should they exist, is challenging. In some cases, federal GME program payments may undercompensate a hospital while in other cases program payments may exceed the hospital's costs. GAO attempted to examine the cost of training in a 2018 report and found that measuring these costs was difficult and that some costs were difficult to identify. They also noted that the current data collected were not sufficient to identify these costs or to compare them across GME programs. In general, the data collected are not sufficient to determine if or when these scenarios occur nor are data available to determine the factors that may affect hospital training costs. Better data on these \"costs\" may be useful to better target federal GME support. ", "Congress may also consider policy options that seek to influence the geographical distribution of residents. Such strategies have been pursued in the past; for example, the ACA's redistribution of Medicare-funded residency slots gave preference to hospitals in states with health professional shortage areas and low resident-to-population ratios. Successfully implementing policy options to achieve geographic distribution goals have a number of the same challenges that policy options that seek to target the specialty composition of the physician population do. For example, proposed policy changes generally target hospitals and not the residents themselves, which may be not be effective when the desired outcomes are determined by where the residents ultimately choose to practice. In addition, geographic distribution policies may face challenges because some areas that have traditionally trained residents may lose their current levels of support. For example, prior critiques have raised concerns that where current residents are trained is not reflective of where the current population is located. For example, GAO notes that \"Medicare GME funding is disbursed based on historical patterns. Therefore, the Medicare-supported residency slots, supported by this Medicare GME funding, are most highly concentrated in northeastern states.\" GAO confirmed this finding in a 2017 report, which examined residency training from 2005 through 2015 and found that the locations remained largely unchanged despite uneven population growth across regions during this time period. Given that training sites have been largely static, successful policy options would either need to add total residents (i.e., expand overall support) or would need to implement a drawdown in support, which may be unpopular and may also be a lengthy process because some residents are currently supported in training programs that last a number of years. ", "Although prior critiques have focused on Medicare's GME support because it is the largest source of GME support, program challenges are not limited to Medicare, as other federal sources of GME support have limited data available and some programs have little flexibility in how payments are used. As these programs all seek to train physicians and are, at times, training the same physicians, policymakers may be interested in examining these programs in concert to minimize duplication and maximize program alignment.", "Appendix A.
