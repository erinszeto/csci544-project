This report focuses on Bush Administration policy regarding earmarks originated by Congress and related issues. Specific definitions for the term earmark (and related terms, like congressional earmark, presidential earmark, and others) vary considerably and are controversial. Nevertheless, all of the terms relate to the use of discretion to allocate particularized benefits to one or more specific purposes, entities, or geographic areas. Some earmarks have the force of law, and others do not. Practices like earmarking have been used for decades, if not centuries, to make decisions regarding the allocation of public resources, but concerns also have been expressed. At the same time, Congress, its Members, and Presidents have asserted the prerogatives of their constitutional and statutory authorities and pursued their budget policy preferences.", "In January 2008, the President announced he would veto future appropriations bills that did not cut the number and funding of Administration-defined earmarks by half, relative to FY2008. The President also issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13457, which directed that agencies \"should not\" fund non-statutory earmarks, except under some conditions. OMB subsequently directed agencies on how to implement the E.O. after enactment of FY2009 continuing and regular appropriations. These are the latest in a series of developments that began in January 2007, when the President proposed that Congress should (1) cut the number and funding of congressionally originated earmarks by at least half for FY2008 appropriations, relative to FY2005, and (2) place them only in statutory text, not report language. In January 2007, the Administration issued its own definition of earmark, whose language (and perhaps meaning) evolved over time in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memoranda. A final definition appears to have been established in E.O. 13457, but its meaning probably is informed by the evolution and contents of previously articulated definitions. Later, OMB established an \"Earmarks\" website, containing a database of Administration-identified earmarks, to track congressional action. Potential related issues for Congress involve, generally, roles and responsibilities for Congress, the President, agencies, and the public in the U.S. political system; defining, identifying, and overseeing earmarks; the executive order; the \"Earmarks\" website and database; and potential representational consequences.", "This report emphasizes analysis of E.O. 13457.

Some priorities may be based on policy makers' views on the proper role of government, the offices and positions in government they hold, or the constituencies they represent. Policy makers also may have different views on \"who decides.\" In the federal budget process, one such area of budgetary conflict has concerned \"earmarking.\" Specific definitions for the term earmark (and related terms, like congressional earmark and presidential earmark ) vary considerably and are controversial.

The report culminates with potential issues for Congress, including the potential for developments to affect the roles of Congress and the President in the budget process. Because the E.O. formally will remain in effect unless it is revoked, some of these issues may continue to be relevant after the swearing in of the next President.

OMB subsequently issued several memoranda to the heads of executive branch agencies that articulated Administration policies, defined the term earmark in several iterations, and required agencies to take certain actions.", "Specifically, an OMB January 2007 memorandum provided an official Administration definition for the term earmark (see Table 1 ). In addition to the definition, the memorandum's Attachment B provided a full page of \"additional guidance\" on the definition, which arguably was an inseparable part of the definition. For example, Attachment B said congressional direction that \"places restrictions on some portion of [Administration-requested] funding\" would count as an earmark . Nevertheless, terms and expressions in the definition, including circumvents , merit-based , competitive , otherwise curtails , and control critical aspects , were left undefined or partially defined. The memorandum also directed agencies and OMB to identify and publicize information about congressionally originated earmarks on the Internet in order to call on Congress to reduce earmark numbers and funding relative to FY2005.", "Three weeks later, an OMB February 2007 memorandum instructed agencies on how to handle non-statutory congressionally originated earmarks for the FY2007 budget, based on OMB's interpretation of the full-year continuing resolution for FY2007. According to the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the full-year measure was \"free of earmarks.\" Agencies were instructed by Section I of OMB's memorandum that they \"should not\" fund non-statutory earmarks, but also told \"the Administration welcomes input to help make informed decisions.\" In the absence of non-statutory earmarks, Section II of the memorandum told agencies to apply \"authorized discretion\" using \"transparent and merit-based determinations to achieve program objectives, consistent with the purpose of the statute and Administration policy (including the President's Budget).\" Viewed in concert with the OMB January 2007 memorandum, the February 2007 memorandum's use of terms may have had implications for how to understand the Administration's definition of earmark (in the January 2007 memorandum) and the Administration's characterizations of its own budgetary decision making. Among other things, Section II appeared to leave open the possibility of overlap between the terms merit-based and consistent with Administration policy in some contexts.", "Starting in March 2007, OMB followed up on its January 2007 memorandum by establishing an \"Earmarks\" website. In succeeding months, the website presented an expanding database of Administration-defined and -identified earmarks corresponding to FY2005 appropriations, FY2008 appropriations, FY2009 appropriations, and several past authorization measures. The website's explicit purposes were, among others, to establish a \"benchmark\" for measuring whether Congress \"achieve[d] the President's cut in half goal\" for FY2008, and to \"encourage and inform the debate over how taxpayers' money is spent.\" The homepage of the website also included as its first paragraph a somewhat different definition of earmark from the one published in January 2007 (see Table 1 ). With the posting of individual earmarks in OMB's database, it became possible to observe how the Administration's definition of earmark was implemented in practice. Many of the Administration's designations of items as earmarks focused on congressional specification, in bill or report language, of a receiving entity or geographic location. Congressionally specified items that previously had been requested by the Administration did not appear to be included in the database. Other items in the database fell outside the category of specifying a recipient or geographic location, however. For example, the datasets of FY2005 appropriations- and authorization-related earmarks include items that reportedly were made by telephone call, made through language in the Congressional Record , and modified from bill or report language through what OMB appears to call \"congressional letters of intent.\" It is not clear, however, if all such instances are included in the database.", "A May 2007 memorandum provided another, somewhat different Administration definition of earmark (see Table 1 ).

E.O. 13457 then instructs that agencies \"should not\" fund non-statutory earmarks, \"except when required by law or when an agency has itself determined a project, program, activity, grant, or other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking.\" The order also provides a new definition of earmark . This time, however, the definition was provided in a document with binding force on agencies (see also Table 1 ):", "[T]he term ''earmark'' means funds provided by the Congress for projects, programs, or grants where the purported congressional direction (whether in statutory text, report language, or other communication) circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process.", "For all legislation enacted after January 29, 2008, E.O. 13457 requires agency heads to take \"all necessary steps to ensure that\"", "agency funding decisions for \"any earmark\" are \"based on the text of laws\" and not based on a variety of non-statutory means, including \"any other non-statutory statement or indication of views of the Congress, or a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff thereof\"; agency funding decisions for \"any earmark\" are \"based on authorized, transparent, statutory criteria and merit-based decision making\"; and \"no oral or written communications concerning earmarks shall supersede statutory criteria, competitive awards, or merit-based decisionmaking.\"", "The executive order also outlines the process by which agency heads are required to handle congressional communications about non-statutory earmarks.

Among other things, it could be argued that the executive order reflects a view that congressional allocation of resources and benefits for public purposes \"often lead[s] to wasteful spending\" if it does not leave to the President and his Administration discretion to make certain funding allocations based on its interpretations of merit, competition, and statutory criteria. In this view, congressional direction that would fully limit the President's or an agency's discretion\u2014for example, congressional specification of a location or recipient in statute or report language\u2014would appear to be automatically considered an earmark .

According to the E.O., agency funding decisions (but not necessarily White House decisions) are to be made \"in the manner set forth\" in Section II of the OMB February 2007 memorandum. Under the memorandum, decisions are required to be based on (1) \"statutory criteria, such as funding formulas, eligibility standards, and merit-based decision-making,\" which often leave considerable discretion, and (2) in areas of significant discretion, \"merit-based determinations.\" The basis for \"merit-based determinations\" is not further defined in the E.O. or February 2007 memorandum, except that decisions in areas of significant discretion would be required to be consistent with the \"purpose of the statute\" and \"Administration policy (including the President's Budget).\" Given various estimates of the extent of earmarking originated by Congress, the resources involved are considerable, likely amounting to billions of dollars.

It could also be argued that the process described in E.O. 13457 might strengthen the President's discretion, influence, and control over agency decision making, which may change the relationship between Congress and the executive agencies. In combination, the E.O. backed up by presidential vetoes, if effective , could be used in an attempt to limit Congress's legislative activities that concern resource allocation to only statutory text.

The additional criteria are \"congressional direction\" that (1) \"circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation processes,\" or (2) \"otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process.\" With regard to the first, OMB has made statements that formulation of the President's budget proposal is a merit-based and competitive allocation process.

Reprogramming typically refers to an agency shifting funds among activities within an appropriations account's lump sum, resulting in an allocation different from what was contemplated at the time appropriations were enacted (e.g., based on agency budget justification documents and other representations).

For example, is budgetary decision making in the White House, among political appointees, or among career civil servants less \"political\" than in Congress?
