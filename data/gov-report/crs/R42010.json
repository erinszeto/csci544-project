It provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture appropriations bill).

Combined, these two appropriations laws provide $164 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED, which is 0.6% less than the comparable FY2011 funding level of $165 billion and 8.6% less than the FY2012 President's Budget request of $179 billion. In addition, the FY2012 annual appropriations law (P.L. 112-74) provides an estimated $577 billion in mandatory L-HHS-ED funding, for a total of $741 billion for L-HHS-ED as a whole.

One way the law seeks to reduce deficits is by establishing discretionary spending caps, which limit the amount of money that can be provided through the annual appropriations process for each of the next ten fiscal years. ", "The FY2012 appropriations bills are the first to be affected by these discretionary spending caps. For FY2012, the BCA established an overall discretionary cap of $1.043 trillion and divided the funding under this cap into two categories: $684 billion for security spending and $359 billion for non-security spending. In FY2012, the security category is defined, per Title I of the BCA, to include funding for the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Intelligence Community Management Account (which funds the offices of the Director of National Intelligence), and all discretionary budget accounts within Budget Function 150 (international affairs).

Meanwhile, total discretionary FY2012 appropriations for health care fraud and abuse ($310 million) did not require any adjustment to the discretionary cap.", "The BCA's statutory budget caps are enforceable via a process known as sequestration. If the caps are exceeded in any year, sequestration requires the executive branch to proportionally reduce funding for all non-exempt agencies, accounts, programs, projects, and activities by the amount necessary to reduce total budget authority to the level authorized under the caps.

The bulk of mandatory SSA funding from the L-HHS-ED bill supports the Supplemental Security Income program ($52.4 billion in FY2012; $49.9 billion in FY2011). When looking exclusively at discretionary funding, the SSA remains the largest component of the related agencies appropriation, constituting roughly 83% of discretionary funds in the FY2012 ($11.5 billion) and FY2011 ($11.5 billion). The majority of discretionary SSA funding covers administrative expenses for Social Security, SSI, and Medicare. ", "After the SSA, the next largest agency of the related agencies appropriation is the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), which constitutes roughly 2% of all funding and 8% of discretionary funding in FY2012 ($1.1 billion) and FY2011 ($1.1 billion). Typically, each of the remaining related agencies receives less than $1 billion from the annual L-HHS-ED appropriations bill.

(See Table 12 for details.)", "The House version of the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill would have eliminated funding for a number of Corporations for National and Community Service (CNCS) programs, such as Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and AmeriCorps State Grants and would have reduced overall CNCS funding for FY2012 by 75% from the FY2011 level. The final L-HHS-ED appropriations bill, however, includes funding for all but one CNCS program. The Learn and Serve America program, which did not receive funding in FY2011, does not receive any funding in the FY2012 L-HHS-ED bill. The House bill would have also eliminated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The final FY2012 appropriations law provides the CPB with $445 million in two-year advance funding, the same amount it received in FY2011, but less than the President's request of $451 million. However, the final law provides no funding for CBP's digitization program, which is a cut of $6 million from FY2011 and the FY2012 President's Budget. The Social Security Administration (SSA) will have approximately the same amount to administer its programs and maintain the integrity of the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs in FY2012 as it did in FY2011. The FY2012 annual appropriations law ( P.L. 112-74 ) provides $11.0 billion for Limitation on Administrative Expenses and program integrity activities. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-77 ) provides an additional $483 million to the SSA for program integrity activities in FY2012 bringing the total to $11.4 billion, approximately the same funding level as FY2011. Note that all of this funding, regardless of the bill by which it is appropriated, is expected to be subject to the 0.189% across-the-board rescission of discretionary appropriations required by Section 527 of Division F of P.L. 112-74 . The National Healthcare Workforce Commission was created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 ) and its members were appointed by the Comptroller General on September 30, 2010. The President requested $3 million for the commission, but no funding is provided in the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill for FY2012. The L-HHS-ED bill contains a policy provision prohibiting the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) from using any appropriated funds to issue any new directive or regulation to provide employees with the means to vote electronically for collective bargaining representation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detailed Related Agencies Appropriations Table", "paragraphs": [" Table 12 shows the appropriations details for offices and major programs of the L-HHS-ED Related Agencies.
