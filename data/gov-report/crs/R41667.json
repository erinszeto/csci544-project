{"id": "R41667", "title": "How Local Election Officials View Election Reform: Results of Three National Surveys", "released_date": "2011-03-04T00:00:00", "summary": ["Local election officials (LEOs) are critical to the administration of federal elections and the implementation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA, P.L. 107-252). Three surveys of LEOs were performed by academic institutions in collaboration with the Congressional Research Service. Although care needs to be taken in interpreting the results, they may have implications for several policy issues, such as how election officials are chosen and trained, the best ways to ensure that voting systems and election procedures are sufficiently effective, secure, and voter-friendly, and whether adjustments should be made to HAVA requirements. Major results include the following:", "The demographic characteristics of LEOs differ from those of other government officials. Almost three-quarters are women, and 5% are minorities. Most do not have a college degree, and most were elected, although those characteristics appear to be changing. Some results suggest areas of potential improvement such as in training and participation in professional associations.", "LEOs believed that the federal government has too great an influence on the acquisition of voting systems, and that local elected officials have too little. Their concerns increased from 2004 to 2006 about the influence of the media, political parties, advocacy groups, and vendors. Concern about the influence of these groups increased again, slightly, from 2006 to 2008.", "LEOs were highly satisfied with whatever voting system they used but were less supportive of other kinds. Their satisfaction declined from 2004 to 2006 for all systems except lever machines, but rebounded in 2008. They also rated their primary voting systems as very accurate, secure, reliable, and voter- and pollworker-friendly, no matter what system they used. However, the most common incident reported by respondents in both the 2006 and 2008 elections was malfunction of a direct recording (DRE) or optical scan (OS) electronic voting system. The incidence of long lines at polling places was highest in jurisdictions using DREs. Most DRE users did not believe that voter-verified paper audit trails (VVPAT) should be required, but nonusers believed they should be. However, the percentage of DRE users who supported VVPAT increased from 2004 to 2008, and more VVPAT users were satisfied with them in 2008 than in 2006.", "On average, LEOs mildly supported requiring photo identification for all voters and believed it would make elections more secure, even though they strongly believed that it will negatively affect turnout and did not believe that voter fraud is a problem in their jurisdictions.", "In all three surveys, LEOs believed that HAVA is making moderate improvements in the electoral process. The level of support declined from 2004 to 2006 but increased to its highest point in 2008. LEOs reported that HAVA has increased the accessibility of voting but has made elections more complicated and has increased their cost, though fewer believed so in 2008 than in 2006. LEOs spent much more time preparing for the election in 2008 than in 2004. They also believed that the increased complexity of elections is hindering recruitment of pollworkers. Most found the activities of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) that HAVA created moderately important, and that its helpfulness improved from 2006 to 2008. Their assessment of the statewide voter-registration database was neutral in 2006 but positive in 2008. They believed that it was more accurate and fair than their previous registration system."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["U.S. elections are highly decentralized, with much of the responsibility for election administration residing with local election officials (LEOs). There are thousands of such officials, many of whom are responsible for all aspects of election administration in their local jurisdictions\u2014including voter registration, recruiting pollworkers, running each election, and choosing and purchasing new voting systems.", "These officials are therefore critical not only to the successful administration of federal elections, but also to the implementation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA, P.L. 107-252 ), the Uniform and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA, P.L. 99-410 , as amended) and other federal statutes. Nevertheless, there has been little objective information on the perceptions and attitudes of LEOs about election reform. Such information may be useful to Congress in deliberations about federal election reform activities.", "This report discusses the results of three scientific opinion surveys that were designed to help fill that gap in knowledge about principal local election officials. The surveys were performed pursuant to projects sponsored by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The projects were developed in collaboration with and the surveys performed by faculty and students at the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, and the Center for Applied Social Research at the University of Oklahoma. The university teams developed and administered the surveys, in consultation with CRS, to samples of LEOs from all 50 states, with a response rate of approximately 40% for each survey. The responses were analyzed by CRS for purposes of this report. See the Appendix for information on the methods used in the surveys and analyses.", "The surveys were administered following the 2004, 2006, and 2008 federal elections. While they were not identical, many of the questions were the same, and comparisons of the results are discussed where appropriate. The findings may be useful to Congress as it considers funding for HAVA, oversight of its implementation, and possible revisions to current law.", "The report begins with a description of some characteristics of local election officials and their jurisdictions. That is followed by a discussion of perceptions and attitudes of LEOs about the different kinds of voting systems used in different jurisdictions\u2014lever machines, punchcard ballots, hand-counted paper ballots, central-count optical scan (CCOS), precinct-count optical scan (PCOS), and direct-recording electronic (DRE) systems such as \"touchscreens.\" The report then describes how HAVA has affected local jurisdictions and the opinions LEOs expressed about the law. The section after that discusses other election administration topics covered in the 2006 and 2008 surveys\u2014preparations for election day, election-day incidents, characteristics of pollworkers, and attitudes about nonpartisan election administration.

In most states, they are counties or major cities, but in some New England and Upper Midwest states, they are small townships\u2014for example, more than 1,800 townships in Wisconsin. The number of registered voters and polling places in a jurisdiction reported by LEOs also varies greatly ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). ", "The reported number of registered voters ranged from fewer than 100 to more than 1 million, with a median of about 12,000 in 2006 and 13,000 in 2008. That 8% increase was consistent with the reported 7%-10% increase in the number of registered voters nationwide during that period. ", "Although LEOs were not asked to report the number of voters in their jurisdictions in the 2004 survey, in 2008 they were asked how the number changed from 2004 to 2008. About two-thirds reported that the number of registered voters had increased between 2004 and 2008, and about one-fifth reported a decrease ( Figure 3 ).", "The number of polling places in a jurisdiction averaged about a dozen, ranging from 0 to 1,000 or more, with about 15% of jurisdictions in each election having only one polling place and a similar percentage having more than 50. The number of election personnel working in a jurisdiction, in addition to the local election official, also varied greatly, from none to more than 10,000, including pollworkers. The 2008 survey also asked about the number of employees other than pollworkers. The median was 5, with a mean of 17 and a maximum of 800. ", "The number of registered voters, polling places, and pollworkers was about 10 times greater in county jurisdictions than in townships. LEOs from counties reported an average of about 56,000 registered voters, while those from townships averaged 6,000. There were 40 polling places per county on average, and 3 per township. Counties had about 290 pollworkers and townships 30.", "Given such diversity and other differences among states\u2014such as wealth, population, and the role of state election officials\u2014responsibilities and characteristics of LEOs are likely to vary greatly. Nevertheless, some patterns emerged from the surveys."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The demographic characteristics of LEOs differ from those of other government officials.", "paragraphs": ["According to the survey results, the typical LEO is a white woman between 50 and 60 years old who is a high school graduate. She was elected to her current office, works full-time in election administration, has been in the profession for about 10 years, and earns under $60,000 per year. She belongs to a state-level professional organization but not a national one, and she believes that her training as an election official has been good to excellent.", "As with any such description, the one above does not capture the diversity within the community surveyed: About one-quarter of LEOs are men, about 5% belong to minority groups, about 40% are college graduates, and about 10% have graduate degrees (see Table 1 ). LEOs range from under 25 to more than 80 years of age, and have served from 1 to 50 years. More than half were elected rather than appointed to their posts. Reported salaries range from under $10,000 to more than $120,000. Most belong to at least one professional organization.", "The demographic profile of LEOs is unusual, especially for a professional group. They differ from those of other local government employees. For example, according to U.S. Census figures, while women comprise a higher proportion of the local government workforce than men overall, men comprise a higher proportion of local government general and administrative managers. About 20% of those managers are members of minorities. The patterns do not appear to be a result of the fact that most LEOs are elected, as the demographic characteristics of legislators appear to be largely similar to those for local government managers.", "The average tenure in the current position declined by about one year from 2004 to 2008, with the proportion of LEOs who had served for two years or less in their current positions rising to 18% in 2008 from 11% in 2004 (see Figure 4 ). Thus, there appeared to be a small increase in job turnover over the three elections. However, there was no significant change in average age ( Figure 5 ).", "Other trends across the surveys included a decrease in the proportion of LEOs who were elected, an increase in both the percentage who worked full time and in the amount of time they spent working on elections, an increase in salary, and a decrease in the proportion who expressed a slightly to strongly conservative ideology. ", "The survey was not designed to identify the causes of such changes, but at least some appear to be consistent with the impacts of federal and state election reform on local jurisdictions. That reform led to increased funding for election administration, changes in voting systems used by many jurisdictions, and an increased workload for many election officials. For example, the survey found that those who reported that they worked full-time on election administration increased from 66% in 2004 to 72% in 2008, while those who reported that they spent more than twenty hours per week on election duties increased from 41% to 49%.", "The increasing complexity of elections and the increased federal role after the passage of HAVA have focused more attention on the role of professionalism in election administration. Given that change, it might be expected that election officials who began serving more recently would have more formal education than those who have served for longer periods. Such a pattern could yield a statistical association between the highest education level attained and the number of years in service as an election official. In fact, there was a small but significant relationship, with LEOs who did not have a college degree averaging 11-12 years of service and those with graduate degrees averaging 8-9 years. However, there was no significant change in the overall distribution of maximum education level over the three surveys ( Figure 6 ).", "Reported salaries of LEOs increased about 7% per year, from an estimated average of $45,000 in 2004 to $51,000 in 2008 ( Figure 7 ). LEOs in jurisdictions with larger numbers of voters tended to have somewhat higher salaries and education levels, and were more likely to be male. In 2008, the median salary for LEOs in jurisdictions below the median size in numbers of voters was $40-50,000; it was $50,000-$60,000 for LEOs in larger jurisdictions. More than 20% of LEOs in larger jurisdictions had attended graduate school, while 10% of those from smaller jurisdictions had. LEOs were male in about 20% of jurisdictions below the median size, and in 30% of those above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fewer than half of LEOs belonged to a national or international association, but most belonged to a state association.", "paragraphs": ["The survey also examined other factors related to election administration as a profession. More than two-thirds (70%-74%) of LEOs reported belonging to at least one professional association. Of those, more than three-fourths belonged to a state association, 30% to a regional one, and about 20% to the three major national or international associations (see Figure 8 ). Altogether, about 40% of LEOs who belonged to at least one association were members of a national or international one, with more than half belonging only to a state or regional association. ", "In 2006, the percentage of LEOs reporting that they had a written job description was 43% for those who had been elected and 70% for those who had been appointed. Most LEOs reported a broad range of election-administration responsibilities beyond solely running elections. Most are also responsible for budgeting, personnel, and purchasing, for example ( Table 2 ).", "Most LEOs received some initial training specifically designed to prepare them for their duties, but for most that training was less than 20 hours, and only one-fifth of LEOs were required to pass an examination ( Table 3 ). Most have also received additional training beyond that initially provided. More than two-thirds of LEOs assessed that their training was good to excellent and resulted in moderate to substantial improvement in their effectiveness and ability to solve problems. More than four-fifths believed that training and experience are equally important in ensuring a successful election.", "This result, shown in Figure 9 , might reflect the impact of HAVA requirements, most of which went into effect in 2006. For example, election officials might have felt less well prepared by their training to implement HAVA in 2006 than in 2004, but the survey did not address that possibility. Other possible factors include increasing public attention to problems in election administration, and recent controversies about the reliability and security of voting systems. Two-fifths of respondents to the 2006 survey, and a third of 2008 respondents, commented on what kinds of additional training would be useful. The most common suggestions were for more training in technical and legal aspects of elections, and more \"hands-on\" training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LEOs were less satisfied with their training in 2006 and 2008 than in 2004.", "paragraphs": ["Given the increasing role of technology in elections, the surveys asked LEOs questions about their attitudes toward technology ( Figure 10 ).

By 2008, that percentage had fallen by almost half, with lever machines decreasing by almost two-thirds, paper ballots by half, CCOS by one-quarter, and punchcards virtually disappearing by 2006 (see Figure 11 ). The proportion of jurisdictions using central-count optical scan (CCOS) decreased by almost half from 2004 to 2006, but that decline reversed in 2008.

From 2006 to 2008, respondents reported a 5% increase in PCOS and a similar decrease in DREs, although those changes were not statistically significant. ", "The observed patterns are consistent with results from other sources. The trends conform with expectations arising from HAVA requirements that emphasized improved usability, including prevention and correction of errors by voters in marking ballots, and accessibility of voting systems. The increase in use of CCOS from 2006 and 2008 appears to run counter to that explanation, because unlike PCOS and DRE systems, CCOS does not provide assistance to voters in preventing errors. The cause of the increase is not clear, but two possible factors are the increase in \"no-excuse\" absentee voting (see the section on \" Election Administration Issues \") and the controversy about the security and reliability of DREs that have led many states to adopt paper-ballot requirements.

The average length of use varies with the length of time a voting system has been available for use. At one extreme, jurisdictions with hand-counted paper ballots have used them for 80 to 100 years, on average. At the other, jurisdictions with DREs have had them under 10 years, on average.", "The pattern of use shown in Figure 12 suggests that jurisdictions do not readily change the kinds of voting systems they use. Before the 1990s, fewer than 10% of jurisdictions used optical scan and DRE voting systems. On the one hand, such reluctance to change creates stability that may be beneficial to voters and administrators. On the other hand, it may mean that a particular kind of technology is used far longer than it should be, with increasing risks of negative consequences. For example, many of the problems associated with the 2000 presidential election were attributed to the continued use of outmoded or flawed technology, such as the punchcard systems in widespread use at the time.", "The causes of such long-term use patterns are complex and may include factors such as legal and budgetary constraints and various forms of transaction costs that would be incurred with any change. Such factors, if they continue to be important, may impede jurisdictions from taking advantage of the kinds of improvements that are likely to occur in voting technology over the next decade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The kind of accessible voting system used varied with the kind of primary voting system.", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, LEOs were asked about the voting systems they used to meet the HAVA accessibility requirement. The options presented were (1) an electronic ballot marking device (BMD), which uses a touchscreen or other computer interface to mark an optical-scan ballot; (2) a DRE; (3) a vote-by-phone voting system, in which the voter uses an automated telephone system to fill out the ballot; and (4) some other system, which the LEO was asked to describe. As Figure 13 shows, the kinds of accessible voting systems used varied depending on the kind of primary voting system used in the jurisdiction. About 40% of responding jurisdictions reported using DREs as their accessible systems. Not surprisingly, most of those also used them as their primary systems. ", "A slightly lower percentage of respondents, 37%, reported using BMDs for accessibility, and it was most commonly used in lever-machine jurisdictions. While most optical-scan jurisdictions might be expected to use BMDs, only about half reported doing so. About 12% of jurisdictions used vote-by-phone, with the majority of those having hand-counted paper ballots as their primary system. ", "Three-quarters of jurisdictions reported having one accessible machine per polling place. About one-fifth used two, and about one in 20 used three. Most LEOs reported that voters without disabilities used accessible machines less than other machines, and about 40% reported that they used them much less. In jurisdictions using DREs as the accessible machines, the differences were less on average than in those using other technology (see Table 4 ). Some observers have argued that accessible voting systems should not be limited to use by voters with disabilities, because that would provide a way for election officials to determine the ballot choices made by that class of voters; it would therefore deprive them of the same degree of ballot secrecy that other voters have.

Their views did not change significantly on the roles of the federal government, elected state officials, local elected officials, and the public over the three surveys.", "In 2008, LEOs were also asked whether cost has too great an influence on the process of selecting voting systems. They agreed on average that it did, and the strength of that view was about the same as for the media, advocates, political parties, and vendors. ", "Overall, the observed patterns of response are not surprising. Support for greater influence by local elected officials is expected, because LEOs generally either report to elected local officials or are elected themselves. However, for some questions, elected LEOs and appointed ones had somewhat different views. The support of elected LEOs for greater influence by local elected officials was 20% higher than that of appointed LEOs; support for greater influence by state elected officials and the public was 5%-10% higher. Elected LEOs were 20% less supportive of influence by unelected officials, and 5%-10% less supportive of influence by the federal government, professional associations, and independent experts.", "The concerns of local officials about the influence of the federal government are well-known in many areas, not just election administration, and many local officials may have resented the HAVA requirements that led to changes in long-used voting systems. The concerns of LEOs about federal influence have not abated, despite improvements in the attitudes of LEOs about HAVA (see \" The Help America Vote Act (HAVA): Impacts\u00a0and\u00a0Attitudes \" below). Also, it is not surprising that LEOs have become more concerned about the roles of stakeholders such as the media, advocates, and political partisans, who are closely associated with the recent controversies about the reliability and security of voting systems.", "There has also been debate and uncertainty specifically about the role and influence of voting system manufacturers and vendors in the selection of voting systems by local jurisdictions. Some observers have argued that vendors have undue influence in what voting systems jurisdictions choose. Others believe that such concerns are unwarranted. But little has been known previously of how LEOs actually view vendors and their relationships with them.", "The results of the 2004 survey were mixed with respect to the importance of vendors. (These results are from more detailed questions on factors influencing the acquisition of voting systems that were not included in the 2006 or 2008 surveys.) LEOs in 2004 appeared to have high trust and confidence in vendors but did not rate them as being especially influential with respect to decisions about voting systems\u2014a view that changed over the next two surveys. Fewer than 10% in 2004 believed that there was insufficient oversight of vendors by the federal government and states, but about one in six believed that local governments did not exercise enough oversight.", "Most jurisdictions using computer-assisted voting reported in 2004 that they had interacted with their voting-system vendors within the last four years. More than 90% of LEOs considered their voting system vendors responsive and the quality of their goods and services to be high. They felt equally strongly that the recommendations of those vendors could be trusted. However, about a fifth of respondents thought that vendors were willing to sacrifice security for greater profit, although 60% disagreed. Also, a quarter felt that vendors were used for too many elements of election administration.", "When LEOs were asked in 2004 what sources of information they relied on with respect to voting systems, state election officials received the highest average rating, with about three-quarters of LEOs indicating that they rely on state officials a great deal. Next most important were other election officials, followed by the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and advocates for the disabled. About one-third of LEOs stated that they relied on vendors a great deal, a level similar to their stated reliance on professional associations. Only 2% of LEOs rated vendors higher than any other source, whereas 20% rated state officials highest. Interest groups were rated lower than vendors, and political parties and media received the lowest ratings.", "When LEOs were asked in 2004 about the amount of influence different actors had on decisions about voting systems, the overall pattern of response was similar to that for information sources. Once again, state, local, and federal officials were judged the most influential, and political parties and the media the least, with vendors in between. An exception was that local nonelected officials were considered less influential on average than vendors. Both voters and advocates for the disabled were rated as more influential on average than vendors. No LEOs rated vendors as more influential than any other source.", "Those results contrast with the views of LEOs described above about whether the levels of influence of stakeholders were too little or too great in 2004 ( Figure 14 ). Of the three actors considered most influential, LEOs believed that local elected officials should have more influence and the federal government has too much, and they were neutral about state officials.

", "As the figure shows, for other characteristics, there were substantial differences in many cases both among voting systems in a survey and for a given voting system across the surveys. For most of those characteristics, LEOs were less happy with the performance of their voting system in 2006 and 2008 than in 2004, especially with respect to optical scan and DRE systems, which they rated lower for cost, size, storage requirements, and machine error in the second and third surveys.", "Optical scan systems, both central- and precinct-count, were rated higher for accessibility in 2006 and 2008 than in 2004.

Some of the comparisons among voting systems, however, did yield surprising results. In particular, the ratings for reliability, security, accuracy, and ease of use by voters were very high and were similar for all voting systems.", "Given media reports about problems with the reliability and security of electronic voting, somewhat different outcomes might have been expected\u2014namely, that DREs would have been rated lower in reliability and security. Also, given that modern DREs are often described as more voter-friendly than other systems, and certainly have the capability of providing higher levels of usability than other types, the lack of difference in ratings for usability is somewhat surprising. ", "With respect to accuracy, a lower rating might have been expected for punchcards, given the difficulties with recounts that were prominent during the 2000 presidential election. It is possible that such confidence exists because few jurisdictions use punch cards now, and those that still use them declined to replace them after 2000. Those jurisdictions kept the system, despite intense negative media coverage of system limitations, and opted not to take part in the punchcard buyout program offered through HAVA.", "The relative lack of difference in ratings of optical scan and DRE systems for acquisition and maintenance costs, and size and storage requirements, appears to run counter to widely held views. Many observers regard DREs as the most expensive voting systems, given that several machines may be needed for each polling place, whereas optical scan systems usually require one machine per polling place (PCOS) or none (CCOS).", "These differences from expectation suggest that LEOs' perceptions of how their voting systems perform may differ substantially in some ways from views about those systems that have often been depicted by the news media and activists. If the perceptions of election officials are accurate, then several of the criticisms leveled at specific voting systems could lead, if acted upon, to unnecessary and even counterproductive regulation and expenditure. For example, if in fact there is little difference in security between an optical scan system and a DRE, then the requirements for voter-verified paper records of votes that many states have imposed may be unnecessary. If, however, LEOs' perceptions are inaccurate, then understanding and addressing the causes of those inaccuracies may be beneficial.

Alternatively, they might truly believe that their voting systems are highly reliable, accurate, and secure, even if independent evidence does not support that view.", "Also, some caution is needed in assigning cause and effect.

The small difference among the surveys in those choosing \"town/township\" and in those choosing \"other\" was almost certainly a result of a small change in the structure of the question after the 2004 survey. However, as the figure implies, the proportion of respondents from county jurisdictions increased slightly over the course of the three surveys.", "All the results presented in this report are from analyses by CRS of data provided from the surveys by researchers at Texas A&M University (2004 and 2006) and the University of Oklahoma (2008). The raw data were first examined for errors, and corrections were made where necessary, in a few cases, such as if a LEO claimed to work more hours per week than is physically possible. Where the correct answer could be reasonably discerned, the response was corrected. Otherwise it was discarded. Once cleaned, the data were analyzed using standard parametric methods, mainly analysis of variance, linear regression, and Student's t-tests as appropriate.", "Three kinds of hypotheses were tested:", "differences between groups, such as whether results differed across the three surveys; differences from a hypothetical value, such as whether LEOs were neutral about, agreed with, or disagreed with a particular statement; and tests for associations, such as whether the number of pollworkers in a jurisdiction was correlated with the number of registered voters.", "Statistical significance was determined using a significance level (\u03b1) of .01. However, for display purposes, graphs with error bars were drawn showing 95% confidence intervals for the means.", "Most tests for which results are presented in this report yielded highly statistically significant results\u2014p-values much lower than the significance level (p << .01). For reported data where statistically significant effects were not found, the lack of effect is noted in the text, for example, by stating that no change was found between 2004 and 2006 for a particular survey item.", "Additional methodological details can be provided upon request."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
