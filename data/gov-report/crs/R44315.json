The JVTA seeks to improve services to victims. For example, it directs the Department of Justice, which administers anti-trafficking programs, to provide a database for trafficking victim stakeholders on counseling and other victim supports.", "The JVTA also seeks to heighten the federal response to crimes perpetrated by traffickers. A major component of the law is the establishment of new financial penalty assessments for traffickers. These monies are to be deposited into a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund established under the act. Money from the fund may be used to award certain existing grants authorized by the TVPA or enhance programming for victims of child pornography served under the Victims of Child Abuse Act, among other purposes. The law prohibits the use of monies from the fund for medical items or health care or services under certain circumstances, though it allows such services to be funded from other sources.", "The JVTA responds to domestic sex trafficking of children through changes to a few policy areas, including missing and exploited children, runaway youth, the child welfare system, and juvenile justice. Notably, it requires law enforcement agencies to report additional information to a federal data system on missing children. It also creates a new child human trafficking deterrence program to aid child victims of both sex and labor trafficking while also supporting investigations and prosecutions of trafficking offenses.", "The JVTA addresses other issues related to trafficking, particularly concerns about possible duplication of efforts and a lack of coordination among the agencies that conduct anti-trafficking activities. It directs the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to conduct a review of human trafficking prevention within the United States, including cataloging the U.S. government's efforts to prevent individuals from committing trafficking offenses and to prevent children from becoming victims. The law also requires a Government Accountability Office report to Congress that would include information on federal and state law enforcement agencies' efforts to combat human trafficking as well as information on federal anti-trafficking grant programs.", "This report supplements CRS Report R43917, Domestic Human Trafficking Legislation in the 114th Congress.

", "Noncitizens are more susceptible than U.S. citizens to labor trafficking, and more foreign victims are found in labor trafficking than in sex trafficking. Although labor trafficking can happen to U.S. citizens, significantly more U.S. citizens are found in sex trafficking.

Such assistance may include temporary housing, independent living skills, cultural orientation, transportation, job training, mental health counseling, and legal assistance. A number of federal agencies administer public awareness campaigns on identifying human trafficking victims. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Blue Campaign is one such example. The majority of cases investigated at the federal level are handled by agents in DOJ's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and DHS's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who coordinate with others as appropriate.

They have established grant programs for victims and law enforcement, strengthened criminal laws, and provided for oversight on the effectiveness and implications of U.S. policies on countering human trafficking. Countering human trafficking has also been a prolific area of legislative activity for the 114 th Congress.

", "Finally, the JVTA directs the Attorney General to implement and maintain a National Strategy for Combating Human Trafficking that includes (1) integrating federal, state, local, and tribal efforts to investigate and prosecute human trafficking cases; (2) coordinating cases within DOJ; (3) addressing annual budget priorities and federal efforts dedicated to preventing and combating human trafficking; (4) continually assessing future trends, challenges, and opportunities to enhance federal, state, local, and tribal efforts to combat human trafficking; and (5) encouraging cooperation, coordination, and mutual support between the private sector and federal agencies to combat human trafficking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training", "paragraphs": ["While U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is one of the two lead agencies responsible for human trafficking investigations, personnel from several agencies within DHS may encounter instances and victims of trafficking during the course of their regular duties. For example, agents from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may encounter trafficking victims at airports as traffickers attempt to move the victims around the country. The JVTA directs the Secretary of DHS to implement a training program within 180 days on deterring, detecting, and disrupting human trafficking during the course of their primary roles and responsibilities for personnel from TSA, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and any other agency that the Secretary deems appropriate. The law also requires the Secretary to ensure that such personnel regularly receive current information related to the detection of human trafficking. The Secretary is required to certify to the appropriate congressional committees no later than one year after enactment that the training has been completed. The JVTA also requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to these committees on the effectiveness of the training program required under the law, including the number of cases in which DHS personnel suspected human trafficking and the number of confirmed cases of human trafficking. The JVTA allows the Secretary to provide the training curricula to any state or local government, or any private organization to assist such entities in creating their own programs to identify human trafficking.", "The JVTA requires the Attorney General to assure that each DOJ anti-trafficking program, including training programs for federal, state, or local law enforcement, includes technical training on effective measures for (1) investigating and prosecuting an individual who obtains, patronizes, or solicits a commercial sex act involving a trafficking victim; and (2) facilitating the provision of physical and mental health services to trafficking victims. It also requires that any DOJ anti-trafficking program for U.S. Attorneys or other federal prosecutors includes training on seeking restitution for trafficking offenses. In addition, it mandates that the Federal Judicial Center provide training to judges related to ordering restitution for trafficking offenses.", "The JVTA amends the TVPA to include members of the Foreign Service as persons who are required to be trained on how to identify and protect trafficking victims, and it specifies minimum requirements for the training. For example, the law requires that all ambassadors and deputy chiefs of missions receive a briefing on trafficking issues prior to departing for their posts.", "As noted previously, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act ( P.L. 113-183 ) amended federal child welfare law to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures needed to ensure relevant training for caseworkers. These procedures must be developed in consultation with state and local law enforcement, juvenile justice systems, health care providers, education agencies, and organizations with experience in dealing with at-risk children and youth. The JVTA similarly amends a separate child welfare law to ensure that state child welfare agencies develop provisions and procedures for training child protective services (CPS) workers about identifying and assessing children who are victims of sex trafficking. ", "The JVTA also requires HHS to competitively award a grant to one medical or nursing school for developing best practices for health care professionals to recognize and appropriately respond to victims of severe forms of human trafficking. This entity would be required to analyze and evaluate, in consultation with others, existing best practices for interprofessional collaboration, and develop training for health care professionals on such best practices. It also requires HHS to later disseminate the best practices identified by the medical or nursing school."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sex Offender Registry", "paragraphs": ["The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) provides a set of minimum standards for sex offender registration and notification in the United States.

In some cases, the rapist volunteers to surrender his parental rights if the woman refuses to testify in the criminal case. While some states have statutes that allow the court to terminate the parental rights in the case of rape, others either do not have such statutes or have restrictions, such as requiring the person to be convicted of the assault before his parental rights can be terminated. ", "The JVTA requires the Attorney General to increase grant funding under the STOP (Services, Training, Officers, Prosecutors) Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program and Sexual Assault Services Program to states that have a law that allows the mother of a child conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her rapist. The laws would apply without regard to the age or marital status of the child's parents at the time of the offense. The increase in formula grants is allowed to be provided for a total of four two-year periods (eight years), and is equal to not more than 10% of the total amount of funding provided to the state averaged over the previous three years. Of the increased funding, 25% is for STOP grants, and 75% for the Sexual Assault Services Program. The JVTA authorizes $5 million a year for FY2015 through FY2019 for the grant increases.
