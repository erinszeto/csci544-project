The PHS agencies are funded primarily with annual discretionary appropriations. They also receive significant amounts of funding from other sources including mandatory funds from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), user fees, and third-party reimbursements (collections).", "The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funds research on improving the quality and delivery of health care. For several years prior to FY2015, AHRQ did not receive its own annual appropriation. Instead, it relied on redistributed (\"set-aside\") discretionary funds from other PHS agencies for most of its funding, with supplemental amounts from the ACA's mandatory Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF). In FY2015 and FY2016, AHRQ received its own discretionary appropriation in lieu of set-aside funds, with the FY2016 level of $428 million below the FY2015 level of $443 million. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the federal government's lead public health agency. CDC obtains its funding from multiple sources besides discretionary appropriations. The agency's funding level has fluctuated in the past few years, with the FY2016 level of $11.8 billion above the FY2015 level of $11.2 billion. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) investigates the public health impact of exposure to hazardous substances. ATSDR is headed by the CDC director and included in the discussion of CDC in this report. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates drugs, medical devices, food, and tobacco products, among other consumer products. The agency is funded with annual discretionary appropriations and industry user fees. The FDA's funding level in FY2016 was $4.7 billion\u2014above the FY2015 level of $4.5 billion\u2014with user fees accounting for about 43% of FDA's total funding. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) funds programs and systems that provide health care services to the uninsured and medically underserved. HRSA, like CDC, relies on funding from several different sources. The agency's funding increased from $10.6 billion in FY2015 to $10.8 billion in FY2016. The Indian Health Service (IHS) supports a health care delivery system for Native Americans. IHS's funding, which includes discretionary appropriations and collections from third-party payers of health care, increased between FY2015 and FY2016 from $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. Appropriations and collections both increased during that period. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds basic, clinical, and translational biomedical and behavioral research. NIH gets more than 99% of its funding from discretionary appropriations. Recent increases in NIH's annual appropriations have boosted its funding level to a new high of $32.3 billion in FY2016, compared to $30.3 billion in FY2015. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funds mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services. SAMHSA's funding, about 95% of which comes from discretionary appropriations, was approximately $3.6 billion in FY2015 and $3.7 billion in FY2016.", "This report is a new edition of an earlier product, which remains available: CRS Report R43304, Public Health Service Agencies: Overview and Funding (FY2010-FY2016).

HRSA funds programs and systems to improve access to health care among low-income populations, pregnant women and children, persons living with HIV/AIDS, rural and frontier populations, and others who are medically underserved. SAMHSA funds community-based mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services.", "CDC is a public health agency that develops and supports community-based and population-wide programs and systems to promote quality of life and prevent the leading causes of disease, injury, disability, and death. ATSDR, which is headed by the CDC director and included in the discussion of CDC in this report, is tasked with identifying potential public health effects from exposure to hazardous substances. Finally, FDA is primarily a regulatory agency, whose mission is to ensure the safety of foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, and the safety and effectiveness of drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and other health products. In 2009, Congress gave FDA the authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products in order to protect public health.", "The programs and activities of five of the PHS agencies\u2014AHRQ, CDC, HRSA, NIH, and SAMHSA\u2014are mostly authorized under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). While some of FDA's regulatory activities are also authorized under the PHSA, the agency and its programs derive most of their statutory authority from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). HRSA's maternal and child health programs are authorized by the Social Security Act (SSA), and many of the IHS programs and services are authorized by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.

The Secretary may transfer up to 1% of the funds in any given account. However, a recipient account may not be increased by more than 3%. Congressional appropriators must be notified in advance of any transfer.", "The HHS Secretary used this transfer authority in FY2013 and again in FY2014 as part of a broader effort to provide the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) with additional funding to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In FY2013, for example, NIH was the primary source of transfers both to CMS for ACA implementation and to CDC and SAMHSA to help offset a loss of funding for those two agencies from the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF, discussed below). A significant portion of the FY2013 PPHF funds that were originally allocated to CDC and SAMHSA were reallocated to CMS, also for ACA implementation. In FY2014, NIH was again the primary source of transfers to CMS to support ACA implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PHS Evaluation Set-Aside", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the transfer authority provided in the annual LHHS appropriations act, Section 241 of the PHSA authorizes the HHS Secretary, with the approval of congressional appropriators, to use a portion of the funds appropriated for programs authorized by the PHSA to evaluate their implementation and effectiveness. This long-standing budgeting authority is known as the Public Health Service Evaluation Set-Aside (set-aside), or PHS budget \"tap.\" ", "Under this authority the appropriations of numerous HHS programs are subject to an assessment. Although the PHSA limits the set-aside to no more than 1% of program appropriations, in recent years the annual LHHS appropriations act has specified a higher amount. The FY2016 LHHS appropriations act capped the set-aside at 2.5%, the same percentage that has been in place since FY2010. ", "Following passage of the annual LHHS appropriations act, the HHS Budget Office calculates the assessment on each of the donor agencies and offices. These funds are then transferred to various recipient agencies and offices within the department for evaluation and other specified purposes, based on the amounts specified in the appropriations act. ", " Table 1 shows the total assessments and transfers for FY2013, by HHS agency and office, and indicates whether the entity was a net donor or recipient of set-aside funds that year. These figures are broadly representative of the distribution of set-aside funds that occurred each fiscal year over a period of several years prior to FY2015, when the appropriators decided to make major changes to the allocation of such funds.", "NIH, whose annual discretionary appropriation exceeds that of all the other PHS agencies combined, is subject to the largest assessment of set-aside funds. NIH contributed almost $710 million (69%) of the $1.026 billion in set-aside funds in FY2013. However, the agency received $8 million in set-aside funding, making it a significant net donor of set-aside funds. Similarly, HRSA contributed more set-aside funds than it received in FY2013. On the other hand, AHRQ, CDC, and SAMHSA were net recipients of set-aside funding in FY2013. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and various offices within the Office of the Secretary (OS) also received set-aside funds.", " Table 1 also shows the set-aside assessments and transfers for the current fiscal year (i.e., FY2016). These figures reflect the significant changes that the appropriators first made in FY2015 by returning most of the set-aside funding to NIH and eliminating any transfers to AHRQ, CDC, and HRSA. As a result, NIH has gone from being by far the largest net donor of set-aside funds to a net recipient of such funding. Meanwhile, AHRQ and CDC have experienced a significant loss of set-aside funding and are now both net donors of these funds. ", "The situation with AHRQ is of particular interest to many. From FY2003 through FY2014, AHRQ did not receive an annual discretionary appropriation. The agency was supported by set-aside funds and, in recent years, by amounts from other sources. In FY2015, however, AHRQ received a discretionary appropriation for the first time in more than a decade in lieu of receiving any set-aside funding. That continues to be the case in FY2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Funding, User Fees, and Collections", "paragraphs": ["Although the bulk of PHS agency funding is provided through annual discretionary appropriations, agencies also receive mandatory funding, user fees, and third-party collections.

A few PHS agencies continue to receive these funds, which are itemized in the funding tables in this report.", "The ACA also established and funded three multibillion dollar trust funds to help support PHS agency programs and activities. First, the ACA provided a total of $11 billion in annual appropriations over the five-year period FY2011-FY2015 to the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) . These funds help support the federal health centers program and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), both of which are administered by HRSA. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) appropriated two more years of funding for the CHCF; a total of $3.910 billion for each of FY2016 and FY2017. A table summarizing each fiscal year's CHCF appropriation and the allocation of funds appears in Appendix A .", "Second, the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) , for which the ACA provided a permanent annual appropriation, is intended to support prevention, wellness, and other public health programs and activities. To date, CDC has received the majority of PPHF funds, while AHRQ, HRSA, and SAMHSA have received smaller amounts. The HHS Secretary transferred almost half of the FY2013 PPHF funds to CMS to support ACA implementation. A table showing the allocation of annual PPHF funding by agency since FY2010 is provided in Appendix B .", "Finally, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) is supporting comparative effectiveness research over a 10-year period (FY2010-FY2019) with a mix of appropriations\u2014some of which are offset by revenue from a fee imposed on health insurance policies and self-insured health plans\u2014and transfers from the Medicare Part A and Part B trust funds. A portion of the PCORTF is allocated for AHRQ. More information on the PCORTF, including the appropriation and transfer formulas, is provided in Appendix C .", "In addition to the ACA funding, HRSA, CDC, and IHS each receive mandatory funds from other sources.

Since PDUFA's enactment, Congress has created several other FDA user fee programs. These programs provide FDA with additional resources that allow it to hire more personnel and expedite the process of reviewing new product applications. Some user fees also pay for information technology infrastructure and postmarket surveillance of FDA-approved products. FDA's user fee programs now support the agency's regulation of prescription drugs, animal drugs, medical devices, tobacco products, and some foods, among other activities. The amount of user fees that FDA collects under these programs has increased steadily since PDUFA was enacted, both in absolute terms and as a share of FDA's overall budget.

The BCA established enforceable discretionary spending limits, or caps, for defense and nondefense spending for each of FY2012 through FY2021, and provided for further annual spending reductions equally divided between the categories of defense and nondefense spending beginning in FY2013. Within each spending category, those further reductions are allocated proportionately to discretionary spending and mandatory spending, subject to certain exemptions and special rules.

First, the funds for the CDC-administered Vaccines for Children program come from Medicaid, which is exempt from sequestration. Second, CDC funding for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) and the World Trade Center Health Program also are exempt from sequestration.

The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, administered by HRSA, is one example of a program for which this occurred. The ACA authorized the home visiting program and funded it through FY2014 (see Table 7 ). Pursuant to the BCA, the President ordered the FY2015 sequestration on March 10, 2014.
