The DHS lists 322 \"chemicals of interest\" and screening threshold quantities for each chemical to determine the need to comply with CFATS. The DHS considers each chemical in the context of three threats: release; theft or diversion; and sabotage and contamination.

Facilities possessing at least 2,000 pounds of transportable fertilizer mixture containing at least 33% ammonium nitrate are potentially high-risk facilities and must participate in the CFATS regulations.

RMPs summarize the potential threat of unanticipated emissions into the ambient air of certain dangerous chemicals and facilities' plans to prevent such releases and mitigate any damage.

These policy issues include the challenges arising from relying on reporting of chemical inventories by regulated facilities; the potential for omission and duplication in existing regulatory reporting; the long intervals between inspection at many such facilities; the ability of federal, state, and local government agencies to share information effectively among themselves; and public and first-responder access to regulatory information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenges from Reporting by Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Congressional policymakers might consider mechanisms to address the data quality issues arising from reporting by facilities. Regulatory programs often require facilities to report their chemical holdings, but such reporting creates the potential for the regulatory agency to be unaware if the facility does not report. This may be especially true for federal agencies that rely on state or local implementation of federal requirements. In addition, the quality of such information may be questioned due to its self-reported nature. For example, the Government Accountability Office has found that DHS does not use self-reported vulnerability assessment information in determining the security risk at chemical facilities. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Harmonized Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Because different chemicals often have different reporting requirements, regulated entities often report different information to different regulating agencies. For example, as noted above, DHS, EPA, and state regulatory agencies receive different information; each chemical may fall under some, all, or no regulatory requirements due to particular exclusions or exemptions. Consequently, no central overview of facility chemical holdings exists, and may create the potential for inefficient regulation. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inspection Rate", "paragraphs": ["Interested Members of Congress might focus upon the rate of inspection under the various regulatory programs. Under some federal programs, inspection has not occurred at a pace expected by policymakers. For example, the DHS stated that it had inspected and approved site security plan implementation at 166 of 4,298 facilities regulated under CFATS as of July 2013. In 2009, the EPA Office of Inspector General reported that EPA had inspected less than half of the EPA-identified high-risk facilities and less than 35% of all facilities reporting under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. Inspection of facilities reporting their chemical holdings may increase the trustworthiness of supplied information. Also, regular inspection may yield benefits in enhanced compliance with best practices and regulatory adherence. Of course, increased inspection relies upon a substantial inspector cadre, which would require additional appropriations for support. Similarly, delegation of inspection responsibilities for federal programs to state agencies might reduce the number of discrete inspections but increase the costs borne by those states. Conversely, additional efficiency might be achieved with a cross-trained inspectorate that might inspect a facility under all, or most, applicable regulatory regimes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ability of Government Agencies to Share Information Effectively", "paragraphs": ["Congressional policymakers have identified information sharing in the homeland security and intelligence context as a high priority following the events of September 11, 2001. The reported gap in information between EPA, which knew of the West Fertilizer Company's existence and its anhydrous ammonia holdings, and DHS, which did not, indicates a potential gap in information sharing among federal regulators. Similarly, information possessed by the state of Texas, which knew of the West Fertilizer Company's ammonium nitrate holdings, apparently did not reach DHS. The DHS has detailed some of its information sharing activities, including sharing CFATS-regulated facility information with federal, state, and local partners, and is reinvigorating its coordination with EPA and review of EPA RMP data to identify facilities that may have failed to submit information under CFATS. Increased information sharing may also raise concern among industry stakeholders regarding the potential for inadvertent release of proprietary information due to the effects of aggregation and the increased need to transmit such information between different entities. President Obama issued an executive order on improving chemical facility safety and security, which would aim to enhance federal agency coordination and information sharing, among other activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Access to Information", "paragraphs": ["Congressional policymakers have long been interested in the balance between providing public access to information regarding chemical hazards and limiting the potential for malicious use of such information. Reporting under EPA regulation is intended to improve accident planning through increasing community and first-responder awareness of the potential for release of hazardous materials. First responders receive some of this information directly and residents of the surrounding community may obtain access to it. In contrast, DHS restricts information dissemination regarding security efforts at chemical facilities, partly in order to limit the ability of malicious actors to use such information for targeting purposes. The extent to which the residents and first responders of West, TX, knew of the potential hazards may provide insights into this balance and the effectiveness of community outreach efforts."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
