Iraqis differ strongly on a number of key issues, including the proper role and powers of federal and regional authorities in regulating oil and gas development; the terms and extent of potential foreign participation in the oil and gas sectors; and proposed formulas and mechanisms for equitably sharing oil and gas revenue. Concurrent, related discussions about the administrative status of the city of Kirkuk and proposed amendments to articles of Iraq's constitution that outline federal and regional oil and gas rights also are highly contentious.", "Both the Bush Administration and the 110th Congress considered the passage of oil and gas sector framework and revenue-sharing legislation as important benchmarks that would indicate the Iraqi government's commitment to promoting political reconciliation and providing a solid foundation for long-term economic development in Iraq. Obama Administration officials and some Members of the 111th Congress have expressed similar views. In the absence of new comprehensive legislation to manage the energy sector and distribute energy export revenues, interim revenue-sharing mechanisms have been implemented, while both the national government and the Kurdistan Regional Government have signed oil and natural gas contracts with foreign firms.", "The central importance of oil and gas revenue for the Iraqi economy is widely recognized by Iraqis, and most groups accept the need to create new legal and policy guidelines for the development of the country's oil and natural gas resources. However, Iraq's current Council of Representatives (parliament) did not take action to consider proposed energy sector reform legislation because of broader political disputes. Observers and U.S. officials remain focused on the outcome of the March 2010 Iraqi national election as an indicator of future trends.", "In January 2010, the Council of Representatives adopted Iraq's 2010 budget, which includes a deficit of more than $19 billion because of increased spending and stagnant oil production and export levels in Iraq. The budget also includes a controversial revenue distribution mechanism that will reward specific energy resource producing governorates. Iraq has secured a $3.6 billion stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a total of $500 million in loans from the World Bank to cover a portion of the expected 2010 deficit, as U.S. officials continue to warn that reduced revenues and spending may jeopardize Iraqi investments in infrastructure and security forces needed to fully stabilize the country.", "The military strategy employed by U.S. forces in Iraq has sought to create a secure environment in which Iraqis can resolve core political differences as a means of ensuring national stability and security. However, it remains to be seen whether proposed oil and gas legislation and ongoing interim efforts to develop Iraq's energy resources will promote reconciliation or contribute to deeper political tension. U.S. policymakers and Members of Congress thus face difficult choices with regard to engaging Iraqis on various policy proposals, related constitutional reforms, and oil and natural gas development contracts, while encouraging Iraqi counterparts to ensure that the content of proposed laws, amendments, and contracts reflects acceptable political compromises.

The nationalization of Iraq's oil resources and production was complete by 1975. From 1975 to 2003, Iraq's oil production and export facilities were entirely state operated. However, from the early 1980s until the toppling of Saddam Hussein's government in 2003, the country's hydrocarbon infrastructure suffered from the negative effects of war, international sanctions, a lack of investment and technology, and, in some cases, mismanagement and corruption. Iraq's highest-ever production level of 3.5 million barrels per day (mbd) was reached in 1990 immediately prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Damage during the 1991 Gulf War and subsequent international sanctions limited overall production and exports until 2003 and beyond.", "According to the Oil and Gas Journal , Iraq has 115 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the world's third-largest after Saudi Arabia and Iran. Other estimates of Iraq's potential oil reserves vary, and the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) notes that current estimates \"have not been revised since 2001 and are largely based on 2-D [two-dimensional] seismic data from nearly three decades ago.\" Given the relative abundance of oil resources in Iraq and the relative ease with which Iraqi oil is extracted, many observers expect that new exploration using advanced technology will reveal further reserves, although estimates of potential additional reserves vary considerably. Many oil industry professionals consider Iraq to have the world's largest, potentially most productive reserves that are not yet fully developed. Iraq's current proven reserves are concentrated (65% or more) in southern Iraq, particularly in the southernmost governorate of Al Basrah. Large proven oil resources also are located in the northern governorate of Al Tamim near the disputed city of Kirkuk.

However, the current export level of 1.97 mbd remains below the March 2003 level and the 2010 budget target of 2.10 mbd (see Table 1 , below). At present, crude oil is the source of over 90% of Iraq's domestic energy consumption, and, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), oil exports generate approximately 85% of Iraq's government revenue. Declines in global oil prices from their 2008 high and reduced oil production led Iraqi leaders to amend their 2009 and 2010 revenue and budget assumptions from projected surpluses to projected consecutive $15 billion deficits. The IMF expects Iraq's budget \"to record significant, albeit declining deficits\" in 2010 and 2011, \"before returning to a surplus position in 2012.\" Official U.S. assessments stress that continued fluctuations in oil prices and production may jeopardize Iraq's fiscal stability and the sustainability of its reconstruction and development plans, with uncertain follow-on effects on the economy and security.", "Compared to other top oil producers, Iraq's current total output makes a significant contribution to global oil supplies. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), as of October 2009, Iraq's total production of 2.4 mbd accounted for nearly 3% of global supply and made Iraq the world's 11 th -largest oil producer (see Table 2 , below). Current Iraqi plans call for the expansion of oil production to 4 mbd by 2013 and then upward to 6 mbd by 2017. In December 2009, Iraq's Minister of Oil Hussein Shahristani stated that \"any increase will not be seen before 2011.\" International firms are not expected to begin to make investments and carry out substantial infrastructure work under the terms of recently agreed technical service contracts until after the Iraqi elections scheduled for March 2010.

Subsequent negotiations between Iraq and prospective foreign partners yielded more compatible fee offers from the international oil companies (IOCs), and several first round field contracts were initialed in late 2009. The second bidding round in December 2009 resulted in more closely aligned Iraqi offers and foreign bids, with many IOCs submitting highly competitive bids and proposing higher production volume pledges than Iraqi officials expected.

The KRG opposes proposals to require federal approval of its existing or future contracts, but notes that it is committed to revenue sharing as defined in the constitution (see below) and draft revenue-sharing legislation that has been considered to date. In May 2009, the national Ministry of Oil agreed to allow the KRG to export a limited quantity of oil using the national oil pipeline infrastructure from two fields, Tawke and Taq Taq, for which PSCs were signed prior to February 2007.

In practice, differing interpretations of the constitution since that time drive an ongoing political impasse over oil issues that has prevented the adoption of comprehensive national oil legislation to date. Iraqi Kurds, acting through the KRG, initially demanded the right to sign oil development deals without national government interference, while the national government has proceeded with a technical service contract bidding process that some critics argue is unconstitutional. Baghdad officials also have had to address popular nationalist concerns about the participation of foreign firms in Iraq's energy sector and have sought to do so by using a technical service contract model, by requiring joint venture participation for Iraq's state-owned oil firms, and by offering conservative payment terms to international partners.

KRG officials in turn argue that the Baghdad government is responsible for paying the foreign partners because the exports use national pipeline infrastructure and the oil ultimately belongs to the Iraqi people. In October 2009, KRG officials halted oil production for export in KRG territory pending a resolution of the payment dispute. In January 2010, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki indicated a willingness to resolve the dispute, and KRG officials offered to restart oil exports from KRG controlled fields if the national government reserved a portion of the proceeds of the sale to compensate the KRG's foreign partners.

Draft Hydrocarbon Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Hydrocarbon Framework Law", "Beginning in mid-2006, a three-member Oil and Energy Committee working under the auspices of the Iraqi cabinet prepared draft hydrocarbon framework legislation to regulate Iraq's oil and gas sector. A political negotiating committee subsequently edited their draft. Following approval by the negotiating committee, Iraq's Council of Ministers (cabinet) approved a draft version of the hydrocarbon framework law in February 2007. Subsequent negotiations among Iraqi leaders sought to clarify the responsibilities of federal and regional authorities as well as contracting procedures for oil fields. On July 3, 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki announced that the Council of Ministers had approved a final version of the framework law and had forwarded the bill to the Council of Representatives for consideration.", "The Council of Ministers' Shoura Council reportedly amended provisions of the bill to ensure their consistency with provisions of the Iraqi constitution. However, Kurdish officials protested the changes, arguing that they are substantive, rather than semantic, and have tentatively withdrawn their support for the legislation. The boycott of cabinet and parliamentary proceedings by various Iraqi entities at the time of the cabinet's approval of the law added to the controversy surrounding the proposed legislation. ", "As of November 2009, statements from Iraqi government officials and members of the Council of Representatives suggest that parliamentary consideration of the legislation continues to be delayed by disagreements between key political figures and likely will be delayed until the election of a new parliament in national elections scheduled for early 2010. The Council of Ministers reportedly is considering new draft legislation, but no timetable has been announced for its consideration. Skepticism about the performance of Oil Minister Shahristani appears to be significant within the Council of Representatives, as is opposition to the conduct of the investment bidding round conducted in July 2009 and to contracts signed by the Kurdistan Regional Government. As such the applicability of the compromises reached prior to the announcement of draft legislation may be in doubt. ", "Note: The following analysis applies to draft legislation released in 2007 and may require substantial revision if new draft legislation emerges from the Council of Ministers in the coming weeks and months or under a new government elected in 2010.", "Federal Oil and Gas Council", "The central element of the draft hydrocarbon framework legislation is the creation of a Federal Oil and Gas Council (FOGC) to determine all national oil and gas sector policies and plans, including those governing exploration, development, and transportation. The FOGC would become the most powerful body in Iraq's oil sector, with the power to review all contracts, and would operate according to a two-thirds majority decision-making system. The seats on the FOGC are reserved for specific cabinet members, representatives of constitutionally recognized regional governments, hydrocarbon experts, and \"producing governorates.\" A \"Panel of Independent Experts,\" open to Iraqi and foreign membership, would work with the FOGC in a non-binding, advisory capacity. The possibility that foreign energy experts or industry representatives could be chosen to participate on this panel has alarmed some Iraqis and foreign observers.", "Although the draft law stipulates that the formation of the FOGC \"shall take into consideration a fair representation of the basic components of the Iraqi society,\" some observers have warned that the makeup of the FOGC specified in the draft law could potentially contribute to sectarian or regional tensions. Given the potential for the majority Shiite Arab community to directly or indirectly control the makeup of Iraq's cabinet in Iraq's democratic system and the ineligibility of Sunni Arab governorates to qualify for FOGC seats based on the other specified terms, some Sunni Arabs fear their interests may not be adequately represented in the powerful council. Other Iraqis may be encouraged to seek constitutionally recognized regional status in order to ensure their representation in the council.", "Contract Type(s)", "The draft hydrocarbon framework law establishes several criteria that future \"exploration and production contracts\" must meet. The criteria are designed to preserve Iraqi control and maximize the country's economic return. The draft law does not mandate the use of so-called \"production-sharing agreements\" as the sole model contract for future oil development in Iraq. The law states that contract holders may be given exclusive rights to exploration, development, production, and marketing of Iraqi oil for specified periods, subject to approval of the contract and a field development plan by Iraqi authorities. The law also outlines general terms and conditions for evaluating contracts and development plans designed to preserve the Iraqi government's sovereign control of oil production, economic returns to Iraq, and \"appropriate returns\" to potential investors. The FOGC's Panel of Independent Experts would use these criteria to evaluate contracts signed by the Kurdistan Regional Government since 2003, and the Ministry of Oil, and the FOGC would use the criteria to evaluate contracts signed by the former regime with international oil companies (Article 40).", "The contract provisions of the law have attracted significant attention because they would allow foreign participation and therefore represent, in principle, a reversal of the nationalization of Iraq's oil sector. The specific details of model contracts developed by Iraqis and the terms of specific individual contracts negotiated between Iraq and potential foreign partners would determine the type of foreign participation and the specific long-term revenue benefits to Iraq or foreign companies. The draft hydrocarbon framework law does not mandate a specific form of contract or predetermine specific contract terms or details. The FOGC would develop model contracts for use in Iraqi oil and gas fields and evaluate agreements with foreign participants according to the stated criteria and the model contracts. According to Revenue Watch Middle East director Yahia Said, \"the aim of this law from beginning was to promote foreign investment in Iraq's oil sector. Yet while the law opens the door for foreign companies, there are careful, deliberate mechanisms in place to maintain control in the hands of national government.\"", "Petroleum Revenues and Sharing Arrangements", "The draft hydrocarbon framework law states that Iraq's oil wealth belongs to all of its citizens, as reflected in the Iraqi constitution. However, the draft legislation does not contain specific guidelines or mechanisms for revenue sharing. The draft would create two funds for oil revenues: the first, an \"Oil Revenue Fund,\" and the second, a \"Future Fund\" to hold an unspecified percentage of oil revenue for long-term development goals. Both funds would be regulated and administered according to terms specified in separate federal revenue legislation.", "Regional Authority and Oil Field Management Annexes", "Constitutionally recognized regional authorities would automatically qualify for seats on the FOGC under the terms of the draft oil sector legislation. The draft law originally was structured to grant regional authorities licensing powers with regard to oil fields specified in four annexes, subject to the terms of the draft law and in conjunction with the plans and procedures of the FOGC. Official versions of the draft annexes were not published. However, Kurdish representatives made several public statements following an April 2007 conference in Dubai expressing their opposition to the draft annexes and threatening to withdraw support for the legislative package in the Council of Representatives. The annexes reportedly were dropped from the draft legislation prior to its approval by the cabinet. Under the new arrangement\u2014allegedly designed to meet demands of Kurdish negotiators\u2014the management of specific oil fields would be decided by the members of the FOGC.", "Draft Revenue-sharing Law", "Article 112 of the Iraqi constitution sets qualitative criteria for the distribution of oil and gas revenues and requires the Iraqi parliament to pass a law regulating revenue distribution. In February 2007, some officials in Baghdad and Washington indicated that a broad agreement to share oil revenues among regions based on population had been reached. However, Iraqi leaders continued to negotiate the terms of the draft revenue-sharing law through June 2007. In line with the constitutional requirement, a separate draft revenue-sharing law has been prepared as a component of the hydrocarbon legislative package currently under consideration.", "According to a draft of the revenue-sharing law published by the Kurdistan Regional Government on June 20, 2007, the federal government would be empowered to collect all oil and gas revenue, with the stipulation that all funds be deposited into external and internal accounts based on their source. The federal government would have priority to allocate the funds in the accounts to support national priorities such as defense and foreign affairs, \"provided that this does not impact the balance and needs of the governments of the Regions and the Governorates which are not organized in a region.\" The remainder of the accounts would be distributed to regions and governorates automatically, on a monthly basis, based on agreed population-density-based percentages until a census can be completed. The Kurdistan Regional Government would receive a 17% share of the remaining funds deposited in two accounts at the Central Bank of Iraq branch in Irbil. No specific provision is made in the draft for addressing requirements to meet the needs of \"damaged regions\" as required by Article 112 of the constitution.", "The draft revenue law also would create a \"Commission of Monitoring the Federal Financial Resources\" composed of central government officials, experts, and representatives of each region and governorate. The Commission would monitor deposits and allocations from the central revenue fund, in addition to facilitating international audits and producing monthly, quarterly, and annual transparency reports. Article 7 of the draft revenue law reiterates the call for the establishment of a \"Future Fund\" for surplus revenue, but states that the operation of such a fund should be defined in a separate piece of legislation following further negotiation among federal, regional, and governorate representatives.", "Ministry of Oil and Iraq National Oil Company Laws", "The final two components of the hydrocarbon legislative package are proposed laws that will reorganize Iraq's Ministry of Oil and establish an Iraqi National Oil Company (INOC). Under the hydrocarbon framework law, the responsibilities and authorities of the Ministry of Oil and the INOC would be altered significantly, and the draft Ministry and INOC laws are necessary to ensure proper oversight, accountability, and separation of powers between the two entities. As of November 2009, a draft INOC law had been approved by the Council of Ministers, but was not considered by the Council of Representatives before the 2010 national election."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
