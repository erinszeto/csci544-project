Attempts at democratic rule have been intermittent and only partially successful. In 1991, a military coup interrupted the first term of Haiti's first democratically-elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide; the threat of a U.S. military intervention allowed him to return three years later and finish his term.

Five years later, in 2001, Aristide was re- elected. Political conflict led to the collapse of his government in 2004, which was followed by an interim government. Charges of corruption against Aristide, dissolution of the parliament by Pr\u00e9val in his first term, questions of the interim government's legitimacy, and flawed elections under all of them contributed to their inability to establish a fully accepted or functioning government.

The fundamental inequality of Haitian society has remained basically unchanged, though, and Haiti remains the poorest country in the hemisphere.

During his first three years in office, Pr\u00e9val has established relative internal political stability. He outlined two main missions for his government: (1) to build institutions, and (2) to establish favorable conditions for private investment in order to create jobs. In November 2007, his Administration published its Poverty Reduction Strategy, a key step in meeting IMF requirements for debt relief. International donors pledged more than $1.5 billion in economic assistance to Haiti. With the support of the MINUSTAH, which arrived in Haiti in 2004, security conditions have improved and reform of the country's police force has begun. Former President George W.

Without a Prime Minister, Haiti could not sign certain agreements with foreign donors or implement programs to address the crisis for over four months.

The Congress passed the law in May, but it does not become law until the President signs it. Some critics believe he is bowing to pressure from textile manufacturers to delay the bill's implementation. The average daily wage for textile assembly workers is $5.25, above the new minimum wage. Some manufacturers, noting that they would have to raise wages proportionally, had asked for a gradual implementation of the law so that they could negotiate new contracts incorporating the new wages into their costs.

One-third of the Senate is elected every two years; the Senate has operated with only one-third of its members for about a year and a half, as unrest, hurricanes, and divisions with the electoral council delayed elections for the other two-thirds. Pr\u00e9val dissolved the electoral council last year and formed a new one. ", "Since then, technical preparations for the elections went well, but the process was fraught with political tensions. The provisional electoral council, with the support of MINUSTAH and donors, completed the election preparation, including voter registration, ballot printing, and training of election workers. But the council also caused controversy by barring former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party from participating for mostly technical reasons. Part of the problem is that two rival factions submitted separate lists of candidates. The council rejected both lists because neither faction had documents signed by the party's head, Aristide. Aristide lives in exile in South Africa. Although technically correct, some observers felt the decision had a politically motivated element, to prevent the once powerful Lavalas from gaining more seats. A UN Security Council delegation in Haiti praised the Lavalas party for seeking a reversal of the decision through legal means, and urged a resolution to the impasse to avoid yet another electoral crisis, of which Haiti has had many in the last couple of decades.

About 4,000 electoral security workers and 6,500 UN peacekeepers helped maintain order on election day. The process was relatively peaceful, but protests and the shooting of a poll official led the government to cancel the vote in one rural department. Apathy, the boycott, and the closing of public transportation out of concern for security contributed to extremely low voter turnout, averaging 11% nationwide. Only one candidate won a majority of the vote, so a runoff vote is scheduled to be held on June 21. A clash between the ruling party and an opposition party, the Struggling People's Organization, OPL, resulted in the death of one person, increasing concerns about violence around the elections. Opposition parties have filed claims of voting fraud, and at least four have vowed to vote against seating the winners of the elections.

Lespwa currently controls one-third of the chamber's seats. Lespwa candidates in the runoff could give the party five to nine more seats. Pr\u00e9val hopes such wins would give him the support he needs in Parliament to pass constitutional reforms and support his economic agenda. Lingering disputes over the elections could dampen that support, however. In addition, several members of Parliament have defected recently from the coalition. He also wishes to strengthen the executive, which some in Parliament oppose. ", "Elections for the Chamber of Deputies are due to be held in 2010.

Over the past 40 years, Haiti's per capita real GDP has declined by 30%. Therefore, economic growth, even if it is greater than population growth, is not expected to be enough to reduce poverty.

Economic growth for FY2007 was 3.2%, the highest rate since the 1990s, but the forecasted growth for FY2008-2009 is only 1.9%, reflecting the impact of recent storms and the global economic crisis.

Haiti has the second largest income disparity in the world. Over 68% of the total national income accrues to the wealthiest 20% of the population, while less than 1.5% of Haiti's national income is accumulated by the poorest 20% of the population.

To help it do this, the Haitian government requested a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment that was published in November 2008. Damages and losses were estimated at almost $900 million ($897.39 million). The greatest damage was done to agricultural production, with almost $200 million in damages and losses, and housing, with about $180 million in damages and losses.
