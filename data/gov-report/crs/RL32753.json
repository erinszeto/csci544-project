If the local educational agency (LEA) seeks to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, either on an interim basis or on a long-term basis (except for a 10-day suspension), a manifestation determination review must be conducted to determine whether the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability, or was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the individualized education program (IEP).

This act is the first reauthorization of IDEA since 1997 and, although the new law preserves the basic structure of IDEA, it also makes significant changes in the law. Some of the most controversial changes were made regarding the discipline of children with disabilities.", "Generally under IDEA a child with a disability is not immune from disciplinary procedures; however, these procedures are not identical to those for children without disabilities.

For example, the 2004 reauthorization adds to the provisions that allow a school to place a child with a disability in an interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 school days by including a child who has inflicted serious bodily injury on another person.", "The concept of a manifestation determination, a procedure to determine whether or not the behavior of a child with a disability was caused by the child's disability, is kept in P.L. 108-446 . However, the manner in which such a determination is made is changed by the new law. Changes are also made regarding the placement of a child with a disability when a parent or LEA disagrees with any decision regarding placement or the manifestation determination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of IDEA's Discipline Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The manner in which children with disabilities can be disciplined may seem quite complex, but the logic involved is much more apparent when IDEA's history is examined. IDEA was originally enacted in 1975 as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, P.L. 94-142 . The primary motive for its enactment was the fact that children with disabilities often failed to receive an education or received an inappropriate education. This lack of education gave rise to numerous judicial decisions, notably PARC v. State of Pennsylvania, and Mills v. Board of Education of the District of Columbia . These decisions found constitutional infirmities with the lack of education for children with disabilities when the states were providing education for children without disabilities. As a result, the states were under considerable pressure to provide such services, and they lobbied Congress to assist them.", "In enacting P.L. 94-142 , Congress provided grants to the states to help pay for education for children with disabilities and also delineated specific requirements the states must follow in order to receive these federal funds. These requirements did not contain a discipline provision per se but rather contained a requirement that if there is a dispute between the school and the parents of a child with a disability, the child \"stays put\" in his or her current educational placement until the dispute is resolved using the due process procedures set forth in the statute. The concept of \"stay put\" was placed in the statute to help eliminate the then common discriminatory practice of expelling children with disabilities from school. A revised \"stay put\" provision remains as law in the current version of IDEA.", "Issues relating to children with disabilities who exhibited violent or inappropriate behavior have been raised for a number of years. In 1988, the question of whether there was an implied exception to the stay put rule was presented to the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe . Honig involved emotionally disturbed children one of whom had choked another student with sufficient force to leave abrasions on the child's neck and who had kicked out a window while he was being escorted to the principal's office. The other child in the Honig case had been involved in stealing, extorting money and making lewd comments. The school had sought expulsion, but the Supreme Court disagreed finding that \"Congress very much meant to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students, particularly emotionally disturbed students, from school.\" However, the Court observed that this holding did \"not leave educators hamstrung....Where a student poses an immediate threat to the safety of others, officials may temporarily suspend him or her for up to 10 school days....And in those cases in which the parents of a truly dangerous child adamantly refuse to permit any change in placement, the 10-day respite gives school officials an opportunity to invoke the aid of the courts under section 1415(e)(2), which empowers courts to grant any appropriate relief.\" This statement about the school's right to seek judicial relief has come to be known as a Honig injunction.", "The Supreme Court's interpretation of IDEA in Honig did not quell all concerns about discipline and children with disabilities. In 1994, Congress amended IDEA's stay put provision to give schools the unilateral authority to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting if the child was determined to have brought a firearm to school. This provision was expanded upon in the IDEA Amendments of 1997 to include weapons, not just firearms, and drugs and is further expanded in the 2004 reauthorization to include situations where a student has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school.", "The Department of Education (ED) had received numerous questions from schools about discipline and in 1995 issued a memorandum discussing numerous discipline issues including the use of manifestation determinations. If a school sought to suspend or expel a child with a disability for more than 10 days, the school must first make a \"manifestation determination,\" a determination concerning whether the student's misconduct was related to his or her disability. If the behavior was not related to the disability, the school could suspend or expel for more than 10 days but must continue to provide education services. If the behavior was related to the disability, the school must give notice of any recommended change in placement and, if the parent objected, the parent could invoke the stay put provision. The Department found that Honig injunctions, court orders to change the placement of a child with a disability, were proper when a school believed that maintaining the child in his or her current placement was \"substantially likely to result in injury to the student or others.\" The concept of a manifestation determination was placed in statutory language in 1997 by P.L. 105-17 as was the regulatory interpretation that educational services cannot cease for children with disabilities even if they have been suspended or expelled. Both of these provisions are kept in P.L. 108-446 , but the manifestation determination and the stay put on appeals provisions are amended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discipline Provisions in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of Disciplinary Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Generally, under P.L. 108-446 a child with a disability is not immune from disciplinary procedures; however, these procedures are not identical to those for children without disabilities.

The Senate bill, S. 1248 , 108 th Cong., contained an approach similar to that of previous law but attempted to \"make it simpler, easier to administer, and more fair to all students.\" Under final enacted law, if a child with a disability commits an action that would be subject to discipline, school personnel have several options. These include", "removing a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from her current placement to another setting or suspension for up to 10 school days. placing the child in an interim alternative education setting for up to 45 school days for situations involving weapons, drugs, or if the student has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school. asking a hearing officer to order a child be placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days if the hearing officer determines that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.", "School officials may also seek a Honig injunction as discussed previously if they are unable to reach agreement with a student's parents and they feel that the new statutory provisions are not sufficient.", "If the local educational agency seeks to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, a manifestation determination review must be conducted.

However, in the comments to the regulations, ED did observe that certain factors, such as a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, expression of remorse, and supports provided to the child prior to the violation, could be unique circumstances. The regulations also state in part that the ability of school personnel to remove a child with a disability is to be applied \"to the extent those alternatives are applied to children without disabilities\" and as long as the removals do not constitute a change in placement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Ten School Day Rule", "paragraphs": ["School personnel may remove a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct from his current placement to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension for not more than 10 school days. These options are to be applied to the same extent that they would be applied to children without disabilities. The 10-day rule was added to IDEA in 1997 and codified what was existing practice. The Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe , supra, had allowed 10-day suspensions under prior law. The 2004 reauthorization reworded the provision and changed 10 days to 10 school days. It should be noted that the time limitations regarding disciplinary procedures generally refer to school days, not days. Thus, the new law adds additional time to the 10-day rule and to other provisions where the term \"school day\" is used.", "The regulations state that where a child has been removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year, and the current removal is for not more than 10 consecutive school days and is not a change of placement, school personnel, in consultation with the child's teacher or teachers, determine the extent to which services are needed so as to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum. The regulations also provide that a child subject to this removal must continue to receive educational services \"as provided in \u00a7300.101(a),\" which is the regulatory provision guaranteeing FAPE. ED commented:", "[W]hile children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive FAPE, we believe the Act modifies the concept of FAPE in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP. An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline. However, the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum, and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child's IEP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interim Alternative Educational Settings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Removal to an Interim Alternative Educational Setting", "paragraphs": ["P.L. 108-446 provides that school personnel may remove a student to an interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 school days in situations involving weapons or drugs, or where the student has inflicted serious bodily injury on another person.

The IDEA statute is silent on this issue, and ED declined to address it in the regulations. However, ED did observe that the burden of proof in IDEA proceedings was at issue in Schaffer v. Weast , a recent Supreme Court decision. The Court held there that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is on the party seeking relief.

The rationale for this provision was to ensure that children with disabilities were not excluded from receiving an education while a parent disputed issues relating to the provision of a free appropriate public education.
