Examples include meat and poultry processing standards to reduce pathogens, residue limits for pesticides in foods, and regulation of agricultural biotechnology. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) cover technical regulations, product standards, environmental regulations, and voluntary procedures relating to human health and animal welfare. Examples include trademarks and patents, labeling and packaging requirements, certification and inspection procedures, product specifications, and marketing of biotechnology. SPS and TBT measures both comprise a group of widely divergent standards and standards-based measures that countries use to regulate markets, protect their consumers, and preserve natural resources.", "According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), SPS and TBT measures have become more prominent concerns for agricultural exporters and policy makers, as tariff-related barriers to trade have been reduced by various multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations and trade agreements. The concerns include whether SPS and TBT measures might be used to unfairly discriminate against imported products or create unnecessary obstacles to trade in agricultural, food, and other traded goods. Notable U.S. trade disputes involving SPS and TBT measures have included a European Union (EU) ban on U.S. meats treated with growth-promoting hormones and also certain pathogen reduction treatments, and an EU moratorium on approvals of biotechnology products, among other types of trade concerns with other countries. Foreign countries have also objected to various U.S. trade measures.", "Multilateral trade rules allow governments to adopt measures to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, provided such measures do not discriminate or use them as disguised protectionism. This principle was clarified in the mid-1990s by WTO members' approval of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (\"SPS Agreement\"). The SPS Agreement sets out the basic rules for ensuring that each country's food safety and animal and plant health laws and regulations are transparent, scientifically defensible, and fair. Similarly, in the late 1970s, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (\"TBT Agreement\") addressed the use of technical requirements and voluntary standards for a range of traded goods.", "In addition, the United States has entered into, or is currently negotiating, numerous regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) that contain SPS and TBT language. In an effort to resolve perceived intractable trade problems regarding SPS and TBT matters, many in U.S. agriculture and the food industry are supporting efforts to build on and go beyond rules, rights, and obligations in the SPS Agreement and TBT Agreement, as well as beyond commitments in existing U.S. FTAs. The U.S. meat and poultry industry initially proposed efforts to adopt tougher WTO rules for animal health regulations as part of the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. These concepts were later reinforced by recommendations from U.S. and EU trade officials involved in the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations. These efforts are referred to as WTO-Plus rules, SPS-Plus, and TBT-Plus rules.", "In Congress, which must approve legislation if a trade agreement is to be implemented, many Members are interested in how a trade agreement might address SPS and TBT matters. Many remain concerned that countries are turning to non-tariff measures, such as SPS and TBT measures, to protect their farmers from import competition. U.S. rights and obligations regarding SPS and TBT measures are also relevant to regulations affecting imported food."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures are laws, regulations, standards, and procedures that governments employ as \"necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health\" from the risks associated with the spread of pests, diseases, or disease-carrying and causing organisms, or from additives, toxins, or contaminants in food, beverages, or feedstuffs. SPS measures are designed to protect animals and plants from diseases and pests, and to protect humans from animal- and plant-borne diseases and pests, and foodborne risks. Examples include specific product or processing standards, requirements for products to be produced in disease-free areas, quarantine and inspection procedures, sampling and testing requirements, residue limits for pesticides and drugs in foods, and prohibitions on certain food additives.

TBTs in agriculture include SPS measures, but also include other types of measures related to health and quality standards, testing, registration, and certification requirements, as well as packaging and labeling regulations.

Overall, SPS/TBT measures comprise a group of widely divergent standards and standards-based measures that countries use to regulate markets, protect their consumers, and preserve natural resources, but that can also be used to discriminate against imports in favor of domestic products. Specific examples in agriculture include meat and poultry processing standards to reduce pathogens, residue limits for pesticides in foods, fumigation requirements for grains and wood packaging materials to kill pests, labeling and marketing standards, food safety protocols, and regulation of agricultural biotechnology. This has resulted in a variety of formal trade disputes as well as ongoing trade concerns between the United States and its trading partners. ", "The United States has initiated several formal trade disputes regarding SPS/TBT measures that have been elevated for review and dispute resolution within the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some high-profile trade disputes include U.S. concerns about the European Union's (EU's) ban on U.S. meats from livestock treated with growth-promoting hormones, the EU's restrictions on chemicals used to treat U.S. poultry, and the EU's moratorium on approvals of biotechnology products. Other disputes have involved U.S. complaints about testing and inspection requirements, among other SPS/TBT measures, applied in other countries.

Researchers at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also note that \"food regulation compliance costs have a relatively higher overall economic impact in low income countries than in high-income countries.\"", "A 2009 study suggests that nontariff barriers restrict agricultural trade, and may be more restrictive to trade than import tariffs.

Agricultural goods are estimated to have a higher overall average AVE (44%), compared to manufacturing goods (19%). The overall median AVE estimate is also higher: 20% for agriculture and 6% for manufacturing. Similarly, in 2012, the WTO concluded from a literature review of the estimated trade effects of both tariff and non-tariff measures that non-tariff measures may restrict trade far more than tariffs, and that SPS/TBT measures have a negative effect on agricultural trade, especially export market diversification. Another 2009 study looked at the extent to which certain nontariff barriers may result in higher retail prices for some foods, and concluded that nontariff barriers may substantially raise prices for fruits and vegetables, meat products, and also processed foods. The study also concluded that nontariff measures are generally more restrictive in the European Union, United States, and some South East Asian countries, and less restrictive in some African, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern countries.", "Finally, other available studies have attempted to estimate the economic impact to specific agricultural products from regulations in certain countries. For example, one study estimated the potential gain in Washington State apple exports to selected countries, including China\u2014where it is believed that if SPS barriers were reduced then U.S. apple exports would be greater. The study concluded that apple exports to China could increase by more than 20% if the tariff equivalent of SPS measures imposed in China were to be reduced, which could translate into possible income gains for Washington State apple exporters.

These staff-level discussions often help the importing and exporting parties to clarify their differences, and to determine mutually acceptable conditions for importing the affected product that will not compromise the importing party's safeguards. However, not all problems can be solved in this manner. Eventually, bilateral consultations with the foreign country over an outstanding SPS or TBT issue might be pursued by USTR, with USDA's assistance.
