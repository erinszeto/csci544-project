As the Trump Administration implements its environmental policies, various legal challenges to Obama Administration climate change regulations remain pending before courts. During the last term of the Obama Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration finalized a series of regulations to address emissions from cars, trucks, and their engines that may contribute to climate change. In addition, EPA finalized regulations pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to reduce GHG emissions from stationary sources such as power plants, GHG-emitting oil and gas sources, and landfills. Various stakeholders have challenged a majority of these rules generally contesting the scope of EPA's authority and its methods for regulating GHG emissions.", "In addition to the CAA, other environmental statutes such as the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act require federal agencies to consider climate change in their actions and decisions. The extent to which agencies may consider climate change effects and rely on predictive models, studies, and assumptions, however, has been challenged in court. Federal agencies are also required to consider the cost of GHG emissions in their rulemakings and environmental reviews. As the Trump Administration implements its policies on climate change, stakeholders may sue to ensure compliance with laws and judicial precedent that require consideration of climate change effects or costs.", "Climate change litigation may potentially increase as some stakeholders seek to reduce GHG emissions and address climate change effects. In the past, plaintiffs have had little success in using federal common law nuisance claims to force private entities to reduce their GHG emissions or pay damages for alleged injuries caused by their emissions. In 2011, the Supreme Court determined that these claims were displaced when Congress granted EPA authority to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA. If Congress amends the CAA to remove EPA's authority, plaintiffs may seek to reintroduce these common law nuisance claims. However, they will likely face jurisdictional barriers that may be difficult to overcome.", "Federal courts often do not reach the merits of climate change suits due to threshold procedural and jurisdictional barriers, such as whether a plaintiff or petitioner has the right to bring a lawsuit in the first place or whether the court has jurisdiction over a type of claim. These difficult procedural and jurisdictional barriers are at the center of a recent case claiming that the government has a duty to safeguard certain natural resources for the benefit of the public and that duty compels the government to address climate change.", "This report will cover a brief history of U.S. climate change regulation; review the different types of regulation and legal actions that have been pursued in the national debate over GHGs; examine selected legal issues and next steps in related litigation; and address what these legal and regulatory developments mean for Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["I n 2013, President Obama released a Climate Action Plan (CAP) to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and to encourage adaptation to expected climate change.

Many of these challenges have focused on EPA's authority to regulate GHGs under the CAA.

The Court determined that the CAA authorized EPA to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles because CO 2 and other GHGs \"fit well within the CAA's capacious [and unambiguous] definition of 'air pollutant.'\" Rejecting EPA's argument that the agency could not regulate vehicle GHG emissions because to do so would conflict with the Department of Transportation's (DOT's) fuel economy standards, the Court explained that EPA's statutory obligation to protect public health and welfare under the CAA is \"wholly independent of DOT's mandate to promote energy efficiency.\" In addition, the Court held that CAA Section 202 does not allow EPA to refuse to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles based on policy considerations, but that EPA must regulate GHG emissions if EPA finds that GHGs \"cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" ", "Based on this reasoning, the Court identified three ways EPA could respond to the rulemaking petition: (1) make a finding that motor vehicle GHG emissions may \"endanger public health or welfare\" and issue emissions standards; (2) make a finding that there is no endangerment from these emissions; (3) or provide a \"reasonable explanation\" as to why the Agency cannot or will not make an endangerment finding.

Reading \"air pollutant\" to include GHG emissions in these permit programs, the Court reasoned, creates a staggering administrative workload because of the low emission thresholds that trigger those programs, and the huge number of sources that satisfy those thresholds for CO 2 , the primary GHG. The administrative unwieldiness of demanding PSD and Title V permits for so many sources argued strongly, in the Court's view, against a GHG-inclusive reading of those programs.

Although the OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on how to conduct cost-benefit analysis, it mentions climate change costs only once, with respect to addressing \"uncertain knowledge of how some economic activities might affect future climate change.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Threshold Barriers to Litigation", "paragraphs": ["Federal courts often do not reach the merits of a climate change suit due to threshold procedural barriers, such as whether a plaintiff or petitioner has the right to bring a lawsuit in the first place or whether the court has jurisdiction over a type of claim. \u00a0To proceed to the merits of a case, a plaintiff must establish standing, a procedural threshold that has, at times, posed a difficult hurdle to overcome."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Standing Doctrine", "paragraphs": ["The standing doctrine is derived from Article III of the Constitution, which limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \"cases\" or \"controversies.\" To satisfy the constitutional standing requirements in Article III, the Supreme Court imposes three requirements: (1) the plaintiff must allege a personal injury-in-fact, which is actual or imminent, concrete, and particularized; (2) injury must be \"fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct; and (3) the injury must be \"likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" A plaintiff or petitioner that fails to satisfy any of these elements lacks standing, and the court will dismiss the suit.", "The issue of a state's standing to bring a climate change suit was central to two landmark climate change decisions, Massachusetts v. EPA in the Supreme Court and American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut ( AEP ) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Second Circuit). Both decisions noted that Article III standing is satisfied when a state brings suit as parens patriae (literally, father of the country) on behalf of its citizens. Parens patriae doctrine allows a state to sue in its sovereign capacity to protect its citizenry, rather than being limited, as Article III would normally require, to asserting traditional particularized injuries to state interests.", "Most of the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA is devoted to whether plaintiffs had standing to sue. At the outset, the Court asserted that states are entitled to \"special solicitude\" when seeking to establish standing. The Court found that the state met all three factors to establish standing\u2014injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability of the injury. For the first factor, the Court determined that the current and potential future loss of Massachusetts shore land from sea level rise was an injury-in-fact. That this injury may be widely shared with other coastal states does not disqualify this injury, said the Court; it is nonetheless particular and concrete. ", "The second prong of the standing test is causation, requiring that the alleged injury be fairly traceable to the defendant. EPA did not dispute the existence of a causal relationship between GHG emissions and climate change. It did argue, however, that any reduction in GHG emissions achieved through the current litigation would be too tiny a fraction of worldwide GHG emissions to make a cognizable difference in climate change. In an important ruling that may benefit environmental plaintiffs in other contexts, the Court held that even an agency's refusal to take a \"small incremental step\" that would result in only a modest reduction in worldwide GHG emissions, is enough for standing purposes. ", "The third and final factor is whether the remedy sought by the plaintiff is likely to redress the injury. In this case, Massachusetts sought as a remedy a regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. The Court found that this remedy satisfied redressability because while it would not by itself reverse climate change, it would nonetheless slow or reduce it.", "After its Massachusetts v. EPA decision, the Supreme Court considered the question of the standing of state and non-state parties in climate change suits in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (AEP). As discussed above, the Second Circuit held that both state and non-state plaintiffs had standing in a tort suit seeking GHG reductions from five large electric utilities. The Court, by an equally divided vote of four-to-four, affirmed a Second Circuit standing decision but avoided directly addressing the standing of non-state parties in climate change suits. The Court stated that \"[f]our members of the Court would hold that at least some plaintiffs have Article III standing under Massachusetts , which permitted a State to challenge EPA's refusal to regulate [GHG] emissions \u2026 and, further, that no other threshold obstacle bars review.\" Without further explanation, the AEP decision leaves the question of whether non-state petitioners have standing under Article III in climate change suits unresolved.", "A related issue to state standing is whether Indian tribes, by virtue of their inherent sovereignty, may establish standing through parens patriae status. The argument for tribal parens patriae standing was rejected by the district court in Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp . In this case, an Alaskan native village sought damages from energy companies and electric utilities for coastal erosion, alleging that GHG emissions from their operations contribute to climate change, and thus to the village's erosion problem. The court explained that unlike Massachusetts v. EPA , the village was not entitled to \"special solitude\" because they were seeking damages directed against private entities and not enforcing any procedural rights concerning an agency's rulemaking authority. In dismissing the suit, the court held that the village lacked standing because it had not satisfied the \"causation\" component of standing doctrine\u2014that is, the village had not connected their coastal erosion problem to the specific GHG emissions of the defendants. In addition, the court concluded that the claim was nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine, under which lawsuits based on policy questions must be left to the political branches of government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Standing for Non-State Plaintiffs", "paragraphs": ["In general, non-state plaintiffs have encountered difficulties in establishing standing in climate change-related litigation. The finding of standing in Massachusetts generally did not extend to non-state plaintiffs seeking to establish standing in nonstatutory causes of action (such as common law nuisance), and the split decision in AEP failed to provide any further guidance.

These efforts, however, have been largely unsuccessful.", "The few cases that have brought common law nuisance claims seeking injunction or damages have failed based on the court's lack of jurisdiction to hear the claims.

While standing asks whether there is a proper plaintiff before the court, the political question doctrine asks whether there is a justiciable claim . The doctrine is rooted in the separation of powers principles, and acts to restrain courts from interfering in policy questions and decisions made by the political branches of government. The Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr in 1962 held that some cases are nonjusticiable because they are constitutionally committed to other branches of the government, impossible to decide without an initial policy determination, or otherwise imprudent for judicial review. ", "The doctrine has been the focal point in several nuisance-based climate change litigation matters, with courts rejecting such claims on that ground. For example, in Comer v. Murphy Oil USA , property owners sought money damages, claiming that GHG emissions from oil and energy companies were a \"nuisance\" that added to the severity of Hurricane Katrina, which damaged their property. The court held, among other things that \"the claims presented by the plaintiffs constitute nonjusticiable political questions, because there are no judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the issues presented, and because the case would require the Court to make initial policy determinations that have been entrusted to the EPA by Congress.\" Similarly, in California v. General Motors Corp ., the State of California brought a nuisance suit against automakers for money damages for their alleged contribution to climate change that was dismissed as a nonjusticiable political question. in Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., in addition to dismissing the case for lack of standing, the district court also held, among other things, that \"the allocation of fault\u2014and cost\u2014of\u00a0global warming is a matter appropriately left for determination by the executive or legislative branch in the first instance.\" Some of these cases were also dismissed because the claims were displaced by the CAA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Displacement of Federal Common Law", "paragraphs": ["Federal common law may be displaced where \"Congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law.\" The test of displacement is whether the federal statute speaks directly to the question raised in the lawsuit. In 2011, the Supreme Court's decision in AEP (discussed above) barred federal common law claims (such as nuisance) against entities for alleged injuries from GHG emissions. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that under Section 111 of the CAA, EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions displaces federal common law rights to seek abatement of GHG emissions from power plants. ", "Though the 2011 AEP ruling involved plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief (requiring the GHG-emitting defendants to cap and reduce their CO 2 emissions over time), a court has held the ruling to mean the CAA displaces federal common law actions seeking monetary damages as well. The availability of state common law claims for reducing GHG emissions remains an open question although one court has held that state law nuisance claims may also be displaced.", "If Congress amends the CAA to remove EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA, which would effectively overturn the Supreme Court's decisions in AEP and Massachusetts v. EPA , it would appear that common law nuisance claims would possibly no longer be displaced by federal actions, which would potentially open the door to a resurgence of these claims. Currently, the House is considering H.R. 637 , the Stopping EPA Overreach Act of 2017, which would exclude GHGs from regulation under the Clean Air Act. ", "Barring any congressional action removing EPA's authority, the AEP decision will continue to displace common-law-based climate change claims, making it unnecessary for courts to reach the standing and political question issues in such cases. However, a recent case in the context of the public trust doctrine is raising those jurisdictional issues anew.

The case,\u00a0 Juliana\u00a0v. United States , is part of a campaign of state and federal lawsuits and rulemaking petitions related to climate change coordinated by an Oregon nonprofit,\u00a0Our Children's Trust. While only a preliminary ruling, the\u00a0opinion\u00a0has prompted some media outlets to speculate whether the \"kids'\" lawsuit may potentially force actions to address climate change further through litigation.", "The\u00a0plaintiffs allege that federal officials promoted policies that contribute to climate change, while knowing of the alleged dangers of those policies. The\u00a0plaintiffs\u00a0ask the court to order the federal government to \"implement an enforceable national remedial plan to phase out fossil fuel emission\" and \"stabilize the climate system,\" among other requests for relief. There are multiple causes of action in the\u00a0complaint, which the district court organized into two categories: (i) alleged violations of plaintiffs'\u00a0substantive due process rights\u00a0to life, and liberty, and property in the Constitution and (ii) common law violations of the public trust doctrine. The district court did not rule on the merits of these claims, nor did it issue a finding that the government bears legal or factual responsibility for increased carbon dioxide emissions. But the court did conclude that it has subject matter jurisdiction over the case and that the plaintiffs' alleged facts that, if proven to be true, could entitle them to relief.", "In addition to raising standing and political question issues similar to those discussed above, the court's treatment of the\u00a0plaintiffs' public trust claim\u00a0may also represent a unique ruling in the context of climate change litigation. The public trust doctrine is a common law principle\u00a0with ancient origins\u00a0whereby the government has a duty to safeguard certain natural resources for the benefit of the public. The public trust doctrine is traditionally associated with\u00a0tidelands\u00a0and the\u00a0beds of navigable waterways, and the government argued that the doctrine should not be extended to create a duty to preserve the earth's atmosphere. While the\u00a0 Juliana \u00a0court stopped short of deciding that the atmosphere is part of the public trust, instead focusing on alleged rising sea levels and harm to the territorial sea, it left open the possibility of a future ruling that the public trust doctrine creates a federal government duty to protect the atmosphere. Thus far, no court has ruled on the merits of an \"atmospheric public trust\" claim against the federal government, and\u00a0 state \u00a0courts have \u00a0taken\u00a0divergent\u00a0views\u00a0on the viability such a claim against state governments under their respective state constitutions and laws.

On January 31, 2017, the court denied the plaintiffs' efforts to depose Secretary of State Rex Tillerson regarding his work related to climate change while at ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute, among other issues. The Trump Administration is seeking a late appeal of the denial of the motion to dismiss and to delay trial with the Ninth Circuit.
