Two categories of UC state law issues are considered: (1) changes in the duration of state UC unemployment benefits, and (2) changes in the UC weekly benefit amount.", "In recent years, some states have enacted legislation to decrease the maximum number of weeks of regular state UC benefits. Until 2011, all states paid at least up to 26 weeks of UC benefits to eligible, unemployed individuals. In 2011, however, six states passed legislation to decrease their maximum UC benefit durations: Arkansas, Florida, Illinois (only for calendar year 2012), Michigan, Missouri, and South Carolina. In 2012, Georgia also passed legislation to decrease the maximum UC benefit duration. In 2013, Kansas and North Carolina enacted similar legislation. Subsequently, in 2015, Arkansas and Missouri enacted additional state laws to further reduce their maximum UC durations. In the case of Missouri, however, the Missouri Supreme Court found the 2015 law unconstitutional; therefore, this further UC duration reduction is not in effect. In 2016, Idaho reduced its maximum UC duration. Finally, in 2017, Arkansas passed a third reduction in its maximum UC duration. As a result of these state law changes, depending on state unemployment, the shortest potential UC maximum duration is currently 12 weeks (in Florida and North Carolina), compared with 26 weeks prior to 2011.", "Changes in UC benefit duration have consequences for the duration of federal unemployment benefits that may be available to unemployed workers, including Extended Benefits (EB) and benefits from the now-expired Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program. Because state UC benefit duration is an underlying factor in the calculation of duration for additional federal unemployment benefits, reducing UC maximum duration also reduces the number of weeks available to unemployed workers in the federal extended unemployment programs (including EUC08, which is now expired, and EB).", "Prior to the expiration of the EUC08 program on December 28, 2013 (December 29, 2013, in New York), states were temporarily subject to a \"nonreduction\" rule (under P.L. 111-205, as amended), which made the availability of federally financed EUC08 benefits contingent on not actively changing the state's method of calculation for UC benefits, if it would have decreased weekly benefit amounts. Some states, however, make automatic adjustments to weekly benefit amounts under existing state law. Consequently, when these states experience certain conditions, such as a decrease in the average weekly wage used in the automatic adjustment calculation, their maximum weekly UC benefit amount may have been decreased without having violated the now-expired \"nonreduction\" rule. P.L. 112-96 provided a specific exception to the \"nonreduction\" rule in the case of state legislation enacted before March 1, 2012. In February 2013, North Carolina enacted legislation that actively reduced UC weekly benefit amount calculations beginning in July 2013. Due to this violation of the \"nonreduction\" rule, EUC08 benefits were no longer available in North Carolina, effective June 29, 2013. All EUC08 benefits expired as of the week ending on or before January 1, 2014 (i.e., December 28, 2013; or December 29, 2013, in New York State). Any reduction to the UC weekly benefit amount also translates into reduced EB weekly benefit amounts (and EUC08 benefit amounts when the program was authorized).", "Overall, the two types of changes to state UC laws and programs have consequences for the duration and amount of unemployment benefits.

In general, these states have been attempting to reduce the costs of UC benefits, which are financed through state taxes on employers.

This results in essentially 53 different programs. Generally, UC eligibility is based on attaining qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month period (called a base period) prior to unemployment. All states require a worker to have earned a certain amount of wages or to have worked for a certain period of time (or both) within the base period to be monetarily eligible to receive any UC benefits. The methods states use to determine monetary eligibility vary greatly. Most state benefit formulas replace approximately half of a claimant's average weekly wage up to a weekly maximum.

There is nothing in federal law, however, that requires states to set their UC benefit duration maximum at 26 weeks. Thus, states have the discretion to offer fewer than 26 weeks as the maximum as well as to set their own UC benefit durations via their state UC laws. In the early decades of the UC program, there was more variation in the maximum duration of UC benefits across states, which also tended to be lower than 26 weeks.

When the economy grows, UC program revenue rises through increased tax collection and UC program expenditures fall, as fewer workers are unemployed. The effect of collecting more taxes than are spent dampens demand in the economy. It also creates a surplus of funds, or a \"cushion\" of available funds, for the UC program to draw upon during a recession. In a recession, UC tax revenue falls and UC program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UC benefits. The increased amount of UC payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of earnings losses by injecting additional funds into the economy.", "As a result of the most recent recession, December 2007-June 2009, and its accompanying prolonged and high unemployment, states paid out large amounts of UC benefits: $75.3 billion in FY2009 and $63.0 billion in FY2010 versus $30.2 billion in FY2006 and $31.4 billion in FY2007. This increase in state expenditures on UC benefits also led to large outstanding federal loans in many states. According to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), 36 states depleted the balance of their state unemployment tax act (SUTA) revenues within their Unemployment Trust Fund accounts and took out federal loans to continue to pay UC benefits. In 2010, for instance, outstanding federal loans to states totaled $40.2 billion at the end of the calendar year.", "States may address this type of UC financial stress by (1) taking action to reduce UC expenditures (i.e., by decreasing UC benefits and/or limiting eligibility); (2) raising UC revenue (i.e., by increasing SUTA taxes); or (3) pursuing some combination of the first two options. The significant financial stress from the most recent recession contributed, in large part, to state legislative action during recent years.

In addition to a significant increase in state expenditures on UC benefits during the 2011-2015 period, there were also significant federal expenditures on unemployment benefits authorized through the EB and EUC08 programs during this period. For instance, in FY2011, $11.9 billion was paid out in EB benefits and $52.7 billion in EUC08 benefits, all federal expenditures. Because states administer all unemployment benefits, including EB and EUC08 benefits (when authorized), through their state UC programs, states were facing increased administrative pressure regarding program integrity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has included UC in its list of \"high-error\" programs throughout this time period, with the nominal amount of all improper UC payments peaking in FY2010 at $17.5 billion. UC remains an OMB \"high-error\" program in the current year.", "In this climate, Congress has taken an active interest in trying to reduce UC improper payments, including UC, EB, and EUC08 overpayments made to individuals. For instance, Congress enacted three federal laws during the 2011-2015 period that either added or clarified state administrative responsibilities to decrease benefit overpayments ( P.L. 112-40 ; P.L. 112-96 ; and P.L. 113-67 ) or imposed new restrictions on UC eligibility ( P.L. 112-96 ). Additionally, Congress held two hearings during this period to examine state UC program integrity: House Ways and Means Committee, Subcommittee on Human Resources, \"Ending Cash for Convicts and Other Ways to Improve the Integrity of the UI Program\" (September 11, 2013), and House Ways and Means Committee, Subcommittee on Human Resources, \"Protecting the Safety Net from Waste, Fraud, and Abuse\" (June 3, 2015).", "DOL also prioritized program integrity efforts during this time period, for instance, by \"making an immediate call to action to all state administrators to ensure that UI [unemployment insurance] integrity is a top priority and to develop state specific strategies to bring down the UI improper payment rate.\" DOL also provided supplemental administrative funding opportunities to states during this period.
