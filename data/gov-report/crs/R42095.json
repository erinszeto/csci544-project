With an eye to those constitutional boundaries, the Federal Death Penalty Act and related statutory provisions govern the procedures under which the death penalty may be imposed.", "Some defendants are ineligible for the death penalty regardless of the crimes with which they are accused. Children and those incompetent to stand trial may not face the death penalty; pregnant women and the mentally retarded may not be executed. There is no statute of limitations for murder, and the time constraints imposed by the due process and speedy trial clauses of the Constitution are rarely an impediment to prosecution.", "The decision to seek or forgo the death penalty in a federal capital case must be weighed by the Justice Department's Capital Review Committee and approved by the Attorney General.", "Defendants convicted of murder are death-eligible only if they are found at a separate sentencing hearing to have acted with life-threatening intent. Among those who have, capital punishment may be imposed only if the sentencing jury unanimously concludes that the aggravating circumstances that surround the murder and the defendant outweigh the mitigating circumstances to an extent that justifies execution.", "The Federal Death Penalty Act provides several specific aggravating factors, such as murder of a law enforcement officer or multiple murders committed at the same time. It also permits consideration of any relevant \"non-statutory aggravating factors.\" Impact on the victim's family and future dangerousness of the defendant are perhaps the most commonly invoked non-statutory aggravating factors. The jury must agree on the existence of at least one of the statutory aggravating factors if the defendant is to be sentenced to death.", "The Federal Death Penalty Act permits consideration of any relevant mitigating factor, and identifies a few, such as the absence of prior criminal record or the fact that a co-defendant, equally or more culpable, has escaped with a lesser sentence.", "The Federal Death Penalty Act recognizes other capital offenses that do not necessarily involve murder: treason, espionage, large-scale drug trafficking, and attempted murder to obstruct a drug kingpin investigation.

Capital punishment was a feature of English law that the early colonists brought with them. Once here, they often supplemented English law with provisions of their own. Although law among the colonies was hardly uniform beyond its English foundations, murder, rape, grand larceny, and various other property crimes appear to have been among the crimes punishable by death in each of the colonies. In fact, \"[a]t the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, capital punishment was a common sanction in every State.\" ", "When the first Congress convened, it made federal capital offenses of murder within federal enclaves, treason, and piracy, as well as forgery and counterfeiting of federal certificates and public securities. By the time of the Revised Statutes of 1878, the list of federal capital offenses included treason; and murder, arson, or rape in U.S. special maritime and territorial jurisdiction; piracy; insurance fraud involving the destruction of a vessel at sea; and the rescue of an individual under sentence of death. ", "When the Supreme Court announced its decision in Furman v. Georgia , the number of federal capital murder offenses had increased, but the inventory of capital offenses that did not include death as an element had been reduced to rape, treason, and espionage. ", "After Furman , where the Supreme Court found unconstitutional imposition of capital punishment pursuant to procedures then required under state and federal law, Congress made procedural adjustments to revive the death penalty as a sentencing option first in air piracy cases, then in drug kingpin homicide cases, and finally as a general matter in the Federal Death Penalty Act. Now federal capital offenses are confined to espionage, treason, certain drug kingpin offenses (that do not involve murder), and murder under various jurisdictional circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Post-Furman Jurisprudence", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Death Penalty Act reflects the constitutional boundaries identified in Furman and subsequent related Supreme Court decisions. The opinion for the Court in Furman v. Georgia runs less than a page. It simply states: \"The Court holds that the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty in these cases constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Division among the members of the Court accounted for the brevity. Each of the Justices wrote either a concurring or dissenting opinion. Three Justices thought capital punishment was per se cruel and unusual. Two others felt that the then existing sentencing procedures failed to equitably separate the wheat from the chaff: the system did not ensure imposition of the death penalty, the most severe punishment, uniformly in the most deserving cases and only in the most deserving cases. The remaining four Justices dissented on three grounds. Like two members of the majority, they could not say that the death penalty was per se cruel and unusual. They felt the decision was incompatible with appropriate judicial constraint and the deference due the legislative prerogatives. And, they argued that the unfair, arbitrary, capricious standard advanced by three members of the majority was a due process standard which the Court the year before had found posed no impediment to implementation of state capital sentencing statutes.", "Furman drew two responses. Some states sought to remedy arbitrary imposition of the death penalty by making capital punishment mandatory. Some states and Congress narrowed the category of cases in which the death penalty might be a sentencing option and crafted procedures designed to guide jury discretion in capital cases in order to equitably reduce the risk of random imposition. The Court in Woodson rejected the first approach, and in Gregg endorsed the second.", "The Court has subsequently noted that Furman and Gregg \"establish that a ... capital sentencing system must: (1) rationally narrow the class of death-eligible defendants; and (2) permit a jury to render a reasoned, individualized sentencing determination based on a death-eligible defendant's record, personal characteristics, and the circumstances of his crime.\"", "With respect to eligibility for the death penalty, the Court declared \"that capital punishment must 'be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution.'\" \"Applying this principle, [the Court] held in Roper and Atkins that the execution of juveniles and mentally retarded persons are punishments violative of the Eighth Amendment because the offender had a diminished personal responsibility for the crime.\" ", "Moreover, the Eighth Amendment cannot accept imposition of the death penalty where it is disproportionate to the crime itself as, at least in some instances, \"where the crime did not result, or was not intended to result, in death of the victim. In Coker , for instance, the Court held it would be unconstitutional to execute an offender who had raped an adult woman.... And in Enmund , the Court overturned the capital sentence of a defendant who aided and abetted a robbery during which a murder was committed but did not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing would take place. On the other hand, in Tison , the Court allowed the defendants' death sentences to stand where they did not themselves kill the victims but their involvement in the events leading up to the murders was active, recklessly indifferent, and substantial.\" ", "Imposition of the death penalty as punishment for a particular crime will be considered cruel and unusual when it is contrary to the \"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of maturing society.\" Those standards find expression in legislative enactments, prosecution practices, jury performance, and execution records, viewed in light of \" the Court's own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment's text, history, meaning, and purpose.\"", "Once a defendant has been found to be a member of a capital punishment eligible class, the question becomes whether he is among that limited number within that class for whom the death penalty is an appropriate punishment. The Court, after Gregg , found acceptable sentencing schemes that reserved capital punishment for those cases in which the jury's consideration involved one or more aggravating factors and any mitigating factors. If an aggravating factor is not already required for eligibility, one must be found in the course of the individualized selection assessment. Aggravating factors must satisfy three requirements. \"First the circumstance may not apply to every defendant convicted of the murder; it must apply only to a subclass of defendants convicted of murder. Second, the aggravating circumstance may not be constitutionally vague.\" Third, the aggravating circumstance may not be statutorily or constitutionally impermissible or irrelevant.", "As for mitigating evidence, evidence must be received and considered \"if the sentencer could reasonably find that it warrants a sentence less than death.\" The Constitution insists \" that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a capital defendant's relevant mitigating evidence.... [V]irtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances.\"", "The Eighth Amendment also condemns execution in a cruel and unusual manner. It proscribes any method of execution which presents an \"objectively intolerable risk\" that the method is \"sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering.\" The federal and state capital punishment statutes all require, or at least permit, execution by lethal injunction. In Baze , the Court rejected an Eighth Amendment challenge which failed to show that the lethal injunction procedure at issue was sure or very likely to cause needless suffering."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Federal Law", "paragraphs": ["Existing federal law affords capital cases special treatment.

The due process delay proscription only applies where the delay is the product of prosecutorial bad faith prejudicial to the defendant: \"[A] pplicable statutes of limitations protect against the prosecution's bringing stale criminal charges against any defendant, and, beyond that protection, the Fifth Amendment requires the dismissal of an indictment, even if it is brought within the statute of limitations, if the defendant can prove that the Government's delay in bringing the indictment was a deliberate device to gain an advantage over him and that it caused him actual prejudice in presenting his defense.\" ", "Moreover, the statute of limitations only marks time from the commission of the crime to accusation, in the form of either arrest or indictment. Deadlines between accusation and trial are the province of the constitutional and statutory speedy trial provisions. Here too, the limits are not particularly confining in most instances. \"The Sixth Amendment ... Speedy Trial Clause is written with such breadth that, taken literally, it would forbid the government to delay the trial of an 'accused' for any reason at all. [The] cases, however, have qualified the literal sweep of the provision by specifically recognizing the relevance of four separate enquiries: whether delay before trial was uncommonly long, whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for that delay, whether, in due course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial, and whether he suffered prejudice as the delay's result.\" The Speedy Trial Act provides a more detailed time table, but one that comes with a number of extensions and exclusions.

That is, the specific murder-manslaughter instruction of Section 3236 applies only with regard to \"unitary\" murder offenses, such as murder by a federal prisoner; it does not apply to \"death resulting\" cases, cases where murder is a sentencing element rather than a substantive element of the offense, such as in cases of a violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(use of a firearm during and relating to the commission of crime of violence), the sentence for which is determined in part by whether death resulted from the commission of the offense.

The statute and the courts have added more. First, subsection 3592(c)(6) limits the factor to instances that \"involve torture or serious physical abuse of the victim.\" Second, the courts have explained that this limits the factor to cases in which the defendant \"inflicted 'suffering or mutilation above and beyond that necessary to cause death.'\" ", "Ordering a murder for hire: The statutory aggravating factor that applies when the defendant has procured another to commit a murder appears to have been cited sparingly.", "Murder for pecuniary gain: On the other hand, the closely related pecuniary gain factor\u2014\"the defendant committed the offense as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value\"\u2014is cited with some regularity.

The factor requires the government to show a considerable amount of planning, but there is no need to show that the \"defendant deliberated for any particular period of time.\" The steps taken in preparation for a murder will often bespeak substantial planning.

It requires a murder committed in the course of a continuing criminal (drug kingpin) enterprise offense involving the sale of controlled substances to children.", "High public official: The high public official aggravating factor is both more inclusive and more exclusive than its caption might suggest. It does not encompass high state officials. It does, however, include foreign officials as well as federal law enforcement and correctional officers and employees.

Subsection 3593(a), on the other hand, mentions it as one of the factors that may be considered aggravating. This mixed treatment may be a product of the Supreme Court's struggles with the issue. The Court initially suggested that a prosecution's presentation of victim impact evidence at a capital sentencing hearing was inherently prejudicial. Shortly thereafter, however, it rejected the notion that the Eight Amendment contained a per se prohibition on victim impact evidence. It concluded that in \"the majority of cases ... victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes. In the event that evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause ... provides a mechanism for relief.\" The Court later rejected a contention that overlap between the statutory victim vulnerability factor and the non-statutory victim impact factor resulted in a constitutionally impermissible double counting.", "The statute refers to the impact of the offense on the victim's family, but the courts have also permitted expressions of grief and loss from non-family members. Evidence of \"a victim's family members' characterizations and opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate sentence\" may still be out of bounds, but the courts are otherwise reluctant to bar the admission of victim impact evidence.", "Future dangerousness: The non-statutory aggravating factor covering future dangerousness appears with some regularity in cases in which the Justice Department elects to seek the death penalty. It is understood to encompass \"evidence that a defendant is likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would be a threat to the lives and safety of others.\" The factor may be problematic when proof of its existence takes the form of evidence of the defendant's lack of remorse\u2014particularly when that unconstitutionally draws the jury's attention to the defendant's exercise of either his right to a trial or his right not to testify.

Childhood hardships, remorse, and impact of the execution on the defendant's family are among the more common. Yet, a jury's capital sentencing decision will not always be undone by the trial court's erroneous failure to admit mitigating evidence.

Each of the crimes presents considerations of its own and might under some circumstances survive scrutiny even under the individual violence standards. Nevertheless, it seems likely that any court confronting the issue would at a minimum consider the Kennedy standards (indicia of \"the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\" read in conjunction with the Court's precedents). ", "Treason is the crime of which the Founding Fathers were most leery\u2014so uneasy, in fact, that they inserted a narrow definition and procedural safeguards in the Constitution itself: \"Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\" ", "Congress made treason a capital offense in the very first Congress, and so it has remained throughout. Congress ensured its status as a capital offense when it revived the death penalty in 1994. Treason is a state crime in at least 23 states, and a capital offense in 10 of those. State prosecutions are virtually unheard of, however. Federal treason prosecutions, never numerous, have become particularly uncommon. There were 35 federal treason cases prior to World War II; 11 arose out of that conflict, and apparently there has been only 1 since then. ", "Thus, the Supreme Court has had no occasion to pass upon the constitutionality of capital punishment in a treason case since Furman . The Court, however, had previously handed down decisions in four treason cases. In the first, Ex parte Bollman , the Court granted habeas corpus relief on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to hold the petitioners on a charge of treason. In the second, Cramer v. United States , the Court overturned the petitioner's treason conviction on the ground that the overt acts upon which it was based were insufficient, either because the overt acts did not show treasonous intent or because they lacked the support of two witnesses upon which the Constitution insists. The Court affirmed the treason convictions in Haupt v. United States and Kawakita v. United States . None of the treasonous acts by Kawakita or Haupt involved the death of a victim.", "The existing federal statute likewise permits capital punishment even in a deathless treason case. Yet, it reserves the death penalty for those defendants who have previously been convicted of treason, or who, in the commission of the offense, have created either a grave risk of death or a grave risk of substantial danger to national security, or whose case presents some similar aggravating circumstance. It remains to be seen whether this is enough or even whether treason cases are subject to the same manner of Eighth Amendment analysis as the state violence cases. ", "It might be a close question under the elements of the tests mentioned in Kennedy . Executive officials have virtually abandoned recourse to treason prosecutions, but inclusion in the 1994 revival belies the suggestion that capital punishment in all treason cases is commonly considered excessive. The dearth of modern treason prosecutions might be attributed to the ability to prosecute treasonous conduct as other crimes, crimes whose prosecutions come without the evidentiary hurdles of a treason case. On other hand, most of those crimes are not capital offenses. The only exception, the espionage statute, dates from a time before treason prosecutions had become pass\u00e9, although Congress made it a death-eligible offense when it revived capital punishment as a sentencing option in 1994.

Capital punishment is confined to those cases marked by one of the three aggravating factors and by the absence of countervailing mitigating factors.
