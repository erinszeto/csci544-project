On July 24, the delegates appointed five members to serve as the Committee of Detail; the committee was charged with assembling all the points decided by that stage of the deliberations, arranging them, and presenting them to the convention for further refinement and discussion. The committee's report, presented on August 6, proposed that governors would fill Senate vacancies if they occurred when the state legislature was not in session:", "Article 5, Section 1. The Senate of the United States shall be chosen by the Legislatures of the several States. Each Legislature shall choose two members. Vacancies may be supplied by the Executive until the next meeting of the Legislature (emphasis added). Each member shall have one vote.", "On August 9, the delegates turned to Article 5; Edmund Randolph of Virginia, a member of the Committee of Detail, explained that the provision was thought ", "... necessary to prevent inconvenient chasms in the Senate. In some states the legislatures meet but once a year. As the Senate will have more power and consist of a smaller number than the other house, vacancies there will be of more consequence. The executives might be safely entrusted, he thought, with the appointment for so short a time. ", "James Wilson of Pennsylvania countered by asserting that the state legislatures met frequently enough to deal with vacancies, that the measure removed appointment of the Senators another step from popular election, and that it violated separation of powers by giving the executive power to appoint a legislator, no matter how brief the period. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut noted that \"may\" as used in the provision was not necessarily prescriptive, and that \"[w]hen the legislative meeting happens to be near, the power will not be exerted.\" A motion to strike out executive appointment was voted down eight states to one, with one divided. Hugh Williamson of North Carolina then offered an amendment to change the language to read \"vacancies shall be supplied by the Executive unless other provision shall be made by the legislature,\" which was also rejected.", "The Committee on Style and Arrangement made minor alterations, and inserted the provision in Article I, Section 3, paragraph (clause) 2 in its September 12 report. The full convention made final changes and approved the provision on September 17, and it was incorporated without debate into the Constitution in the following form:", "... and if vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.", "The appointments provision does not appear to have aroused much interest during the debate on ratification. A review of available sources, including The Federalist and proceedings of the state conventions that ratified the Constitution, reveals almost no debate on the question.", "For the next 124 years, governors appointed temporary Senators according to the constitutional requirement with only minor controversy. During this long period, 189 Senators were appointed by state governors; 20 of these appointments were contested, but only 8 were \"excluded\" by the Senate. The primary grounds for these contested appointments appear to have centered on whether vacancies happened during the recess of the legislature. According to historian George Haynes, throughout much of this time, \"the Senate refused to admit to its membership men who had been appointed by the governors of their several States when the legislature had had the opportunity to fill the vacancies, but had failed to do so by reason of deadlocks.\" Aside from this recurring controversy, the appointment of temporary Senators seems to have been otherwise unremarkable. A random survey of various states during the period from 1789 through 1913 identifies an average of 3.3 senatorial appointments per state for the period, with individual totals dependent largely on the length of time the state had been in the Union. For instance, New Hampshire, one of the original states, is recorded as having had eight appointed temporary Senators during this period, while Montana, admitted in 1889, never had an appointment under the original constitutional provision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Seventeenth Amendment", "paragraphs": ["For more than 70 years following ratification of the Constitution, there was little interest in changing the original constitutional provisions governing Senate elections and vacancies. Although an amendment providing for direct election was introduced as early as 1826, few others followed, and by 1860, only nine such proposals had been offered, all but one in the House. Satisfaction with the status quo began to erode, however, after the Civil War, and support grew for a constitutional amendment that would provide direct popular election of the Senate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Support Grows for Direct Election of U.S. Senators", "paragraphs": ["During the last third of the 19 th century, indirect election of Senators by state legislatures came under growing criticism, while proposals for an amendment to establish direct election began to gain support. The decades following the Civil War witnessed increasing instances of both protracted elections, in which senatorial contests were drawn out over lengthy periods, and deadlocked elections, in which the state legislature proved unable to settle on a candidate by the time its session ended. In the most extreme instances, protracted and deadlocked elections resulted in unfilled Senate vacancies for sometimes lengthy periods. According to Haynes, 14 seats were left unfilled in the Senate for protracted periods, and while \"[t]he duration of these vacancies varied somewhat ... in most cases, it amounted to the loss of a Senator for the entire term of a Congress.\" During the same period, the Senate election process was increasingly regarded as seriously compromised by corruption. Corporations, trusts, and wealthy individuals were often perceived as having bribed state legislators in order to secure the election of favored candidates. Once in office, the Senators so elected were said to \"keep their positions by heeding the wishes of party leaders and corporate sponsors rather than constituents.\" A third factor contributing to the rise of support for direct election of Senators was what one historian characterized as \"a long-term American inclination to strengthen representative democracy.\" As such, the campaign for popular election might be considered part of the series of state and federal laws and constitutional amendments intended to expand the right to vote and guarantee the integrity of election procedures. As the movement for reform gained strength, \"progressive\" elements in both major parties, and rising political movements such as the Populist and Socialist parties, all supported direct election of the Senate.", "Action for popular election of Senators proceeded on two levels. First, beginning as early as the 1870s, the House of Representatives considered popular election amendment proposals. As support for the proposal gained strength, the House first approved a proposed amendment in 1893, and did so with increasing vote margins a total of five times between 1893 and 1902; in each case, however, the Senate took no action. For nearly the next decade, Congress took no action, as the House declined to spend limited session time debating proposals that were very unlikely to receive consideration in the Senate. Direct election met with greater success in the states. After years of experimentation with different plans by the states, in 1904, Oregon voters used the newly enacted initiative process to pass legislation that had the effect of requiring state legislators to pledge to elect the Senate candidate who received the most votes in the primary elections. By 1911, over half the states had adopted some version of the Oregon system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress Acts\u2014The Seventeenth Amendment", "paragraphs": ["Pressure continued to build on the Senate in the first decade of the 20 th century. In addition to enacting versions of the Oregon Plan, a number of states petitioned Congress, asking it to propose a direct election amendment, while others submitted petitions for an Article V convention to consider an amendment. Deadlocked elections in several states continued to draw publicity, while in 1906, a sensational but influential series of articles titled \"The Treason of the Senate\" ran in William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan . All these influences helped promote the cause of direct election.

This clause would have removed reference to the Senate from Article I, Section 4, clause 1, of the Constitution, and would have had the effect of eliminating federal authority over the Senate elections process. It has been described by historians as \"a 'race rider' which would deny to the federal government the authority to regulate the manner in which elections were conducted.\" Supporters of the clause asserted it guaranteed state sovereignty and restrained the power of the federal government, while opponents characterized it as an attack on the right of Black Americans to vote as conferred by the 15 th Amendment, at least with respect to the Senate. On April 13, 1911, the House rejected an effort to strip clause 2 from H.J.Res. 39, and moved immediately to approve the resolution with it intact.", "When the Senate took up the measure on May 15, Senator Joseph Bristow offered an amended version which did not include the elections control clause.

The election was held, and a Senator elected, but the governor had previously appointed a temporary replacement in 1912, six months before the 17 th Amendment was ratified. The right of the elected Senator to supplant the appointed one was challenged on the grounds that the governor had no legal right to issue the writ of election, because neither Congress nor the Maryland legislature had enacted legislation authorizing the special elections contemplated by the 17 th Amendment. The Senate debated the issue, rejected this argument, and seated the elected Senator. In the second case, the governor of Alabama sought to appoint an interim Senator to fill a vacancy created in 1913, after the 17 th Amendment had been ratified. The Alabama legislature had not yet passed legislation providing for gubernatorial appointments, as provided in clause 2 of the Amendment, and the Senate declined to seat the appointee on the grounds that the governor could not exercise the appointment power unless so authorized by state law.", "The Senate Historical Office maintains records for Senators appointed since 1913, beginning with Rienzi M.

Of this figure, 14 appointees have been women: seven of these were the widows of incumbent Senators who agreed to serve until a successor could be elected; two were spouses of the governor who appointed them; and one was the daughter of the governor who appointed her. Three men were appointed to fill vacancies created by the death of their fathers. Of the 193 appointments, 118, or 61.1%, sought election, while the remainder served only until the special election. Sixty two, or 52.5%, of those who pursued election were successful, while 56 were defeated, often in the primary election.", "The Senate data exclude so-called \"technical\" resignations. Generally considered a separate class, these resignations occurred when a retiring Senator resigned after the election of his or her successor, but before the expiration of the term. The Senator-elect would then be appointed to serve out the balance of the term by the state governor, and accrue the benefits of two months extra seniority. This practice was ended in 1980 when the major parties agreed that Senators-elect would no longer be able to derive seniority benefits through appointment as a result of technical resignations.", "Although complete data are not available, a study of Senators appointed to fill vacancies between 1945 and 1979 found an even lower success rate in primary elections.

Section 2(a) required that, if the President of the Senate issues a certification that a vacancy exists in the Senate, a special election to fill the vacancy would be held not later than 90 days after the certification was issued. The election would be conducted in accordance with existing state laws. Section 2(b) provided that a special election not be held if the vacancy were certified within 90 days of the regularly scheduled election for the Senate seat in question, or during the period between the regularly scheduled election and the first day of the first session of the next Congress. Finally, Section 2(c) provided a rule of construction stating that nothing in the act would impair the constitutional authority of the several states to provide for temporary appointments to fill Senate vacancies, or the authority of appointed Senators between the time of their appointment and the special election.", "Section 3 would have authorized the Election Assistance Commission to reimburse states for up to 50% of the costs incurred in connection with holding the special election.", "This bill sought to provide for expedited special elections to fill Senate vacancies, and to assist states in meeting the expenses of special elections. It sought to avoid potential conflicts with the 17 th Amendment by authorizing the states to continue to provide for gubernatorial appointments, but would generally have led to considerably shorter tenures for most appointed Senators. As a secondary issue, it addressed concerns of state and local governments related to the costs of planning and administration of special elections through a program of reimbursements. It may be noted that this provision would have eliminated or reduced the likelihood that the act would be subject to points of order on the floor of either chamber on the grounds that it imposed \"unfunded mandates\" on state and local governments.", "H.R. 899 derived its authority from the Constitution, which provides that", "The Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.", "In this connection, it could be argued however, that, notwithstanding the rule of construction contained in Section 2(c), the bill infringed on the 17 th Amendment's grant of authority to the states to \"fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.\"", "By choosing legislation, rather than a constitutional amendment, as the vehicle for their proposal, the sponsors of H.R. 899 may have been subject to a constitutional challenge, but they may also have been influenced by the many obstacles faced by proposed constitutional amendments. The bill addressed many concerns surrounding the Senate vacancy appointment process, but had arguably a better chance of passage than a constitutional amendment. The hurdles faced by bills are much lower than those faced by proposed constitutional amendments: unlike constitutional amendments, there is no supermajority requirement for passage in the House and Senate, nor is the approval of three fourths of the states required. On the other hand, as a bill, H.R. 899 would have been subject to veto, whereas the President exercises no constitutional authority at any stage of the amendment process.

S.J.Res. 7 was introduced by Senator Russell D. Feingold on January 29, 2009, and was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and subsequently to the Subcommittee on the Constitution. H.J.Res. 21 was introduced by Representative David Dreier on February 11, 2009. The resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and subsequently to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.", "Section 1 of S.J.Res. 7 and H.J.Res. 21 required that \"no person shall be a Senator from a State unless such person has been elected by the people thereof.\" The section further directed state governors to issue writs of election to fill Senate vacancies. Section 2 stipulated that \"the election or term of any Senator chosen before\" the amendment took effect would not be affected.", "S.J.Res. 7 and H.J.Res. 21 proposed a fundamental change in the constitutional procedures governing Senate vacancies by completely eliminating the state option to provide for temporary appointments incorporated in the 17 th Amendment. Proponents of the amendment may have argued that it was a further step in the long march toward more inclusively democratic government in the United States. By extending the voters' right to choose their Senators to special elections when vacancies occur, it could have been described by supporters as falling not only within the tradition of the 17 th Amendment, but in the same progression as the 15 th , 19 th , 23 rd , 24 th and 26 th Amendments, all of which extended the people's right to vote. As one of the sponsors noted, the amendment did not question the integrity or ability of any appointed Senators, but rather, recognized the fact that \"those who want to be a U.S. Senator should have to make their case to the people.... And the voters should choose them in the time-honored way that they choose the rest of the Congress of the United States.\"", "Opponents might have responded with the argument attributed to Viscount Falkland, that \"where it is not necessary to change, it is necessary not to change,\" particularly in the case of the Constitution. The 17 th Amendment provision for temporary Senate appointments, they might have noted, has, with few exceptions, served the nation well for nearly a century. In this connection, they might further have characterized the proposed amendment as an overreaction to a situation that was almost without precedent, was unlikely to be repeated any time soon, and could resolve itself in 20 months or less, which it ultimately did. They might also have raised the issue of costs imposed on the states by special Senate elections. In even the least populous ones, they would be significant, but in states such as California, they would place a substantial financial strain on overburdened state and local governments. Further concern might have been raised over the question of continuity in government. Critics of the amendment might question the effect it would have had on the ability of the Senate to reconstitute itself in the event of a terrorist attack or some other catastrophe that resulted in the death or disability of a large number of Senators. Current arrangements under the 17 th Amendment allow for multiple appointments under these circumstances. If the proposed amendment had been ratified, it might arguably have prolonged the amount of time necessary to fill a large number of Senate vacancies.", "Both resolutions were referred to the constitutional subcommittees of their respective full judiciary committees: in the House, the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties and in the Senate, the Subcommittee on the Constitution. On March 11, 2009, the two subcommittees held a joint hearing on the measures, and on August 6, the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution voted to approve S.J.Res. 7 and report it to the full Committee on the Judiciary, but no further action was taken on either measure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The controversies surrounding appointments to fill Senate vacancies that occurred in the context of the 2008 presidential election generated a considerable level of interest, including media analyses and commentaries, and legislative proposals for change on both the federal and state levels. The death of Senator Kennedy, the Massachusetts legislature's subsequent repeal of the state's \"election-only\" Senate vacancy law, and the vigorously contested special election to succeed the Senator, generated even greater public interest, given its prominence in the larger national political arena. It seems apparent, however, that the substantial levels of interest in the states and at the federal level in the process\u2014as opposed to individual special elections\u2014subsided after 2010. For instance, the special election to fill the Massachusetts Senate vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator John Kerry generated modest national publicity and does not seem likely to stimulate revived interest in the process.", "On the federal level, the question of reforming Senate vacancy procedures appears to have been a short-lived phenomenon, at least for the present. In the 111 th Congress, H.R. 899 would have provided expedited special elections to fill Senate vacancies, and S.J.Res. 7 and H.J.Res. 21 would have required that all Senate vacancies be filled by special election. The former faced the hurdles all bills must pass in the legislative process, plus the possibility that its constitutionality might be subject to challenge. The latter two measures, as with all proposed constitutional amendments, faced the considerable obstacles to passage and ratification deliberately embedded in the Constitution by the founders.
