This national program is aimed at reducing the use, manufacturing, and trafficking of illicit drugs and the reduction of drug-related crime and violence and of drug-related health consequences. The director of ONDCP has primary responsibilities of developing a comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy (Strategy) to direct the nation's anti-drug efforts; developing a National Drug Control Budget (Budget) to implement the National Drug Control Strategy, including determining the adequacy of the drug control budgets submitted by contributing federal Drug Control Program agencies; and evaluating the effectiveness of the National Drug Control Strategy implementation by the various agencies contributing to the Drug Control Program. Authorization for ONDCP expired at the end of FY2010, but it has continued to receive appropriations. Congress, while continuously charged with ONDCP's oversight, is now faced with its possible reauthorization.", "In May 2009, then-Director R. Gil Kerlikowske called for an end to use of the term \"war on drugs.\" This is in part because while drug use was previously considered a law enforcement or criminal justice problem, it has transitioned to being viewed more as a public health problem. Indeed, the Obama Administration has indicated that a comprehensive strategy should include a range of prevention, treatment, and law enforcement elements. The 2014 National Drug Control Strategy outlines seven core areas\u2014ranging from strengthening international partnerships to focusing on intervention and treatment efforts in health care\u2014aimed at reducing both illicit drug use and its consequences. The overall goal is to achieve a 15% reduction in the rate of drug use and its consequences over a five-year period (2010-2015).", "In creating the National Drug Control Strategy, ONDCP consults with the various federal Drug Control Program agencies. ONDCP then reviews their respective drug budgets and incorporates them into the National Drug Control Budget (Budget), which is submitted to Congress as part of the annual appropriations process. As requested by Congress in the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-469), the Budget was restructured in FY2012, incorporating the activities and budgets of 19 additional federal agencies/programs, to reflect a more complete range of federal drug control spending. The FY2013 Budget incorporated four additional federal agencies/programs, and the FY2014 Budget incorporated one additional federal program. In the proposed FY2015 Budget, there are five priorities for which resources are requested across agencies: substance abuse prevention and substance abuse treatment (both of which are considered demand-reduction areas), and drug interdiction, domestic law enforcement, and international partnerships (the three of which are considered supply-reduction areas). The FY2015 Budget proposes to use 57% of the funds ($14.436 billion) for supply-side functions and 43% of the funds ($10.927 billion) for demand-side functions. Federal drug control activities were funded at $25.212 billion for FY2014. In September 2014, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 (P.L. 113-164) continued funding the federal government at FY2014 spending levels through December 11, 2014. Details of FY2015 federal drug control spending, however, remain unclear.", "In considering ONDCP's reauthorization, there are several issues on which policy makers may deliberate. Congress may consider whether to authorize specific supply-reduction or demand-reduction programs. Congress may also exercise oversight regarding ONDCP's implementation of evidenced-based activities. Another issue that might be debated is whether the revised Budget structure captures the full scope of the nation's anti-drug activities. Further, ONDCP has created a new Performance Reporting System (PRS) to evaluate annual progress toward each of the Drug Control Program's strategic goals.

According to a 2014 Gallup survey, 63% of respondents reported that they worry a \"great deal\" or \"fair amount\" about drug use as a problem in the United States while 37% reported that they worry \"only a little\" or \"not at all\" about this issue.", "This report provides a discussion of the National Drug Control Strategy, the National Drug Control Budget, and ONDCP's evaluation of the National Drug Control Strategy implementation. It then provides an analysis of selected legislative and oversight issues that Congress may consider when debating the reauthorization of ONDCP.

", "In each Strategy since 2010, ONDCP has outlined seven specific objectives\u2014to be accomplished by 2015\u2014aimed at reducing both illicit drug use and its consequences. These objectives include reducing the following:", "The prevalence of 12- to 17-year-olds who report having used any illicit drugs in the past 30 days (by 15%). According to the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 9.4% of youth in this age range report being \"current\" (in the past month) users of illicit drugs.

According to the 2013 Monitoring the Future study, 27.8% of 8 th graders report having had alcohol (1.7% decline since 2012), 14.8% of 8 th graders report having used cigarettes (0.8% decline since 2012), and 20.3% of 8 th graders report having used some form of illicit drug in their lifetimes (1.8% increase since 2012). The prevalence of 18- to 25-year-olds who report having used any illicit drugs in the past 30 days (by 10%). Notably, 21.5% of adults in this age range reported being current illicit drug users in 2013. The number of chronic drug users (by 15%). For instance, the 2013 NSDUH suggests that about 8.1 million individuals used marijuana on a daily or near-daily basis in the previous year. The number of drug-induced deaths (by 15%). In 2011, there were a reported 43,544 drug-induced deaths in the United States. Drug-related morbidity (by 15%). In 2011, the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) estimates there were over 5 million drug-related emergency department visits. The prevalence of drugged driving (by 10%). In 2013, an estimated 3.8% of the 12-and-older population drove under the influence of an illicit drug. This represents a decrease from the rate in 2012 (3.9%).", "In order to attain these goals, the Strategy proposes initiatives to bolster community-based drug prevention efforts; expand health care opportunities, both for early drug and substance abuse intervention as well as for treatment and recovery; end the cycle of drug use, crime, and incarceration; disrupt domestic drug production and trafficking; strengthen international law enforcement, intelligence, and civic partnerships; and enhance the use of science to inform program evaluation and policymaking.", "In addition to revising the orientation of the Strategy, ONDCP identifies three policy priorities where the Administration believes there can be substantial progress over the short term. These priorities include reducing prescription drug abuse, addressing drugged driving, and preventing drug use before it begins. The 2014 Strategy highlights certain issues that merit special attention, including the threat of new synthetic drugs and cooperation with international partners in combating transnational organized crime.", "In a review of ONDCP's revised Strategy and programs included in the federal drug control budget, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that \"[ONDCP] and federal agencies have not made progress toward achieving most of the goals articulated in the 2010 National Drug Strategy ... but are reported to be on track to implement most Strategy action items intended to support these goals.\" GAO also concluded that federal drug abuse programs are \"fragmented and overlapping\" and recommended that ONDCP assist federal agencies in coordinating efforts and reducing inefficiencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prescription Drug Abuse Action Plan", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration describes prescription drug abuse as the nation's fastest growing drug problem, and in 2011, released a prescription drug abuse plan, Epidemic: Responding to America's Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis .

Some action items included additional training and education for physicians and pharmacists, improved drug disposal programs, enhanced prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), and improved cooperation and information sharing among PDMPs.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospital visits for abuse of prescription drugs are now as common as hospital visits for abuse of illicit drugs.
