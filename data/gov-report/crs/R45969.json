Per Section 3312(a) of the PHSA, to be covered by the WTCHP and thus compensable under the VCF, a condition must be on the list of WTCHP-covered conditions and it must be determined that exposure in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks \"is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition.\" In most cases, the VCF requires that a person's condition be WTCHP certified for that condition to be compensable.", "The WTCHP provides standardized guidance to determine whether a person's condition was caused by exposure in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. This determination is based on a combination of the amount of time a person was physically present at a site and the specific activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as search and rescue, sleeping in a home in Lower Manhattan, or just passing through a site\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which the person engaged.

The WTCHP evaluates conditions that do not meet the minimum exposure criteria on a case-by-case basis using \"professional judgement\" and \"any relevant medical and/or scientific information.\"", "WTCHP-covered mental health conditions may not be used to establish VCF eligibility, as the VCF does not include any provisions for benefit payments for mental health conditions.

If the WTCHP administrator is petitioned to add conditions to the WTC-related health conditions' list, the administrator is required, within 90 days, to either request a recommendation on action from the WTC Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) or make a determination on adding the health condition.

Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand filed a petition, in the form of a letter to the WTCHP administrator, requesting that the administrator \"conduct an immediate review of new medical evidence showing increased cancer rates among firefighters who served at ground zero\" and that the administrator \"consider adding coverage for cancer under the Zadroga Act.\" In response to this petition, the WTC administrator requested that the STAC \"review the available information on cancer outcomes associated with the exposures resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and provide advice on whether to add cancer, or a certain type of cancer, to the List specified in the Zadroga Act.\" ", "On September 12, 2012, based on the STAC's recommendations, the WTCHP administrator added more than 60 types of cancer, covering nearly every body system and including any cancers in persons less than 20 years of age and any rare cancers, to the list of WTC-related health conditions, thus making these conditions compensable under the VCF. ", "In a review of the decision to add cancers to the list of WTC-related health conditions, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the WTCHP administrator used a hazards-based approach to evaluate cancers. This approach evaluated whether exposures in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were associated with types of cancer but did not evaluate the probability of developing cancer based on a given exposure. A GAO-convened scientific panel indicated that the hazards-based approach the WTCHP administrator used was reasonable given data constraints and the fact that there is a certification process to determine if a cancer or other condition on the WTC-related health list meets the statutory requirement of being \"substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition.\" The panel also indicated that this approach could have benefited from an independent peer review process. The WTCHP administrator stated that peer review was not possible given the statutory time constraints to act on the petition and the STAC's recommendation.
