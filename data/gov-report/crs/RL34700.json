When Congress and the President do not reach final decisions about one or more regular appropriations acts by the beginning of the federal fiscal year, October 1, they often enact a CR. Two general types of CRs are used. An \"interim\" CR provides agencies with stopgap funding for a period of time until final appropriations decisions are made, or until enactment of another interim CR. A \"full-year\" CR provides final funding amounts for the remainder of a fiscal year in lieu of one or more regular appropriations acts. \"Anomalies\" may be included in an interim CR to prevent what parties to CR negotiations perceive as major problems that would be caused if an otherwise uniform approach were used to provide funding and impose related restrictions. The President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and agencies often are involved with Congress in the process of formulating, negotiating, and implementing interim CRs. An implication of their involvement is that they may influence the potential impacts of interim CRs.", "Interim CRs typically are intended to both (1) preserve congressional prerogatives to make final decisions on full-year funding levels and (2) prevent a funding gap and corresponding government shutdown. Consequently, interim CRs provide relatively restrictive funding levels for agencies and usually prohibit projects or activities that were not funded in the previous year (sometimes called \"new starts\"). Interim CRs also impose some paperwork burden on federal agencies. Two other potential impacts might be identified. First, the restrictive funding level of an interim CR may impact upon an agency's activities, compared to the situation of receiving full-year appropriations. For example, agency personnel may reduce or delay a variety of actions, including hiring, award of contracts, and travel. Second, an agency funded by an interim CR may experience some uncertainty about what its final funding level will be. Uncertainty may cause an agency to alter its operations, rates of spending, and spending patterns over time, with potential ripple effects for internal management of the agency and its programmatic activities. Whether any potential impacts manifest themselves in actual cases would depend on specific circumstances, including how the interim CR is crafted, the time of year, and an agency's or program's particular operations. OMB and agency documents, as well as Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports, provide additional perspectives on potential impacts of interim CRs.", "Related issues for Congress may include use of anomalies to manage impacts, congressional access to information and views from agencies and their employees, and the assumptions that are used when assessing potential impacts.", "More extensive analysis on this subject is available in CRS Congressional Distribution Memorandum, Potential Impacts of Interim Continuing Resolutions (CRs) on Agency Operations and the Functioning of the Federal Government, coordinated by [author name scrubbed] (available on request).

An \"interim\" CR provides agencies with stopgap funding for a period of time until final appropriations decisions are made, or until enactment of another interim CR. A \"full-year\" CR, by contrast, provides final funding amounts for the remainder of a fiscal year in lieu of one or more regular appropriations acts. If interim or full-year appropriations are not enacted, a funding gap and government shutdown occur for affected agencies and programs.", "This report analyzes potential impacts that interim CRs might have on agency operations. CRs have become commonplace in the federal budget process, with CRs occurring in some form in all but four years out of a 61-year period from FY1952 to FY2012. However, studies of the impacts of interim CRs are quite limited aside from mostly anecdotal accounts. Furthermore, interim CRs are formulated differently from time to time, and may affect highly diverse agencies and programs in varying ways. Without in-depth analysis of specific circumstances, therefore, it may be difficult, or in many cases impossible, to make generalizable statements about the impacts of interim CRs on particular agencies at particular times.", "It is possible, however, to identify some potential impacts of interim CRs prospectively, utilizing several approaches. This report uses three. First, the report discusses how an interim CR's provisions and requirements may impact directly upon an agency, based on what an interim CR explicitly is formulated to do. Second, the report analyzes Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agency documents that have provided guidance or requirements for how an agency should navigate through periods of interim CRs. The existence and emphases of such documents may suggest the occurrence, or at least the risk of occurrence, of interim CR-related impacts on the operations of agencies. Third, the report analyzes brief mentions of claims of impact contained in Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports from a 20-year span, typically made by agency officials without independent GAO validation. In addition, a GAO report from 2009 provided the results of a case study, in which GAO evaluated the effects of interim CRs on six federal bureau-size agencies.", "The possibility that an interim CR might cause impacts may raise corresponding issues for Congress. One issue relates to the fact that the President, OMB, and agencies may play roles in the formulation, negotiation, and implementation of interim CRs. An implication of this involvement is that Congress typically does not solely determine what the impacts of an interim CR will be, because the President, OMB, and agencies may influence the nature and extent of potential impacts. Another issue relates to interim CRs as a product of high-stakes negotiation over major issues of fiscal and substantive policy. Claims about positive or negative impacts of CRs may be used to argue that changes in CR language, budget priorities, or the budget process are necessary. The ways in which such claims are framed, however, typically rest on implicit assumptions about what would have happened in the absence of the interim CR (e.g., a government shutdown, on one hand, or agreement on final appropriations, on the other). Viewing interim CRs as a product of high-stakes negotiation helps explain why differing assumptions sometimes may be plausible. Given the nature of budget deliberations and the potential for changes in the budget process to change power relationships among participants, the ways in which the impact of an interim CR may be framed might be viewed as similarly significant. The report's final section discusses these and other topics.", "Full-year CRs occur less frequently than interim CRs. Historically, the term \"CR\" has been used in different ways in the context of providing full-year appropriations amounts.

For this reason, full-year CRs generally are not discussed in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interim CRs and Their Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Usage of the term \"continuing resolution,\" like other budget terms, has varied sometimes to reflect evolving budget practices.

For agencies and programs that are funded through annual appropriations acts, appropriations must be enacted by this date if many governmental activities are to continue operating. These funds pay for most of the routine operations of federal agencies, including salaries, contracts, and grants. Final action on some of the regular appropriations acts is frequently delayed beyond October 1. A delay may occur, for example, when negotiations between Congress and the President have not resulted yet in final decisions. When action on one or more regular appropriations acts is incomplete after the beginning of a fiscal year, Congress often provides temporary funding for affected agencies by using an interim CR. The stopgap funding is available until a date specified in the CR, enactment of a new interim CR, or enactment of full-year appropriations, whichever occurs earliest. In this sense, the term \"continuing\" has been used to indicate that appropriations will continue at a certain level (and subject to certain conditions), pending further decisions.", "Interim CRs usually are enacted in the context of ongoing and high-stakes budget negotiations between Congress and the President and within Congress. In general, interim CRs typically are intended to (1) preserve congressional prerogatives to make final decisions on full-year funding levels and (2) prevent a funding gap and corresponding government shutdown. Consequently, interim CRs provide relatively restrictive funding levels for agencies. In addition, an interim CR may be structured purposefully as less than optimal from the perspective of many stakeholders, in order to retain sufficient incentive for negotiating parties to come to an accord for final decisions. Participants in a negotiation also may find it necessary to compromise, purposefully accepting what they perceive as some undesirable impacts in an interim CR (e.g., temporary constraints on funding) in order to achieve what they perceive as more important, desirable impacts (e.g., achievement of budget policy goals or avoidance of a government shutdown).

In contrast to regular and supplemental appropriations acts, an interim CR generally does not provide a specific amount of budget authority for an appropriations account for a specific time period of availability. Rather, an interim CR provides authority to obligate and spend funds at a statutorily prescribed pace, or \"rate,\" over time, for an appropriations account. More technically, an interim CR typically provides funding at a specified \"rate for operations\" for accounts covered by the CR. An agency may continue to obligate and spend funds at this rate for the duration of the interim CR\u2014that is, until the CR expires or is superseded. The interim CR uses a formula to calculate this rate. These formulas, which are based on annual amounts or levels of spending, may be set in various ways. For example, funding has been based on formulas such as (1) the lower of the amounts provided in the House-passed version or Senate-passed version of the bill (assuming both houses have acted); (2) the amounts provided in a particular committee-reported bill; or (3) the funding levels available for the previous fiscal year. Interim CRs frequently provide rates that vary among the regular appropriations bills funded. Under an interim CR's formula, an agency that ultimately expects to receive a substantial increase in its full-year funding level compared to the previous year typically would be subject to rate restrictions and would not receive the increased level of funding for the duration of the interim CR, unless special exceptions were made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Apportionment", "paragraphs": ["After enactment of an interim CR, OMB provides detailed directions to executive agencies on the availability of funds and how to proceed with budget execution, typically in a bulletin. The bulletin includes announcement of an \"automatic apportionment\" of funds that will be made available for obligation, as a percentage of the annualized amount provided by the CR. Under a typical OMB bulletin, part of the annualized amount is apportioned and made available for obligation. Funds usually are apportioned either in proportion to the time period of the fiscal year covered by the CR, or according to the historical, seasonal rate of obligations for the period of the year covered by the CR, whichever is lower. A 30-day CR might, therefore, provide 30 days worth of funding, derived either from a certain annualized amount that is set by formula or from a historical spending pattern. In an interim CR, Congress also may provide authority for OMB to mitigate furloughs of federal employees by apportioning funds for personnel compensation and benefits at a higher rate for operations, albeit with some restrictions.

Partial shutdowns of the federal government in FY1996, however, were more far-reaching in their effects. A five-day shutdown in November 1995 resulted in the furlough of an estimated 800,000 federal employees. A second, 21-day shutdown occurred a month later, resulting in the furlough of nearly 300,000 federal employees.

At least three funding scenarios appear to be possible for an agency that is funded by an interim CR: (1) less funding than otherwise would have been provided under a full-year appropriation (or, essentially, a lower rate for operations during the CR's duration); (2) more funding; or (3) the same amount. For example, suppose an agency anticipated an increase in its full-year budget because of apparent consensus on a higher prospective funding level among the House, Senate, and President. Further suppose, however, that the agency's budget is included in a legislative vehicle that is the subject of some controversy due to budget or programmatic issues elsewhere in the legislation. If the level of policy conflict among the House, Senate, and President were such that an interim CR were used to provide funding until disagreements were resolved, the agency might receive a considerably lower rate for operations than was anticipated for the duration of the CR. Assuming a final funding decision were made at the anticipated level, an agency might or might not be able to \"catch up\" with what it had planned to do. By contrast, if an agency expected a lower full-year amount than the rate that was provided by an interim CR, the agency might experience more flexibility than previously had been anticipated for the duration of the CR. Finally, if an agency expected flat funding from one year to another, there might be little or no impact associated with an interim CR's funding amount. In the face of a restrictive funding level, agency personnel may reduce or delay a variety of actions, including hiring, award of contracts, and travel.

Both Circular No. A-11 and OMB's occasional bulletins address this point. During a CR of extended duration, there is some risk of \"major disruptions to essential government services\" if care is not taken to conduct acquisitions using certain practices and \"basic steps.\" According to OMB, these practices and steps include determining the availability of funding for existing and new contract requirements; modifying existing contracts as required by the \"fiscal constraints imposed by the CR\"; giving contractors and especially small businesses appropriate notice of funding limitations; following \"prudent contracting principles and practices\" to ensure available funds are used \"as efficiently and effectively as possible\" and to \"minimize disruption of agency operations\"; and funding only ongoing projects and activities, \"not new initiatives or projects.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Documents", "paragraphs": ["Agency documents that provide guidance and impose requirements for how to operate under an interim CR appear to range from the highly elaborate to the more ad hoc.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has integrated CRs and shutdowns into its instructions and process diagrams on budget execution. Smaller entities have created their own guidance memoranda and \"instruction\" documents. Agencies also may issue documents advising on the status of grant awards under a CR, and providing advice to federal and state officials on how to make timely grant awards under a CR.

There is some risk that agency spending may exceed congressionally directed minimal amounts in some situations, making it necessary to caution agency personnel to restrain spending even if both Senate and House versions of appropriations bills may provide for an increase. Although an agency may have the tools and policies to award grants in a timely way when operating under an interim CR, and even improve the timeliness of awards to states under current policies, it is nevertheless \"more difficult ... to make timely awards while the Agency operates under a series of short continuing resolutions, but it is still possible.\" There is some risk that stakeholders and grant recipients will not know that grant awards may not be fully funded until enactment of full-year appropriations.

Hiring delays may have affected some agencies' abilities to conduct all planned activities (e.g., food and medical device inspections). Agencies reported also that longer-term interim CRs delayed contracts for nonrecurring projects or compressed the time available for discretionary grants. However, some agencies shifted their contract and grant cycles to later in the fiscal year to reduce the amount of additional work required to modify contracts and award grants in multiple installments. Long-term CRs may allow for better planning in the near term, compared to a series of short-term interim CRs.

However, anomalies frequently are not included for many programs in interim CRs. A potential explanation for the rarity of anomalies is that the granting of too many anomalies would reduce incentives to negotiate seriously and come to final agreement on full-year appropriations.

In this case, the claim of impact implicitly assumes a scenario under which, in the absence of an interim CR, full-year appropriations would have been passed by October 1. Passage of full-year appropriations, in turn, would have eliminated uncertainty about funding. However, it also may be plausible that absence of a CR might instead cause an impasse in negotiations and a government shutdown, rather than enactment of full-year appropriations, rendering the observer's claim contestable. The reverse argument may also be made. Suppose another observer characterized an interim CR as having prevented a government shutdown. However, it may be plausible that absence of a CR might cause negotiators to reach agreement on full-year appropriations, thereby avoiding the shutdown without need for a CR.", "Claims of an impact or lack of impact can be debatable, therefore, and become subjects of scrutiny or even controversy. Some observers, for example, might question the validity of an assumption. An observer might be partly motivated to raise such objections, because claims of impacts may generate an argument that a change in budget priorities or the budget process is necessary in order to avoid or modify some purported impact. Viewing interim CRs as a product of negotiation, in which parties may come to the table with different underlying values and assumptions, helps explain why differing perspectives may be plausible. It is conceivable, for example, that participants in a negotiation may hold opposite perspectives about the impact of an interim CR in a particular situation. Each participant's views might be based both on his or her aspirations for the outcome of negotiations and the negotiating leverage the participant believes he or she could wield. In other words, because there typically is some uncertainty about the outcome of any negotiation, contrasting viewpoints may be plausible until decisions are made."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
