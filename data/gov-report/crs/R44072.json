The reclamation has created over 2,000 acres (809 hectares) of artificial landmasses on Chinese-occupied reefs that are disputed between several countries and are located in some of the world's most heavily trafficked waters. China announced on June 16, 2015, that its reclamation work would be completed \"in the upcoming days,\" and that when reclamation was finished, it would turn to building facilities on the newly created artificial islands.", "The reclamation activity continues a series of assertive actions by China in the South China Sea as Beijing seeks to more actively stress its sovereignty claims in the area. These actions have led the U.S. government to argue that China is seeking to strengthen its maritime territorial claims using threats, coercion, and other actions that fall short of direct conflict. This, some observers argue, raises the question of whether the United States has developed a strategy for countering Chinese actions, and if so, whether that strategy is adequate. China states that its activities are legal, reflecting its claim of sovereignty over the affected features, and notes that other South China Sea claimants have also reclaimed areas on features that they occupy.", "The reclamation and construction has military/operational, diplomatic, and legal implications. The Chinese government has stated that the work is intended to fulfill \"the need of necessary military defense,\" as well as to serve non-military purposes. China's plans to use the artificial islands for military purposes could affect U.S. strategy in the Asia-Pacific. The activity has complicated diplomatic processes intended to lower tensions in the region, and legal processes under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), that could bring clarity to disputes over maritime rights in the area.

These actions have led the U.S. government to argue that China is seeking to strengthen its maritime territorial claims using threats, coercion, and other actions that fall short of direct conflict. U.S. officials point to Chinese actions including more extensive patrols by Chinese maritime authorities and other Chinese vessels, the blockading of some disputed features by Chinese maritime authorities, the announcement of fishing bans, energy exploration in disputed waters, and now the reclamation and infrastructure improvements on several Chinese-controlled features. In the view of many experts, these actions have substantially heightened regional tensions and raised the potential of military conflict in some of the world's most heavily trafficked waters, through which around $5 trillion in ship-borne commerce passes each year.

It points out that other claimants, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Taiwan, have also reclaimed land and fortified features in the area; that one claimant, Vietnam, occupies considerably more features in the Spratlys than China does; and that others have constructed airstrips and based troops on features they control. ", "Other observers, including U.S. government officials, argue that the scale of China's current reclamation dwarfs that by any other actor in the South China Sea and is inconsistent with the (non-binding) 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC).

Among them:", "Is the reclamation activity legal? What are its implications for China's ability to make arguments about its sovereignty and maritime rights in the area? What are China's motivations for pursuing reclamation activity now? Does the reclamation activity improve China's ability to operate military and other assets further from the Chinese coast, and what would this ability allow the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and other Chinese institutions to do? Does the reclamation threaten or affect U.S. interests including freedom of navigation and freedom of the high seas? Does the reclamation substantially change the status of diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions and resolve sovereignty disputes in the region? How does Chinese reclamation activity affect U.S. strategy in the region? What are the appropriate responses for the United States?", "CRS consulted with U.S. government and outside experts on the legal, military/operational, diplomatic, and economic implications of China's activities. Among CRS's findings are the following.", "Although others, including Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, have also reclaimed and/or reinforced land features in the area, China's reclamation is by far the most extensive any nation has undertaken on disputed features in the South China Sea. It is difficult to judge the legality of the Chinese reclamation activity, given that sovereignty over the features affected is not settled. Reclamation, per se, is not illegal on features over which a nation has sovereignty. However, each of the features is claimed by at least two parties, so each is clearly disputed. Moreover, some features in their original form may not have extended above water at high tide, meaning no sovereignty claim to those features is recognized under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Under UNCLOS, the reclamation does not allow China to claim broader 200-nautical-mile EEZs around the reclaimed landmasses. The most that a nation could claim around any of the features is territorial waters extending 12 nautical miles from the feature, and this is only claimable if, before reclamation began, the reef included features above water at all times. So far China has not asserted new legal claims based on its artificial island building. China has so far confined its latest wave of reclamation and construction work to features it already occupied in the Spratly Island chain. It does not appear to have sought to carry out such work on features it did not previously control, including those occupied by other claimants. The reclamation arguably violates the spirit of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and makes discussions over a potential Code of Conduct more difficult. The reclamation includes areas under consideration in an ongoing UNCLOS arbitration case, in which the Philippines seeks a ruling on the legality of Chinese claims and behavior in the South China Sea. The Philippines has asked for a ruling on the legal status of each of the features under reclamation, among others. Such a ruling could clarify the rights of all parties in areas surrounding the features. The reclamation efforts could improve China's ability to maintain ship and aircraft operations in the region on a day-to-day basis, including patrols of disputed features in the South China Sea, and to conduct combat operations in the region. China could use one or more of the reclamation sites as locations for anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems, including radars, electronic listening equipment, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), and manned and unmanned aircraft. China may be undertaking reclamation now in a way that it did not previously in part because of its development of more sophisticated dredging capabilities that make it easier for it to perform such work far from the Chinese mainland."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Implications of Chinese Reclamation", "paragraphs": ["One set of questions surrounding China's reclamation and construction activity is whether it can be considered legal, what additional rights China may seek to claim based on the features, and whether the activity in any way hinders the rights of other parties to navigate in the waters and airspace surrounding the features. ", "International law, as embodied in UNCLOS, governs the rights of states with respect to maritime zones, which are defined in terms of proximity to a coastal state. China and other claimants, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei, are parties to UNCLOS, although under the terms of Beijing's accession it did not agree to many of the convention's dispute resolution mechanisms. The United States is not a party to the convention, but it has said it abides by most of the convention's terms for claiming maritime rights. With respect to maritime disputes, the United States has consistently stated that it takes no position on the specific sovereignty questions but urges the parties involved to resolve the disputes peacefully, according to international law, and to refrain from using coercion, force, or threat to strengthen their claims.", "UNCLOS recognizes that coastal states may claim maritime zones in which they may exercise certain rights:", "Territorial Sea : A coastal state is entitled to claim a belt of sea adjacent to its coast as its \"territorial sea.\" This territorial sea may extend up to 12 nautical miles from the coast, and in this belt of sea the coastal state may exercise full sovereignty. (UNCLOS articles 2-3) Contiguous Zone : A coastal state may also establish a zone adjacent to its territorial sea as a \"contiguous zone.\" Within this zone, the coastal state is not sovereign, but it may exercise the control necessary to prevent and punish infringements of the customs, fiscal, immigration, and sanitary laws and regulations that apply in its territorial sea. The contiguous zone may extend up to 24 nautical miles from the coast. (UNCLOS article 33) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) : A coastal state may claim a belt of sea up to 200 nautical miles from its coast as its \"exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\" In this area, the coastal state is entitled to exercise \"sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living\" of the sea, the seabed, and the subsoil of the seabed. (UNCLOS articles 55-57) The coastal state also has the \"exclusive right to construct and to authorize and regulate the construction, operation and use of\" artificial islands and certain other installations. (UNCLOS article 60) Continental Shelf : UNCLOS recognizes the legal right of every coastal state to control and exploit the natural resources of its continental shelf as determined under the UNCLOS Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, up to 350 miles from its coast. (UNCLOS articles 76-77)", "Under UNCLOS article 121, these maritime zones may extend not only from the primary land area of a coastal state, but also from any islands over which it is sovereign. An island is defined as a \"naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide.\" (Article 21) However, \"rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own\" are entitled only to a 12-mile territorial sea, not an EEZ or continental shelf. Elevations that are submerged at high tide and artificial islands do not establish rights in adjacent waters.", "The construction of an artificial island may raise legal questions if it takes place within the EEZ of another state. In contrast, land reclamation related to features located in the high seas appears to be permissible under UNCLOS. Consequently, the permissibility of China's land reclamation activities depends on the delimitation of zones among the surrounding states. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan without controlling it, and Taiwan occupies Itu Aba, the largest natural feature in the Spratlys chain and widely acknowledged to be a natural island according to the UNCLOS definition. At a stretch, therefore, China might seek to claim an EEZ linked to Itu Aba that would overlap the EEZ of the Philippines island of Palawan, meaning that China conceivably could try to argue that none of its activities impinge the exclusive rights of the Philippines. Chinese scholars routinely refer to Itu Aba as among eight Chinese-occupied features in the Spratlys chain, but China has not explicitly spelled out an EEZ claim linked to Itu Aba.", "In the cases of China's current land reclamation activities in the South China Sea, it appears that the most China could hope to establish would be a 12-mile belt of territorial waters surrounding features that qualified as rocks prior to the land reclamation efforts. Prior to reclamation, none of the original features appears to have been a natural island that could support human habitation of its own, and artificial islands do not generate their own maritime zones.", "However, due to the complex nature of the tidal regime in the South China Sea, it may be difficult to establish which features stood above water at high tide prior to reclamation, which would affect any claim of sovereignty over such features (as nations cannot claim sovereignty over low-tide elevations) as well as the location of basepoints from which to measure any maritime rights. This is one of the Philippines' concerns about the reclamation, as the Philippine-initiated case currently being considered by an UNCLOS Arbitral Tribunal asked the tribunal for rulings on whether or not each of the original features qualified for any sovereignty claims and maritime rights.", "China has not stated whether it will claim an EEZ from any of the enlarged features. While China's land reclamation efforts could create some ambiguity with respect to whether certain features are naturally formed rocks rather than elevations submerged at high tide, it seems unlikely that China could establish that the features were always capable of sustaining human habitation or economic activity so as to qualify as full-fledged islands that would be entitled to an EEZ. ", "While China's land reclamation projects in areas that constitute high seas may not be illegal, they could implicate China's obligations under UNCLOS regarding preservation of the marine environment. UNCLOS article 194 obligates states parties to \"take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment,\" including measures \"necessary to protect and preserve rare or fragile ecosystems as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered species and other forms of marine life.\" Some experts believe that China's dredging of the ocean floor near features in the South China Sea is harming coral reefs and other components of the local marine ecology. It has been suggested that a legal challenge to Chinese activities based on their environmental effects could prove viable inasmuch as it could be pursued without contesting maritime boundaries, improving the chances that jurisdiction would be found.", "The South China Sea DOC does not directly address land reclamation to transform features into artificial islands. However, parties to it undertake to \"exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability including, among others, refraining from action of inhabiting on the presently uninhabited islands, reefs, shoals, cays, and other features and to handle their differences in a constructive manner.\" China's land reclamation efforts arguably violate the general spirit of cooperation and self-restraint embodied in the DOC, which will likely make further diplomatic efforts to lower tensions or promote confidence-building cooperative projects more difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military/Operational Implications", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["China's land reclamation efforts in the South China Sea could improve China's ability to maintain ship and aircraft operations in the region on a day-to-day basis, and to conduct combat operations in the region if need be.

At present, PLA Navy and China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels operating in the South China Sea must return to bases along the Chinese coast to resupply, conduct major repairs, and give sailors shore leave. Bases in the Spratlys could permit China to bring in fuel, supplies, and replacement parts, and then transfer them to Chinese vessels operating in the area, improving the fraction of time deployed that these vessels are able to conduct operations. This fraction could further be increased by stationing ships at these facilities and rotating successive crews to the ships\u2014a practice that the U.S. Navy has employed or plans to employ for mine warfare ships stationed in the Persian Gulf and for Littoral Combat Ships to be stationed at Singapore. The enhanced facilities could also mitigate the logistical challenges of energy exploration by Chinese companies in the southern part of the South China Sea. As discussed in a CRS report, Chinese fishing boats on some occasions have harassed and confronted non-Chinese vessels. Many analysts believe that the PRC government directs and controls certain fishing vessels. An increased Chinese fishing boat presence in the area could thus have potential implications not only for Chinese fishing operations, but also for China's ability to enforce its maritime claims in the region.

[its] ability to berth deeper draft ships at its outposts and thus to expand its law enforcement and naval presence further south in the South China Sea.... \" By strengthening its operational capabilities in the area, China may hope to discourage rivals from challenging its territorial claims.

In addition, these bases may have limited capacity for repairing battle damage, and could be difficult to resupply from the mainland, particularly if opposing forces cut air and sea lines of communication. In general, destroying or disabling a base would be more difficult for the armed forces of a Southeast Asian country than for the U.S. military.

This diversion of assets would likely occur in the opening stages of a conflict, when the United States might have a limited number of on-scene assets.

He defended the scale of China's reclamation and construction work by stating, \"As a major country, the scale and pace of its construction is in line with the international responsibilities and obligations China assumes in the South China Sea.\" He added that China had \"exercised enormous restraint\" in its handling of maritime disputes.", "In his June 16, 2015, statement announcing the planned end to China's reclamation work, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lu Kang said that \"as planned\" the work would be completed \"in the upcoming days.\" Then, he said, \"we will start the building of facilities to meet functional requirements.\" The statement also reiterated elements of the previous statements. Specifically, Lu claimed that China's activities", "\"fall within the scope of China's sovereignty, and are lawful, reasonable and justified\"; \"do not affect the freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in accordance with international law in the South China Sea\"; and have not and will not \"cause damage to the marine ecological system and environment in the South China Sea.\"", "As for China's intentions, Lu repeated that \"Apart from satisfying the need of necessary military defense, the main purpose of China's construction activities is to meet various civilian demands and better perform China's international obligations and responsibilities.... \"", "On June 17, 2015, China's official Xinhua News Agency cited China's National Development and Reform Commission as saying that civil facilities China plans to build on the artificial islands include lighthouses, radio navigation stations, and \"[f]acilities used for environmental observation, disaster prevention and alleviation, transportation and logistical support.\" Xinhua quoted the NDRC as saying such facilities \"are meant to ensure local civil needs, provide the international community with public services like assistance and salvage at sea, and promote international cooperation on maritime scientific research.\" China has not disclosed its plans for military facilities.", "China has not so far asserted new legal claims based on its artificial island building. After the United States flew a P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance plane near the reclaimed features, with a CNN crew on board, China objected to the flight, but not in legal terms. Rather, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said reconnaissance by U.S. military aircraft \"poses a potential threat to the security of China's maritime features, and is highly likely to cause miscalculation, or even untoward maritime and aerial incidents.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unofficial Chinese Commentary", "paragraphs": ["The theme of restraint is common in Chinese narratives related to the reclamation work. They generally depict China as playing catch-up to rival claimants, who are portrayed as having engaged in decades of construction and land reclamation work on features in the sea, as well as exploitation of economic resources, including oil. The United States is portrayed as having turned a blind eye to this activity. The narrative presented in a December 2014 article by the Dongguan Daily 's military analyst is representative:", "China has always taken a cautious approach, adhered to the 'Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea,' and avoided 'showdowns,' but China's restraint has not been reciprocated. With the support of external big powers, some neighboring countries in the South China Sea have further intensified [their efforts] and 'staked out' the South China Sea. In the face of such an urgent situation, China has realized that just relying on diplomatic declarations of sovereignty and protests is insufficient to stop intensified encroachment on [China's] interests, and so in recent years, China has started to change its thinking about rights protection.", "Chinese accounts often claim the following points.", "China occupies just 7 features in the Spratly Islands group, while Vietnam occupies 29, the Philippines 8, Malaysia 5, and Taiwan 1. (Non-Chinese sources sometimes give different numbers.) Chinese officials routinely refer to other claimants who occupy features in the Spratlys as having \"illegally invaded and occupied\" China's islands and reefs. The number of features Vietnam occupies in the Spratly Islands, and the number of troops it has stationed on them, both grew substantially over the 1990s. By one Chinese account, in 1993 Vietnam occupied 24 features and had 600 soldiers stationed on them; by 2002, Vietnam occupied 29 features and had as many as 2,020 soldiers stationed on them. Even before China's recent reported construction of an airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef, four other claimants had already built airfields big enough for large fighter planes on features they control in the Spratly Islands. Those airfields are on Itu Aba Island, occupied by Taiwan; Spratly Island, occupied by Vietnam; Thitu Island, occupied by the Philippines; and Swallow Reef, occupied by Malaysia. China and Brunei are the only claimants that do not currently have operational air bases in the Spratlys. Other countries have engaged in significant land reclamation on disputed features in the Spratly Islands since the 1970s. China's Foreign Ministry has charged, for example, that Vietnam \"carried out large-scale reclamation on over 20 maritime features\" in the Spratly Islands and \"built on them a considerable amount of fixed facilities such as harbor basins, airstrip, missile bases, office buildings, barracks, hotels and lighthouses.\" The ministry also raised the Philippines' construction of an airport and dock at Thitu Island. Other claimants allegedly have drilled 1,380 oil wells in the South China Sea, with annual production as high as 423 million barrels (50 million tonnes). China says it has drilled no wells, although since 2012, it has several times sent its Haiyang Shiyou 981 platform into the South China Sea to explore for oil and natural gas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of New Technology", "paragraphs": ["Chinese reports credit new technology for China's success in rapidly transforming Chinese-controlled features in the Spratlys.

(See image below.) According to reports on the website of the vessel's designer and owner, the Tianjing was designed by Shanghai Jiaotong University and the German engineering firm Vosta LMG and built by China Merchants Heavy Industry Yard in Shenzhen between April 28, 2008 and January 2010. It is now the third largest self-propelled cutter suction dredger in the world, and the largest in Asia, with the ability to dredge to a depth of 30 meters (98 feet) and to move 4,500 cubic meters (159,000 cubic feet) of clay, compacted sand, gravel, and rocks per hour. Because it is self-propelled, it can make its own way to the southern part of the South China Sea, unlike non-self-propelled vessels, which need to be towed. Once in place, the Tianjing can easily shuttle among all the Spratlys reefs that China occupies.", "Writing on a popular Chinese news aggregator site, Guancha , commentator Shi Yang reported that the Tianjing spent 193 days moving among five reefs in the Spratly Island group between September 2013 and June 2014. Shi estimated that in that time, the Tianjing blasted more than 10 million cubic meters (13 million cubic yards) of sand and sea water onto the reefs, or the equivalent of three times the volume of concrete used to build the Hoover Dam. \"In this reclamation contest involving national will and capacity, where China is coming from behind, the advanced technology and superior products of the industrial departments will undoubtedly be crucial,\" Shi wrote.
