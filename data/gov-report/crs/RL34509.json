That government, which includes members of the former opposition, has improved economic and humanitarian conditions during its ongoing transitional rule. However, significant concerns about the country's political future remain. Zimbabwe's March 2008 elections resulted in the party of long-serving President Mugabe losing its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai received more votes than Mugabe in the presidential race, but fell short of the needed margin for victory. Tsvangirai later withdrew his name from the ballot days before the required runoff, amid widespread political violence. Mugabe was thus declared the winner. In September 2008, after weeks of negotiations, Tsvangirai and Mugabe reached an agreement to form a unity government, with Mugabe remaining head of state. Tsvangirai became prime minister and cabinet and gubernatorial positions were divided among the parties. Disputes delayed implementation of the agreement until February 2009, when members of the opposition were sworn in alongside former rivals as ministers in a new government.", "The parties to the power-sharing agreement have faced significant challenges in working together to promote political reconciliation and in addressing serious economic and humanitarian needs. The high level of political violence and repression that followed the 2008 elections has subsided, but serious human rights abuses continue. The nascent recovery of the economy, which effectively collapsed in 2008, is tenuous. Zimbabwe is in debt distress, and the official unemployment rate remains over 90%. Humanitarian conditions have improved in the past three years, but localized food insecurity and high chronic malnutrition rates persist. Poor water and sanitation conditions led in 2008 to a nationwide cholera outbreak that killed over 4,000 people, and despite improvements, one-third of rural Zimbabweans still lack clean drinking water. Deteriorating conditions in the country over the past decade led many Zimbabweans to immigrate to neighboring countries, and these economic and political migrants continue to place a substantial burden on the region.", "International donors welcomed the power sharing agreement, but have been cautious in reengaging the government. They have predicated a resumption of significant donor aid on additional political reforms. Many remain skeptical that true power sharing exists in the government, which includes several officials from the previous administration. Some question the commitment of the former ruling party, seen as autocratic and repressive by critics, to reform. Foreign investors also remain wary, amid uncertainty regarding the timetable for new elections, tentatively expected in 2012. Substantial movement on outstanding reforms is unlikely at least until after the elections are held.", "The U.S. government has been critical of Mugabe and members of his former regime for their lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law, and has enforced targeted sanctions against top government officials and associates since 2002. The United States has, at the same time, provided substantial humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe. Congress articulated its opposition to the Mugabe government's undemocratic policies in the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA; P.L. 107-99) and subsequent legislation. Some in Congress have proposed policy changes in recent years, suggesting that U.S. sanctions be modified to reflect Zimbabwe's current political construct, while others remain unconvinced that sufficient reform has occurred.

Rising inflation and unemployment rates contributed in the late 1990s to the creation of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The MDC enjoyed initial success, campaigning against a referendum in 2000 that would have expanded the president's powers, made government officials immune from prosecution, and allowed the uncompensated seizure of white-owned land for redistribution to black farmers. The referendum failed, and the MDC won nearly half the parliamentary seats in that year's election. Members of ZANU-PF have since taken numerous, often undemocratic actions to maintain power. ", "Zimbabwe's most recent elections were held in 2008. They were very controversial and sparked serious political violence that illustrated the deep divide between ZANU-PF and the opposition. After months of uncertainty following a September 2008 power-sharing deal known as the Global Political Agreement (GPA), ZANU-PF and the MDC reached a final accord in January 2009. It led to the creation of a coalition government, with senior positions divided among the parties. Given long-standing tensions between ZANU-PF and the MDC, many observers continue to express skepticism that the parties truly share power. Initial reforms by the current government have stemmed Zimbabwe's runaway inflation rate and stabilized the economy, but significant challenges to the country's recovery remain. South Africa has led regional mediation efforts to address the parties' outstanding concerns. Both parties have agreed to hold national elections in 2012, although a date has yet to be set. The electoral process is expected to be tense. ", "This report provides an overview of the transitional government and related recent developments.

Dubbed \"the world's fastest shrinking economy,\" Zimbabwe saw its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decline over 50% between 2000 and 2009. After several years of hyperinflation, the country's official inflation rate had risen to a level at which prices doubled in less than 24 hours. Zimbabwe's economy had effectively collapsed, a situation that President Mugabe has frequently blamed on Western sanctions. Critics contend Zimbabwe's economic troubles stem from years of poor governance and mismanagement. ", "Today, Zimbabwe continues to face serious political and economic challenges. Over 90% of the population lacks formal employment. Life expectancy for Zimbabweans has fallen significantly in the past 20 years, in part due to a high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate. Some 7 million Zimbabweans required food aid in early 2009, and, while the situation has since improved, localized food insecurity persists. The breakdown of the country's dilapidated water and sewage systems contributed to an outbreak of cholera in late 2008 that resulted in several thousand deaths and infected almost 100,000. In 2009, over half the population had little or no access to safe drinking water or sanitation. Despite over $50 million in subsequent donor interventions to rehabilitate these systems, the risk of waterborne disease remains high, with one in three rural Zimbabweans still lacking access to clean drinking water. More than 3 million people are estimated to have emigrated in the last decade, including up to half of the country's doctors and nurses. Many hospitals and clinics continue to lack medicines, supplies, and functioning equipment. The public education system has suffered a major decline. Teachers receive wages that are a fraction of those earned by their regional counterparts. Repeated threats by teachers and other civil servants to strike for higher wages continue to pose a challenge for the transitional government as it struggles to raise state revenues to address competing budget priorities.", "Flawed elections in 2008 and subsequent months of widespread political violence left the country's political rivals bitterly at odds. At that time, the government of Zimbabwe, considered to be authoritarian by the U.S. State Department and others, found few allies in the international community; several countries, including Botswana, refused to recognize its legitimacy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Power-Sharing Agreement", "paragraphs": ["Questions surrounding the legitimacy of the Zimbabwe government in the wake of the March and June 2008 elections (see Appendix ) left the country mired in political uncertainty for the remainder of that year.

When the parliament was sworn in on August 25, Lovemore Moyo from Tsvangirai's faction of the MDC (known as MDC-T) was elected speaker. ", "On September 15, 2008, after several weeks of negotiations overseen by Mbeki, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing arrangement, the Global Political Agreement (GPA), to resolve the political standoff by establishing a unity government and outlining a time frame for the drafting and adoption of a new constitution. As part of the deal, Tsvangirai would become prime minister in a new unity government, and cabinet positions would be divided among the parties. Mugabe, who remains head of state under the arrangement, would lead the cabinet, but Tsvangirai, as chair of a new Council of Ministers, would be responsible for the day-to-day management of government affairs. Early reports claimed that Tsvangirai would gain control of the police force, while Mugabe would retain control of the armed forces. The text of the agreement, however, left the oversight of the police, which falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs, undetermined, and ZANU-PF refused to relinquish the position. ", "In the months after the agreement was signed, the MDC accused the government of abducting and torturing over 40 opposition and civil society leaders, including human rights activist Jestina Mukuko. Her whereabouts were unknown for three weeks before she was presented in court on charges of treason (see \" Human Rights Abuses \" below). Southern African leaders continued to call on the parties to implement the agreement and to share the Home Affairs Ministry, but Tsvangirai, citing the continued harassment of his colleagues, declared the deal to be unworkable. After Mugabe announced plans to name a new cabinet with or without Tsvangirai's participation, Southern African leaders renewed efforts to bring the parties together, and on January 31, amid reports of significant internal debate among the MDC leadership, Morgan Tsvangirai announced that he would join Mugabe in a transitional coalition government.

The positions were created as part of a constitutional amendment approved unanimously by the legislature to formalize the coalition government and the GPA. The controversial Ministry of Home Affairs, which oversees the police service, is now co-chaired by an MDC and a ZANU-PF minister, but the MDC's ability to affect change within the police, still led by a ZANU-PF loyalist, remains in question. The MDC factions gained control of several key ministries, including Finance, Public Service, Water, Energy and Power Development, Public Works, Health, Education, Commerce, and State Enterprises, which oversees parastatals. The party expressed its intention to use the Ministry of Constitutional and Parliamentary Affairs to press for its goal of constitutional reform. ", "Despite the MDC's purported role as a co-equal partner in government, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on several outstanding reforms demanded by donors. Critics of the previous regime suggest that Mugabe and his allies did not enter into this government in good faith. International donors have repeatedly stated that a resumption of significant aid will depend on both economic and democratic reforms, the restoration of the rule of law, and a demonstrated respect for human rights. Without an influx of considerable foreign funds, many analysts suggest Zimbabwe will struggle to return its economic and social indicators to pre-crisis levels.", "The duration of the coalition government was not explicitly defined in the power-sharing agreement, and a considerable amount of political uncertainty regarding the government's future remains.

Elections are expected to be held several months after the planned referendum, but a timeline for the polls was not provided in the GPA.

Inflation has remained at single digit levels since 2009. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and others suggest that reforms on the macroeconomic front are encouraging, but the situation remains fragile. The IMF estimates decelerated growth in 2011, however, barring further policy corrections. The adoption of hard currencies (predominantly the U.S. dollar and the South African rand) stabilized prices in 2009 and stemmed a previously rampant inflation rate. The local currency has become effectively worthless. The \"dollarization\" of the economy, combined with the elimination of price controls, allowed shopkeepers to restock their shelves with basic goods in 2009, but the cost of living remains high. Some retailers are again offering credit to customers, a practice that had been suspended in 2007. ", "Under the direction of Minister Biti, the government began issuing government \"salaries\" in vouchers good for $100 U.S. dollars, regardless of seniority, in late February 2009. Absenteeism within the civil service had reportedly reached 50% in the latter half of 2008 as salaries went unpaid, and Biti and Prime Minister Tsvangirai pledged to pay these allowances in an effort to get Zimbabweans to return to work. The vouchers encouraged many civil servants to return, including, notably, the country's teachers, who had been on strike for months. Some progression has been subsequently introduced into the salary structure and wages have been periodically raised, but they remain low by regional salary standards, and the country's unions have repeatedly pressed for further increases. ", "A cash budgeting policy implemented by Minister Biti in 2009 restored fiscal discipline, although revenues remain limited and wage overruns have caused the government to operate with a deficit since 2010. Revenue generation has improved in the past three years, but the government continues to struggle with a large public wage bill that leaves little for public services or infrastructure repairs. With the assistance of the World Bank, the Finance Ministry has conducted a payroll audit to address concerns that ghost workers have been collecting salaries. The results of that audit, which found 38,000 positions with significant irregularities, including potentially 14,000 ghost workers, have been rejected by President Mugabe and ZANU-PF. The ghost worker issue, along with concerns about the government's indigenization policy and the liquidity of banks, are reportedly among the main issues impeding an agreement between the IMF and the government on an IMF Staff Monitored Program, which would aim to help Zimbabwe establish a track record of strong policies and address its debt distress.", "In March 2009, the transitional government introduced the Short Term Emergency Recovery Program (STERP), designed to stabilize Zimbabwe's economy by identifying priority areas as targets for policy reforms and donor assistance. The program also identified key areas of the economy, including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and tourism, as anchors of the stabilization effort and stressed the need to promote production and increase capacity in those sectors. By most accounts, STERP has been successful\u2014the World Economic Forum's 2011 Global Competitiveness Report , for example, asserts that the economy has made a nascent recovery. STERP was followed in 2010 by a three-year medium-term policy framework, STERP II, aiming to consolidate the recovery efforts begun in the previous year and move Zimbabwe from stabilization to growth and development. In July 2011, the Finance Ministry introduced a Medium Term Plan (MTP) to follow STERP with a longer-term approach to fiscal planning.

Some donors are providing off-budget assistance for certain sectors in an effort to provide targeted assistance and avoid contributing to the country's entrenched patronage system. The Finance Ministry has coordinated with some donors to identify budget lines (water, education, sanitation, etc.) for which they might assume payouts. Such a strategy requires strong donor coordination, and to that end the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) developed a multi-donor trust fund, which is administered by the AfDB in coordination with the Finance Ministry.

Central bank governance remains an issue of primary concern to donors. According to the IMF, the quasi-fiscal activities of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), under the management of RBZ Governor Gideon Gono, were primarily responsible for the surge in the country's money supply up to 2008. After the government implemented price controls in June 2007, cutting prices of basic commodities by 50% in an effort to stem inflation, manufacturing output fell more than 50% within six months and many firms were forced to close. The price controls also resulted in a shortage of basic goods and contributed to worsening social indicators. The previous government's \"fast track\" land reform effort, which included the uncompensated seizure of white-owned farms, and recent local ownership regulations have both contributed to significant uncertainty over property rights, deterring foreign direct investment and lowering consumer confidence. In April 2009, Gideon Gono admitted to having \"borrowed\" over $1 billion from private foreign exchange accounts in the Reserve Bank to pay government expenses.

Nearly all of the country's 4,500 commercial farms have been redistributed, some forcibly, to black Zimbabweans. By some accounts, the land redistribution program has been plagued by inefficiencies, with large portions of redistributed land not actively farmed.

The government insisted at that time that it would not expropriate foreign-owned companies and that the law would not be applied to every company, but rather \"on the basis of capital (investment) and employment levels.\" In early 2010, however, a ZANU-PF minister announced new regulations, demanding that all foreign and locally owned businesses valued at $500,000 or greater transfer at least 51% ownership to black Zimbabweans. According to these regulations, which Prime Minister Tsvangirai dismissed as \"null and void\" because they were introduced without MDC approval, thousands of companies were given a short deadline to submit plans for compliance; the ZANU-PF minister subsequently agreed to extend the deadline and reexamine the directive, and the government's position on the regulations remains under dispute.

", "ZANU-PF's fast track land reform program and more recent policy changes, such as the Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act, have created significant uncertainty over property rights, deterring foreign direct investment and lowering consumer confidence. Many observers are skeptical that the MDC can counter the entrenched patronage system that currently exists, within the scope of the current government. Several policies of the previous administration, including the mass urban evictions of 2005 (Operation Murambatsvina), have had lasting repercussions for human development objectives, including access to education, according to some reports. These development challenges require attention from the current government, but may also benefit from donor pressure and support. ", "Western donors have met periodically in recent years to explore reconstruction options, and their representatives meet regularly in Harare to coordinate existing aid programs. Britain has maintained its willingness to release funds to pay for parts of an orderly land redistribution program if Mugabe retires and the rule of law is returned. It is unclear whether Britain would concede to release such funds prior to Mugabe's departure from office. The World Bank and the IMF have also developed strategies for Zimbabwe's economic recovery. Significant donor assistance is likely to be required to rebuild the public health sector, which according to reports may have lost over 70% of its skilled workforce. The education sector faces similar challenges. Reviving the country's agriculture industry will require delicate handling to address historical grievances regarding land distribution and tenure.", "Maintaining the flow of foreign currency to pay salaries is critical to ensuring stability, but MDC officials have acknowledged donor concerns. Prime Minister Tsvangirai, in his inaugural address to the parliament, warned MPs, \"no donor country or institution is going to offer any meaningful assistance unless our government projects a positive new image.\" Few governments have publicly indicated a willingness to date to provide loans or aid directly to the government. ", "The IMF has noted positive steps toward fiscal discipline and offered policy advice and technical assistance, but has warned that IMF lending will not be renewed until Zimbabwe begins to repay its debts and establishes a track record of sound policy implementation and donor support. In the interim, the IMF's Executive Board met in May 2009 to approve a \"targeted lifting\" of the Fund's suspension of technical assistance to the government. This resumption of assistance indicated that the IMF has judged Zimbabwe to be cooperating with the Fund on policies and payments toward addressing its outstanding arrears. It has allowed IMF technical advisors to work with the Finance Ministry to improve its revenue collection and bank payment system, particularly to process transactions in foreign exchange, as well as on fiduciary control of the central bank. In February 2010, with the support of the United States, the Board voted to restore Zimbabwe's voting rights, which were suspended in 2003 after a determination that Zimbabwe had not sufficiently strengthened its cooperation with the IMF in areas of policy implementation and payments. Several recent studies have explored options for addressing Zimbabwe's external debt arrears and pursuing comprehensive debt relief. The IMF has suggested that a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) could assist Zimbabwe in establishing a track record of sound policies that would pave the way for debt relief and access to donor funds. ", "The State Department's FY2009 supplemental request stated that \"to be successful, Zimbabwe's transition will require a significant infusion of capital and program investment in both the short- and long-term.\" The department's FY2010 request included an expansion of technical assistance to the government on a range of issues, such as trade policy and legal and regulatory reforms that affect businesses, and it aims to reinforce technical assistance provided by the international financial institutions. Recent budget requests go further, proposing new activities to promote private sector development and agricultural recovery, but caution that \"if the government does not make adequate progress in meeting donor benchmarks, assistance beyond the agriculture sector may not follow.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sanctions", "paragraphs": ["As the transitional government concludes its third year, foreign governments, including the United States, continue to debate the efficacy and utility of their sanctions against Zimbabwe and members of the ZANU-PF elite. Some suggest that sanctions be lifted, while others maintain that they continue to provide a useful tool to press for democratic reforms. At issue are three different types of restrictions\u2014travel and financial restrictions targeting individuals; bilateral donor restrictions that prohibit the provision of aid directly to the Zimbabwe government; and bilateral restrictions that prevent the representatives of certain governments, namely the United States, from supporting the resumption of multilateral lending by the major international financial institutions. The first two types of restrictions remain solely at the discretion of the governments that imposed them. However, if foreign governments were to lift the third restriction, against support for IMF and World Bank lending, those banks' own policies would still be an impediment to renewed financial flows, given Zimbabwe's outstanding debt arrears. As discussed above, the IMF and other multilateral banks have stipulated that the Zimbabwe government must establish a track record of sound fiscal policy before the debt arrears question can be addressed. Donor governments may also choose to consider debt forgiveness for Zimbabwe. Given the transitional nature of Zimbabwe's current government and uncertainty surrounding the date of the country's next elections, however, some policymakers question whether such decisions should be delayed until a new, democratically elected government takes office."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.

Although the negotiations resulted in the amendment of some laws seen to restrict press freedom and political activity, the talks were abandoned after President Mugabe announced an election date without consulting the opposition. Human rights activists argued that the legislative changes were cosmetic and that the talks failed to create a level playing field prior to the 2008 elections.", "The two factions of the main opposition party, the MDC, which split in 2005, remained divided prior to the elections. Despite rumors of dissatisfaction with Mugabe's continued rule from within his own party, ZANU-PF's central committee nominated Mugabe to be their presidential candidate. The committee also supported a resolution to hold all elections (presidential, parliamentary, and local council) at the same time, and to reduce the terms for all public offices from six to five years. In addition, they voted to back efforts to increase the number of parliamentarians. Critics contend that these proposals were an effort to manipulate the electoral process through gerrymandering, with the new constituencies created in rural areas where the ruling party had stronger support. The proposals were included in a controversial Constitutional Amendment Bill, which, to the surprise of many observers, was passed by the parliament in 2007 with the support of MDC Members of Parliament (MPs). The final version of the legislation, did, however, include some changes seen as concessions to the opposition, and reports suggest that the MDC supported the legislation because of progress in the South Africa negotiations.", "In February 2008, a senior member of ZANU-PF, Simba Makoni, announced his intention to run against President Mugabe in the upcoming elections. He was subsequently expelled from the party and ran as an independent, although he was rumored to have the support of several unnamed senior party officials. Makoni had served as finance minister from 2000 to 2002 and was reportedly dismissed after criticizing the administration's economic policies. Opposition leader Tsvangirai dismissed Makoni as \"old wine in a new bottle,\" but rival MDC leader Arthur Mutambara withdrew as a presidential candidate and expressed his support for Makoni.", "In the pre-election period, civic activists reported significant pre-election irregularities. The Zimbabwean government invited election observers from over 40 countries and regional organizations, including SADC, but allegedly barred observers from countries considered to be critical of its policies. Western media organizations and journalists were also reportedly denied permission to cover the elections.", "Zimbabwe's first \"harmonized\" elections were held on March 29, 2008. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), widely criticized for its delayed release of the results, announced the National Assembly results four days after the election. For the first time since independence, ZANU-PF lost its majority in the National Assembly. The MDC factions won 109 seats in the 220-seat National Assembly, over ZANU-PF's 97. After a month of rising tensions, the results of the presidential race were belatedly announced on May 2. They indicated that Tsvangirai had received more votes than Mugabe, but had failed to garner the 50% needed to avoid a runoff.", "Although the opposition accused the government of manipulating the results and initially objected to participating in a runoff, Morgan Tsvangirai agreed to stand against President Mugabe in a second round of voting. While electoral law requires the government to hold a runoff election within 21 days of announcing the initial results, the ZEC declared that the runoff would not be held until June 27, three months after the first round. During the following weeks, reports of political violence increased dramatically, in what many critics contend was a government-orchestrated attempt to punish opposition supporters and ensure a Mugabe victory in the runoff. Several of the country's security service chiefs, including the heads of the army and the police, publicly announced that they would not recognize an electoral victory by anyone other that Mugabe. Citing the high number of attacks against MDC supporters and the lack of a level playing field, Tsvangirai withdrew from the race days before the election. Despite public comments from African observer missions and a presidential statement from the United Nations Security Council arguing that conditions for a free and fair election did not exist, the government held the runoff as scheduled. Mugabe was declared the winner with over 85% of the vote and inaugurated on June 29, 2008.

The following day the paper announced on its website that a unity government was \"not feasible.\" According to a May 2008 International Crisis Group report, some senior ZANU-PF members, including Vice President Joyce Mujuru and Reserve Bank governor Gideon Gono, tried to convince the president to accept a unity government, but were overruled by senior security officials. Central to the concerns of ZANU-PF hardliners, critics assert, are questions regarding immunity for serious human rights abuses committed since independence. Both parties issued public statements after the elections indicating a willingness to negotiate, but ZANU-PF declared that Tsvangirai must acknowledge Mugabe's victory as a prerequisite. Tsvangirai refused to do so.

One week after the elections, self-styled war veteran leader Jabuli Sibanda warned, \"It has come to our realization that the elections were used as another war front to prepare for the reinvasion of our country.... As freedom fighters, we feel compelled to repel the invasion,\" echoing a frequent Mugabe refrain that an opposition victory would be tantamount to the British reinstating colonial rule. The state-owned Herald newspaper contributed to fears of a white takeover in the wake of the election, reporting, \"an increasing number of white former commercial farmers are reportedly threatening resettled black farmers throughout the country with eviction from their farms or face the wrath of an anticipated 'incoming MDC government.'\" These pronouncements coincided with farm invasions throughout the country, and by mid-April 2008 the Commercial Farmers Union reported that over 100 of the estimated remaining 400 white farmers had been forced off their lands.

Most Harare medical clinics were at full capacity during the height of the violence, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Zimbabwe's largest farmers' union reported that militias displaced over 40,000 farm workers, and there were widespread reports of burned homes, granaries, and livestock. The United Nations' resident representative in Zimbabwe stated at the time, \"there is an emerging pattern of political violence inflicted mainly, but not exclusively, on suspected followers of the MDC.\" The level of violence was confirmed by an eight-person SADC mission: \"we have seen it, there are people in hospital who said they have been tortured, you have seen pictures, you have seen pictures of houses that have been destroyed and so on.\"", "Some Zimbabwean officials, including the police chief, accused the MDC of rigging and inciting violence.
