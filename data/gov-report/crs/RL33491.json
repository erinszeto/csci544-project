It would \"transform countries, through far-reaching, fundamental changes in institutions of governance, human capacity, and economic structure that enable a country to sustain further economic and social progress without depending on foreign aid.\" In addition to promoting transformational development, the same paper identified four further challenges to which U.S. assistance programs are designed to respond: strengthening fragile states; providing humanitarian relief; supporting U.S. geostrategic interests; and mitigating global and transnational ills. The concept of transformational development already has been applied by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) which manages another Bush Administration foreign aid initiative that rewards \"best performing\" countries through a competitive process measuring achievements in the areas of governance, economic policies, and social programs.", "Also announced at about the same time was a related \"transformational diplomacy\" initiative that will reposition diplomats to \"critical emerging areas,\" enhance language and regional skills, and emphasize outreach to foreign populations. In this new environment of seeking transformational change in recipient countries through both development and diplomacy, Secretary Rice has argued for better coordination and policy coherence of U.S. assistance programs, with an emphasis on both short-term, and long-term strategic goals at the country and global level.

Countries with high poverty levels and undemocratic governments are considered permissive environments for terrorism and criminal activities.

Others fear that the Framework is focused on strategic objectives to the neglect of poverty alleviation, which they contend is the underlying cause for instability. Still others believe that the restructuring advantages a short-term strategic approach over a long-term development perspective. The Administration counters that the Framework is flexible enough to deal with any number of development issues a country may have.
