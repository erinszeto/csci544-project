USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulates most meat, poultry, and processed egg products. The agriculture appropriations subcommittees oversee both the FDA and FSIS budgets.", "Historically, federal funding and staffing levels between FDA and FSIS have been disproportionate to their respective responsibilities for addressing food safety activities. Although FSIS is responsible for 10%-20% of the U.S. food supply, it has had approximately 60% of the two agencies' combined food safety budget; and although FDA has been responsible for 80%-90% of the U.S. food supply, it has received about 40% of the available budget ( Table 12 ). For example, in FY2010, FSIS received $1.018 billion in appropriated funds plus another approximately $150 million in industry-paid user fees, whereas FDA's FY2010 budget for foods was $783 million, virtually all of it appropriated with limited authorized user fees. Staffing levels also vary considerably among the two agencies: FSIS staff numbered around 9,400 FTEs in FY2010, while FDA staff working on food-related activities numbers about 3,400 FTEs.

Over the years, congressional appropriators have increased funding for FDA food activities, which more than doubled from $435.5 million in FY2005 to an estimated $866.1 million in FY2012 ( Table 12 ). FDA's operating level in FY2013, including sequestration, totaled an estimated $796.6 million.

FSMA was the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s. Among its many provisions, FSMA increases frequency of inspections at food facilities, tightens record-keeping requirements, extends oversight to certain farms, and mandates product recalls. It requires food processing, manufacturing, shipping, and other facilities to conduct a food safety plan of the most likely safety hazards, and design and implement risk-based controls. It also mandates improvements to the nation's foodborne illness surveillance systems and increased scrutiny of food imports, among other provisions. FSMA did not directly address meat and poultry products under USDA's jurisdiction.

After FSMA was signed into law in January 2011, concerns were voiced about whether there would be enough money to overhaul the U.S. food safety system and also whether expanded investment in this area was appropriate in the current budgetary climate. Prior to enactment, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing FSMA could increase net federal spending subject to appropriation by about $1.4 billion over a five-year period (FY2011-FY2015). This cost estimate covers activities at FDA and other federal agencies, and does not include offsetting revenue from the collection of new user fees authorized under FSMA. New fees authorized under FSMA include an annual fee for participants in the voluntary qualified importer program (VQIP) and three fees for certain periodic activities involving reinspection, recall, and export certification. FSMA did not impose any new facility registration fees. Prior to enactment, CBO estimated that about $240 million in new fees would be collected over the five-year period (FY2011-FY2015). Taking into account these new fees, CBO estimated that covering the five-year cost of new requirements within FDA, including more frequent inspections, would require additional outlays of $1.1 billion. FSMA also authorized an increase in FDA staff, reaching 5,000 by FY2014.", "FDA continues to implement regulations under FSMA.

When the appropriations law was passed, the WIC program was governed by an interim final rule which did not allow WIC benefits to be used to purchase white potatoes. Since that time, USDA's final rule has been published and it retains this restriction. ", "The background to understand this issue dates back to efforts begun about 10 years ago to update the \"WIC Food Packages.\" States have some leeway to determine the specific foods that are eligible for WIC redemption in their state, but they must do so within federal regulatory requirements. These federal requirements are often referred to as the \"WIC food packages,\" and there are different packages for pregnant women, post-partum women, infants, and children. The current WIC food packages are based on an interim final rule that was published on December 6, 2007; states were required to implement the revisions by October 1, 2009. Prior to publishing this rule, USDA consulted with the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which published the 2005 study, WIC Food Packages: Time for a Change. One of IOM's many recommendations was that WIC food packages include fresh fruits and vegetables, except for white potatoes. The IOM study cited food intake data showing that white potatoes, unlike many other vegetables, were widely consumed. ", "The restriction on white potatoes in the proposed and interim final rules has proven controversial particularly to potato growers and related congressional supporters, with the white potato's treatment in the WIC program coming up in hearings and in legislation, including an amendment that was successfully added during the House Committee's markup of their FY2014 appropriations bill. In the enacted appropriations law, there is no provision of law regarding potatoes and WIC, but there is a directive within the Joint Explanatory Statement. Recognizing that a final rule was in clearance at the time of the appropriations law's introduction, the Statement indicates that, \"the agreement expects\" USDA's amendment of the WIC food packages to include: ", "all varieties of fresh, whole, or cut vegetables, except for vegetables with added sugars, fats, oils; provided that inclusion of such vegetables contribute towards meeting the special nutrition needs of program participants and increases the availability of low-cost, high-nutrient alternatives for participants throughout the year....", "Unlike the legislative language included in the House-reported FY2014 appropriations bill, which would have required USDA's inclusion of white potatoes, the Joint Explanatory Statement does give USDA discretion not to include all vegetables as specified. If USDA decides not to comply with the expectation above, the Statement requires the Secretary to submit to the Appropriations Committees a report explaining that decision. ", "Again, since the time of the Statement's publication, USDA-FNS published its final rule on the WIC Food Packages, and it retains the exclusion of white potatoes. The preamble to the final rule explains comments received opposing this restriction and also includes a further explanation of the decision to retain the restriction. The final rule's preamble states: ", "the restriction of white potatoes, as recommended by the IOM, is based on data indicating that consumption of starchy vegetables meets or exceeds recommended amounts, and food intake data showing that white potatoes are the most widely used vegetable. Including white potatoes ... would not contribute towards meeting the nutrition needs of the WIC population and would not support the goal of expanding the types and varieties of fruits and vegetables available to program participants.", "In addition to the WIC Food Packages language, the Joint Explanatory Statement \u2013 together with the appropriations language itself - gives states some flexibility on the federally required timeline for authorizing new stores to accept WIC benefits.

Major discretionary programs include certain conservation programs; most rural development programs; research and education programs; agricultural credit programs; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the Food for Peace international food aid program; meat and poultry inspection; and food marketing and regulatory programs. The discretionary accounts also include FDA and CFTC appropriations.

Some mandatory spending, such as for the farm commodity programs, is highly variable and is driven by program participation rates, economic and price conditions, and weather patterns. Programs and policies are set in the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ). In recent years, mandatory spending has tended to rise, particularly as nutrition benefits have risen because of the recession. ", "Although mandatory programs generally are outside the scope of the appropriations debate, amounts for these programs are included in the annual Agriculture appropriations act. In terms of budget enforcement, though, mandatory spending decisions are governed in the authorizations process via the Congressional Budget Office baseline. For example, the SNAP and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs. In fact, SNAP is referred to as an \"appropriated entitlement,\" and requires an annual appropriation. In contrast, the Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury, but receives an annual appropriation to reimburse the Treasury and to maintain its line of credit. ", "Budget Authority, Obligations, Outlays, and Program Levels", "In addition to the difference between mandatory and discretionary spending, four other terms are important to understanding differences in discussions about federal spending: budget authority, obligations, outlays, and program levels.", "1. Budget authority = How much money Congress allows a federal agency to commit to spend. It represents a limit on funding and is generally what Congress focuses on in making most budgetary decisions. It is the legal basis to incur obligations. Most of the amounts mentioned in this report are budget authority. 2. Obligations = How much money agencies commit to spend. Obligations represent activities such as employing personnel, entering into contracts, and submitting purchase orders. 3. Outlays = How much money actually flows out of an agency's account. Outlays may differ from appropriations (budget authority) because, for example, payments on a contract may not flow out until a later year. For construction or delivery of services, budget authority may be committed (contracted) in one fiscal year and outlays may be spread across several fiscal years. 4. Program level = Sum of the activities supported or undertaken by an agency. A program level may be much higher than its budget authority for several reasons. User fees support some activities (e.g., food or border inspection). The agency makes loans; for example, a large loan authority (program level) is possible with a small budget authority (loan subsidy) that accounts for defaults and interest rate assistance, assuming most loans are repaid. Transfers from other agencies, or funds are carried forward from prior years. ", "Appendix B. Agriculture Appropriations Timelines", "In the past 20 years (the time period for this analysis that begins in FY1995, see Table B-1 ), Agriculture appropriations bills were enacted as stand-alone measures nine times: FY1995-FY1998, FY2000-FY2002, FY2006, and FY2010.
