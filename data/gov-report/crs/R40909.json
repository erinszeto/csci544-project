Mujica, a former leader of the leftist Tupamaro urban guerilla movement that fought against the Uruguayan government in the 1960s and 1970s, defeated former President Luis Alberto Lacalle (1990-1995) of the center-right National Party in the country's sixth consecutive democratic election since its 12-year dictatorship ended in 1985. Mujica was forced to contest a runoff after he failed to win an absolute majority of the vote in the October 2009 first-round election. In legislative elections held concurrently with the first-round vote, the Broad Front retained its majorities in both houses of the Uruguayan Congress. The new legislature and President are to be inaugurated to their respective five-year terms on February 15 and March 1, 2010.", "Mujica will replace popular incumbent President Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, who was constitutionally ineligible to run for a second consecutive term.

The V\u00e1zquez Administration's policies appear to have been reasonably successful, as they\u2014along with a boom in global commodity prices\u2014have contributed to several years of strong economic growth and considerable reductions in poverty. Beyond economic and social welfare policy, V\u00e1zquez has done much to address Uruguay's dictatorship-era human rights violations and expand rights to the country's homosexual population.", "Uruguay has enjoyed friendly relations with the United States since its transition back to democracy, though it traditionally has had closer ties to Europe and its South American neighbors, Argentina and Brazil. Commercial ties between Uruguay and the United States have expanded substantially in recent years, with the countries signing a bilateral investment treaty in 2004 and a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in January 2007. The United States and Uruguay have also cooperated on military matters, with both countries playing significant roles in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. Relations are likely to remain close in the coming years as the Obama Administration and President-elect Mujica have announced their mutual desire to further strengthen bilateral ties.", "On September 14, 2009, the ATPDEA Expansion and Extension Act of 2009 (S. 1665, Lugar) was introduced in the Senate.

During the crisis\u2014which was principally the result of the spillover effects of the economic problems of its much larger neighbors, Argentina and Brazil\u2014Uruguay's economy contracted by 11%, unemployment climbed to 21%, and over one-third of the country's 3.5 million citizens found themselves living below the poverty line. While economic stability returned to Uruguay prior to the 2004 election, some international investors were worried about the possible economic policies of the V\u00e1zquez government. In order to calm investor fears, V\u00e1zquez signed a three-year, $1.1 billion stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shortly after taking office. The agreement committed Uruguay to a substantial primary fiscal surplus, low inflation, considerable reductions in external debt, and several structural reforms designed to improve competitiveness and attract foreign investment. Although Uruguay terminated the agreement in 2006 following the early repayment of its IMF debt, it has maintained a number of the policy commitments.", "The V\u00e1zquez Administration has also done much to address poverty and inequality throughout its term, though it has been criticized by some of the more leftist sectors of the FA for allegedly subordinating social welfare concerns to the maintenance of market-friendly economic policies. In the first months of his administration, V\u00e1zquez created a ministry of Social Development and sought to reduce the country's poverty rate with a $240 million National Plan to Address the Social Emergency (PANES). PANES provided a monthly conditional cash transfer of approximately $75 to over 100,000 households in extreme poverty. In exchange, those receiving the benefits were required to participate in community work and ensure that their children attended school daily and had regular health checkups. PANES included a number of other initiatives as well, such as food purchase cards, new homeless shelters, an expansion of free health coverage, and job training programs. In late 2007, PANES was replaced with the Plan for Social Equity. V\u00e1zquez has recently introduced two programs designed to expand opportunity through technology: Plan Ceibal , which provides all public school students in Uruguay with a free personal computer, and Plan Cardales , which provides low-income families with subsidized access to telephone, television, and Internet services.", "In addition to the administration's social welfare programs, V\u00e1zquez passed a law forbidding discrimination against workers for labor activities, and reestablished tripartite wage councils\u2014composed of representatives of government, businesses, and unions\u2014to negotiate wages for approximately 100,000 firms and 600,000 workers. The labor reforms have considerably increased the power of unions, playing a substantial role in the percentage of unionized workers more than doubling between 2005 and 2007 to approximately 24% of the labor force. Moreover, the V\u00e1zquez Administration and the FA have overhauled the tax system to make it more progressive, reducing the value-added tax and replacing the tax on wages with a personal income tax that exempts the poorest 60%.", "The V\u00e1zquez Administration's economic and social welfare policies, along with the recent boom in commodity prices\u2014which significantly affect Uruguay's primarily agricultural economy \u2014have contributed to several years of strong economic growth and considerable reductions in poverty. Since 2005, Uruguay's real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown by an average of 7% per year, the country's debt has fallen from 66% of GDP to 26% of GDP, and investment has increased to 19% of GDP, the highest rate in the country's history. Likewise, between 2004 and 2009, the poverty rate in Uruguay fell from 31.9% to 20.3% and extreme poverty fell from 4.2% to 1.4%, while real wages increased 18% and household income increased 30%. Uruguay remains one of the most developed countries in Latin America, with an adult literacy rate of nearly 98%, a life expectancy of 76 years, and a 2008 per capita income of $8,260.

During the country's 12 years of authoritarian rule, tens of thousands of Uruguayan citizens were forced into political exile, 3,000-4,000 were imprisoned, and several hundred were \"disappeared\" or killed. Nonetheless, the only official action taken by previous governments to investigate the country's past was the creation of a peace commission, which was active between 2000 and 2003, and only looked into those who had been \"disappeared.\" Furthermore, the peace commission only had an investigative mandate since the country's amnesty law\u2014passed in 1986 and ratified in a national referendum in 1989\u2014treats dictatorship-era crimes with impunity.", "Immediately after his election, V\u00e1zquez initiated investigations into the government's human rights abuses during the authoritarian period. Since then, excavations of military barracks have turned up the remains of some of the \"disappeared,\" files from the dictatorship have been released to the public, and the state has agreed to provide compensation to the those who were imprisoned for political reasons and the families of those who were killed. The V\u00e1zquez Administration also reinterpreted the amnesty law to exclude crimes committed outside Uruguay as a part of the regional coordination plan to eliminate political dissidents known as \"Operation Condor.\" As a result, a number of former members of the military and police have been tried and jailed, including former dictators Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry (1973-1976) and Gregorio \u00c1lvarez (1981-1985). Some former members of the security forces, who believe that their actions were necessary to defend the country from ideological subversives, have criticized the FA for allegedly seeking to rewrite the country's history. Although a referendum to repeal the country's amnesty law was rejected in the October 2009 general election, an Uruguayan Supreme Court ruling issued several days before the election found the application of the amnesty law in a case involving the 1974 death of a political prisoner to be unconstitutional.

Some also argued that those who reside abroad should have no say in the policies that will affect the lives of those actually living in Uruguay. The other referendum would have annulled the amnesty that was granted to the military and police following the return to democracy for crimes committed during the country's dictatorship.

Some also alleged that the referendum fomented persecution of the security forces while ignoring the crimes that were committed by the country's leftist guerilla group.

Following the return to democracy, Mujica helped found the Popular Participation Movement (MPP), which is currently the largest faction within the FA coalition. He was elected to Uruguay's lower house in 1994 and to the Senate in 1999, before serving as minister of livestock, agriculture, and fisheries during the V\u00e1zquez Administration. Although he hails from a more left-leaning faction of the FA, Mujica has developed a reputation as a pragmatist and consensus-builder. He has already reached out to the political opposition, offering appointments to state companies and autonomous entities, and setting up multi-partisan technical commissions to develop security, education, energy, and environmental policy.", "While his campaign opponents attacked Mujica's past to portray him as a radical departure from the V\u00e1zquez government, most analysts maintain that the Mujica Administration's policies are likely to closely resemble those of his predecessor. Mujica selected Danilo Astori\u2014a competitor for the FA presidential nomination who served as economy minister during the V\u00e1zquez Administration\u2014as his running-mate in order to reassure voters and investors that he was committed to maintaining Uruguay's market-oriented economic policies. Mujica has said that he intends to delegate economic policy to Astori, and economic posts in the administration are expected to be filled by leaders associated with Astori's more centrist faction of the FA, the L\u00edber Seregni Front (FLS). Members of the FLS have reportedly been selected to head the economy, tourism, and transportation ministries. Analysts also expect Mujica to broadly maintain the V\u00e1zquez Administration's social welfare and foreign policies, though he may place more emphasis on domestic redistribution and regional integration. The more left-leaning sectors of the FA, such as Mujica's MPP, will reportedly control the foreign and defense ministries, as well as the majority of the social ministries.
