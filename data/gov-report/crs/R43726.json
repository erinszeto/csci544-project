Recently, congressional interest has focused on the efficient and effective management of federal grant programs. A recent congressional hearing evaluated the impact of alleged inefficient grant management which, according to a GAO report, resulted in more than $794 million in undisbursed federal grant funds in expired grant accounts. GAO concluded that federal agencies needed to improve the timeliness of federal grant closeouts to address the undisbursed funds issue.

Recently, congressional interest has focused on the efficient and effective management of federal grant programs. As a result of this interest, Congress has asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct investigations into the grants management practices of federal agencies. These investigations have shown that federal agencies struggle with conducting timely federal grant closeouts, ensuring appropriate internal controls in the oversight of federal grants, and need to establish better monitoring of federal grant recipients and subgrant recipients to reduce the risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. Delays in closing out federal grants result in delays in identifying points in the grants management process where waste, fraud, and abuse may be occurring. Failure to identify and resolve these weaknesses increases the likelihood of continued waste, fraud, and abuse. ", "Grant administration tasks, such as closing out federal grants, are necessary to ensure appropriate oversight of federal grant funds. Closing out federal grants involves reviewing all expenditures made under the grant to ensure that funds were spent appropriately and identifying unspent (i.e., undisbursed) funds that should be transferred back to the Department of the Treasury. GAO has reported that it found more than $794 million in undisbursed federal grant funds in expired grant accounts administered by federal agencies and concluded that federal agencies needed to improve the timeliness of federal grant closeouts to address the undisbursed funds issue.

Congress typically provides budget authority for a federal grant program through an appropriations act. The purpose for the funds and the period of availability varies across programs and agencies. Budget authority is divided by purpose and period of availability into budget accounts for the purposes of budget execution. A federal agency then obligates the funds pursuant to guidelines issued by OMB. The obligation of funds by an agency constitutes a definite commitment, making the government legally liable for the payment of goods and services ordered or received.
