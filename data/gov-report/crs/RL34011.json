A suspension extends the term of the lease, to allow the lessee to facilitate development. The state of California sued, contending that MMS should have made a consistency determination showing that the lease suspensions were consistent with California's coastal management plan before issuing the suspensions. In June 2001, the U.S. Court for the Northern District of California agreed with the state of California and struck down the lease suspensions. MMS appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

The Court reasoned that the lessees had not bargained for the more extensive consistency determination requirements to be applied to suspension requests when the leases were signed, and that therefore the legislation creating these new requirements amounted to breach of the leases.

However, coal mining is an old activity in the United States, and at the time SMCRA was enacted there was a large inventory of abandoned mine sites that no company could be held accountable to reclaim. To address this problem, SMCRA established an Abandoned Mine Land (AML) fund, with fees levied on coal production, to reclaim abandoned sites that posed serious health or safety hazards.

In the FY2008 request, the proceeds were proposed to be split, with half for a four-year phase-out of payments under P.L. 106-393 and the other half for habitat improvement and land acquisition. Legislation would be needed to authorize the proposed land sale, but such legislation has not been enacted.
