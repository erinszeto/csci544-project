Congress has established two land management systems for which statutory guidelines generally apply to all areas in the system. The National Wilderness Preservation System has many units, with general management guidelines: no permanent roads or structures; no commercial enterprises; and no motorized or mechanical access. However, the 1964 Wilderness Act that created the Wilderness System and many subsequent wilderness statutes have also included numerous exceptions to these standards for specific areas. The other system is the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, with general management direction for the corridors identified along designated rivers.", "In addition, Congress has designated at least 96 individual areas within the National Forest System, and continues to consider more such designations. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, for example, designated 10 individual special areas among its many provisions. While many of the designations are unique, the areas can generally be grouped into six categories: national monuments (5, plus one administrative designation); recreation areas (26); scenic areas (11); game refuges (6); protection areas (37); and other (11).", "While the statutes designating these 96 areas differ, many provisions are found in multiple statutes. Common administrative provisions include findings of the importance and uniqueness of the area; purposes for administration of the area; designation of the area, often with references to maps and boundaries; applicable law, with most making the provisions supplemental to the management guidance for national forests generally; a management plan for the area; an advisory committee for the area or the plan; authorization of land acquisition; and withdrawal of the area from the public land laws. Less common administrative provisions include requiring regulations for the area; explicitly allowing inholder access; prohibiting buffer zones around the area; retaining most state and local governance provisions; and authorizing appropriations.", "There are also three common resource management provisions in the many statutes designating special areas: withdrawal of the area from mining and mineral leasing laws, subject to valid existing rights; timber harvesting restrictions, often with exemptions for fire, insect, or disease control; and fish and wildlife management, generally preserving state responsibilities and jurisdiction, allowing fishing and hunting, and authorizing area or period closures for various purposes, in consultation with state officials.

In 1905, the 75 million acres of forest reserves (renamed national forests in 1907) were transferred to the Department of Agriculture; the Forestry Division was merged with the existing USDA Bureau of Forestry (whose purpose was to conduct forestry research and to provide assistance to forestland owners) to create a new agency: the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in the Department of Agriculture.

Section 1 of MUSYA directs that the national forests \"shall be administered for outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes.\" Section 2 requires that the surface resources be developed and administered for \"multiple use and sustained yield,\" considering the relative values of the various resources, and notes that creating and managing areas of wilderness is consistent with the purposes of the act.", "Section 4(a) of MUSYA defines multiple-use management of national forest resources. It directs management to best meet the needs of the American people, with adjustments to changing needs and conditions. Multiple-use management also permits some land to be used for only one or a few resources. Finally, multiple-use management must maintain the productivity of the lands. Thus, MUSYA directs that national forest management balance recreation, timber, grazing, water, and wildlife, as desired by the American people, while sustaining productivity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land and Resource Management Planning", "paragraphs": ["Planning for NFS use and management is guided by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA). NFMA requires comprehensive land and resource management plans for each unit of the NFS, to be amended as needed and revised periodically but at least every 15 years. The planning requires an interdisciplinary approach combining \"physical, biological, economic, and other sciences,\" directs that the plans provide for multiple use in accordance with MUSYA, and requires public participation in developing, reviewing, and revising the plans.", "In Section 6 (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604), NFMA established numerous requirements and considerations for the planning process. Some provisions were particularly controversial, because of their potential to reduce or otherwise constrain timber harvesting. The more controversial provisions include:", "Section 6(g)(1): \"insure that land management plans are prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ...\" Section 6(g)(3)(B): \"provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area ...\" Section 6(g)(3)(E): \"insure that timber will be harvested ... only where\u2014(i) soil, slope, and other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged; (ii) there is assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked within five years after harvest; [and] (iii) protection is provided for streams, streambanks, shorelines, lakes, wetlands, and other bodies of water from detrimental changes in water temperatures, blockages of water courses, and deposits of sediment, where harvests are likely to seriously and adversely affect water conditions or fish habitat ...\" Section 6(k): \"identify lands within the management area which are not suited for timber production, considering physical, economic, and other pertinent factors to the extent feasible, ... [and] assure that, except for salvage sales or sales necessitated to protect other multiple-use values, no timber harvesting shall occur on such lands for a period of 10 years.\"", "Two of these provisions\u2014Section 6(g)(3)(E) and Section 6(k)\u2014were intended to constrain timber harvesting by establishing biophysical and economic requirements, respectively, for timber production. The NEPA provision\u2014Section 6(g)(1)\u2014establishes a procedural requirement that can be, and has been, used to delay or prevent timber harvesting and other development activities in the national forests. The biological diversity provision\u2014Section 6(g)(3)(B)\u2014has perhaps had the most significant impact, however. The 1979 and 1982 regulations to implement this provision required the USFS to maintain viable populations of all native and desirable non-native species. This requirement for viable populations was the initial basis for the litigation that reduced USFS (and BLM) timber harvesting in the Pacific Northwest by 90% or more to maintain the northern spotted owl. (The subsequent listing of the owl under the Endangered Species Act provided further impetus to reduce timber harvesting to preserve northern spotted owl habitat.)", "In addition to the controversial provisions of NFMA, efforts to revise the 1982 implementing regulations have been controversial. In November 2000, the Clinton Administration finalized new rules (to be phased in) that emphasized planning for the biological sustainability of the national forests. The Bush Administration delayed implementing the Clinton rules, then replaced them in January 2005 before they went into effect. The final Bush rules were to balance biological and socioeconomic sustainability, to make fewer decisions nationally by reducing regulatory guidelines, and to exempt plans from NEPA and ESA, because the Bush Administration viewed plans as guides to decision-making that would not include site-specific decisions. The Bush planning rules were successfully challenged. In 2007, the USFS reissued the Bush rules as a proposed rule with a draft NEPA environmental impact statement and ESA consultation to meet court requirements. The final planning rules were issued in April 2008, and were invalidated by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June 2009 for failing to comply with NEPA and ESA.

Six general types of provisions in many wilderness statutes provide exceptions to the general wilderness management restrictions.", "Access to private land s. Section 5 of the Wilderness Act provided for adequate and reasonable access to nonfederal lands and \"valid occupancies\" (e.g., valid mining claims) within designated wilderness areas. Several subsequent wilderness statutes have essentially reiterated this direction, allowing for adequate access to private lands within designated wilderness areas. Access for wildfire, insect, or disease contro l. Section 4(d)(1) of the Wilderness Act explicitly provided for measures needed to control wildfires, insects, and diseases, subject to reasonable regulations. As catastrophic wildfires have apparently become more frequent and more intense in recent years, this authority for nonconforming activities in wilderness areas to control fire, insects, and diseases has essentially been repeated in more recent wilderness statutes. Access for livestock grazin g. Section 4(d)(4)(2) of the Wilderness Act allowed continued livestock grazing in wilderness areas.

The language from the Wilderness Act and from the committee report on the Arizona Desert Wilderness Act of 1990 has subsequently been repeated or referenced in several statutes. Native and tribal rights and acces s. Several wilderness statutes have provided for access to the designated wilderness areas for native traditional cultural and religious purposes. The guidance has either been that nothing in the act \"alters, modifies, enlarges, diminishes, or abrogates the treaty rights ...\" or that the Secretary is to \"ensure access for traditional cultural and religious purposes\" and to allow temporary closures (i.e., exclusive access) for the smallest possible area and minimum possible period. Provisions in other statutes have also directed cooperation, memoranda of understanding, and agreements to provide access to and protection of important tribal use areas. Low-level military overflight s. Since 1990, several wilderness statutes have included provisions to specify that nothing in the act \"shall preclude low level overflights of military aircraft, the designation of new units of special airspace, or the use or establishment of military flight training routes over wilderness areas designated by this\" act.

Management of the lands within the corridor depends, in part, on the river's classification; developmental activities are most restricted along wild rivers and least restricted along recreational rivers. Administration is to emphasize the values that led to the designation, and uses are generally restricted only if they harm those values. Section 10(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act states:", "Each component of the national wild and scenic rivers system shall be administered in such a manner as to protect and enhance the values which caused it to be included in said system without, insofar as is consistent therewith, limiting other uses that do not substantially interfere with public use and enjoyment of these values. In such administration primary emphasis shall be given to protecting its esthetic, scenic, historic, archaeologic, and scientific features.", "Thus, the USFS is to manage the national forest lands within the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System under MUSYA and NFMA, as long as the activities are consistent with protecting the wild, scenic, or recreational nature of the designated rivers.

Many SMA statutes include findings about the unique attributes of the area being designated.", "2. Purpose. Most SMA statutes include a statement about the purpose(s) for designating the area. Such statements often provide a basis for management that may differ from management of the area prior to designation.", "3. Designation. Many SMA statutes include a provision explicitly designating and naming the area. These provisions often include a reference to the area's boundaries and to a map (commonly identified by a name and date) to be retained in a specific office (typically the Forest Supervisor's office for the national forest in which the SMA is located).", "4. NFS Laws. Most SMA statutes direct that the SMA is to be managed consistent with the laws, rules, and regulations generally applicable to National Forest System lands. Thus, the purposes and provisions enacted for the designated area are generally supplemental to existing governance, and not a substitute for that management guidance.", "5. Management Plan. Many SMA statutes require a management plan for the designated area, commonly completed within a specified period. Sometimes the planning guidance requires public participation; sometimes it does so indirectly, by reference to the NFMA planning process and requirements.", "6. Advisory Committee. Many SMA statutes provide for an advisory committee or group for the designated area. This advisory committee is frequently permanent, but sometimes is just for the development of the management plan. Also, some advisory groups are to represent the array of general public interests, but others are to focus on scientific issues associated with management of the area.", "7. Land Acquisition. Most SMA statutes authorize land acquisition for nonfederal land within the boundaries of the area. As the USFS has general land acquisition authority under the Weeks Law (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 515 et al.) and the SMAs are within the NFS, such land acquisition authority might be redundant.", "8. Withdrawal. Many of the SMA statutes withdraw the lands of the designated area from access under public land laws, such as the Homestead Act. As most of the public land laws were repealed in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and are no longer applicable to NFS or other federal lands, the more recent SMA statutes are less likely to include such a provision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Common Resource Management Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Three resource provisions have been included in many of the statutes designating SMAs in the NFS. These provisions generally address management of, and access to, minerals, timber, and fish and wildlife.", "1. Minerals. Most SMA statutes withdraw the designated lands from access under the mining and the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, subject to valid existing rights. This is very similar to the provisions of the Wilderness Act for withdrawing lands from access for mineral exploration and development. Some statutes authorize the USFS to continue to sell mineral materials (sand and gravel) from within the designated area.", "2. Timber. Many SMA statutes restrict timber harvesting. The most common approach is to use the restrictions of the Wilderness Act: no commercial timber harvesting, except as needed for fire, insect, and disease control and for visitor and administrative safety. Other approaches include requiring uneven-aged management practices, directing that harvesting be adjusted for possible scenic impacts, or limiting the size or species of trees that can be cut and removed.", "3. Fish and Wildlife. Most of the statutes designating SMAs include provisions relating to fish and wildlife management. In general, the statutes explicitly retain state jurisdiction over the management of the animals, limiting federal SMA administration to habitat management. Many of the statutes also explicitly allow hunting and fishing, and sometimes trapping, consistent with state law.

In some instances, the language parallels the Wilderness Act, allowing \"reasonable\" rights of access.", "3. Buffer Zones. Some of the statutes designating SMAs prohibit the USFS from establishing buffer zones around the SMA. This provision is akin to provisions enacted in several statutes designating wilderness areas, which note that the ability to see or hear a nonconforming activity from within the wilderness is not sufficient authority to restrict or prohibit that activity.", "4. Effect on Governance. Several SMA statutes direct that the designation is to have no effect on state or local laws and regulations, including law enforcement and taxation of private enterprise within the SMA.", "5. Authorization of Appropriations. Some SMA statutes explicitly authorize appropriations for administering the area consistent with the statute.
