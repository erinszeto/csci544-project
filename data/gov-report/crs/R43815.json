Those furnaces are the most common type of home heating appliance. While the scope of the report is limited to that one type of furnace, much of the discussion also applies to standards for other furnaces and to standards for residential central air conditioners and heat pumps.", "A 1987 statutory congressional directive set gas furnace standards for 1992 and directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to consider raising the standards in 1994 and 2007. DOE's responses were challenged in court twice (2005, 2007). The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) authorized DOE to set new standards for residential natural gas furnaces and certain other equipment. EISA Section 306 empowered DOE to set both a \"technical\" standard for manufacturers (a base national standard) and a regional \"installation\" standard for distributors and contractors. The regional standard concept aims to address geographic differences in heating needs. This law marked the first time that Congress authorized DOE to set regional standards.", "All other previous DOE energy efficiency standards for consumer products\u2014whether set by law or by DOE rule\u2014had only created a national technical standard for manufacturers. In that case, the compliance date served as a deadline only for manufacturers to have retooled their production lines, so that new equipment would comply with the new energy efficiency criteria. As the inventory of \"old\" equipment became exhausted, the \"new\" equipment from manufacturers would gradually replace it in the supply chain. Ultimately, the equipment distributors and residential installers at the end of the supply chain would have only the new equipment available to them.", "In contrast, the DOE-proposed regional gas furnace standard would have set the same compliance date for both manufacturers and installers. This would effectively move the scheduled implementation date down the supply chain from manufacturers, and thereby accelerate the change-over requirement date and shorten the \"sell-through\" adjustment period for furnace distributors and contractors.", "In another departure from past practice, EISA Section 308 specified that DOE could employ a direct final rule (DFR) process to implement the new regional standards. This is another policy innovation that had not been used previously in the appliance standard-making process. The DFR process\u2014which relies upon a preliminary consensus agreement among industry and energy efficiency groups\u2014differs from the \"traditional\" notice-and-comment process that had been used in all previous DOE rulemakings for consumer product energy efficiency standards.", "The two innovations\u2014regional standards and the DFR process\u2014led to new uncertainties and implementation design issues which, in late 2011, prompted an industry court challenge. In April 2014, the court adopted a negotiated settlement that directs DOE to reformulate the gas furnace rulemaking and directs that standards for air conditioners and heat pumps begin in 2015 and 2016. The final rule for gas furnaces had been set for May 2013\u2014but the new, revised rule is not expected to take effect before 2021 or 2022. In October 2014, gas industry groups raised the issue of separating gas furnace product classes in the revised rulemaking.

Residential furnaces come in a variety of designs, each of which employs a different fuel. Natural gas furnaces are, by far, the dominant type. A furnace produces hot air that is distributed throughout the home by a ventilation duct system. There are two main types of residential furnaces: weatherized (for outdoor installation, such as on rooftops) and non-weatherized (installed indoors, often in a basement or special closet). Non-weatherized furnaces are far more common and come in two forms: condensing and non-condensing. Furnaces with a 90% or greater AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency) are known as \"condensing\" furnaces because they condense water out of exiting (exhaust) flue gases to recover heat to further warm the home. Those exhaust gases would otherwise be vented up the chimney. A non-condensing furnace does not have the secondary system to recapture heat from byproduct moisture and gases. Thus, it requires a chimney or other exhaust venting to allow the larger amount of waste gases to escape.

Also, EPCA authorized the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) to administer the targets and directed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to provide energy labels for equipment covered by the targets. When FEA became part of the new Department of Energy (DOE) in 1978, the regulatory authority was transferred to the Secretary of Energy.

Also, NAECA amended EPCA to require DOE to consider amending the 78% AFUE standard in two subsequent rulemakings. First, the law required DOE to publish a final rule no later than January 1, 1994, to determine if the initial statutory efficiency standards for furnaces should be amended.

DOE believed that publishing the rule fulfilled its obligation under the consent decree mentioned above.", "However, the rule was met with criticism from states and public interest groups who felt the rule should have demanded a greater increase in the efficiency standards. In January 2008, two parallel challenges to the DOE Final Rule were filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The challenges took issue with perceived flaws in DOE's economic analysis as well as the allegedly minimal energy saving associated with the 80% standard. One challenge noted that DOE had found that \"a 90% standard would result in average life cycle costs (LCC) savings on a national level of $55 per consumer, while the 80% standard would result in only $2 of LCC savings per consumer\" due to \"DOE's assumption that by 2015, 99% of households will purchase furnaces that achieve the 80% efficiency level irrespective of any revision of standards.\"", "Some states also expressed a concern that the 80% AFUE national efficiency standard would preempt stricter state standards. For example, the state of California filed a motion to intervene in the State challenge to the DOE standards in which it contended that \"[i]f DOE's weak standards for residential furnaces and boilers are permitted to stand, California will lose the opportunity to benefit from a more stringent rule.\"", "Other states also raised concerns about the new federal standards preempting stricter state standards.

The law specified that any DOE rule which establishes a regional energy efficiency standard must be accompanied by a base national \"minimum\" standard. Further, it directed that any regional standard for the furnace product \"shall apply to any such product installed on or after the effective date of the standard.\" (emphasis added) Thus, Section 306 authorized DOE to make a technical standard for manufacturers (the base national \"minimum standard\") and a higher regional \"installation standard.\" All other previous DOE energy efficiency standards for consumer products\u2014whether set by statute or by regulation\u2014only created national technical standards for manufacturers.

That is the amount of time it would take distribution channels from manufacturers to distributors to installers to do what is necessary to avoid having stranded inventory as of May 1, 2013.\" (emphasis added)", "Second, AHRI explained the need from the manufacturers' perspective:", "This extension of the standards' effective date is needed in order for manufacturers to have adequate time to prepare for compliance with regional furnace standards and related standards enforcement and product labeling requirements, and to ensure that any changes in furnace minimum standards are timed to coincide with the start of the 2014-2015 heating season.", "The requested delay, AHRI noted, would enable manufacturers to avoid economic losses and market disruptions for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 heating seasons.", "Third, distributors and installers emphasized the need for additional \"sell-through time\" to avoid losses from stranded inventory. HARDI (the association of equipment distributors) and ACCA supported the AHRI-proposed extension. HARDI stressed that the DOE approach to regional standards had been very difficult for distributors, and AHRI stressed the economic importance of coordinating the projected preparation time needed with the compliance date constraint:", "We request that DOE grant this petition as soon as possible, but by no later than September 15, 2012; otherwise manufacturers and distribution channels will begin to incur significant market disruptions and economic losses as they will have to re-position product offerings and distribution for the upcoming heating season. The 18-month delay would make the effective date November 1, 2014. This is still two years before what would have been the normal effective date for these standards and less than two years from DOE publication of its enforcement rule, assuming that DOE publishes this rule near the end of this year [2012].", "Uncertainties about requirements for enforcement and product labeling were additional concerns that prompted industry efforts to extend the time period for compliance. AHRI cited the fact that DOE had not yet prescribed the final enforcement information measures that manufacturers, distributors, and installers would be required to take in order to establish compliance with regional standards. The AHRI petition emphasized that:", "Inasmuch as DOE has not even published a proposed rule on regional standards enforcement and recognizing that under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) DOE has 15 months from the date it prescribes regional standards to prescribe regional standards enforcement rules, AHRI assumes that it will be the end of the year [2012] before a final rule is published ... if [the final rule] imposes an obligation to track products or to submit additional information, manufacturers should be allowed a minimum of 12 months to begin compliance . Distributors and contractors will, of course, have their own compliance lead time needs depending on what they are required to do by the final rule. (emphasis added)", "Also, AHRI noted that product labeling for regional standards enforcement would require several months of lead time for compliance. In conclusion, AHRI reflected on the new process, while requesting an adjustment to the compliance date: \"Regional standards and direct final rules are new both to DOE and to industry and other stakeholders, and all of us are learning from experience. AHRI has readily engaged in negotiating consensus standards ...

ACCA elaborated that such venting is a problem for some residential buildings, such as row houses. \"The requirement that non-weatherized furnaces installed in the north[ern] region meet a minimum 90% AFUE poses potential installation issues for contractors and their customers. In certain cases, adequately addressing the ventilation and condensate requirements for higher efficiency may cause the installation costs to increase considerably or make the installation impractical or impossible.\"", "Under certain conditions, EISA \u00a7306 allows for waivers of the regional standard.

The waiver process would allow a trained contractor to determine whether a specific installation job would qualify for a waiver, then file documentation with the Department of Energy after the installation. It's important to note that until the DOE finalizes the enforcement rule, it is unknown whether waivers will be allowed, the criteria for allowing them, or the exact process to obtain one. But the fact waivers are being considered is causing some confusion about the new furnace rule.", "Thus, although the waiver provision appears to have been designed to help create flexibility for addressing potential barriers to a regional standard, ACCA viewed it as contributing to uncertainty about enforcement of the rulemaking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pressure to Switch from Gas to Electric", "paragraphs": ["In its comments on DOE's Enforcement Framework Document , APGA contended that DOE's proposed regional standard rule could cause consumers to switch fuels:", "One of APGA's main concerns regarding the DFR analysis is that, by forcing consumers in the Northern Region to replace non-condensing furnaces with condensing furnaces in order to meet the new 90% AFUE standard, the new rule will precipitate substantial fuel switching from gas-fired furnaces and water heaters to their electric (or other, such as kerosene) counterparts\u2014a result that undermines the policy goals of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.", "APGA stressed that, for a standard to address a key problem of the DFR\u2014specifically, the assumption that life cycle energy and cost savings will prevent fuel switching\u2014the standard must account for the income level of the affected consumers. DOE, it stated, concludes that most affected consumers will act in an economically rational fashion and hence will not switch from gas to electric equipment. APGA finds DOE's logic faulty, noting:", "The problem with DOE's rationale is that there are many millions of lower income persons for whom the key determinant\u2014in fact, the only determinant\u2014is the up-front cost disparity for purchase and installation of gas equipment versus electric equipment; the record in the DFR proceeding [and other documents] ... are crystal clear that, on the basis of up-front costs, fuel switching will occur. Lower income consumers do not make decisions regarding household appliances such as furnaces and water heaters based on life cycle costs because they are living paycheck to paycheck (assuming they are employed at all) and hence make economic choices based on immediate out-of-pocket costs.... The only way to mitigate this unintended but certain outcome of the DFR is a meaningful waiver provision.", "Based on that view, APGA advocated for two distinct waiver provisions: one based on income level, and one based on characteristics of the building. In the first case, APGA stressed that an \"effective\" waiver must allow all gas consumers below a certain income level to \"self-certify\" to that effect, thereby permitting them to \"replace a non-condensing furnace with a [new] non-condensing furnace if they choose.\" APGA observed that such a self-certification approach has worked for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which supports those needing assistance in paying for their home energy needs. However, APGA argued that the LIHEAP level of income eligibility is too low to be \"fully effective\" for residential furnace waiver qualification. Instead, APGA proposed that 250% of the poverty level \"will catch most, though certainly not all.\" of the lower income customers that would otherwise switch to another fuel.", "In the second case, APGA recommended a waiver provision targeted to all row houses, and any similar residential buildings, for an exemption from the 90% AFUE standard\u2014regardless of the income level of the occupants.

This assessment must address public comments on the proposed standard and consider, \"to the greatest extent practicable,\" several additional factors.", "To address the criterion of \"technological feasibility\" DOE assesses the full range of commercially available equipment and its associated energy efficiency levels.

DOE must then assess whether that level would achieve a \"significant amount of energy savings.\"", "Market Participants and Distribution Channels", "The RAP identified non-weatherized (indoor) natural gas furnaces as accounting for the dominant market share among the family of residential furnace equipment types:", "Because the large majority of residential furnace shipments fall into the non-weatherized gas product class, DOE will focus heavily on non-weatherized gas-fired furnaces. As a result, DOE plans to select units for teardown that will include approximately 25 non-weatherized gas-fired furnaces, 4 weatherized gas-fired furnaces, 6 mobile home gas-fired furnaces, and 8 non-weatherized oil-fired furnaces.", "In order to estimate the price \"markup\" that a manufacturer adds to furnace production cost, DOE had to define furnace market participants and identify associated distribution channels (supply chains). The RAP describes the furnace distribution channel in simple terms:", "Most residential furnaces pass through the following distribution channel: the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) assembles the system and sells it to a distributor; the distributor sells the unit to a contractor; the contractor sells the unit to the final end-user and performs the installation. After installation, the contractor performs all service on the system, including inspection, maintenance, and repair.", "The RAP provides rich detail about the contractor portion of the channel, where the direct interaction with consumers takes place:", "Most contractors compete at the local level and the majority of them are small businesses. Many contractors carry products made by more than one manufacturer. Contractors interface with the end-user: installing new furnace systems to their specifications as well as inspecting, servicing, or repairing the existing system. In the residential furnace market, contractors sell products as part of an installation package and do not list retail product prices separately from installation cost. Furthermore, differences in local markets, weather conditions, and many other factors can affect the price [that] contractors charge for furnaces. (emphasis added)", "Potential Industry Impacts of Regional Standards", "In the RAP , DOE stated that it expected similar issues for the new DFR rule as it had experienced in its previous rulemaking for this equipment. In describing DOE's methods for assessing potential impacts of regional standards, the RAP notes the similarities of the market participants and distribution channels for each of each of the three types of equipment covered by DOE's 2007 rule that called for an 80% AFUE standard:", "Market participants in the residential furnace distribution chain are often represented by the same trade associations as those in the central air conditioning and heat pump distribution chain. For the current [2007] central air conditioner and heat pump standards rulemaking, DOE conducted limited interviews with distributors and contractors, and sought comment regarding the potential impacts of regional standards as they relate to these products. Commenters noted that distributors and contractors of central air conditioners and heat pumps also service furnaces and face very similar issues with respect to regional standards. (emphasis added)", "DOE's RAP laid out three potential ways that the new standards could affect industry. First, DOE anticipated that new regional standards could disrupt existing supply chains. Based on the comments of the distributors, the RAP recounted DOE's interpretation of their views and concerns:", "The distributors were concerned that possible disparities between the regional boundaries for standards and existing distribution boundaries may prove problematic. Distributors stated that regional standards may be defined based on geographic boundaries composed of state lines, which are usually different than the boundaries of markets for heating and cooling products. Additionally, distributors were concerned about the possible impact of regional standards on the efficiency of the distribution chain, and ultimately, their ability to control costs. National and regional distributors stated that they would face decreases in their economies of scale, which currently affect products that can be stocked and sold nationwide. They stated that if certain products could not be sold throughout the entire country, then the cost of those products in the regions where they could be sold would be driven up. They added that distributors [in] service areas that overlap borders between regions would be particularly affected, as their costs would increase due to the more complex and diverse inventories.", "Second, DOE foresaw that supply chain disruption could raise management and compliance costs. For furnace distributors and contractors, DOE anticipated that the regional standards would present two new challenges:", "Based on the ... interviews and its own preliminary market assessment, DOE believes there are two main ways in which regional standards could impact furnace distributors and contractors. First, because some distributors close to borders of regions may sell products in more than one region, complying with standards that differ across regions may cause these distributors to carry a different mix of inventory to fill orders in each region. The inventory management costs could increase or the overall investment in inventory could increase. Second, EISA 2007 allows for regional standards to be enforced at the installation level, in addition to the existing enforcement of national efficiency standards at the manufacturer level. As a consequence, there likely would be new compliance costs for distributors and contractors, involving at a minimum additional record-keeping and reporting. (emphasis added)", "Third, the DOE Plan also anticipated that distributors and contractors would respond to the above-noted cost increases by increasing prices:", "Based on its current assessment of the market, DOE believes that any additional costs that regional standards may impose on furnace distributors and contractors would be reflected by a change in the markups used by these entities. In its analysis of regional standards, DOE plans to estimate changes in markups based on an assessment of (1) the inventory that would likely be carried in various geographic areas (South, North, and border areas), and (2) the potential costs of enforcement requirements. (emphasis added)", "Some Key Economic Assumptions", "Energy Price Assumptions", "DOE's Appliance Standards Program planned to use the Energy Information Administration's (EIA's) projections of national average natural gas, propane, electricity, and fuel oil prices to residential consumers to estimate future energy prices. The most recent edition of EIA's Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) was chosen to serve as the source of projections for future energy prices.", "Equipment First Cost vs. Life Cycle Cost", "In order to analyze future monetary \"first costs\" of furnace equipment and the costs associated with the equipment's energy use through a long-term future, DOE had to select a value for the consumer discount rate:", "The calculation of [Life Cycle Cost] requires the use of an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of operating expenses during the product lifetime. The discount rate used in the LCC analysis represents the rate from an individual consumer's perspective.... For consumers of residential furnaces, DOE plans to use the same approach that it relied on to develop discount rates for the November 2007 residential furnaces and boilers standards rulemaking (i.e., deriving the discount rates from estimates of the \"finance cost\" to purchase residential products).", "Potential Risk of Fuel Switching", "The potential problem of fuel-switching (product-switching) was addressed in the RAP : ", "DOE also plans to account for fuel and product switching that may result from standards requiring higher-efficiency furnaces. Because home builders are sensitive to first costs, a standard level that significantly increases the purchase price may induce some builders to switch to a different heating system. Such a standard level may also induce some home owners to replace their existing furnace with a different heating product, although in this case switching may incur additional costs to accommodate the different product. The decision to switch is also affected by the prices of the energy sources for competing products (i.e., the prices of natural gas and electricity). DOE's analysis will account for the key factors expected to influence fuel and product switching that may result from standards requiring higher-efficiency furnaces. DOE will take into consideration factors from the rulemaking on heat pumps that may influence fuel switching from furnaces, in particular the potential installed costs of heat pumps, which compete with furnaces in some markets.", "Estimating the Future Value of Energy Savings", "To estimate the values for cumulative energy savings, DOE adopted OMB-specified guidelines for values of discount rates:", "According to U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for Federal agencies, DOE will conduct two NPV [net present value] calculations, one using a real discount rate of 3 percent and another using a real discount rate of 7 percent. The discount rates for the determination of NPV are in contrast to the discount rates used in the LCC analysis, which are designed to reflect a consumer's perspective. The 7-percent real value is an estimate of the average before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. economy. The 3-percent real value represents the \"societal rate of time preference,\" which is the rate at which society discounts future consumption flows to their present value.", "Key Issues for Public Comment", "The RAP noted that DOE wanted to receive public comment on a variety of key issues, including: ", "The consensus agreement; The combining of multiple equipment standards into a single rulemaking that covered residential central air conditioners, heat pumps, residential furnaces, and furnace fans; DOE's proposed definitions of regions, for the analysis of regional standards; and The viability of the regional standard enforcement mechanisms presented in the RAP , other mechanisms DOE should consider, and the extent to which these mechanisms would result in additional financial burdens to consumers, manufacturers, contractors, distributors, dealers, and installers. In particular, DOE stated an interest in data on how, if at all, the enforcement options would increase compliance costs and/or other costs.", "Appendix D.
