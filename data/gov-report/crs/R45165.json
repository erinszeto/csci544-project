The farm commodity program provisions in Title I of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79, the 2014 farm bill) consists of three types of support for crop years 2014-2018:", "1. Price Loss Coverage (PLC) payments. PLC payments occur if the national average marketing year price for a \"covered commodity\" (e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, and peanuts, among others) is below its \"reference price.\" The difference between these two prices is the per-unit payment rate, which is multiplied by historical program yields and paid on 85% of historical program acres (i.e., base acres). 2. Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) payments. ARC payments occur when annual crop revenue for a county or an individual producer is below its guaranteed level based on a five-year moving average of historical crop revenue. The difference between these prices is the per-acre payment rate, which is paid on 85% of base acres. 3. Marketing Assistance Loans (MAL). MAL offers interim financing for a group of \"loan\" commodities (consisting of covered crops plus several others) that is equal to actual production multiplied by statutorily set loan rates. Additional benefits are available to producers if market prices fall below loan rates.", "These three commodity support programs are in effect for the 2014-2018 crop years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) reported that ARC and PLC payments exceeded $5 billion in FY2014, and payments reached nearly $7 billion in both FY2015 and FY2016. Under current law, the Congressional Budget Office projects farm commodity program payments to exceed a combined total of $4 billion each fiscal year from 2016 to 2027.", "The \"covered commodities\" that qualify for ARC and PLC include wheat, feed grains (corn, sorghum, barley, oats), seed cotton, rice, soybeans, other oilseeds (sunflower seed, rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, crambe, and sesame seed), and peanuts.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) implements the majority of the farm bill programs. This report focuses on commodity program payments authorized by Title I of the 2014 farm bill. The authority for USDA to operate farm commodity support programs comes from three permanent laws, as amended: the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (P.L. 75-430), the Agricultural Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-439), and the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act of 1948 (P.L. 80-806).

These risks could potentially include market price instability and crop failure. Proponents see the goal of farm policy as maintaining the economic health of the nation's farm sector so as to facilitate adequate domestic supplies of food, feed, and fiber and to allow U.S. agriculture to fully exploit its comparative advantage in producing high-quality, affordable agricultural products for the global market.

The President's FY2019 budget proposes lowering the AGI cap for eligibility for commodity program payments to $500,000 from $900,000. Several large farm groups and commodity associations are opposed to lowering the AGI limit to qualify for farm program benefits. The AGI for an individual producer\u2014or a farm entity\u2014is determined by averaging the AGI declared on federal tax forms for the three tax years prior to the most recent tax year. ", "Limits on eligibility based on income were first introduced in 2002. The 2002, 2008, and 2014 farm bills have each addressed the AGI limit using a different approach:", "The 2002 farm bill established that producers with an AGI exceeding $2.5 million were not eligible for certain program benefits. The 2008 farm bill established separate AGI limits for farm income ($750,000) and off-farm income ($500,000). The 2014 farm bill re-established the AGI limit as a single limit on all income (on-farm and off-farm) of $900,000 (three-year average) or double that amount for married couples filing separate tax returns. A producer with an AGI in excess of $900,000 is not eligible for benefits under ARC-CO, ARC-IC, PLC, or MAL. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
