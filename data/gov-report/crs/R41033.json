Although some countermeasures have been acquired through this law, Congress continues to address several Project BioShield-related policy issues. These include whether to continue diverting Project BioShield acquisition funding to other purposes; whether to change the countermeasure development and acquisition process; how to replace stockpiled countermeasures as they expire; and whether to alter federal efforts to encourage the development of broad-spectrum countermeasures.", "This law provides three main authorities: (1) relaxing regulatory requirements for some CBRN terrorism-related spending, including hiring personnel and awarding research grants; (2) guaranteeing a federal market for new CBRN medical countermeasures; and (3) permitting emergency use of unapproved countermeasures. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has used each of these authorities. The HHS used expedited review authorities to approve contracts and grants related to CBRN countermeasure research and development. The HHS used the authority to guarantee a government market to obligate approximately $2.5 billion to acquire countermeasures against anthrax, botulism, radiation, and smallpox. The HHS has also employed the emergency use authority several times, including during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-90) advance-appropriated $5.593 billion for FY2004 to FY2013 for CBRN countermeasures acquisition through Project BioShield. Through FY2011, subsequent Congresses have removed $1.461 billion from this account through rescissions and transfers, more than 25% of the advance appropriation. The transfers from this account supported CBRN medical countermeasure advanced development, pandemic influenza preparedness and response, and basic biomedical research. The President's FY2012 budget requests a transfer of $765 million out of this account to support CBRN countermeasure advanced development and to establish a CBRN countermeasure strategic investment corporation.", "Since passing the Project BioShield Act, subsequent Congresses have considered additional measures to further encourage countermeasure development. The 109th Congress created the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in HHS through the Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417). Among other duties, BARDA oversees all of HHS's Project BioShield procurements. The Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act also modified the Project BioShield procurement process.

According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), HHS used the simplified acquisitions procedure authority for five contracts. These contracts, all executed between 2004 and 2005 using funds from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), totaled approximately $30 million. Through December 2009, HHS had not exercised this authority to use other than full and open competition.", "The Project BioShield Act authorizes the HHS Secretary to use an expedited peer review award process for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements related to CBRN countermeasure R&D, if the Secretary deems that a pressing need for an expedited award exists. The act limits this authority to awards worth $1.5 million or less. This expedited award process replaces the normal peer review process. Some scientists have expressed concerns that an expedited review process would reduce research quality. The normal peer review process can provide proposals with greater scientific merit a higher probability of receiving funding, a factor potentially lost in an expedited process. According to HHS, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) awarded 5 contracts and 56 grants through this expedited peer review process through December 2009. According to NIAID, grants that go through the normal peer review process typically take 9 to 18 months to receive funding.

Originally, HHS could pay a company only on the delivery of a substantial portion of the countermeasure. The Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act ( P.L. 109-417 ) modified the Project BioShield Act to allow for milestone-based payments of up to half of the total award before delivery.

Potential countermeasure developers considered the establishment of a separate, advance-funded account dedicated solely to countermeasure procurement as integral to their participation in this program. The advance funding helped assure developers that payment for successfully developed countermeasures would not depend on future, potentially uncertain appropriations processes. Although advance funding the Project BioShield account may have provided some assurance of funding stability to developers, in practice, these funds have been subject to the annual appropriations process. Subsequent Congresses have rescinded or transferred more than 25% of the advance appropriation. Additional transfers proposed by the President for FY2012, if enacted, would increase the total amount rescinded and transferred out of this fund to 40% of the initial advance appropriation.

In appropriating $5.6 billion over ten years for Project BioShield, Congress anticipated an average obligation rate of $560 million per year. However, HHS has obligated these funds at a slower pace, an average of $320 million annually. If Congress had not made rescissions and transfers to other accounts, HHS would have needed to obligate an average of $1 billion annually from FY2011 to FY2013 to exhaust the fund before its expiration. After accounting for the enacted rescissions and transfers, HHS needs to obligate an average of $520 million annually from FY2011 to FY2013 to exhaust the fund before its expiration.

Continued transfers would reduce the amount of money available for countermeasure procurement, could affect the willingness of developers to participate in Project BioShield, and might change the respective roles of the federal government and private developers in countermeasure development.

However, if funding began to constrain countermeasure procurement, Congress could reverse this course and appropriate additional money for Project BioShield acquisitions. ", "Congress attempted to address developers' concern regarding the consistent availability of funding for countermeasure procurement by providing a 10-year advance appropriation. Continuing the pattern of annual transfers out of this fund, even with the potential for additional appropriations in future years, might cause potential countermeasure developers to feel dependent on the actions of future appropriators, precisely the situation that establishment and advance funding of the special reserve fund was designed to ameliorate. If potential countermeasure developers feel more dependent on the actions of future appropriators, they may be less inclined to begin or continue countermeasure development.

On the other hand, transferring funds to support advanced development may reduce the amount that developers need to raise from other sources. ", "Funding transfers may also modify the relative roles of the federal government and the private sector in Project BioShield. Congress originally designed Project BioShield to minimize the risk that the government would pay for countermeasures that fail during development (see \" Market Guarantee \" above). Congress expected developers to manage this risk, using the government-market guarantee to entice investors to fund countermeasure development.

The Project BioShield Act does not exclude procuring such countermeasures, but it does require that the presence of another commercial market be factored into the HHS Secretary's decision to purchase the countermeasure. The HHS has stated its interest in using Project BioShield to acquire new broad-spectrum countermeasures. However, Project BioShield contracts to date have specifically targeted individual threat agents, a strategy commonly described as \"one bug, one drug.\" According to HHS, BARDA awarded its first advanced development contract for a product \"that has direct multi-purpose potential for biothreat preparedness and routine healthcare,\" in August 2010. Congress may decide that HHS needs further guidance or authorities to encourage the development and acquisition of new broad spectrum countermeasures through Project BioShield."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
