As a result of these modifications, the statute currently laid out in the U.S. Code is structured very differently from the early statutes of 1932 and 1933.

These elements are the reorganization plan contents , the limitations on power , and the expedited parliamentary procedures . The provisions that define the potential scope of reorganization plan content, when combined with the provisions that further limit or prohibit certain reorganization plan content, set the boundaries of a reorganization that the President can propose under this special authority. The provisions that specify the parliamentary procedures to be used define the role of Congress in facilitating or impeding the enactment of a submitted plan.

Congress reshaped the contours of the authority in response to experience and political context. During successive renewals of the authority, Congress sometimes narrowed, and other times expanded, the scope of potential reorganization activities. In addition, the expedited procedures were altered in such a way that it became easier or harder to defeat one of the President's plans, though always easier than under the regular procedures. In general, the trend from the 1940s onward was to narrow the scope of potential activities and to make it easier for Congress to defeat a plan.", "The presidential reorganization authority was not continuous from 1932 to 1984; it lapsed for periods of less than two years on a number of occasions, and for longer periods from 1935 to 1939, from 1941 through 1945, from 1973 to 1977, and from early 1981 to late 1984. As discussed below, the type of expedited parliamentary procedure employed under the reorganization authority\u2014a \"legislative veto\"\u2014was found to be unconstitutional in 1983. The authority was modified to address this issue, and it was extended for approximately two months at the end of 1984. However, this version of reorganization authority was never used; the last plan was submitted in 1980, by President Jimmy Carter.

The text includes brief historical context, a summary of Presidents' requests for the authority and Congress's response, highlights of the changes to the authority over time, and a summary of the plans that were submitted under the authority. Congressional consideration of grants of expedited reorganization authority to the President often included debates over the constitutionality of the legislative veto mechanism that was, until 1984, a key component. Inasmuch as this set of procedures was found to be unconstitutional and has no longer been under consideration in the legislative proposals of recent years, these previous constitutional concerns are not described here. CRS specialists conducted a thorough research of the evolution of these procedures in 1980, however, and the resulting studies were published in a committee print."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Economy Act of 1932 (Hoover)", "paragraphs": ["The earliest antecedent of the reorganization authority that is currently in the U.S. Code dates to 1932. While Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover had been a proponent of the idea that Congress should delegate to the President authority to propose reorganizations of the executive branch for the purposes of improved economy and efficiency, subject to some form of congressional disapproval. He continued to advance this view during his presidency. In 1932, Hoover requested this power, and, a few months prior to the 1932 presidential election, Congress provided the first version of the President's reorganization authority. ", "The statute was enacted on June 30, 1932, during the first session of the 72 nd Congress (1931-1932). Under the act, the President was authorized to direct, by executive order, specified government reorganization actions. Each such executive order was subject to congressional review, and could be nullified by a resolution of disapproval, within 60 days, by either chamber. In the event of an adjournment of Congress within the 60-day period, the order could not become effective until 60 days following reconvening. ", "The first session of the 72 nd Congress adjourned on July 16, 1932, and it did not reconvene until December 5, 1932. The period between enactment and adjournment\u201416 days\u2014seemingly would have been of insufficient duration to allow an executive order to go into effect under the congressional review and disapproval provision of the statute, even if it had been submitted upon enactment. Perhaps for this reason, President Hoover did not submit executive orders under the act to Congress until December 9, 1932. By this time, the President had been defeated in his bid for reelection, and he was completing his term in office.", "The act established definitions for federal government agencies that reflected the distinctions made among various entities at that time. It specified that, for purposes of the statute an \"executive agency\" was a \"commission, board, bureau, division, service, or office in the executive branch,\" with executive departments excluded. An \"independent executive agency,\" by contrast, was an \"executive agency not under the jurisdiction or control of any executive department,\" that is, any freestanding entity that was not a department. Congress continued to distinguish between departments, subunits of departments, and other freestanding federal organizations in later versions of the statute. ", "Under the act, an executive order could ", "transfer all or part of an independent agency and/or its functions to a department or agency; transfer all or part of an agency from one department to another; consolidate or redistribute functions within a department or in its component agencies; or specify the name and functions of a consolidated entity, as well as the title, powers, and duties of its head. ", "The use of these powers was to be consistent with the purposes identified by the statute: that is, to group, coordinate, and consolidate agencies according to major purpose; to reduce the number of agencies by combining those with similar functions; to eliminate overlap and duplication of effort; and to \"segregate regulatory agencies and functions from those of an administrative and executive character.\"", "Within these broad parameters, limitations were placed on the range of actions the President could include in an executive order. The statute provided that \"Whenever \u2026 the President concludes that any executive department or agency created by statute should be abolished and the functions thereof transferred to another executive department or agency or eliminated entirely the authority granted in this title shall not apply.\" In other words, an executive order under this authority could not abolish an entire federal organization or eliminate all of its functions.", "During the remainder of his term, President Hoover issued 11 executive orders under the authority of the act. The orders directed the consolidation, coordination, and grouping of specified agencies and activities according to the major functions and purposes. As previously noted, the act included a mechanism for disapproval by a resolution of a single house of Congress, also known as a \"one-house legislative veto.\" Following four days of hearings in late December 1932, the House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments recommended that the House disapprove all of the executive orders. Among other reasons, the committee expressed reservations about binding the incoming President with the initiatives of the outgoing President. The committee's report, published on January 9, 1933, noted that the testimony of the President's Director of the Budget appeared to endorse this view:", "At the conclusion of his testimony Colonel [J. Clawson] Roop, in reply to a question of the chairman of the committee, expressed his personal opinion that it would be unwise to make the proposed changes on the eve of the inauguration of a new President. This view, coming as it did from the Director of the Budget, the official who was designated by the President to prepare the information upon which the orders were based, naturally had great weight with members of the committee.", "The House disapproved all 11 of Hoover's orders on January 19, 1933, thus preventing their implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Amendments of 1933 (Roosevelt)", "paragraphs": ["On January 3, 1933, President Hoover spoke out against opposition to his reorganization orders, and he urged Congress to either allow them to take effect, or to provide an enhanced authority to the next President:", "The same opposition has now arisen which has defeated every effort at reorganization for 25 years.... The proposal to transfer the job of reorganization to my successor is simply a device by which it is hoped that these proposals can be defeated.... Any real reorganization sensibly carried out will sooner or later embrace the very orders I have issued.... Either Congress must keep its hands off now, or they must give to my successor much larger powers of independent action than given to any President if there is ever to be reorganization. And that authority to be effective should be free of the limitations in the law passed last year which gives Congress the veto power, which prevents the abolition of functions, which prevents the rearrangement of major departments. Otherwise, it will, as is now being demonstrated in the present law, again be make-believe.", "Consistent with the spirit of this statement, one day before leaving office, President Hoover signed the Treasury-Post Office Appropriations Act of March 3, 1933, which included an amendment to the 1932 statute that extended and strengthened reorganization authority for the benefit of his successor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The 1932 provisions were further amended on March 20, 1933, after Roosevelt took office.", "As amended in 1933, the act expressed a greater sense of urgency, in the context of the national economic downturn, to reorganize the federal government. The introductory statement of the statute began: ", "The Congress hereby declares that a serious emergency exists by reason of the general economic depression; that it is imperative to reduce drastically governmental expenditures; and that such reduction may be accomplished in great measure by proceeding immediately under the provisions of this title. ", "The changes in the amended act addressed some of the features that Hoover had perceived to be shortcomings in the original law: ", "While the executive orders were to be submitted to Congress as before, the amended act provided no expedited method of congressional disapproval. Consequently, any executive order under the 1933 act would go into effect, absent enactment of a new law to the contrary. Under the amended act, the list of possible reorganizational actions was expanded to include the abolishment of a statutorily established agency or function. An exception to this authority was that an order could not abolish or transfer a department or all of its functions.", "Overall, the 1933 amendments expanded the range of actions the President could order under the authority, and it all but eliminated the ability of Congress to prevent such orders from taking effect. Unlike the original 1932 act, however, the amended statute had a sunset date: Executive orders under this authority had to be transmitted to Congress within two years from enactment.", "Despite the availability of expansive reorganization powers, Roosevelt did not undertake a comprehensive rearrangement of the executive branch. He did, however, issue a number of executive orders making various individual regroupings, consolidations, transfers, and abolitions of executive agencies and functions. According to one observer, the most important of these changes were:", "The creation of an Office of National Parks, Buildings, and Reservations in the Department of the Interior in order to consolidate all functions of administering public buildings and reservations, national parks, national monuments, and national cemeteries; the creation of divisions of Disbursement and Procurement in the Treasury Department to handle all of the government's disbursement and procurement activities; the abolition of the United States Shipping Board and the transfer of its functions and those of its subsidiary Fleet Corporation to the Department of Commerce; the consolidation of the separate Bureaus of Immigration and Naturalization into the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the Department of Labor; the transfer of the functions of the Federal Board for Vocational Education to the Interior Department, where they were assigned to the Office of Education; the consolidation of all the government's agricultural credit agencies in a newly created Farm Credit Administration; the transfer of the Office of the Alien Property Custodian and its functions to the Department of Justice; the abolition of the Board of Indian Commissioners and the transfer of its functions to the Department of the Interior; and the creation of a Division of Territories and Insular Possessions in the Department of the Interior to consolidate all the governments functions pertaining to territorial matters.", "In his message transmitting Executive Order 6166 to Congress, President Roosevelt stated that it would \"effect a saving of more than $25,000,000.\" Whether such savings ultimately were achieved under the order is unknown. It does not appear, however, that the number of government agencies declined during this period. One later assessment observed that, \"[i]n the eighteen months from the middle of 1933 to the end of 1934, 60 new administrative units were created, some by Congress and others by executive order in pursuance of general legislation. None of these took the departmental form, and many remain[ed] as permanent units.\"", "Roosevelt's public statements suggest that he did not believe, in general, that government reorganization would be a source of much savings. He expressed this clearly in his articulation of the administrative benefits of reorganization when he sought a renewal of the authority in 1937:", "The experience of states and municipalities definitely proves that reorganization of government along the lines of modern business administrative practice can increase efficiency, minimize error, duplication and waste, and raise the morale of the public service. But that experience does not prove, and no person conversant with the management of large private corporations or of governments honestly suggests, that reorganization of government machinery in the interest of efficiency is a method of making major savings in the cost of government. ", "Large savings in the cost of government can be made only by cutting down or eliminating government functions. And to those who advocate such a course it is fair to put the question\u2014which functions of government do you advocate cutting off?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reorganization Authority Proposal During the 75th Congress (1937-1938) (Roosevelt)", "paragraphs": ["By mid-1935, the reorganization authority that had been provided in 1933 had expired. Organizational changes under this authority, as well as statutes enacted by Congress during the first years of the Roosevelt Administration, had created a federal bureaucracy seemingly in need of administrative reorganization and improved management. In early 1936, both Congress and the President initiated studies of potential reorganization of the executive branch. The results of these studies were not publically released until after the 1936 election and the beginning of both the President's second term and the 75 th Congress (1937-1938).", "The research on behalf of Congress, which was carried out by the Brookings Institution, resulted in a series of 15 reports that were submitted to Congress periodically during this time. The reports were combined into a 1,200 page Senate report that was published in August 1937. This report contained the results of \"a study of the organization and administration of [then] existing functions and \u2026 recommendations regarding the improvement of their administrative performance.\" As such, it did not speak to the question of presidential reorganization authority.", "By early 1937, the study conducted on the President's behalf had been completed and reported to the President and Congress. This work, which was carried out by the President's Committee on Administrative Management, also known as the Brownlow Committee, resulted in a legislative proposal that was forwarded to Congress. Included in the proposal was a new version of reorganization authority. The proposal differed from the 1933 amendments in a number of ways that arguably would have shifted more power from Congress to the President than had been the case in the previous law. For example, the President would not have been required to inform, or get approval from, Congress as part of the process. In addition, the authority, previously authorized for two years, would have been without expiration. Furthermore, the range of reorganizational tools available to the President would have been greater. Among other possible actions, he would have been empowered to establish or abolish any government agency or federal corporation, including a department. The proposal to reactivate and expand the authority was embedded in draft legislation that also would have made statutory changes to the federal government, including establishment of a Department of Social Welfare and a Department of Public Works. ", "Consideration of the Administration's request for executive branch reorganization authority appears to have been influenced by a proposal by the President, during the same session of Congress, to reorganize the federal judiciary. By this time, President Roosevelt had completed his first term and much of his New Deal economic and social legislative agenda had been enacted. The Supreme Court, in turn, had invalidated some of these laws. The President's proposal to reorganize the judiciary, which has frequently been referred to as his \"court-packing plan,\" would have temporarily expanded the number of members of the Supreme Court and allowed the President to appoint additional Justices. These new Justices presumably would have ruled more favorably on challenges to New Deal legislation. The President's plan was seen by some to be an effort to aggrandize the power of the executive. It proved to be controversial, and, opposed even by some Members of Congress of his own party, it was never enacted.", "In this context, the President's request for expanded executive branch reorganization authority was viewed by some as another effort to expand the President's power, in this case at the expense of the legislative branch. For example, during Senate debate on reorganization authority in early 1938, one Senator drew an explicit connection between the two efforts:", "[A] year ago, when like a vagrant meteor the Court-packing scheme burst upon the horizon of our Legislature, the people, both legislators and onlookers, stood aghast, astonished, and bewildered. Little time had they to appreciate what that bill then was; and no time had they to appreciate that the complement of that bill, the so-called reorganization bill, followed and was a part of the scheme which was then presented to the American people.", "A year ago we had two bills. The first was the Court-packing bill, which was designed to give the President control of the courts. The second was the reorganization bill, which was designed to give the President all the power Congress possessed. If either bill were successful, that which was desired would be brought about. ", "The Court bill was not successful. Its purpose has been and will be accomplished in a measure because time and nature have done their work. So the President has attained in part his object in that regard.", "The reorganization bill has not yet been successful. Yet men stand upon this floor\u2014just as good men as any of the rest of us, no doubt, with the same patriotic impulses the same desire to protect and preserve liberty in this land\u2014and plead for the passage of the reorganization bill, which gives to the President plenary powers in the entire domain of Congress.", "Some scholars have also attributed congressional opposition to other factors. Included in these factors are perceptions of insufficient consultation with congressional leadership and inadequate attention to spending reductions, as well as opposition to the establishment of one or more new departments.", "Early in 1938, the Senate passed a renewal of reorganization authority that was more limited than what the President had requested. Notably, it would have required that the President inform Congress of executive orders under the statute. In addition, the authority would have been of only two years duration. The range of reorganizational tools available to the President would have been similar to those that had been available in 1933. The Senate-passed measure was considered and amended in the House. The House amendments restored a version of the 1932 mechanism for congressional disapproval of the executive orders, among other changes. Ultimately the bill was recommitted in the House and never enacted.

The terms of the legislation were more limited in scope than those that had been requested during the preceding two years, and the Reorganization Act of 1939 was enacted on April 3, 1939. One observer noted:", "The Reorganization bill introduced in 1939 stood in sharp contrast to the measure defeated by the House the previous year. It was extremely mild, omitting nearly every controversial feature of its predecessor.... It sparked no storm of controversy; public fear was absent and pressure groups were quiescent.", "The authority, delineated under the first title of the statute, differed from that of 1933 in several ways. First, the legal vehicle by which a reorganization initiative would be proposed by the President was to be a reorganization plan, rather than an executive order. This provision addressed a long-standing concern that allowing Congress to void an executive order by resolution was a violation of the separation of powers. Second, a reorganization plan could be nullified by concurrent resolution of Congress within 60 calendar days of its transmittal\u2014a so-called two-house legislative veto. This mechanism for congressional involvement in the process represented somewhat of a middle ground between the 1932 statute, which allowed either house to nullify the President's proposal by simple resolution, and the 1933 statute, which had no provision for congressional nullification of an initiative. ", "The 1939 act provided the President with less authority and included more limits than the 1933 act. Although a reorganization plan under the 1939 act could abolish agencies and transfer functions, as could be done under the 1933 statute, it could no longer abolish functions. In addition, the range of actions that could not be included in a plan was expanded to include ", "the creation of a new department; a change in the name of a department or the title of its head, or the designation of any agency as \"department\" or its head as \"Secretary\"; the transfer, consolidation, or abolition of the whole or any part of 21 enumerated agencies; the continuation of an agency or function beyond the time provided for by law; and the exercise of a function not provided for in law.", "As had been the case under the 1933 law, the authority under the 1939 act was of limited duration. All plans had to be transmitted to Congress before January 21, 1941, the beginning of the next presidential term. ", "President Roosevelt submitted five plans under the act, and each went into effect. Although not required by the act, Congress passed a joint resolution of approval in each case. These resolutions provided a way for Congress to \"amend\" the plans as to their application and effective dates. ", "One of the plans faced opposition, but ultimately was approved. The House passed a concurrent resolution disapproving Reorganization Plan No. IV of 1940, but the Senate did not adopt the measure. The joint resolution of approval under which Congress endorsed the plan was initiated in the House as a joint resolution of approval for Reorganization Plan No. V of 1940. The Senate amended this resolution with approval of plan no. IV, and the House then agreed to the amended resolution. ", "For some Members of Congress, this outcome, in which a plan went into effect despite the opposition of one chamber of Congress, was evidence of the shortcomings of the method of congressional consideration in the 1939 act. For example, in 1945, Representative Walter H. Judd referred to this sequence of events in the context of advocating for a one-house veto over a two-house veto. He stated: ", "[I]t was under that 1939 act that a thing happened which many people here believe was unwise\u2014the transfer of the CAA [Civil Aeronautics Authority] into the Department of Commerce. That reorganization plan was disapproved, as I recall, by a vote of 4 to 1 in this House, but it was approved in the other body by a narrow margin and became the law, despite our objection. It was under that law which the House had disapproved that the CAA was placed under the Department of Commerce, so that it ceased to be a wholly independent quasijudicial agency and became subject to the control of the Secretary of Commerce, who is a political appointee.", "The President's five plans effected a number of changes, including some that had been recommended in the 1937 report of the Brownlow Committee. Included among these changes were reorganizations that shaped the newly created Executive Office of the President (EOP). The Federal Security Agency, predecessor to the Department of Health and Human Services, was also established under this authority, from functions transferred from the Departments of Labor (DOL), the Interior (DOI), and the Treasury (Treasury), as well as the Works Progress Administration, the Social Security Board, and the Civilian Conservation Corps.

By this time, the 1939 authority had been expired for four years. But the President had not been altogether without authority in this area. After the United States entered World War II, Congress provided the President with temporary and limited war-time reorganization authority. The First War Powers Act was enacted December 18, 1941, 11 days after the attack against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, HI. The statute provided the President with authority similar to that which had been conveyed through the Overman Act of 1918, during World War I. Under the authority, the President could transfer and consolidate agencies by executive order without congressional consultation or approval, as long as his actions related to the conduct of the war. After the war, however, the organizational structure of the departments and agencies was to revert to its pre-war status unless arrangements had been statutorily changed in the interim.", "The First War Powers Act seemingly diminished the need for a renewal of the 1939 authority at that time. Its reversion provision, however, planted the seeds for President Truman's 1945 request. As one observer later noted:", "The authority granted under Title I of the 1941 Act was to cease six months after termination of the war; and, as in the case of the Overman Act [of 1918], all agencies were to resume the exercise of duties, powers, and functions 'as heretofore or hereafter by law provided.' American participation in hostilities of World War II lasted almost forty-five months whereas in World War I it had lasted but nineteen. One hundred and thirty-five executive orders had been issued by President Roosevelt in regard to war organizations as contrasted with some twenty-four issued by President [Woodrow] Wilson [under the Overman Act]. The complexity of unraveling such a vast war organization and mobilization of manpower and resources was enormous.", "Truman discussed this problem in his message requesting reorganization authority:", "[E]very step taken under Title I [of the First War Powers Act] will automatically revert, upon the termination of the Title, to the pre-existing status. ", "Such automatic reversion is not workable. I think that the Congress has recognized that fact\u2026. In some instances it will be necessary to delay reversion beyond the period now provided by law, or to stay it permanently. In other instances it will be necessary to modify action heretofore taken under Title I and to continue the resulting arrangement beyond the date of expiration of the Title. Automatic reversion will result in the re-establishment of some agencies that should not be re-established.", "Truman also envisioned reorganization activities not related to post-war reversion under the requested authority. His message stated: \"Quite aside from the disposition of the war organization of the Government, other adjustments need to be made currently and continuously in the Government establishment.\"", "The legislation proposed by the Truman Administration would have been similar to that enacted in 1939. It provided that action by both chambers\u2014a two-house veto\u2014would be required for disapproval of submitted reorganization plans, for example. The Truman proposal differed from the 1939 act in several significant respects, however. Under the proposal, the authority would have been permanent, rather than limited in duration. In addition, no agencies would have been exempted from reorganization activities, and the range of permissible organizational adjustments would have been broader. ", "As before, Congress was not receptive to what was perceived as a broad grant of authority, and the bills that made their way through the House and the Senate were more limited in scope. The first related bill introduced in the House, for example, would have exempted 21 agencies, provided for a one-house veto, and prohibited the establishment of new departments.", "The Administration actively advocated for its version of the authority, and it was successful in obtaining authority that was broader than that initially proposed in the House. Some have also credited Comptroller General Lindsay C. Warren, a former House Member who had been directly involved with the development of the 1939 act, with advancing the Administration's cause, particularly in the House. In a hearing of the House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, Warren gave a vivid description of the problem as he saw it:", "That is why I say the present set-up is a hodgepodge and crazy-quilt of duplications, overlappings, inefficiencies, and inconsistencies, with their attendant extravagance. It is probably an ideal system for the tax eaters and those who wish to keep themselves perpetually attached to the public teat, but it is bad for those who have to pay the bill.", "In his view, this was a problem that the President, with the proposed reorganization authority, might solve, but that Congress could not:", "Here is something that we all admit is bad. We admit this Government establishment just cannot survive at the pace it is going now. I mean the growth of it. Sooner or later it will tumble of its own weight unless something is done to coordinate and check some of this. Now, we have an Executive who says he will do this job fairly and efficiently and fearlessly. Now, when he sends down the plans, if you don't like them, if you put in the cloture provision, you have a right to vote against them. Gentlemen, Congress could sit in daily session here for the next hundred years and they wouldn't reorganize the Government of its own volition. And that is not any detraction of Congress, when I say that.", "Active congressional consideration of reorganization authority began in September of 1945, and a bill was enacted three months later on December 20. ", "The new statute was similar to that of 1939 in a number of ways. In a victory for the Administration, disapproval of reorganization plans still required action by both chambers. But the Administration did not get the permanent authority it sought; the duration of the new authority was to be roughly two and a quarter years. In addition, certain kinds of reorganization activities, such as the power to abolish or create a department, were still prohibited. ", "The new statute also differed from that of 1939 in several ways. The 1939 act opened by stating: \"The Congress hereby declares that by reason of continued national deficits beginning in 1931 it is desirable to reduce substantially Government expenditures.\" This declaration was dropped in 1945, although the act did include among its six purposes \"to reduce expenditures and promote economy.\" Listed first among these purposes, however, was \"to facilitate orderly transition from war to peace.\" Another way in which the 1945 act differed from the 1939 act is that, whereas the earlier statute exempted 21 agencies from the authority, the later act partially or fully exempted only 11.", "In addition to these differences, the 1945 act included a new provision that constrained the use of the authority with regard to many independent regulatory agencies. The act provided that", "No reorganization plan shall provide for, and no reorganization under this Act shall have the effect of\u2014\u2026 (6) imposing, in connection with the exercise of any quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative function possessed by an independent agency, any greater limitation upon the exercise of independent judgment and discretion, to the full extent authorized by law, in the carrying out of such function, than existed with respect to the exercise of such function by the agency in which it was vested prior to the taking effect of such reorganization; except that this prohibition shall not prevent the abolition of any such function.", "The Senate Committee on the Judiciary, which added this provision to the legislation it reported, included its rationale in its accompanying report:", "[The provision] represents an attempt by the committee to protect the independent exercise of quasi-judicial authority now vested, by an act of Congress, in agencies in the executive branch. The committee recognizes that the exemptions contained in the bill as reported may be changed or deleted before the bill is enacted in its final form; and the committee strongly urges that, whatever is done with respect to such exemptions, [this] provision \u2026 be retained.", "This sentiment was reiterated by a committee member on the Senate floor shortly before passage of the Senate version:", "The thought of the Senate committee \u2026 was that any quasi-judicial agency in exercising quasi-judicial functions or rule-making functions should be absolutely independent of, say, a Cabinet officer. The purpose of the committee was that in the event a quasi-judicial agency which is now independent should be placed under a Cabinet officer, notwithstanding that fact the Cabinet officer should in no way interfere with the absolute independence of the quasi-judicial junctions or the rule-making functions of such agency.", "President Truman submitted seven different reorganization plans to Congress under the 1945 act: three each in 1946 and 1947, and one in 1948. In response to six of the seven submissions, the House passed resolutions of disapproval. Of these six plans, only three were also disapproved by the Senate and thereby rejected. Such outcomes illustrate the extent to which reorganization authority requiring a two-house veto for disapproval of a plan was more favorable to Administration initiatives than authority with a one-house veto might have been. Had the 1945 act had a one-house veto procedure, it appears that six, rather than three, of Truman's seven plans might have been rejected.", "The disapproved plans included the following:", "Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1946. Among other effects, this plan would have consolidated national housing functions and agencies, and centralized their administration. The plan was opposed by the housing industry. In addition, the plan proposed a national structure that differed from housing policy legislation that was then working its way through Congress. Truman's Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1947, which the Senate allowed to go into effect the following year, reorganized housing agencies and functions in a way that was more acceptable to interested parties. Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1947 and Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1948. Both of these plans would have transferred the U.S. Employment Service to the Department of Labor. The service had been transferred from the Federal Security Agency to the Labor Department under the wartime authority; these plans would have kept it there. The proposed transfer would have strengthened the Department of Labor, which was perceived to favor the interests of organized labor. The plans were opposed by congressional Republicans, who were in the majority in both houses during the 80 th Congress (1947-1948), as well as many conservative Democrats.", "The Reorganization Act of 1945 expired at the end of March 1948."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Reorganization Act of 1949 (Truman)", "paragraphs": ["The Reorganization Act of 1949 was enacted soon after the start of President Truman's second term. The passage of this law followed the release of the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch, which was also known as the Hoover Commission, after its chairman, former President Herbert Hoover. Among other things, the commission supported reactivation of presidential reorganization authority. This support reflected the sentiments of the chairman, who had sought the power during his own presidency (see above). President Truman generally endorsed the work of the commission, and he used reorganization authority to implement some of its recommendations.", "The Hoover Commission had been established by public law on July 7, 1947. The 80 th Congress (1947-1948), which enacted this statute, was led by Republicans, and many of its Members favored containing and shrinking the plethora of federal government agencies that had emerged during the New Deal and World War II. The Senate report on the legislation establishing the commission, for example, expressed this point of view: ", "During the past 16 years, national and international events have necessitated a constantly expanding emergency government. In the wake of the prolonged economic distress of the 1930's and the 4 years of direct participation in World War II, the number of principal components of the Federal Government have multiplied from 521, in 1932, to 2,369, in 1947. The annual pay roll of the executive branch of the Government today approximates 6\u00bc billion dollars which is 1\u00bd billion dollars more than the Government spent for all purposes in 1933. The executive branch now employs more people than all the State, city, and county governments combined. In this sprawling organization called the United States Government, functions and services criss-cross and overlap to a degree which has astounded every student of governmental operation. For example, there are no less than 29 agencies lending Government funds, 34 engaged in the acquisition of land, 16 engaged in wildlife preservation, 10 in Government construction, 9 in credit and finance, 12 in home and community planning, 10 in materials and construction, 28 in welfare matters, 4 in bank examinations, 14 in forestry matters, and 65 in gathering statistics.... And all the evidence points towards still further expansion, aimlessly, pointlessly, pleasing no one and frustrating sincere efforts to serve the people. ", "The first meeting of the Hoover Commission was held in late September 1947. The bipartisan commission, which included 12 members from both the government and the private sector, was charged with studying and investigating \"the present organization and methods of operation\" of all organizational units of the executive branch \"to determine what changes therein are necessary \u2026 to accomplish the purposes\" of the act. These purposes included promoting \"economy, efficiency, and improved service in the transaction of the public business\" in these organizations by:", "(1) limiting expenditures to the lowest amount consistent with the efficient performance of essential services, activities, and functions;", "(2) eliminating duplication and overlapping of services, activities, and functions;", "(3) consolidating services, activities, and functions of a similar nature;", "(4) abolishing services, activities, and functions not necessary to the efficient conduct of government; and ", "(5) defining and limiting executive functions, services, and activities.", "The commission carried out its research via 34 working groups, each charged with examining a particular organizational or policy area. Work began in the fall of 1947 and continued through 1948.", "Some saw the commission as a mechanism for strengthening the ability of the President to manage the large federal bureaucracy by centralizing authorities within the departments and agencies and building the President's management capacity\u2014the mission embodied in the first three purposes enumerated above. Others viewed it as a mechanism for assessing the role of the federal government and recommending abolition of those functions that would better be carried out by the private sector\u2014a mission derived from the latter two purposes above. Hoover appears to have favored both approaches to the commission's work, and the groundwork of the commission during 1947 and 1948 was geared toward accomplishing both of these missions.", "Studies of the commission's work have suggested that Hoover and other Republican members hoped that the commission's recommendations might provide the basis for significant government reform, in terms of both its management and its scope, under an anticipated Republican President. Such reform might have, for example, abolished some of the government functions that were established under the New Deal. After President Truman's reelection, the work of the commission apparently was retailored to focus less on reassessing the purposes of government and more on recommending organizational and managerial improvements that would be more acceptable to the Truman Administration. It has also been argued that the content and tone of the commission's recommendations were moderated by other factors, including the views of the Republican presidential nominee, Thomas E. Dewey; disagreements among commission members; the relationship between President Truman and former President Hoover; and Truman Administration influence.", "By January 1949, the reelection of President Truman, Democratic majorities in both houses, and the support of the Hoover Commission had laid the groundwork for renewing presidential reorganization authority, which had expired at the end of the previous March. Administration-drafted bills were introduced in both houses at the beginning of the Congress, and the legislation was actively considered over the following six months. The Administration sought to make the authority permanent, to eliminate exemptions of agencies, and to permit the creation of new departments. Although the recommendations of the Hoover Commission gained general public and congressional support, opposition to specific elements emerged. One recommended change that faced particularly strong opposition was a proposal to move the civil functions of the Army Corps of Engineers to the Department of the Interior. Whereas in the previous reorganization authority statute, Congress had arranged to protect certain agencies by exempting them and by prohibiting limitations on the judgment or discretion of independent agencies in carrying out quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative functions, legislative deliberations in 1949 yielded a different outcome. Congress elected to provide for disapproval by a vote of either house\u2014a so-called one-house legislative veto\u2014easing rejection of a plan that would reorganize a specific agency. With this procedural safeguard, the reorganization authority was enacted on June 20, 1949.", "The Reorganization Act of 1949 was similar in many respects to its 1945 predecessor; many of the provisions regarding plan contents and limitations remained the same, for example. It differed in several significant ways, however. Chief among these differences was the change in disapproval procedures and the lack of the exempted agencies provisions just discussed. In addition, the list of the six purposes of the authority no longer included a reference to a post-war transition. Instead, a new purpose that perhaps reflected the spirit embodied in the work of the Hoover Commission headed the list: \"to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch of the Government and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business.\" Yet another new provision incorporated a change that had been requested by the Administration: a reorganization plan could include the creation of a new department (although not through consolidation of two or more existing departments and their functions). Another goal of the Administration\u2014permanent authority\u2014was not achieved. Instead, the reorganization power was authorized for nearly four years, which was longer than previous periods.", "During this four-year period, President Truman submitted 41 reorganization plans to Congress. Unlike the bulk of the plans and executive orders submitted under previous reorganization statutes, most of these plans each dealt with a limited number of actions regarding one or two agencies. Many of these plans were designed either to implement recommendations of the Hoover Commission or to apply the principles set forth in the commission's reports. For example, a number of the reorganization plans pertained to the centralization of administrative authority over collegial boards and commissions in their chairs. ", "Eleven of the 41 plans were disapproved by Congress. Two of these\u2014one submitted in 1949 and the other in 1950\u2014would have elevated the Federal Security Agency to department status. Other rejected plans included those that would have:", "vested in the Secretaries of the Treasury and Agriculture functions and powers that had instead been vested by law in subordinate officials in their respective departments; centralized administrative authority in the chairs of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board; transferred the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Department of Commerce; vested appointment authority for local postmasters in the Postmaster General, under the civil service, rather than in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate; abolished certain Bureau of Customs offices that had been filled through appointment by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and transferred their functions to Treasury department officials appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury under the civil service; and vested the appointment authority for U.S. marshals in the Attorney General, under the civil service, rather than in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.", "The last three of these disapproved changes would have converted politically appointed positions, over which Senators were thought to have some influence, into career positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subsequent Reauthorizations of the 1949 Act (Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon)", "paragraphs": ["The Reorganization Act of 1949 was renewed eight times, in 1953, 1955, 1957, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1969, and 1971.

Perhaps most significantly, Byrd's legislation would have strengthened the role of Congress in the process by providing that a proposed reorganization plan would become effective through the adoption of a concurrent resolution of approval, rather than through the lack of a resolution of disapproval. The bill also would have required that the President, in his annual budget message, inform Congress of reorganization plans then under study or consideration.

In addition to adopting the 1981 modifications discussed above, the amendments altered the method by which a plan could take effect. This change responded to a 1983 ruling by the Supreme Court, in INS v. Chadha , that the legislative veto process (i.e., that a plan could be rejected by a resolution of one or both houses) was unconstitutional. Under the new authority, once the President submitted a reorganization plan, Congress was to consider, under an expedited procedure, a joint resolution approving the plan. The expedited procedure included limitations on the duration of committee consideration, the duration of floor debate, and amendments (although the President could amend or modify his plan during the first 60 days after submission). As a joint resolution, this vehicle would need to be approved by the President to have the force of law. Unlike the legislative veto, the burden of action was placed on the proponents of the plan, rather than its opponents. As is the case under the regular legislative process, the default would be the status quo. The process of reorganizing the government was thus made somewhat more difficult than it would have been under earlier versions of presidential reorganization authority.", "The amendments enacted by Congress extended the reorganization plan authority from November 1984 to December 31, 1984. However, the Senate adjourned sine die for the year the day following passage of the bill, and it did not reassemble until January 3, 1985, after the December 31, 1984, deadline for submission of plans had passed. Given the requirement that plans be submitted while Congress was in session, the Reagan Administration had virtually no opportunity to use the authority he had been given. Although the statutory deadline for submission of plans has passed, the dormant statute remains in the U.S. Code .", "The Court's ruling in INS v. Chadha raised concerns that the validity of existing reorganization plans, all of which had gone into effect under reorganization authority with legislative veto provisions, might be called into question.

Alternatively, agency heads could direct reorganization activities within their agencies, where the power to establish organizational arrangements is understood to be inherent or is specified in law. In addition, under Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code , the President could alter organizational arrangements by redelegating functions that Congress has vested in him. ", "Advocates of this approach might argue that existing delegations of reorganization authority provide the Administration with sufficient flexibility to make minor adaptations to changing circumstances. They could argue that a renewal of presidential reorganization authority, which could facilitate larger scale government-wide changes, would be an unnecessary delegation of Congress's role in establishing and shaping the federal bureaucracy. Such an argument might point to the ability of Congress to carry out this role, as evident over the past decade in, for example, the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, the reorganization of the intelligence community, the increase of autonomy for the Federal Emergency Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security, the abolishment of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It could further be argued that Congress, through its committee system, is better suited to represent the broad array of interests that might be affected by alterations to the federal bureaucracy, and that reorganizations that take these interests into account are more likely to endure and not be impeded during the implementation phase. ", "On the other hand, proponents of renewing the authority have argued that Congress has been ineffective in enacting legislation that improves federal organizational arrangements. For example, when introducing his initiative, President Obama stated:", "In 1984 \u2026 Congress stopped granting [presidential reorganization] authority. And when this process was left to follow the usual congressional pace and procedures, not surprisingly, it bogged down. So congressional committees fought to protect their turf and lobbyists fought to keep things the way they were because they were the only ones who could navigate the confusion. And because it's always easier to add than subtract in Washington, inertia prevented any real reform from happening. Layers kept getting added on and added on and added on. ", "At a March 2012 hearing on renewal of the authority, Daniel I. Werfel, the Controller at OMB, acknowledged, however, that Congress was able to legislate a large scale reorganization in the aftermath of 9/11, while differentiating this accomplishment from potential reorganizations based on non-emergency needs:", "I think the important distinguishing factor about Department of Homeland Security reorganization is that that was in response to a crisis and a clear emerging need that was on the national consciousness to realign or clearly protect the homeland.... The fact that the DHS reorganization came together in response to a crisis, from our standpoint, is not sufficient evidence that the executive branch and Congress are ready to be transformative in government reorganization. ", "Congressional committees might elect to conduct oversight of the federal bureaucracy's organizational arrangements, either government wide, or in select policy spheres, regardless of whether or not Congress renews presidential reorganization authority. In the past, when additional investigation and analysis of federal organization were indicated, Congress has sometimes established blue ribbon commissions.

Perhaps chief among these, the expedited congressional procedures are tailored to facilitate consideration of a joint resolution to approve submitted plans, rather than to disapprove submitted plans. In addition, the scope of the 1984 statute is more limited than that of the Carter-era authority: renaming of existing departments is not permitted and a plan could not create a new, freestanding agency.

The prohibition was removed because Members observed that plans under previous acts had created large agencies that were, for all intents and purposes, like departments.

Shortly after taking office in 1953, he submitted a plan that established the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Essentially, this action elevated the existing Federal Security Agency to department status. Notably, Congress endorsed this action by enacting a statute that moved up the effective date of the department's establishment.

The legislative effort to create the department was defeated when the House Rules Committee did not adopt a rule for floor consideration of the measure, reportedly because of civil rights-related issues. The President subsequently submitted Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1962, which also would have established a Department of Urban Affairs and Housing to carry out the functions of several existing agencies.

If the limitation were to be deleted, as the Obama Administration has requested, the authority would be, in this respect, similar to that in use under the Carter Administration. ", "The Senate and House committees of jurisdiction expressed different intentions with regard to this provision. The perspective of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs was captured in the 1981 report of extension legislation:", "Many experts believe there is a need to slow the growth of new independent agencies in the executive branch of government that are not part of an existing executive branch agency. New independent agencies tend to diffuse accountability for programs and policies. The larger the number of such agencies, the more difficult it is for the President to establish, coordinate and implement policies. Since new independent agencies will often report directly to the President and not through a cabinet secretary, their access and participation in the Administration's policy making process is more limited.", "From the perspective of the House Committee on Government Operations, as expressed in its 1983 report on extension legislation, the inclusion of this provision was intended to clarify pre-existing limitations with regard to the creation of new departments and agencies. Taken together with other limitations, the \"requirements reflect the [House] Committee's desire that the creation of new entities in the Executive Branch be subject to the legislation process.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposal as a Whole", "paragraphs": ["If Congress were to renew the presidential reorganization authority as requested by the Obama Administration, without congressional amendment, it would make a delegation of authority that has precedent in the mid-20 th century in a form that has never been tried before. It appears that the statute would provide the President with a greater level of flexibility to establish and abolish departments than has ever been provided before. It could be argued that this power might be circumscribed, in part, by the prohibition on the establishment, by reorganization plan, of any free-standing agencies. To a lesser extent, the use of the power might be shaped by a requirement that the Administration self-certify that a plan is likely to result in a decreased number of agencies or cost saving related to targeted functions. As discussed above, however, such a determination of net changes in the number of agencies and the level of cost-savings could be complicated by definitional issues. The congressional procedures for consideration of a submitted plan would perhaps pose a greater constraint on the President's power under the Obama proposal. Although these specialized parliamentary procedures would be similar to those enacted in 1984, they were never before used in the context of this authority. Arguably, the President could face a greater legislative burden in gaining approval for his plans than did previous Presidents who had similar reorganization authority.

Enact the Authority with Other Amendments", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, should Congress elect to renew presidential reorganization authority, it might reauthorize it in its current form or it might reauthorize it with the amendments requested by the Obama Administration. Naturally, the options for renewing the statute that are available to Congress are not restricted to these two choices. Congress could opt to include any of a variety of other changes. Such changes might amend any of the statute's 12 sections, or add new sections altogether. ", "As noted earlier in this report, each of the elements of reorganization authority is integral to its overall scope and effect; several of these bear particular mention because they establish the roles and authority of the President and Congress, respectively, in this context. These elements are the reorganization plan contents , the limitations on power , and the expedited parliamentary procedures . When combined, the provisions that define the potential scope of reorganization plan content and the provisions that further limit or prohibit certain reorganization plan content set the parameters of a reorganization that the President can propose. For example, the 1977 act allowed that a reorganization plan may provide for consolidating all or part of an agency with all or part of another agency. In the same act, the limitations section provides that a reorganization under this authority may not have the effect of consolidating two or more departments or two or more independent regulatory agencies. In this way, the general authority is modified under specific circumstances. The expedited parliamentary procedures merit close attention in the context of this authority because they define the role of Congress in facilitating or impeding the enactment of the plan developed by the President. The procedures also define steps the President must take during this process, and so prescribe the ease or difficulty, from his perspective, with which a plan might be enacted and implemented.

By eliminating paragraph 2, for example, a proposed plan could no longer provide for the abolition of functions.", "Alternatively, Congress could expand the range of permissible plan provisions. For example, paragraph 2 could be amended by striking the second clause so that \"the abolition of all or a part of the functions of an agency\" would be without qualification. This change was included in legislation proposed by the George W. Bush Administration. The Bush proposal also would have explicitly permitted the submitted plans to include provisions for the creation of new agencies by adding a seventh paragraph to that effect.", "Given that the Obama Administration has described, in general terms, the first reorganization that would be undertaken under renewed authority, Congress might elect to amend the statute to specify that only one plan could be submitted at a time. Such amendments might modify this section and/or the section on limitations to specify the range of agencies or functions that could be included in the plan. This approach might be seen by lawmakers as a middle ground between delegating broad authority to the President and not delegating to him any reorganization authority at all.

The present statute includes seven limitations on what may be included in a reorganization plan.

Limitations could be reduced further than requested by the President to provide even more flexibility. For example, by striking paragraph 7, and eliminating prohibition on \"dealing with more than one logically consistent subject matter\" in plans, the President could submit more comprehensive plans to Congress. This might allow him to construct plans that would combine changes appealing to different constituencies in a way that would increase the likelihood that the plan would be ratified by Congress.", "Alternatively, Congress might elect to add limitations, thus putting further constraints on the President's exercise of reorganization authority. Some potential limitations were included in past versions of reorganization authority, but are no longer included. For example, the limitations section of the 1939 act enumerated 21 agencies that could not be the subject of most of the reorganization activities a plan might specify. It provided that no plan would provide \"for the transfer, consolidation, or abolition of the whole or any part of such agency or of its head, or of all or any of the functions of such agency or of its head.\" Another provision, used in the 1945 act, limited reorganizations with regard to certain agency functions, rather than entire specified agencies. Under the act, no plan was to provide for \"imposing \u2026 any greater limitation upon the exercise of independent judgment or discretion \u2026 in connection with carrying out [quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative] functions,\" than existed prior to the reorganization. A third provision, also adopted in 1945, exempted from alteration any organizational arrangements that had been enacted by Congress since the beginning of that year.", "President George W. Bush's proposal took a different approach to limitations. It would have repealed all seven existing limitations, and instead circumscribed the agencies that might be part of a plan. The agencies selected perhaps reflected the Administration's highest priority reorganization at the time. The new amended Section 905 would have provided that plans would be limited to the following organizations: the Office of the National Intelligence Director; the Central Intelligence Agency; the National Security Agency; the Defense Intelligence Agency; the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; the National Reconnaissance Office; other offices within the Department of Defense for the collection of specialized national intelligence through reconnaissance programs; the intelligence elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Energy; the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the Department of State; the Office of Intelligence Analysis of the Department of the Treasury; the elements of the Department of Homeland Security concerned with the analysis of intelligence information, including the Office of Intelligence of the Coast Guard; and such \"other elements of any other department or agency as may be designated by the President, or designated jointly by the National Intelligence Director and the head of the department or agency concerned, as an element of the intelligence community.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Changes to Expedited Congressional Procedures193", "paragraphs": ["Should Congress grant the President renewed reorganization authority, lawmakers might choose to include expedited parliamentary procedures that are the same as those last authorized in 1984, or they may choose instead to modify these procedures in whole or in part. Conversely, Congress might reject the idea of including fast track procedures entirely, and instead decide to have Congress consider a joint resolution of approval or disapproval or a reorganization implementing bill under its regular parliamentary procedures, rather than special rules enacted in law.", "Broadly speaking, when considering what type of expedited legislative procedures might be enacted as part of reorganization authority, several structural questions might be considered by lawmakers. The first is whether to make the parliamentary vehicle for congressional consideration a joint resolution of approval or one of disapproval. Joint resolutions of approval arguably have the effect of tilting the balance of power to Congress and away from the President by requiring affirmative congressional action for any reorganization plan to go into force. Joint resolutions of disapproval, on the other hand, strengthen the hand of the President vis-a-vis Congress because they establish a situation in which a President's reorganization plan will go into force unless Congress is able to stop it, something which would likely require supermajority votes of the House and Senate to override presidential veto of a disapproval resolution. ", "Another consideration to take into account relating to expedited procedures is whether to include mandatory pre-consultation requirements that the President must adhere to before submitting a reorganization plan to Congress. Some expedited procedure statutes, such as the Trade Act of 1974, do require the President to consult with Congress in various ways and on various questions before submitting a proposed implementing bill to the House and Senate. Should policymakers include such pre-consultation provisions, they could choose to make them broad or extremely prescriptive. ", "Still another question is whether Congress should be permitted to amend a reorganization plan once it is submitted. Generally speaking, prior versions of expedited authority did not allow Congress to directly do this, although the most recent version of reorganization authority provided the President with a limited window to amend or withdraw his own reorganization plan once submitted. From a parliamentary standpoint, it should be noted that if a congressional amendment process is permitted in an expedited procedure either at the committee or floor stage of consideration, it is not possible to guarantee that Congress will be able to complete consideration of a legislative measure for presentment to the President."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Government reorganization is often cast in terms of potential administrative benefits, such as improved program effectiveness, greater efficiency, reduced cost, and improved policy integration across related programs. Whenever Congress has delegated reorganization authority to the President in the past, it has clearly stated in the statutory provisions that the objective of reorganization is such administrative improvement. Congress has often required that reorganization plans submitted by the President certify that such improvements are at least part of the objective of the proposed reorganization. In more recent versions of the law, the President is required to articulate the plan's means of achieving such improvements. ", "In addition to these administrative goals, reorganization efforts often have spoken or unspoken political goals and outcomes. The political nature of reorganization arises from the fact that it redistributes power and resources, and interests inside and outside the federal bureaucracy stand to gain or lose in this process. Depending on the scope and limitations of the authority available to the President, organizational units and functions might not only be moved, but could be abolished. Employees in the reorganized agencies will often be the most directly impacted, but outside interests, such as those who are regulated by, or receive benefits from, such agencies are affected as well. Congressional committees may also be impacted by a reorganization, directly through potential jurisdictional changes or indirectly through constituent groups. Although a government reorganization may have beneficial outcomes over time, it is axiomatic that it is disruptive, at least in the short term, to the functioning of the organizational systems involved. It is likely to upset existing power dynamics, rearrange relationships, create uncertainty and anxiety, and generally interrupt the flow of work. ", "Proponents of a delegation to the President of broad reorganization authority might argue that the President can be more effective than Congress in conceptualizing, as well as implementing, government-wide reorganization. Some critics argue that Congress is often unable to develop consensus and pass meaningful reorganization legislation. Where such consensus is arrived at, critics might assert that political, rather than administrative reform concerns are primary in its crafting. ", "Opponents of reauthorizing the President's reorganization authority might argue that Congress is better suited as a place for sorting out the competing demands and interests involved in broad reorganizations. They might argue that Congress, by representing a greater cross section of interests, provides a better forum in which to shape the federal government. Critics of presidential reorganization authority might also note that Congress has successfully reorganized the federal government, in large and small ways, through the legislative process. ", "When Congress delegates reorganization authority to the President and establishes expedited procedures for the consideration of resulting plans, it cedes some of its institutional power to the President. The history of such delegations suggests that Congress has been selective about when and under what terms it does so. Among the factors that appear to influence this decision-making process are the perceived administrative need and expected benefits, the record of collaborative efforts between a particular Congress and a particular President, and other political contextual factors.
