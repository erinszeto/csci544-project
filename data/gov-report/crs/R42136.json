At times, Congress has encouraged the development of such systems; in other instances, it has attempted to rein in or better organize the Department of Defense's efforts.", "Unmanned aircraft are commonly called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and when combined with ground control stations and data links, form UAS, or unmanned aerial systems.", "The use of UAS in conflicts such as Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and humanitarian relief operations such as Haiti, revealed the advantages and disadvantages provided by unmanned aircraft. Long considered experimental in military operations, UAS are now making national headlines as they are used in ways normally reserved for manned aircraft. Conventional wisdom states that UAS offer two main advantages over manned aircraft: they are considered more cost-effective, and they minimize the risk to a pilot's life. For these reasons and others, DOD's unmanned aircraft inventory increased more than 40-fold from 2002 to 2010.", "UAVs range from the size of an insect to that of a commercial airliner. DOD currently possesses five UAVs in large numbers: the Air Force's Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk; and the Army's Hunter and Shadow. Other key UAV developmental efforts include the Air Force's RQ-170 Sentinel; the Navy's Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS), MQ-8 Fire Scout, and Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAV; and the Marine Corps's Small Tactical Unmanned Aerial System.", "In the past, tension existed between the services' efforts to acquire UAS and congressional initiatives to encourage a consolidated DOD approach. Some observers argue that the result has been a less than stellar track record for UAS programs. However, reflecting the growing awareness and support in Congress and the Department of Defense for UAS, investments in unmanned aerial vehicles have been increasing every year. DOD spending on UAS has increased from $284 million in FY2000 to $3.3 billion in FY2010.", "Congressional considerations include the proper pace, scope, and management of DOD UAS procurement; appropriate investment priorities for UAS versus manned aircraft; UAS future roles and applications; legal issues arising from the use of UAS; issues of operational control and data management; personnel issues; industrial base issues; and technology proliferation."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 1917, United States military services have researched and employed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Over that time, they have been called drones, robot planes, pilotless aircraft, RPVs (remotely piloted vehicles), RPAs (remotely piloted aircraft) and other terms describing aircraft that fly under control with no person aboard. They are most often called UAVs, and when combined with ground control stations and data links, form UAS, or unmanned aerial systems.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) defines UAVs as powered, aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator, use aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. Ballistic or semi-ballistic vehicles, cruise missiles, and artillery projectiles are not considered UAVs by the DOD definition. UAVs are either described as a single air vehicle (with associated surveillance sensors), or a UAV system (UAS), which usually consists of three to six air vehicles, a ground control station, and support equipment.", "Although only recently procured in significant numbers by the United States, UAS were first tested during World War I, although not used in combat by the United States during that war. Indeed, it was not until the Vietnam War that the United States employed UAS such as the AQM-34 Firebee in a combat role. The Firebee exemplifies the versatility of UAS\u2014initially flown in the 1950s as an aerial gunnery target and then in the 1960s as an intelligence-collection drone, it was modified to deliver payloads and flew its first flight test as an armed UAV in 2002.", "The military use of UAS in conflicts such as Kosovo (1999), Iraq (since 2003), and Afghanistan (since 2001) has illustrated the advantages and disadvantages of unmanned aircraft. UAS regularly make national headlines as they perform tasks historically performed by manned aircraft. UAS are thought to offer two main advantages over manned aircraft: they eliminate the risk to a pilot's life, and their aeronautical capabilities, such as endurance, are not bound by human limitations. UAS also protect the lives of pilots by performing those dull, dirty, or dangerous missions that do not require a pilot in the cockpit. UAS may also be cheaper to procure and operate than manned aircraft. However, the lower procurement cost of UAS can be weighed against their greater proclivity to crash, while the minimized risk to onboard crew can be weighed against the complications and hazards inherent in flying unmanned vehicles in airspace shared with manned assets.", "UAS use has increased for a number of reasons. Advanced navigation and communications technologies were not available just a few years ago, and increases in military communications satellite bandwidth have made remote operation of UAS more practical. The nature of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars has also increased the demand for UAS, as identification of and strikes against targets hiding among civilian populations required persistent surveillance and prompt strike capability, to minimize collateral damage. Further, UAS provide an asymmetrical\u2014and comparatively invulnerable\u2014technical advantage in these conflicts.", "For many years, the Israeli Air Force led the world in developing UAS and tactics. U.S. observers noticed Israel's successful use of UAS during operations in Lebanon in 1982, encouraging then-Navy Secretary John Lehman to acquire a UAS capability for the Navy. Interest also grew in other parts of the Pentagon, and the Reagan Administration's FY1987 budget requested notably higher levels of UAS funding. This marked the transition of UAS in the United States from experimental projects to acquisition programs.", "Initial U.S. capabilities came from platforms acquired from Israel. One such UAS, Pioneer, emerged as a useful source of intelligence at the tactical level during Operation Desert Storm, when Pioneer was used by Navy battleships to locate Iraqi targets for its 16-inch guns. Gulf War experience demonstrated the potential value of UAS, and the Air Force's Predator was placed on a fast track, quickly adding new capabilities. Debuting in the Balkans conflict, the Predator performed surveillance missions such as monitoring area roads for weapons movements and conducting battle damage assessment. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have featured the Air Force's Global Hawk, as well as adding a new mission that allows the Predator to live up to its name\u2014armed reconnaissance.", "Reflecting a growing awareness and support for UAS, Congress has increased investment in unmanned aerial vehicles annually. The FY2001 investment in UAS was approximately $667 million. For FY2012, DOD has asked for $3.9 billion in procurement and development funding with much more planned for the outyears. DOD's inventory of unmanned aircraft increased from 167 to nearly 7,500 from 2002 to 2010.", "DOD's UAS research and development (R&D) funding has also grown, for a variety of reasons: UAS are considered a growth industry, many UAS are relatively inexpensive to produce, and new technology in miniaturization has helped accelerate the development of many UAS types. ", "Congress has approached UAS development with strong encouragement tempered with concern. Notably, in 2000, Congress set the goal of making \"one-third of the aircraft in the operational deep strike force aircraft fleet\" unmanned. Congress has also directed the formation of joint program offices to ensure commonality among the services' UAS programs. Following expressed concern that DOD's \"growing enthusiasm may well lead to a situation in which there is no clear path toward the future of UAS,\" Congress also required DOD to submit a UAS roadmap. In some instances, Congress has chastened DOD for what it saw as a leisurely rate of UAS acquisition and encouraged it to speed up this pace, or speed up the incorporation of certain capabilities. For example, in 1996, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) supported legislation directing DOD to weaponize both the Predator and Hunter, but DOD opposed the initiative.", "Although this report focuses on the military uses of UAS, Congress's interest in UAS extends beyond the defense committees, as UAS capabilities have also led to their use in missions outside the military. The Department of Homeland Security operates UAS to help patrol U.S. borders, and Congress has questioned the efficacy of such operations. Further, the use of UAS in a variety of roles, but particularly as platforms for delivering lethal force, raises a number of legal issues of interest to Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Why Does the Military Want UAS?", "paragraphs": ["In today's military, unmanned systems are highly desired by combatant commanders for their versatility and persistence.

But \"unmanned systems reduce the risk to our warfighters by providing a sophisticated stand-off capability that supports intelligence, command and control, targeting, and weapons delivery. These systems also improve situational awareness and reduce many of the emotional hazards inherent in air and ground combat, thus decreasing the likelihood of causing civilian noncombatant casualties.\" \"UAVs have gained favor as ways to reduce risk to combat troops, the cost of hardware and the reaction time in a surgical strike\" and \"to conduct missions in areas that are difficult to access or otherwise considered too high-risk for manned aircraft or personnel on the ground.\"", "As a result, \"The number of platforms in this category\u2014R/MQ-4 Global Hawk-class, MQ-9 Reaper, and MQ-1 Predator-class unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)\u2014will grow from approximately 340 in FY 2012 to approximately 650 in FY 2021.\"", "Some in the military also tout UAS's reduced cost of acquisition and operation when compared to manned platforms. However, the Congressional Budget Office cautions that savings cannot be taken for granted:", "Unmanned aircraft systems are usually less expensive than manned aircraft. Initial concepts envisioned very low-cost, essentially expendable aircraft. As of 2011, however, whether substantially lower costs will be realized is unclear. Although a pilot may not be on board, the advanced sensors carried by unmanned aircraft systems are very expensive and cannot be viewed as expendable....

Tanker flight profiles are relatively benign compared to many others, and they tend to operate far from enemy air defenses. Except for operating the refueling boom (to refuel Air Force aircraft), the refueling crew's primary job is to keep the aircraft flying straight, level, and at a steady speed. In July 2010, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded a contract to demonstrate refueling by Global Hawk UAVs, and a March 2011 test demonstrated the Global Hawk's ability to receive refueling autonomously. The Global Hawk's 2001 trans-oceanic flights (from the United States to Australia and from the United States to Portugal) demonstrate the ability of current UAVs to fly missions analogous to aerial refueling missions. This same technology could allow UAVs to refuel manned aircraft. The second X-47B will be equipped to demonstrate refueling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Combat", "paragraphs": ["A more difficult future task could be air-to-air combat. Although UAS offensive operations to date have focused on ground targets, UCAVs are being designed to carry air-to-air weapons and other systems that may allow them to undertake air superiority missions. DOD is experimenting with outfitting today's UAVs with the sensors and weapons required to conduct such a mission. In fact, a Predator has reportedly already engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft. In March 2003 it was reported that a Predator launched a Stinger air-to-air missile at an Iraqi MiG before the Iraqi aircraft shot it down. While this operational encounter may be a \"baby step\" on the way toward an aerial combat capability, newer UAS such as the X-47B, Avenger, and Phantom Ray are not being designed with acknowledged air-to-air capability.", "In short, UAS are expected to take on every type of mission currently flown by manned aircraft."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Why Are There So Many Different UAS?", "paragraphs": ["Although UAS have a long history, only in the last 10-15 years have advances in navigation, communications, materials, and other technologies made a variety of current UAS missions possible. UAS are therefore still in a period of innovation, both in their design and how they are operated. This can be seen as analogous to military aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s, when technologies and doctrines evolved at a rapid rate to exploit the new technology, and also to the early Jet Age, when the military acquired many different models of aircraft with varying capabilities before settling on a force made up of large numbers of relatively few models based on lessons learned.", "Also, the period of UAS innovation has coincided with ongoing U.S. combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Demand for UAS capabilities in the field is essentially unconstrained. As new systems and capabilities have emerged, the availability of urgent-needs funding has allowed commanders to bring the latest technology into theater without lengthy procurement processes. Thus, instead of traditional competitions in which systems may be tested against each other in advance of operations, new UAS have been deployed directly to the field, where U.S. forces are able to experiment with and exploit their capabilities. The combination of funding, demand, and technological innovation has resulted in DOD acquiring a multiplicity of systems without significant effort to reduce the number of systems or consolidate functions across services.", "For example, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is concerned that the Army and Air Force are unnecessarily developing two different electro-optical and infrared sensor payloads for Sky Warrior and Predator when a common payload could be achieved\u2014currently the basic sensors are 80 percent common and manufactured by the same contractor. However, according to Army officials, the Air Force sensor is more expensive and has capabilities, such as high-definition video, for which the Army has no requirements. Therefore, the Army does not believe a fully common solution is warranted.", "It should be noted that the number of systems acquired does not correspond to the number of unique platforms. By installing different sensors, a mostly common airframe can be made to serve the requirements of multiple services. The General Atomics I-GNAT developed into the Air Force Predator and Reaper, which served as the basis for the Army Gray Eagle and DHS's Predator optimized for marine environments; Northrop Grumman's Air Force Global Hawk became, with different equipment, the Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) system.", "This is not to say that the resulting systems are the same. Due to different requirements and payloads, a BAMS, for example, costs almost twice as much as a Global Hawk. This commonality may, however, provide an argument for those who advocate greater jointness in UAS development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Does the Department of Defense Have an Integrated UAS Development Policy?", "paragraphs": ["In September 2007, the Secretary of Defense ordered creation of a UAS Task Force within the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.

Thus, development of UAS in DOD can be said to be federated, but not integrated.", "DOD also issues a biannual roadmap indicating what technologies and capabilities it expects to see in future systems, and attempting to project the requirements for broad UAS capabilities 25 years into the future. Development of UAS is still carried out by individual military services.", "UAS programs range from the combat tested\u2014Pioneer, Hunter, Predator, and Global Hawk\u2014to the not yet tested\u2014the Air Force and Navy's Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles. Sizes and ranges of UAVs also vary greatly: the 8-inch-long Wasp Micro UAV has a combat radius of 5 nautical miles, while the 44-foot-long Global Hawk (the size of a medium sized corporate jet) has a combat radius of 5,400 nm.", " Table 1 outlines the total UAV inventory. When compared to the inventory of February 2003, which only included five major platforms and an inventory of 163 unmanned aircraft, the acceleration and expansion becomes clear. The 7454 UAVs include many second-generation derivatives, such as Predator B and BAMS, and some non-traditional vehicles, such as gMAV and T-Hawk.", "The increase in DOD's UAV inventory appears largely due to the rising demand for UAVs to branch out from the typical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) applications and conduct a wider variety of missions. Predator B and Reaper are equipped with a strike capability, and many Predator As have been modified to carry weapons. Additionally, mine detection, border patrol, medical resupply, and force perimeter protection are increasingly considered as roles for UAS.", "In order to understand fully the pace and scope of UAS acquisition, a comparison between manned aircraft inventories and unmanned inventories may prove to be a useful tool. Figure 1 shows the ratio of manned to unmanned aircraft. Due to the recent acceleration in UAS production and drawdowns in manned aircraft, manned aircraft have gone from 95% of all DOD aircraft in 2005 to 59% today. Previously described as complements to, or augmentation of, manned aircraft, user demand and budgetary push have increasingly promoted UAS into a principal role.", "A significant congressional boost to UAS acquisition came in the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which expressed Congress's desire that \"within ten years, one-third of U.S. military operational deep strike aircraft will be unmanned.\" This goal was seen at the time as very challenging, because DOD had no unmanned deep strike aircraft. ", "Subsequently, the Fiscal 2007 Defense Authorization Act required the Secretary of Defense to \"develop a policy, to be applicable throughout the Department of Defense, on research, development, test and evaluation, procurement, and operation of unmanned systems.\" The policy was required to include, among other elements, \"A preference for unmanned systems in acquisition programs for new systems, including a requirement under any such program for the development of a manned system for a certification that an unmanned system is incapable of meeting program requirements.\" Thus, Congress changed the default assumption of new systems; instead of seeking unmanned systems to accomplish the same tasks as manned equivalents, unmanned systems would be developed to accomplish military tasks unless there was some need that the systems be manned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UAS Management Issues", "paragraphs": ["In addition to establishing acquisition pace, and scope of application, one significant congressional task may be to determine whether DOD's administrative processes and lines of authority within the acquisition process are effective for UAS development and acquisition. The management of DOD's development and acquisition programs received heightened attention in recent Congresses. Given that UAS are acquired by all four of the military services and the U.S. Special Operations Command, and that UAS acquisition is accelerating (for a growing list of applications), it appears that great potential exists for duplication of effort. This leads many to call for centralization of UAS acquisition authority, to ensure unity of effort and inhibit wasteful duplication.

According to DOD's most recent estimate, the Global Hawk program will cost $13.9 billion to purchase 66 aircraft; a program acquisition unit cost of $211 million per UAV. The program has twice triggered Nunn-McCurdy breaches, which require DOD to notify Congress when cost growth on a major acquisition program reaches 15%. In 2005, development cost overruns led to an average unit cost growth of 18% per airframe and prompted appropriators to voice their concern ( H.R. 2863 , H.Rept. 109-119 , p. 174). In April 2011, a reduction in the number of Global Hawk Block 40 aircraft requested in the FY2012 budget from 22 to 11 caused overall Global Hawk unit prices to increase by 11%, again triggering Nunn-McCurdy. ", "[T]he RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drone, by Northrop Grumman [NOC] has been criticized by the Air Force for higher than expected cost growth. [Under Secretary of Defense Ashton] Carter said that program is \"on a path to being unaffordable\" and will be studied in detail to determine what is causing the suspected inefficiencies.", "Much UAS cost growth appears to spring from factors that have also affected manned aircraft programs, such as \"requirements creep\" and inconsistent management practices. Global Hawk costs, for example, have been driven up by adding multiple sensors, which themselves increase cost, but also require larger wings and more powerful engines to carry the increased weight, which also increases cost. Although originally intended to carry one primary sensor at a time, DOD changed the requirement so that Global Hawk is to carry two or more primary sensors\u2014which has increased the UAS's price.", "Global Hawk is not the only example of requirements creep. Originally considered a relatively modest UAS, the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) evolved into a large, long range aircraft with a heavy payload, which increased cost. J-UCAS was canceled in 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organizational Management Issues", "paragraphs": ["The frequent change and realignment of DOD's organizations with a role in UAS development illustrates the difficulties of establishing a comprehensive UAS management system. Over the years, management of UAS programs has gone full circle from the military services, to a Navy-run Joint Program Office (JPO), to the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) and then back to the services, under the auspices of OSD. The JPO was established in 1988, but met criticism in Congress. ", "The JPO was replaced by the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO), created in 1993 to more effectively manage DOD's disparate airborne reconnaissance programs, including UAS. DARO was disbanded in 1998, amid criticism of problems, redesigns, and accidents with the family of systems that it was formed to develop. It is unclear whether this criticism was completely legitimate, or whether it was generated by advocates of manned aviation, who sought to protect these established programs.", "Since DARO's demise, no single organization has managed DOD UAS efforts. General oversight authority resides within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (OASD(C3I)), while the military services manage program development and acquisition.", "In an effort to increase joint coordination of UAS programs operated by the services, OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force in 2001. The task force, which falls under the authority of the Pentagon's acquisition chief (Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), works to help standardize payload development, establish uniform interfaces, and promote a common vision for future UAS-related efforts. Subsequently, the Joint UAV Planning Task Force has been promoted to the top rung on the UAS management ladder. ", "In lieu of creating an executive agent for UAS, the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DepSecDef) directed the formation of a UAS Task Force (TF). The TF was directed to identify to the Deputy Advisory Working Group (DAWG) and, where appropriate, assign lead organizations for issues related to the acquisition and management of UAS including interoperability, civil airspace integration, frequency spectrum and bandwidth utilization, ground stations, and airframe payload and sensor management.", "In order to help a common UAS vision become a reality, the task force, through the OSD, published three UAS Roadmaps in April 2001, December 2002, and August 2005. A more recent UAS roadmap was published in April 2009 as part of a DOD integrated roadmap that also included unmanned systems for ground and sea warfare.", "In March 2005 testimony to the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces, the GAO criticized DOD for the lack of an \"oversight body to guide UAV development efforts and related investment decisions,\" which ultimately does not allow DOD \"to make sound program decisions or establish funding priorities.\" From the testimony, it would appear that the GAO envisioned a central authority or body to satisfy this role. ", "In what appeared to be a move toward further management restructuring, reports in 2005 indicated that OSD was considering appointing one of the services as the executive agent and coordinator for UAS programs, a role the Air Force actively pursued. However, later that year the JROC announced that DOD had abandoned the notion of an executive agent in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The first, entitled the Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT), provides a forum for identification and problem solving of major interoperability and standardization issues between the services. A complementary Joint UAV Center of Excellence coordinates with the OIPT to improve interoperability and enhance UAS applications through the examination of sensor technologies, UAS intelligence collection assets, system technologies, training, and tactics.", "That command arrangement was revised in 2007, when the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the formation of a UAS Task Force.

Developing a coordinated, DOD-wide UAS investment strategy appears key to ensuring duplication is avoided and scarce resources are maximized. As part of its defense oversight role, Congress is positioned to arbitrate between competing UAS investments, or impact DOD's overarching investment plan. Several relevant questions seem apparent: How is UAS cost quantified? What is the most effective balance in spending between UAS and manned aircraft? How should DOD, Congress, and the UAS manufacturers balance cost with capability? Finally, what areas of investment are the most important to maximize UAS capabilities?", "When compared to other aircraft, the cost of an individual remotely piloted vehicle can be misleading. UAVs operate as part of a system, which generally consists of a ground control station, a ground crew including remote pilots and sensor operators, communication links, and often multiple air vehicles. Unlike a manned aircraft such as an F-16, these supporting elements are a requisite for the vehicle's flight. Consequently, analysts comparing UAV costs to manned aircraft may need to consider the cost of the supporting elements and operational infrastructure that make up the complete unmanned aviation system.", "Monitoring or evaluating UAS costs can also be complicated by budgeting conventions. While UAVs can be found in the \"Aircraft Procurement, Air Force\" account in that service's budget request documentation, the Army includes its UAS funding requests in \"Other Procurement, Army.\" This account contains a broad range of dissimilar items. Also, because most UAS conduct Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions, some portion of their costs are covered in the Intelligence budget rather than the DOD budget, which complicates building a complete picture of cost.", "Once an adequate and uniform cost comparison mechanism or definition has been established, the next step for Congress may be to identify an appropriate balance in spending between UAS and manned aircraft. If the upward trend in UAS funding continues through 2013, as shown in Figure 3 , DOD is projected to have spent upwards of $26 billion on procurement, RDT&E, operations, and maintenance for UAS from 2001-2013. This number far exceeds the $3.9 billion spent on UAS from 1988-2000.", " Figure 3 demonstrates the total funding for UAS as a percentage of the total military aviation funding. As the pie chart shows, despite the recent acquisition of many UAS, such systems represent only 8% of all military aviation procurement funding.", "Cost savings have long been touted by UAS advocates as one of the advantages offered by unmanned aircraft over manned aircraft. However, critics point out that the acquisition cost savings are often negligible if one considers that money saved by not having a pilot in the cockpit must be applied to the \"ground cockpit\" of the UAS aircrew operating the UAV from the ground control station. Another cost question concerns personnel. Do UAS \"pilots\" cost less to train and keep proficient than pilots of manned aircraft? So although the air vehicle might be cheaper than a manned aircraft, the UAV system as a whole is not always less expensive. Additionally, UAS have a higher attrition rate and lower reliability rate than manned aircraft, which means that the operation and maintenance costs can be higher. On the other hand, UAS ground control stations are capable of simultaneously flying multiple UAVs, somewhat restoring the advantage in cost to the unmanned system. Congress has noted that, \"while the acquisition per unit cost may be relatively small, in the aggregate, the acquisition cost rivals the investment in other larger weapon systems.\"", "At what threshold does an \"expendable\" UAV cost too much to lose? Sensors have consistently increased the cost of the air vehicle, according to Former Air Force Secretary James Roche. The inexpensive designs of small UAV air vehicles like the Desert Hawk and Dragon Eye are dwarfed by the cost of the lightweight electro-optical/infrared cameras that make up their payloads. On the other end of the size spectrum, the RQ-4B second generation Global Hawk's sensor payload represents approximately 54% of the vehicle's flyaway cost, which does not include the cost of the increased wingspan that shoulders the extra 1000 pounds of sensor suites. These costs are increasing due to the basic law of supply and demand. Growing demand, matched with a lack of commercial sensor equivalents, means that UAS sensor producers face little competition, which would help keep costs down.", "Growing sensor costs have prompted some observers to recommend equipping UAVs with self-protection devices, suggesting those UAVs are no longer considered expendable. Consequently, two schools of thought exist for employing UAVs in ways that could help balance cost with capability. One is to field many smaller, less expensive, and less capable UAVs controlled through a highly interconnected communications network. One example of this investment approach was included in the Army's developmental Future Combat System, which intended to link several relatively inexpensive UAVs like the Raven, the Shadow, and the Fire Scout with 18 other weapons platforms. None of these UAVs could individually shoulder all of the air duties required by the system, yet the robust communications network was expected to distribute the mission duties to allow each platform to provide its specialized task.", "A second approach advocates fielding fewer, more expensive, and more capable UAVs that are less networked with other systems, such as the autonomous Global Hawk. The Global Hawk serves as a high altitude, \"all-in-one\" surveillance platform capable of staying aloft for days at a time, yet does not operate in concert with any of its fellow UAV peers. Since 2003, programs at both ends of this spectrum have experienced delays and a reduction in funding. The Army's Future Combat System has experienced delays due to significant management and technology issues. Similarly, the highly capable Global Hawk has risen in cost and been the target of funding cuts.", "Finally, what areas of investment will yield the maximum effectiveness out of these UAS? Four specific issues stand out as the most pressing: interoperability, reliability, force multiplication/autonomy, and engine systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Interoperability", "paragraphs": ["UAS development has been marked by the slow advancement of interoperability. The future plans for UAS use within the framework of larger battlefield operations and more interconnected and potentially joint-service combat systems require UAS to communicate seamlessly between each other and numerous different ground components, and to also be compatible with diverse ground control systems. The lack of interconnectivity at these levels has often complicated missions to the point of reducing their effectiveness, as Dyke Weatherington, head of DOD's UAS planning taskforce, noted: \"There have been cases where a service's UAV, if it could have gotten data to another service, another component, it may have provided better situational awareness on a specific threat in a specific area that might have resulted in different measures being taken.\"", "Advancing the interoperability of UAS has been a critical part of the OSD's investment plans. The Department of Defense has pushed forward with the establishment of communication between similar UAS to help facilitate interoperability among four system elements: ", "First, DOD hopes to integrate an adequate interface for situational awareness, which will relay the objective, position, payload composition, service operator, and mission tasking procedure to other unmanned aircraft and potentially to ground elements. Second, a payload interface will allow the coherent transfer of surveillance data. Third, the weapons interface will constitute a separate transfer medium by which operators can coordinate these platforms' offensive capabilities. Finally, the air vehicle control interface will enable navigation and positioning from the ground with respect to other aircraft.", "Although the framework for these categories of interoperability has been established, the technology has been slow to catch up. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 1815 , H.Rept. 109-89 ) took a major step to encourage inter-platform communication. The members of the House Armed Services Committee included a clause that called for the requirement of all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles throughout the services to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link, which has become the services' standardized communication tool for providing \"critical wideband data link required for real-time situational awareness, as well as real time sensor and targeting data to tactical commanders.\" If UAS are to achieve the level of interoperability envisioned by the OSD, the services and industry will likely need to keep focused on achieving the Common Data Link communications system goal and invest appropriately to facilitate an expedited and efficient development process.", "The finite bandwidth that currently exists for all military aircraft, and the resulting competition for existing bandwidth, may render the expansion of UAS applications infeasible and leave many platforms grounded. Ultimately, the requirement for bandwidth grows with every war the United States fights. The increased use of UAS in Iraq and Afghanistan indicates that remotely piloted platforms' mass consumption of bandwidth will require a more robust information transfer system in the coming years. ", "One approach to alleviating the bandwidth concern was the Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) project. DOD intended to use that laser and satellite communications system to provide U.S. Armed Forces with an unlimited and uninhibited ability to send and receive messages and critical information around the world without data traffic jams. However, the TSAT project was canceled in 2009. As another interim option, DOD has testified that a more autonomous UAV would require less bandwidth, since more data are processed on board and less data are being moved. However, it is unclear that autonomy will actually decrease bandwidth requirements since the transmission of data from the UAV's sensors drives the demand for bandwidth. As an example, a single Global Hawk, already an autonomous UAV, \"requires 500Mbps bandwidth\u2014which equates to 500 percent of the total bandwidth of the entire U.S. military used during the 1991 Gulf War.\"", "Another approach to alleviating the bandwidth problem is allowing UAVs to be operated from a manned stand-off aircraft such as a command and control aircraft with line of sight to the UAV. Stationing the mission control element of the UAV system in another aircraft instead of on the ground would reduce the reliance on satellites for beyond-line-of-sight communication, simplifying command and control. Experimentation is currently ongoing in this area, with the first step being controlling the UAV's sensor payload from an airborne platform."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliability/Safety", "paragraphs": ["A 2010 media study reported that \"Thirty-eight Predator and Reaper drones have crashed during combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and nine more during training on bases in the U.S.\u2014with each crash costing between $3.7 million and $5 million.

Although most UAV accidents have been attributed to human error, investment in reliability upgrades appears to be another high priority for UAS. The 2005 UAS Roadmap indicated that UAV mishap rates appeared to be much higher than the mishap rates of many manned aircraft. Table 3 shows the number of Class A Mishaps per 100,000 hours of major UAVs and comparable manned aircraft as of 2005.", "However, \"(a)ccident rates per 100,000 hours dropped to 7.5 for the Predator and 16.4 for the Reaper last year (2009), according to the Air Force. The Predator rate is comparable to that of the F-16 fighter at the same stage, Air Force officers say, and just under the 8.2 rate for small, single-engine private airplanes flown in the U.S.\"", "In its 2004 study, the Defense Science Board (DSB) notes that manned aircraft over the past five decades have moved from a relatively high mishap rate to relatively low rates through advancements in system design, weather durability improvements, and reliability upgrades. It should be pointed out, however, that the UAS, with the exception of Predator, have total flight times that are significantly less the than the 100,000 hours used to calculate the mishap rate. Most aircraft tend to have a much higher mishap rate in their first 50,000 hours of flight than their second 50,000 hours of flight. Further, some of the UAS in Table 3 have flown numerous missions while still under development. Predator and Global Hawk, for instance, entered combat well prior to their planned initial operational capability (2005 for Predator, and 2011 for Global Hawk). It may be unfair to compare the mishap rates of developmental UAS with manned aircraft that have completed development and been modernized and refined over decades of use.", "The DSB report also suggests that nominal upgrades and investment\u2014arguing even that many UAS will need little change\u2014could produce substantial reductions in the UAV mishap rates. The 2005 UAS Roadmap proposes investments into emerging technologies, such as self-repairing \"smart\" flight control systems, auto take-off and recovery instruments, and heavy fuel engines, to enhance reliability. Also, the incorporation of advanced materials\u2014such as high temperature components, light-weight structures, shape memory alloys, and cold weather tolerance designs that include significant de-icing properties\u2014will be expected to improve the survivability of UAS in adverse environments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Force Multiplication/Autonomy", "paragraphs": ["One of the most attractive and innovative technological priorities for UAS is to enable one ground operator to pilot several UAVs at once. Currently most UAS require at least two ground operators; one to pilot the vehicle and another to control the sensors. The end goal for UAS manufactures and users is to reduce the 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and eventually elevate the autonomy and interoperability of UAS to the point where two or more vehicles can be controlled by one operator. If this technological feat is achieved, the advantage of UAS as a force-multiplier on the battlefield could provide a dramatic change in combat capability.", "The process of achieving this goal may require significant time and investments. As the 2005 UAS Roadmap notes, \"Getting groups of UA to team (or swarm) in order to accomplish an objective will require significant investment in control technologies\" with specific reference to distributed control technologies. Considering the two operator system currently in place for most UAS, the logical approach to reaching this technological advancement is to first invest in the autonomous flight capabilities of the UAVs, so as to reduce the workload for the complete UAS. The Global Hawk and the Scan Eagle possess significant automated flight capabilities, but their degree of actual flight autonomy can be debated due to the UAV's need for continuous operator intervention in poor weather conditions. The OSD quantifies the degree of UAV autonomy on a scale of 1 to 10; Table 4 shows the OSD's Autonomous Capability Levels for UAVs.", "In order for UAVs to achieve maximum use when being controlled by a single pilot, the UAV ACL must achieve a level of at least 8. Currently, the Global Hawk, which is considered by many the most autonomous UAV currently in service, maintains an ACL of approximately 2.5. FAA and the UAS industry are working with the Department of Defense in order to facilitate the universal development of \"see and avoid\" technology that would allow a UAV to operate autonomously and avoid approaching aircraft, potentially increasing the standard ACL for UAS to 4. Additionally, inter-UAS communication and the coordination associated with interoperability must match the autonomous flight abilities. Full automation of sensor capabilities would enable the lone operator to control a network of intelligence collecting drones.", "The first steps towards the \"one-operator-per-several-UAVs\" advancement are already underway. In 2005, the Air Force evaluated a Predator upgrade that allowed one operator to control the flight plan of four Predator UAVs during an exercise in which one UAV engaged a target and the other three hovered nearby on standby status.

For example, the Army chose to develop a new sensor payload for its Sky Warrior, despite the fact that the sensor currently used on the Air Force's Predator is comparable and manufactured by the same contractor. To support their respective requirements, the services also make resource allocation decisions independently. DOD officials have not quantified the potential costs or benefits of pursuing various alternatives, including common systems. To maximize acquisition resources and meet increased demand, Congress and DOD have increasingly pushed for more commonality among unmanned aircraft systems.", " Table 5 shows a comparison of the performance specifications of UAS with electro-optical and infra-red sensors.

Further, the F-16 is a versatile combat aircraft that can be used to perform many missions that the Reaper cannot.

Long-duration law enforcement surveillance, a task performed by manned aircraft during the October 2002 sniper incident near Washington, DC, is one example. The U.S. Department of Transportation has studied possible security roles for UAS, such as following trucks with hazardous cargo, while the Energy Department has been developing high-altitude instruments to measure radiation in the atmosphere. UAS might also be used in sparsely populated areas of the western United States to search for forest fires. Following the widespread destruction of Hurricane Katrina, some suggest that a UAS like Global Hawk could play roles in \"consequence management\" and relief efforts.

Other options could include manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites. Each platform offers both advantages and disadvantages. Manned aircraft provide a flexible platform, but risk a pilot's life. Some of the country's largest defense contractors are competing to develop unmanned blimps that may be capable of floating months at a time at an altitude of 70,000 feet and carrying 4,000 pounds of payload. OSD's UAS Roadmap includes a section on lighter-than-air blimps and tethered \"aerostat\" platforms, which OSD indicates to be important for a variety of roles, including psychological operations, spotting incoming enemy missiles and border monitoring. Furthermore, these platforms could provide services equivalent to many border surveillance UAS, but their decreased dependency on fuel could reduce operations costs. One drawback to these lighter-than-air platforms is their lack of maneuverability and speed relative to UAVs like the Global Hawk; their long persistence once on station may be somewhat offset by the time required for them to relocate in response to new taskings. Nonetheless, many major UAS manufacturers are preparing\u2014and, in some cases, testing\u2014lighter-than-air systems that could carry out a variety of missions for homeland security.", "Space satellites offer many benefits; they are thought to be relatively invulnerable to attack, and field many advanced capabilities. However, tasking the satellites can be cumbersome, especially with competing national priorities. The limited number of systems can only serve so many customers at one time.

According to FAA spokesman William Shumann, the primary challenge in finding this common ground is \"to develop vehicles that meet FAA safety requirements if they want to fly in crowded airspace.\" The August 2003 announcement that the FAA had granted the Air Force a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation signified the first steps in the reconciliation of these discrepancies. Upgrading UAS collision avoidance capabilities, often referred to as \"sense and avoid\" technology, appears to be a critical part in the next step of reaching the UAS-airspace common ground.

Further, those inclined to fly manned aircraft may not be as disinclined to fly UAS as was believed in the past. Flying armed UAS may be more appealing to these personnel than is flying non-armed UAS. Also, flying UAS may be an attractive compromise for certain personnel. While it may not confer all the excitement of flying a manned aircraft, it also avoids many of the hardships (e.g., arduous deployments and potential harm). The Air Force believes that flying UAS from control stations in the United States will be attractive to some in the reserve component who may be disinclined to experience an active duty lifestyle consistent with flying manned aircraft.

In their eyes, crucial skills and technologies could thus be lost by concentrating only on unmanned aircraft design, possibly causing U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design to wane. These proponents point out that UAS have been around for almost a century, yet only recently became operationally effective, and are not likely to replace manned aircraft in the near future.", "Others disagree, and believe that critical manned aircraft design skills are not jeopardized by increased pursuit of UAS because there is considerable commonality between manned and unmanned combat aircraft. Except for the obvious lack of a cockpit, unmanned combat aircraft may require stealthy airframes, advanced avionics, and high performance engines just like manned combat aircraft. Also, major defense contractors have already begun to shift to unmanned aircraft design in order to stay competitive. This is because UAS are beginning to play a prominent role in warfare, as seen in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. The same skills and technologies required for building manned aircraft will likely lend themselves to unmanned aviation design as well. Companies that have lost out in recent aviation contracts, such as Boeing and the JSF in 2001, are looking towards unmanned bombers and fighters as prospects for growth. Were Boeing to design manned aircraft in the future, the critical skills needed would still be present, according to this argument. Boeing acquired UAS maker Insitu in 2008. Northrop Grumman Corp., as another example, has created a new business unit to aggressively pursue UAS contracts, and acquired Scaled Composites in 2007 in part for UAS design expertise.

Another estimates that global UAS expenditures will double from $1.7 billion in 2011 to $3.5 billion in 2020. The global market for combat aircraft alone, at approximately $15.8 billion in 2011, dwarfs the UAS market. But the rate of growth is projected to be much slower, peaking at approximately $21 billion in 2017, and dropping to approximately $19 billion in 2020.

These cameras are housed in a ball-shaped turret that can be easily seen underneath the vehicle's nose. The Predator is also equipped with a Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) sensor ball which adds a laser designator to the E-O/IR payload that allows the Predator to track moving targets. Additionally, the Predator's payload includes a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which enables the UAS to \"see\" through inclement weather. The Predator's satellite communications provide for beyond line-of-sight operations. In 2001, as a secondary function, the Predator was outfitted with the ability to carry two Hellfire missiles. Previously, the Predator identified a target and relayed the coordinates to a manned aircraft, which then engaged the target. The addition of this anti-tank ordnance enables the UAS to launch a precision attack on a time sensitive target with a minimized \"sensor-to-shoot\" time cycle.

It can fly to a target area 5,400 nautical miles away, loiter at 60,000 feet while monitoring an area the size of the state of Illinois for 24 hours, and then return. Global Hawk was originally designed to be an autonomous drone capable of taking off, flying, and landing on pre-programmed inputs to the UAV's flight computer. Air Force operators have found, however, that the UAS requires frequent intervention by remote operators. The RQ-4B resembles the RQ-4A, yet features a significantly larger airframe. In designing the B-model, Northrop Grumman increased the Global Hawk's length from 44 feet to 48 feet and its wingspan from 116 feet to 132 feet.

The Global Hawk UAS has been called \"the theater commander's around-the-clock, low-hanging (surveillance) satellite.\" The UAS provides a long-dwell presence over the battlespace, giving military commanders a persistent source of high-quality imagery that has proven valuable in surveillance and interdiction operations. The RQ-4A's current imagery payload consists of a 2,000-lb integrated suite of sensors much larger than those found on the Predator. These sensors include an all-weather SAR with Moving Target Indicator (MTI) capability, an E-O digital camera and an IR sensor. As the result of a January 2002 Air Force requirements summit, Northrop Grumman expanded its payload to make it a multi-intelligence air vehicle. The subsequent incarnation, the RQ-4B, is outfitted with an open-system architecture that enables the vehicle to carry multiple payloads, such as signals intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic intelligence (ELINT) sensors. Furthermore, the classified Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) payload will be added in order to increase radar capabilities. These new sensor packages will enable operators to eavesdrop on radio transmissions or to identify enemy radar from extremely high altitudes. Future plans include adding hyper-spectral sensors for increased imagery precision and incorporating laser communications to expand information transfer capabilities. The end goal is to field a UAS that will work with space-based sensors to create a \"staring net\" that will prevent enemies from establishing a tactical surprise. In August 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration granted the Global Hawk authorization to fly in U.S. civilian airspace, which further expanded the system's mission potential.
