Within these categories, the MCH Services Block Grant supports a wide array of programs, including newborn screening, health services for children with special health care needs (CSHCNs), and immunization programs.", "Topics Covered in This Report", "This report provides background and funding information on the MCH Services Block Grant.

", "The MCH Services Block Grant is composed of three funding programs. The first is a block grant and is the largest of the three funding programs. It is provided to states and territories (referred to collectively as states in this report) to enable them to coordinate programs, develop systems, and provide a broad range of health services. The second funding program is the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) program. SPRANS is a competitive grant program that funds research and training projects that focus on low-income pregnant women, mothers, and children, including CSHCNs. The third funding program is the Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) program. CISS is a competitive grant program that funds projects that support the development and expansion of integrated services at the community level.

A federal-state partnership is a program that joins a federal agency with a state or jurisdiction, in order for the two to address a certain issue. Under this federal-state partnership, states make available federal and nonfederal funds to provide health care services to their maternal and child health populations (see the \" Requirements of Block Grant Allocation and Distribution \" section of this report). The FY2015 dollar amounts from these sources, the latest available, are presented in Table A-1 .

Such services and programs aimed to improve the health of mothers and children, particularly those in low-income households. They included maternal and child health services, services for disabled children, child welfare services, and vocational rehabilitation services. Title V services included activities related to abstinence, postpartum depression, and personal responsibility educational services and programs.", "The 97 th Congress named this consolidation the MCH Services Block Grant and renamed it in statute as the \"Title V MCH Services Block Grant,\" which is commonly referred to as \"Title V.\" This change was implemented by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981 ( P.L. 97-35 ), as amended. The 1981 OBRA gave states more flexibility in determining how to use federal funds to address maternal and child health needs. In addition, the 1981 OBRA required that each state receive, at a minimum, the combined funding of the programs consolidated under it. ", "Congress made additional changes to the MCH Services Block Grant under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 ( P.L. 101-239 ). These changes increased the authorization of appropriations; called for greater accountability; and created stricter rules for application and reporting requirements for states, including a statewide needs assessment requirement. Over time, additional programs targeting CSHCNs and low-income women and children were added to the SSA and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA).
