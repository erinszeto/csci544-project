The mandatory spending increased by $6 billion not because of congressional action this year but because of changing economic and program conditions.

On January 22, USDA further announced that as the shutdown continued, FSA offices would remain open on a full-time basis (with excepted staff) from January 24 to February 8 and three days per week thereafter. This latter plan was not implemented because the shutdown ended on January 25. All 9,342 staff of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was exempted by using carryover funding and mandatory funding authorized in the 2014 farm bill. Near the end of the shutdown, NRCS had begun preparations to furlough much of its agency beginning on February 3, 2019, after having retained 100% of the agency since the beginning of the shutdown. By beginning to furlough some employees, NRCS intended to conserve carryover balances and focus exempted staff on carrying out certain mandatory farm bill programs. This plan was not implemented because the shutdown ended on January 25. Most of USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) programs, whether mandatory or discretionary, rely on funding provided in appropriations acts. FNS program operations during a government shutdown vary based on the different programs' available resources, determined by factors such as contingency or carryover funds and terms of the expired appropriations acts, as well as USDA's decisionmaking. Beginning in late December 2018, FNS released program-specific memoranda to states and program operators describing the status of different nutrition assistance programs during the current funding lapse.
