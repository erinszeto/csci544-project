Refundability: Families with little or no income tax liability may be able to claim the credit as a refund. The amount of the refund is equal to 15% of a taxpayer's earnings above $3,000, up to the maximum amount of credit for the family. This is referred to as the \"earned income\" refundability formula.

Roughly half (52.4%) of the child tax credit benefits go to taxpayers with cash incomes under $40,000, whereas the other half go to those making more than $40,000. Roughly the same proportion of the child tax credit goes to taxpayers with AGI between $10,000 and $20,000 ($18.0%) as goes to those with AGI between $50,000 and $75,000 (16.9%), underscoring the fact that this tax credit provides significant benefits to both low-income and middle-income families. Most taxpayers with incomes above $200,000 will be ineligible for the credit due to the phase-out thresholds. ", "EGTRRA and ARRA, which first made the credit partially refundable and then expanded refundability respectively, expanded the credit's availability to lower-income Americans, especially those with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000. Prior to this expansion, the credit was largely available only to middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers. As previously noted, the EGTRRA provisions were made permanent by ATRA, while the ARRA changes were made permanent by the PATH Act.", "Although the current credit is generally available to low-income taxpayers, it provides little benefit to extremely poor taxpayers. Taxpayers with incomes under $10,000 receive 3.6% of the child tax credit, even though they make up 16.8% of tax units. This suggests that this provision may not benefit the very poor in proportion to their population. ", "Taxpayers with very low income (i.e., less than $10,000) do not benefit from the child tax credit (or receive a very small credit, less than $1,000 per child) for two reasons. First, taxpayers with very low income do not have any income tax liability and so cannot claim the nonrefundable portion of the child tax credit. Even if the taxpayer had one qualifying child\u2014and so would be able to reduce their tax liability by $1,000\u2014if they do not owe any federal income taxes, they cannot reduce their taxes by the credit amount. This is one rationale for making tax credits refundable (i.e., available to taxpayers with little or no tax liability). The child tax credit is refundable. However, the child tax credit is only refundable if taxpayers have earnings above $3,000, and the refund is calculated as 15 cents for every dollar of earnings above this $3,000 threshold. Hence, the second reason the very poor do not claim the credit, or claim less than the full value of the credit, is that their low income prevents them from fully benefiting from the refundable portion of the credit. For example, a taxpayer with two children and earnings of $10,000 would, based on the refundability formula, be eligible for $1,050 in child tax credits, as opposed to the maximum amount of $2,000. A taxpayer with two children needs $16,333 in earnings to be able to claim the full $2,000 of child tax credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Generally, economists evaluate tax policy\u2014like the child tax credit\u2014through three different lenses: the equity (or fairness) of the provision (which necessitates defining fairness), how the tax provision affects taxpayers' behavior (again, the intended behavior must be specified), and the complexity of administering the tax provision. These three lenses are often referred to as equity, efficiency, and administration, respectively. A provision may be seen differently through these lenses. For example, a tax provision may simplify the tax code (improve administration), but result in an undesirable behavior (reduce efficiency). Hence economists tend to evaluate a tax provision using these three approaches to provide the most complete economic analysis of the provision. As with other tax provisions, this report will analyze the child tax credit through the lenses of equity, efficiency, and administration. Specifically: ", "Equity: Economic theory suggests that there are two ways to analyze the fairness of a provision, vertical equity and horizontal equity. Vertical equity states that groups with more resources should pay more taxes, whereas horizontal equity states that families with the same circumstances should pay the same taxes. While the child tax credit is generally evaluated as vertically equitable, because it reinforces the progressivity of the current tax code, economists have differing views on whether it is horizontally equitable. ", "Efficiency: When examining the efficiency of a tax provision, economists examine how a tax provision affects taxpayer behavior, in terms of encouraging a taxpayer to do more or less of a certain activity. Theoretically, the child tax credit may have effects on taxpayer behavior, in terms of encouraging taxpayers to work and to have children, but there is currently very little evidence to support or refute these theories. ", "Administration: Tax policies\u2014like the child tax credit\u2014can be analyzed with respect to their effect on the complexity of the tax code. The administration of a tax provision can affect whether it ultimately achieves its economic or policy goals. There are a variety of tax benefits available to families with children, and the addition of the child tax credit, while beneficial to many families, has made the tax code potentially more complicated especially for lower-income taxpayers. ", "The following section examines in detail the child tax credit in terms of its impact on equity, taxpayer behavior, and tax administration."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Equity of the Child Tax Credit", "paragraphs": ["There are several ways to assess the fairness or equity of a tax provision. Depending on the definition used, the child tax credit may or may not be equitable. ", "The current federal income tax is progressive, meaning higher-income taxpayers pay a greater share of their income in taxes (and thus have a higher average income tax rate) than lower-income taxpayers. A progressive tax system reflects a standard of fairness called vertical equity (whether taxes should be progressive and how progressive is subject to some debate). ", "The child tax credit is generally considered vertically equitable because it reinforces the progressivity of the current income tax structure. The credit is structured to lower the tax burden of families earning between $3,000 and the phase-out income level, generally $150,000 for a married couple with two children. As illustrated in Table 2 , the child tax credit reduces the average federal tax rate of taxpayers with cash income under $200,000, while having little impact on taxpayers with income greater than $200,000. In addition, the child tax credit tends to reduce lower-income taxpayers' average tax rates more than it reduces the average tax rate of higher-income taxpayers. The largest reduction occurs among those with income between $10,000 and $20,000.", "Another standard of fairness used by economists\u2014referred to as horizontal equity\u2014suggests that families with equal circumstances should pay equal taxes. The child tax credit's effect on horizontal equity ultimately depends on what are considered \"equal circumstances.\" In other words, are taxpayers considered equal if they have the same income or are they considered equal if they have chosen to spend that income in the same way?", "Some economists interpret horizontal equity to mean that families with the same amount of financial resources (i.e., income) should pay the same amount in taxes (and thus have the same average tax rate), regardless of whether they use those resources to buy a house, go on a vacation, or have a child. If children are viewed as choices of how taxpayers use their resources, the credit would violate horizontal equity. Specifically, the child tax credit generally provides greater tax benefits to a family as the number of children increases, assuming their income remains unchanged. For example, in 2012 a married couple that has $50,000 in earnings and no children (and hence is ineligible for the child tax credit) would be expected to owe $3,634 (7.3% average tax rate) in taxes. If the same married couple had one child, they would be expected to owe $2,634 after applying the child tax credit (5.3% average tax rate). If they had an additional child, the credit would lower their tax liability to $1,634 (3.3% average tax rate).", "Other economists define horizontal equity to mean that families with the same \"ability to pay\" should pay the same in tax. Under this definition, families with more children should pay less in tax because additional children reduce their ability to pay. According to the \"ability to pay\" approach, the child tax credit does not generally violate horizontal equity. Congress used the \"ability to pay\" interpretation of horizontal equity to justify the structure of the child tax credit in 1997. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the main reason for the creation of a child tax credit was that ", "Congress believed that [prior to the child tax credit] the individual income tax structure [did] not reduce tax liability by enough to reflect a family's reduced ability to pay taxes as family size increases.... The Congress believed that a tax credit for families with dependent children will reduce the individual income tax burden of those families, will better recognize the financial responsibilities of raising dependent children, and will promote family values. ", "Policymakers may also be interested in evaluating child tax benefits like the child tax credit simultaneously with the other available tax benefits to get a holistic picture of the tax code's impact on equity. For example, as previously mentioned, the child tax credit when evaluated individually may not be horizontally equitable at low incomes. Based on this analysis, increasing refundability of the credit could make the credit more horizontally equitable for some low-income families. However, prior CRS analysis suggests that after making adjustments for a family's ability to pay based on family size, the totality of child tax benefits results in a tax system that is disproportionally generous at lower income levels to larger as opposed to smaller families. In this broader context, expanding refundability of the child tax credit could exacerbate horizontal inequities.

Economic theory suggests that increasing the price of labor (the wage) among low-income workers will have the overall effect of encouraging them to work more. In practice, however, it is very difficult to isolate the labor market effects of the child tax credit from the similarly structured but larger subsidy provided by the EITC, since both credits simultaneously subsidize earnings over the same income range.

Tax policies, including those targeted toward families with children, are currently structured very differently, adding to the complexity of the tax code. For example, a single parent with a 16-year-old child and income of $20,000 in 2010 will be eligible for a $1,000 child tax credit, a $3,650 dependent exemption for that child (which lowers their tax liability by $548), and $2,487 of EITC. In 2011, when the child is 17, the single parent will be ineligible for the child tax credit, but remain eligible for the dependent exemption (which equals $3,700 in 2011 and will lower their tax bill by $555) and approximately $2,598 of EITC. The amount of these tax benefits will also change if the parent marries (which can change their tax liability), has an additional child, or their income changes (which changes the value of the child tax credit and EITC). Tax complexity associated with child-related tax provisions is particularly burdensome for lower-income families. Complexity reduces utilization rates among eligible populations and reduces the value of the benefits among those who do claim them, because they often rely on a paid preparer for assistance. Complexity can thus undermine the ultimate goal of policymakers, whether it be behavioral changes or increased equity.

If their earnings are sufficiently low, they may not be able to benefit from increasing the maximum amount of the credit. For example, if the child tax credit was doubled to $2,000 per child, and all other aspects of the credit remained the same as current law, a family with two children would need earnings of at least $29,667 to claim the full credit if the maximum credit value doubled. Currently the minimum amount of earnings needed to claim the full credit for two children is $16,333.

Under current law, a family with two children must earn $16,333 to be eligible to receive $2,000 in child tax credits as a refund. If the refundability threshold was lowered to zero (and all other parameters remained the same), this same family would need earnings of $13,333 to receive the full $2,000 in child tax credits as a refund.

These phase-out thresholds are not indexed for inflation. If they had been indexed for inflation, they would have been 41% higher in 2012 than they were in 1998. Over the years, the real value of these thresholds has decreased due to inflation, pushing more taxpayers into the phase-out range and reducing the amount of the child tax credit these taxpayers are eligible for.

It would also increase the budgetary cost of the program. Critics of this change may question the necessity of such relief. The empirical evidence suggests that the overall federal tax burden, as well as the federal individual income tax burden, fell for most households with children between 1979 and 2007.

According to IRS data, more than half of taxpayers with income below $50,000 use paid tax preparers. President Bush's 2005 Presidential Panel on Federal Tax Reform summarized the complexity of claiming the child tax credit, \"Figuring out whether you can claim the child tax credit ... requires the skills of a professional sleuth: You need to complete eight lines on a tax form, perform up to five calculations, and fill out as many as three other forms or schedules.\"", "Much of the complexity in child-related tax benefits is related to differing definitions of what constitutes an eligible child, specifically the different age limits of qualifying children among the different tax benefits.

While such a proposal could significantly simplify eligibility rules as well as the calculation of the benefit, policymakers would need to consider the competing functions of current tax benefits as they create a uniform benefit. For example, some benefits like the EITC and refundable portion of the child tax credit subsidize earnings, whereas the nonrefundable portion of the child tax credit provides a uniform benefit per child for taxpayers with sufficient earnings that do not exceed the phase-out level.
