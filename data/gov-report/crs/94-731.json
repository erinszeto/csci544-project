Nevertheless, the Secretary had promulgated regulations that excluded birds, and rats and mice bred for use in research, from coverage under the act. A federal court found this exclusion to violate the act, but the decision was overturned on appeal on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit. Subsequently, in a case unrelated to the birds, rats, and mice question, the en banc D.C. Circuit held that a plaintiff who \"suffered [injuries] to his aesthetic interest in observing animals living under humane conditions\" had standing to sue the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the act.", "Subsequently, another suit was brought to challenge the exclusion of birds, rats, and mice, and a federal district court, citing the D.C. Circuit case, denied the Department of Agriculture's motion to dismiss for lack of standing. As a result, the Department of Agriculture settled the case by agreeing to revise its regulations to include birds, rats, and mice. Then Congress intervened, and, in the Department of Agriculture appropriations for FY2001 ( P.L. 106 - 387 , \u00a7\u00a0772), prohibited FY2001 funds from being used to \"modify the definition of 'animal' in existing regulations pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act.\" The FY2002 appropriations contained the same prohibition ( P.L. 107 - 76 , \u00a7\u00a0732), and then P.L. 107 - 171 , \u00a7\u00a010301, amended the statute to exclude birds, rats, and mice bred for research. Section 10304 of the statute, however, directs the National Research Council, by May 13, 2003, to submit to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees \"a report on the implications of including rats, mice, and birds within the definition of animal under the regulations promulgated under the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.).\" No report appears to have been written.", "The AWA requires every research facility to establish an Institutional Animal Committee of at least three members, at least one of whom shall not be affiliated in any way with the facility and who is intended to represent \"general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals.\" The Committee's responsibilities include to review practices involving pain to animals and to file a report with the Secretary. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143(b).", "The AWA also provides for the licensing of dealers and exhibitors (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02133) and prohibits research facilities from purchasing dogs or cats from unlicensed dealers or exhibitors (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02137). The act defines \"dealer\" in part as a person who, for compensation, transports, buys, or sells any animal \"for research, teaching, exhibition, or use as a pet,\" but it excludes from the definition a retail pet store that does not sell \"animals to a research facility, an exhibitor, or a dealer\" (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2132(f)). The act defines \"exhibitor\" to include carnivals, circuses, and zoos, but to exclude retail pet stores, state and country fairs, livestock shows, rodeos, and purebred dog and cat shows (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2132(h)).", "The AWA also prohibits dealers and exhibitors from selling or otherwise disposing of any dog or cat within five business days after they acquire it, except that this requirement does not apply to operators of auction sales. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2135. A 1990 amendment requires public and private pounds and shelters, and research facilities licensed by the Department of Agriculture, to \"hold and care for\" any dog or cat they acquire \"for a period of not less than five days to enable such dog or cat to be recovered by its original owner or adopted by other individuals before such entity sells such dog or cat to a dealer.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2158(a). Does this provision prohibit a pound, shelter, or research facility from euthanizing a dog or cat before five days? Perhaps not on its face, but that appears to be its intent, as to read it otherwise would seem to defeat its purpose.", "Another 1990 amendment authorized the Attorney General to seek, and federal courts to issue, injunctions against dealing in stolen animals or placing the health of an animal in serious danger in violation of the act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2159.", "P.L. 110 - 234 , \u00a7 14210 (2008) added a new section to the AWA (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02148) that prohibits any person from importing a dog into the United States for purposes of resale unless the Secretary determines that the dog is in good health, has received all necessary vaccinations, and is at least six months old.
