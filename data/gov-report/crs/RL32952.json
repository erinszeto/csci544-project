Some would contend that the ESEA authorizations of appropriations, as amended by NCLBA, represent a funding commitment that was promised in return for legislative support for the new administrative requirements placed on state and local educational systems. They would contend that the authorized levels are needed for implementing the new requirements, and that the differences between promised and actual funding levels represent a shortfall of billions of dollars. The FY2005 appropriation was $9.1 billion less than the amount authorized for the five ESEA programs for which a FY2005 authorization is specified. For FY2006, these five programs were funded at a level $12.0 billion below the authorized level (after adjustment for the 1% rescission). Others would contend that the authorized funding levels represent no more than appropriations ceilings, and as such are no different from authorizations for most education programs. That is, when the authorization amount is specified, it represents only a maximum amount, with the actual funding level to be determined during the regular annual appropriations process. In the past, education programs with specified levels of authorization generally have been funded at lower levels; few have been funded at levels equal to or higher than the specified authorization amount.

Appropriations have never been sufficient to reach the 40% level. In 2004, Congress addressed the authorization issue in P.L. 108 - 446 , which specified authorization ceilings for Part B Grants to States for FY2005 through FY2011. The Part B Grants to States authorization was $12.4 billion for FY2005 and $14.6 billion for FY2006. The FY2005 appropriation was $10.6 billion, or $1.8 billion less than the authorization. The FY2006 appropriation was $10.6 billion (after adjustment for the 1% rescission), or $4.0 billion less than the authorization.

The program provides assistance to eligible undergraduate students based on financial need. Aggregate program costs depend largely on the maximum award and the number of eligible recipients. The maximum award is currently set when appropriations are enacted, which is usually before the start of the program year. The exact number and total amount of the Pell Grant awards cannot be determined until all students have claimed an award. Generally, the number of recipients and the amount of the awards are not reconciled until the end of the program year, which occurs after the following year's appropriations have been enacted. Appropriations for Pell Grants make funds available for two full fiscal years to provide administrative flexibility regarding potential shortfalls and surpluses. If the cost of the Pell Grant program exceeds the current fiscal year's appropriation, the shortfall is covered by using appropriated monies from the next fiscal year. Similarly, a surplus can be carried forward and used in the following year. As of January 4, 2006, the ED Budget Service has estimated that the FY2005 shortfall will be $4.3 billion. For FY2006, the Administration proposed legislation that would recall the federal share of the Perkins Loan program and use $4.3 billion of the proceeds to eliminate the current Pell Grant shortfall. P.L. 109 - 149 continued funding for the Perkins Loan program, and \u00a7305 of P.L. 109 - 149 appropriated $4.3 billion to eliminate the shortfall.

For example, most FY2006 appropriations will be available for obligation from October 1, 2005, through September 30, 2006. Several L-HHS-ED programs, including some of the larger ED programs, have authorization or appropriations provisions that allow funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year. For example, many of the elementary and secondary education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on July 1 of the same year as the appropriations, and remain available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year. That is, FY2006 appropriations for some programs will became available for obligation to the states on July 1, 2006, and will remain available until September 30, 2007. This budgetary procedure is popularly known as \"forward\" or \"multi-year\" funding, and is accomplished through funding provisions in the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill.", "Forward funding in the case of elementary and secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time for school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year. For Pell Grants for undergraduates, however, aggregate program costs for individual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time. Appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support Pell Grants during the following academic year, that is, the FY2006 appropriations will be used primarily to support grants for the 2006-2007 academic year. Unlike elementary and secondary education programs, however, the funds for Pell Grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years, as discussed above.", "An advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for a fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation was enacted. In the case of FY2006 appropriations, funds normally would have become available October 1, 2005, under regular funding provisions, but will not become available until July 1, 2006, under the forward funding provisions discussed above. However, if the July 1, 2006 forward funding date were to be postponed for obligation by three months\u2014until October 1, 2006\u2014the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in a subsequent fiscal year , FY2007. For example, the FY2006 budget request for Title I, Part A Grants to LEAs for the Education for the Disadvantaged was $13.3 billion. This amount includes not only forward funding of $5.9 billion (to become available July 1, 2006), but also an advance appropriation of $7.4 billion (to become available October 1, 2006). Like forward funding provisions, these advance appropriations are specified through provisions in the annual appropriations bill.", "What is the impact of these changes in funding provisions? At the appropriations level, there is no difference between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period available for obligation. At the program or service level, relatively little is changed by the three-month delay in the availability of funds, since most expenditures for a standard school year occur after October 1. At the scorekeeping level, however, a significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year, and is therefore fully included in the current 302(b) allocation for discretionary appropriations. Under federal budget scorekeeping rules, an advance appropriation is not counted in the 302(b) allocation until the following year. In essence, a three-month change from forward funding to an advance appropriation for a given program allows a one-time shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations.
