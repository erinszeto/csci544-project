The North Slope also is home to a diverse, unique, and fragile ecosystem \u2013 resulting in extensive federal, state, and local regulatory protection. Partly due to increased restrictions since the discovery of Prudhoe Bay, operators have developed less environmentally intrusive ways to recover arctic oil, primarily through innovations in several types of technology.", "Seismic technology offers the exploration sector advanced analytical methods that generate high resolution images of geologic structures and that help identify oil and gas accumulations by looking for anomalies or hydrocarbon indicators in the seismic data. Ice-based technology has been improved so as to better serve remote areas during exploratory drilling and production. Computers now allow the manipulation and interpretation of vast amounts of data, offering more precise well locations, thereby reducing the number of wells needed to find hydrocarbon accumulations.", "Recent advances in drilling can reduce the footprint of petroleum operations in arctic environments. New drilling bit designs, fluid formulas, and advanced forms of drilling, such as extended reach, horizontal, and designer wells, permit drilling to reach as far as five miles from a wellhead location and to drill around geological barriers to find and develop hydrocarbon accumulations. Advances in drilling allow less space for a drilling rig, and reduce volumes and weights of both equipment and drilling waste.", "Production facilities are now more compact, with modules performing many functions. A project goal of operators on the North Slope is zero discharge of solid and fluid wastes. Production drilling techniques using slim hole technology, such as coiled tubing and multilateral drilling, can contribute to smaller footprints, less waste, and better recovery of hydrocarbons from each well.", "Proponents of opening ANWR to energy development maintain that these technologies substantially mitigate the effects on the environment of oil and gas operations, and assert that the increase in domestically-produced energy would be worth any minimal environmental impacts. Opponents counter that a facility of any size would still be an industrial site and an intrusion on the ecosystem, and argue that the need for gravel and scarce water, the permanent roads, ports, and airstrips that would follow, and the unknown number of spills would destroy vegetation, contaminate water resources, and interfere with wildlife."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction and Overview", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Scope", "paragraphs": ["Congressional concern over high oil prices, growing U.S. dependence on oil imports, budgetary pressures, and maintenance of the Alaskan oil infrastructure has revived discussion over possibly opening part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas exploration and development.

Among the arguments put forward by proponents of opening ANWR is that there would be a much smaller surface impact, or footprint, from the petroleum industry's presence compared with procedures, operations, and equipment discussed in the 1987 Final Legislative Environmental Impact Statement (FLEIS) on the Refuge prepared by the Department of the Interior. Current law prohibits petroleum and gas development in ANWR.", "Some environmental impact is unavoidable with industry activity. Searching for oil and gas involves drilling into the earth with heavy equipment; and various facilities and other activities are necessary to support such drilling. The downscaling of petroleum equipment and operations and the advanced technological solutions to exploration, drilling, and production difficulties have reduced these impacts, however. Improved exploration and development technologies that have become more widely available include advanced seismic data analysis, ice-based technology, slim hole and high performance drilling techniques, and methods to reduce waste.", "Such innovation also is a factor in addressing the economic obstacles to finding and developing hydrocarbons. Technological advance has more than doubled exploration success rates and markedly improved drilling and production performance and efficiency.

Discussion and analysis of some of these matters can be found in CRS Report RL31278, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Background and Issues , by [author name scrubbed] et al. However, to put the technology developments\u2014the focus of this report\u2014in perspective, the report's initial section summarizes some of the concerns expressed by opponents of development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as well as some of the benefits of ANWR development offered by proponents.", "Exploration and drilling technologies are discussed next, as exploration is the first step toward commercial production of hydrocarbons. After successful drilling of an exploration well or wells, there are a variety of technological options available to the industry for starting the development of the discovery.

Mining the gravel might result in local changes in topography; roads may have to be built to transport the gravel to exploration and production sites; and there would be a direct loss of coastal plain habitat due to secondary effects of gravel spray, dust deposition, and altered snow melt and erosion patterns stemming from facility construction and gravel mining. Very large quantities of water will have to be used for various activities, such as drilling, ice road and ice pad construction, and support of camp facilities, including human consumption. Water probably would have to be transported into the area.", "The long-term effects of winter exploration, drilling, and production operations are unknown. Summer erosion and melting of permafrost may due to the heat generated near productions sites. Tundra may be destroyed around the perimeter of insulated ice pads. Compaction, destruction, and delayed growth of vegetation may occur around ice pad production sites. And even minor spills may cause some destruction of vegetation, contamination of waters, and mortality of small food organisms. Surface disturbances probably would be numerous, with production facilities connected by a gathering network or a system of pipelines to an existing or a future pipeline; and production and related equipment may have to be staged at another location over the summer months, then transported to the field during the winter. The use of ice roads may be limited by hilly topography.", "On the other hand, oil and gas development of the Refuge, it is argued, could yield possibly significant gains in energy security and economic benefits. Development supporters contend that ANWR oil would reduce U.S. dependency upon foreign petroleum, create jobs in Alaska and elsewhere in the United States, generate tax revenues, extend the economic life of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, and possibly lower oil prices.

Mining claims were staked on the seeps outside of ANWR in the early 1900s but never fully exploited. Oil seeps and oil-stained rock also were found within the coastal plain of ANWR. From 1944 to 1953, the Navy conducted a program in the Naval Petroleum Reserve #4, now the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPRA). There, 37 wells were drilled to test 18 structure types that appeared prospective for hydrocarbon accumulation. Three oil and seven natural gas fields, all uneconomic, were discovered. Although uneconomic quantities of petroleum were found, this federal exploration program supported the conclusion that the North Slope had most of the elements of a major petroleum province.

All wells were vertical or directional wells. Production began to decline in 1989, and the field was producing only about 680,000 barrels per day by early 1999. In anticipation of the decline in production, the first production horizontal well was drilled in November 1985. Horizontal wells generally have higher production rates and produce greater quantities of oil and gas than conventional wells because the well encounters more of the reservoir rock.

The FLEIS noted that the supply of fresh water is limited in the 1002 area and is confined to the surface and the shallow zone of soil located above the impermeable permafrost layer. The Refuge receives an average of six inches of precipitation annually. Most lakes are shallow and therefore freeze solid in winter. A 1989 study found 255 lakes, ponds, and puddles within the 1002 area. Less than 25% were deeper than seven feet; only eight contained enough unfrozen water to build a mile or more of ice road. A number of rivers and streams exist in the 1002 area, and these, too, are usually shallow. Ice chips from lakes and rivers can be used to supplement ice road construction. Each mile of ice road uses an estimated one million gallons of liquid water that road builders typically transport no more than 10 miles, as it may freeze before it is used. Water shortages might be addressed with greater use of chipped ice scraped from lakes, and/or development of new technologies using a desalination plant and a heated elevated pipeline.", "Ice road construction also may be limited by the area's topography. Developed areas on the North Slope (e.g., Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk, and Alpine) are very flat, facilitating ice technology, whereas the 1002 area is hillier, its drainage is better established, and its vegetation is more woody than the wetland grasses that dominate Prudhoe Bay and other developed areas. Foothills and the hilly portions constitute 45% and 22%, respectively, of the ANWR coastal plain. Where topographic relief is high, the State of Alaska has allowed gravel roads in lieu of ice for safety reasons.", "Distance from developed areas or potential staging areas can also limit ice technology. As noted, heavy equipment usually would be stored in the nearest possible gravel staging areas, and once ice roads are finished, moved to the drill site. If the distance for ice road construction is great, there will be delay in reaching the drill site, thereby adding to costs. At the production phase, when still more equipment must be moved, the cost of delay could rise further.", "As noted above, solutions to these problems exist; if not (as in the case of topographic limits on use of ice roads), gravel construction can be substituted. However, if polar warming continues, use of ice technology may be limited still further. Standards for cross-tundra travel are being changed to accommodate industry needs, while still attempting to balance effects on tundra habitat.", "Because it is regarded as a model of modern development, the history of the Alpine field is relevant. Located along the border of the National Petroleum Reserve -Alaska (NPRA), it is considered a model of \"roadless\" development because of the short (three-mile) road connecting the two initial pads and the lack of connection with the remainder of North Slope development, except in winter via ice road. As noted earlier, however, the recent approval of five additional pads will add about 28 miles of gravel roads to the existing three miles, and create 1,845 acres of disturbed soils. About 150 miles of roads would be built if the field is fully developed.", "In sum, ice technologies can significantly limit the footprints of development in the exploration phase, especially in flat terrain, with corresponding benefits to tundra vegetation.
