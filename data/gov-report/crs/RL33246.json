The Interim Report summarized its key findings as the following.", "Reading First schools appear to be implementing the major elements of the program as intended by the legislation. Reading First schools received both financial and nonfinancial support from a variety of external sources. Classroom reading instruction in Reading First schools is significantly more likely to adhere to the Reading First legislation than classroom reading instruction in Title I schools. Reading First teachers in three grades (kindergarten, second, and third) were significantly more likely than their counterparts in other Title I schools to place their struggling students in intervention programs.

ED created 16 subpanels to review state applications, and according to the OIG, a majority of the panelists on 15 out of the 16 subpanels had been nominated by ED. In addition, none of the subpanels included a nominee from each of the other organizations specified in Section 1203(c)(2)(A) of the NCLBA. And the OIG found no evidence that the subpanels met to review applications as a whole before recommending that the Secretary approve or disapprove a state's application. The OIG's report states that \"Because the Department did not meet the requirements at Sections 1203(c)(2)(A), it raises the question of whether any of the applications were approved in compliance with the law.\" Although not required to do so by law, ED screened potential panelists for conflicts of interest. However, the screening process used was ineffective, according to the OIG. The OIG reviewed resumes provided to ED by 25 Reading First panelists, and found that six of the panelists had significant professional connections to a specific reading program. ED failed to follow its own guidance ( Reviewer Guidance for the Reading First Program ) for conducting the peer review process. The OIG found that the review panelists provided constructive comments in the Panel Chair Summaries submitted to ED that would have been useful to states whose applications were not approved, in making needed modifications to their applications. However, ED did not share these panel summaries with the states; instead, the Reading First director and his assistant used these panel summaries to write their own reports, which were then provided to states. According to the OIG, these reports did not always accurately reflect the Panel Chair summaries\u2014sometimes the Reading First director and his assistant changed or omitted panelists' comments, and sometimes they added their own comments. As a consequence, states sometimes lacked adequate information to correct their applications and were required to submit amended applications several times before they were approved. In addition, the OIG found that five state applications were approved without documentation that these states had met the required criteria, or that the subpanels had approved these applications. Some of the criteria required by the department for panelists to approve a state's application were not based on requirements included in the NCLBA. ED provided panelists with 25 criteria to be rated in each state application ( Reading First: Criteria for Review of State Applications ). Three rating categories were established for each criterion: \"Exemplary,\" \"Meets Standard,\" and \"Does Not Meet Standard.\" The \"Meets Standard\" category was the bar all states were expected to meet for application approval. The \"Exemplary\" category was applied to conditions above and beyond \"Meets Standard\" that were believed would result in the highest-quality programs. However, the OIG found that some of requirements in the \"Meets Standard\" category were not requirements contained in the NCLBA, and as a consequence, \"State applications were reviewed based upon standards that were not required by statute.\" Finally, the OIG found that \"program officials tried to purposely obscure the content of the statute ( the ESEA ) and otherwise took actions to disregard Congress' direction and intent.\" The OIG also found that ED's \"actions demonstrate that the program officials failed to maintain a controlled environment that exemplifies management integrity and accountability.\" Further, the OIG found that ED's actions may have violated prohibitions in the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA) and the ESEA against federal endorsement of particular curricula.", "The OIG recommended that the Assistant Secretary of ED's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) take the following actions.", "Implement procedures to ensure OESE staff know when to solicit advice from the Office of the General Counsel (OGC); as well as procedures to resolve disputes that might arise between OESE staff and the OGC to \"ensure that programs are managed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\" In consultation with the OGC, make improvements to strengthen procedures for evaluating potential conflicts of interest in panel review processes. Review all Reading First applications to ensure all necessary criteria were met. Make changes, as appropriate, to the management and staff structure of the Reading First program to ensure that Reading First's implementation is consistent with NCLBA requirements. Ask the OGC to provide guidance on what is prohibited by Section 3403(b) of the Department of Education Organization Act. Rely upon an internal advisory committee (which includes representatives from OESE programs, the OGC, and ED's Risk Management Team) to ensure that future initiatives are appropriately implemented and coordinated with other ED programs. Request that the internal advisory committee evaluate whether \"the implementation of Reading First harmed the Federal interest,\" and whether any remedial actions are required. In addition, request that the internal advisory committee ensure that ED has internal controls in place so that future programs do not have problems similar to those that occurred with Reading First. Establish a discussion with state and local education representatives \"to discuss issues with Reading First as part of the reauthorization process.\"", "The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) responded in writing that she agreed with all of the recommendations of the OIG, and would take immediate action to implement these recommendations. However, ED also responded that it did not agree with all of the findings reached by the OIG. ED noted that it has no information to indicate that its peer review process adversely affected any state. It also noted that screening for conflicts of interest was not required\u2014but it took this extra effort and made reasonable efforts to adapt conflict-of-interest procedures to the Reading First program. Regarding its screening of panelists, ED stated that \"We know that while additional steps could have been taken, the steps we took were effective and more than what was required by law.\" ED also indicated that the statute did not specify the role of peer review comments, and that it had not replaced a process required by the NCLBA. In addition, its further review of Reading First staff summaries of these comments found that, overall, \" the summaries did not deviate significantly from the reviewers' comments.\" ED also stated that the peer review panel was advisory, and that it was not practical to have the panel review every resubmitted state application. In addition, ED noted that the Reading First criteria it issued to panelists was intended to \"encourage high-quality projects that go beyond the minimum standards of the statute.\" ED stated that \"Overall, the Reading First guidance has proven to be helpful and it is consistent with the law, and consistent with helping ensure the submission of high quality applications.\" Finally, ED stated that \"We are not aware of information showing inappropriate actions to require particular programs or approaches.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OIG Final Audit Report: The Department's Administration of Selected Aspects of the Reading First Program", "paragraphs": ["This audit focused on ED's administration of several aspects of the Reading First program: the Reading First Leadership Academies (RLAs) held in January and February of 2002; the Reading First website; ED's April 2007 Guidance for the Reading First Program ; and ED's monitoring of conflicts of interest in its technical assistance contracts.

Furthermore, ED noted that participants at the RLAs were told that the purpose of the sessions was not to endorse any particular reading program.
