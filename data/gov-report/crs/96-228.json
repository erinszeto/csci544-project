The coverage threshold is $2,000.", "Under Davis-Bacon, the Secretary of Labor makes wage rate determinations for \"the various classes of laborers and mechanics\" employed on covered work. The Secretary has, through regulation, recognized apprentices and trainees, registered in formal programs, as special categories and allowed a special reduced wage for these workers. Some contractors, however, have created yet another category of worker: i.e., \"helpers.\" These may be informal trainees, or they may simply be general utility workers employed outside of a craft classification. These workers are most often not recognized as a separate category for wage rate determination purposes.", "Through the years, the Department of Labor (DOL) had rigorously adhered to this general worker classification system as necessary to assure that not less than the locally prevailing rate would be paid to \"the various classes of laborers and mechanics\" on a project. Were helpers indiscriminately substituted for journeymen or laborers, DOL holds, wage rates would be depressed and the intent of Congress in crafting the Davis-Bacon Act would be subverted.", "In 1979, the Carter Administration began a general review of Davis-Bacon\u2014including the helper issue. New regulations were issued in January 1981. Before they could be implemented, they were withdrawn and rewritten by the Reagan Administration (1982). Through the next decade, these new Davis-Bacon regulations were largely implemented\u2014but the helper segment remained in litigation. When, in 1992 (following a series of legal maneuvers), judicial approval of the helper regulations was finally secured, Congress blocked their enforcement through the appropriations process, variously denying funding for their implementation.", "In mid-1996, the Associated Builders and Contractors sought court assistance to require enforcement of the helper regulation. DOL responded by returning to the rulemaking process. Subsequently, DOL published a proposed rule (April 1999) defining the concept of helpers and soliciting comment. The proposed rule, essentially, reaffirmed Departmental practice of the 1970s with respect to the use of helpers: the issue had come full circle. This final rule was issued by the Department and took effect on January 19, 2001.", "Administrative initiatives found a counterpart in legislative proposals, introduced periodically up through the 109th Congress.

The process continued through the Reagan and Bush Administrations to the close of the Clinton Administration\u2014and beyond.", "To a large degree the core issues from the 1970s and 1980s, associated with the Davis-Bacon Act, remain controversial. Among these is the question of the employment of helpers on Davis-Bacon covered federal and federally-assisted contract construction work. For example, how is the concept of helper to be defined for Davis-Bacon purposes? What distinguishes a helper from other construction workers? On Davis-Bacon work, should they be integrated into the regular construction crew? Should helpers receive training to enhance their skills and, if so, how should\u00a0such training be structured? How should their wage rates compare with those of other project workers?", "These questions quickly became a source of contention. Through more than 2 decades, employment of helpers (as a separate category of worker on projects covered by the Davis-Bacon Act) remained a matter of dispute. Then, in April 1999, the Department of Labor published a proposed rule on the use of helpers that would, essentially, revert to the 1970s practice of the Department so far as the use of helpers was concerned. A comment period on the proposal closed on June 8, 1999. Meanwhile, legislation was introduced that would have provided a statutory definition of helper \u2014but no legislative action was taken.", "Under date of November 17, 2000, the Department issued a final rule on the helper issue\u2014to take effect on January 19, 2001, during the closing hours of the Clinton Administration. In effect, the final rule reaffirmed Departmental practice of the 1970s: the issue had come full circle.

Normally, the helper would be unskilled\u2014though, in fact, he (or she) could have a wide range of skills but, not having gone through a formal training program, would not be recognized as skilled. A helper could also be a craftsman, a journeyman, down on his luck, and forced by economic necessity to accept general utility work below his level of training. Normally, the helper is unlikely to be a trade union member (or, if a member, not employed under a collectively bargained contract). He may usually be paid a wage lower than that of a skilled worker; though, for particular types of work, he may perform equally as well as a skilled craftsman.", "Because he is cheaper to employ and more flexible in the types of work he may be willing to accept (working outside of craft), he can be a useful addition to a work crew. Where a manager carefully supervises the work to be done, the less expensive helper can be assigned to perform narrow aspects of an otherwise complex task. (This process has been referred to as craft fragmentation.) At the worksite, one might expect to find, in the absence of workrules that would preclude it, a battery of helpers working under the guidance of a more highly paid journeyman. Whether such an arrangement is economical, in terms of productivity and quality of workmanship, is a subject of intense and on-going debate.", "An apprentice or a trainee (enrolled in a formal program) could be expected to rotate throughout the worksite, receiving on-the-job training and, in the case of the former, outside instruction as well. In contrast, the helper would normally receive the narrowest possible training, no more extensive than is absolutely required for the task at hand. And, in large measure, the helper is regarded as a temporary worker rather than a permanent member of his employer's crew. As the Davis-Bacon Act has been implemented by the Secretary of Labor, the Department has recognized apprentices and trainees in formal programs as a classification of workers for wage rate purposes. It has not, generally, recognized the category of helper, however, on the assumption that to do so would undercut the locally prevailing wage structure and skills system that the Davis-Bacon Act was designed to protect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Helpers Under Davis-Bacon: The Context of the Issue", "paragraphs": ["The Davis-Bacon Act (1931, as amended) requires that the \"advertised specifications\" for construction contracts in excess of $2,000 to which the government of the United States or of the District of Columbia is a party:", "... shall contain a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics which shall be based upon the wages that will be determined by the Secretary of Labor to be prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the city, town, village, or other civil subdivision of the State in which the work is to be performed....

It is the informal and often imprecise titles of \"helper\" and \"trainee,\" the BCTD notes, that have provoked conflict. There \"is no evidence that most of these trainees and helpers are anything but temporary employees who are released when their work on the project is completed.\" DOL's restriction on the use of helpers \"strikes at one of the wage-cutting devices by which non-union contractors can achieve the advantage they need to be able more frequently to underbid union contractors on federally funded work.\" And, the BCTD adds, the use of helpers at sub-craft wages was one of the \"abuses the Davis-Bacon Act was intended to remedy.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Administrative Reform of the Helper Provisions", "paragraphs": ["By the late 1970s, a campaign was underway for reform or repeal of Davis-Bacon.

Greene of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a preliminary injunction against the Secretary of Labor and, among other things, addressed at length the issues raised with respect to the helper provision. Judge Greene said:", "At the time of enactment of the Davis-Bacon Act, Congress was acutely conscious of efforts by some employers to classify workers as \"helpers\" in order to avoid paying the skilled laborers' wage. The Senate Committee report noted that wage standards had [been]:", "largely broken down by intermediate classifications of labor and failure to retain the strict lines of demarcation intended to be drawn and maintained between skilled and unskilled labor. The whole tendency has been for wages of the skilled group to descend toward the level of the unskilled group, this by reason of intermediate classification devices.", "The report concluded by recommending that construction contracts contain a provision stating that the minimum wages to be paid \"various classes of laborers and mechanics\" shall be based on wages prevailing \"for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics,\" the language ultimately adopted in 1935....", "The new regulations will permit precisely that which Congress intended to halt in 1935. The concept of \"classes of laborers or mechanics\" was and is central to the statutory scheme. Under existing and long-established industry and administrative practice, a \"class\" of workers is one that has been historically recognized as such and whose members perform well-defined tasks. Helpers have therefore been recognized as a class only when their use has\u00a0been prevailing in an area and they have formed a distinguishable group performing discrete tasks.", "Under the new regulations, helpers not only are not defined in traditional terms, but they may perform any task throughout the entire construction field: they are \"general helpers.\" As a consequence, such individuals would be allowed, at the discretion of the contractors, to perform the tasks of laborers, of journeyman mechanics, and of laborers and mechanics on a cross-craft, multi-trade basis. Obviously, if contractors could thus assign a helper to perform the tasks of any and all classes of laborers and mechanics and they could do so at lesser pay, they will do just that, and the requirement that wages be based on \"corresponding classes\" will effectively be read out of the law. As the Wage Appeals Board said in Fry Brothers Corp ., 123 WAB No. 76-6 (June 14, 1977), at p. 15-16:", "If a construction contractor who is not bound by the classifications of work at which the majority of employees in the area are working is free to classify or reclassify, grade or subgrade traditional craft work as he wishes, such a contractor can, with respect to wage rates, take almost any job away from the group of contractors and the employees who work for them who have established the locality wage standard. There will be little left to the Davis-Bacon Act.", "Moreover, under existing administrative practice, a helper classification is recognized only if it is \"prevailing\" in a particular area; under the new regulations, the use of helpers need only be \"identifiable\" to be recognized. Yet the statute itself refers to \"wages ... prevailing for ... classes,\" not to wages identified for classes. The effect of this change will be that when there is a single \"helper\" or a small group of helpers in a town or a metropolitan area, helpers may be employed in substitution of traditional craft workers throughout that area in all aspects of construction work. In that respect, again, the new regulations will depart both from prior practice and from the central purpose of the Act.", "For these reasons, it is unlikely that, when the merits are reached, this regulation can be allowed to stand.", "Judge Greene noted that \"eight Presidents and 15 Secretaries of Labor of many political and ideological persuasions\" had interpreted the Davis-Bacon regulations without the \"fundamental changes that are brought about by the regulations adopted two months ago\" and had \"continued to interpret and enforce the laws precisely in accordance with the original understanding.\" Judge Green concluded: \"Such consistent, unwavering administrative construction must be accorded very substantial weight by the Court.\"", "On December 23, 1982, Judge Greene, having further reviewed the case, issued a permanent injunction against implementation of the helper rule. The decision was promptly appealed.", "U.S. Court of Appeals (1983). Through the spring of 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, reviewed Judge Greene's decision. On the helper issue, the Appeals Court partly upheld but partly overturned the District Court verdict.", "\"The provision requiring that a helper classification need only be 'identifiable' in an area,\" the Appeals Court declared, \"must be struck down because it operates to undermine the fundamental purpose of the act: that wages on federal construction projects mirror those locally prevailing.\" Further, the Appeals Court pointed to the potential for down-grading a classification of work: for example, making \"carpenter work\" into \"carpenter's helper work\" and, in the process, reducing the wages to be paid. After reviewing the legislative history of the act, it observed: \"What is clear is that Congress regarded underclassification as contrary to the purposes, and most probably to the terms, of the act.\" Again: \"We have concluded that the Secretary's identifiable-classification regulation would virtually ensure underclassification in union-dominated areas.\"", "With respect to the definition of helper , the Appeals Court found that the Secretary of Labor was \"entitled to try to come closer ... than his predecessors have\" to making wage rates on Davis-Bacon projects accurately reflect local practice. It found that a shift from a definition based upon the use of tools to one based upon the element of supervision was reasonable. \"The change may mean that some unscrupulous contractors will find it easier to shift ... journeyman work onto helpers,\" it noted, \"but we find it difficult to second-guess the Secretary's view that he can catch\u00a0them.\"", "Therefore, the Appeals Court split on the helper issue: sustaining Judge Greene on the question of \"identifiable\" versus \"prevailing\" practice but accepting the Secretary's new definition of \"helper.\" Since the regulation was, in effect, a unit, the result blocked implementation of the helper rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Helper Rule Is Cleared by the Courts", "paragraphs": ["The unions appealed the decision of the Appeals Court but, in January 1984, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

A DOL spokesperson suggested that simply \"[t]o state that the helper classification is prevailing because most of the contractors in a local area use helpers is an oversimplification.\" Therefore, in the proposed rule, the Department set forth several options upon which to base a determination and called for public comment. On January 27, 1989, a new revised final rule was published; but, since the Secretary was still subject to Judge Greene's 1982 injunction, the rule had to be cleared through the District Court before it could be implemented.", "On September 24, 1990, Judge Greene vacated the injunction, thus permitting DOL to implement the helper regulation.

The \"Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations\" bill of April 10, 1991 ( P.L. 102-27 ) provided that \"no funds shall be expended by the Secretary of Labor to implement or administer\" the helper regulations (Title III, Section 303). Thus, DOL was barred from further activity through the end of that fiscal year with respect to the helper regulation. Whether the restriction was temporary or permanent became a subject of dispute. In late September 1991, BCTD President Robert Georgine urged Labor Secretary Lynn Martin to withhold implementation until the judicial appeal had been completed. When DOL sought funding in its FY1992 budget request to implement the helper regulation, the request was turned down both in the House and the Senate.

In the opinion of the court, the ratio was \"a purely arbitrary choice without rational decision making.\" It noted", "Such an unsubstantiated imposition of a fixed ratio in a regulatory scheme based on a statute\u00a0designed to implement prevailing practices represents the very essence of arbitrariness. It is true that a regulation must be sustained as long as the agency has articulated a reasonable basis for its decision. ... Here, however, all the agency has done is to state that a 2:3 ratio better reflects industry use of helpers than did the 1:5 ratio.... To state a conclusion is not to reason.", "The matter was sent back to the Department. Two months later, on June 24, 1992, DOL issued a new final Davis-Bacon rule, removing the section of the earlier regulation that had set a ratio of helpers to journeymen and, thus, allowing for an open-ended interpretation.

The Department stated that it \"does not believe it [DOL] could draw the line effectively between semi-skilled and skilled work, especially given that, in today's construction market, skilled craft workers may perform a whole range of duties from unskilled to semi-skilled to skilled, and laborers often perform what may be considered semi-skilled work as well.\" Even the element of supervision would not be helpful in this respect, the Department insisted.

It went on to cite other estimates; and, while there was some variation in the statistics, the percentage of helpers estimated as employed in construction was extremely low.

The unions also expressed concern, DOL noted, that \"the suspended rule's failure to encourage formal craft training would eventually lead to a severe shortage of skilled craft workers in the industry.\" This contention was disputed by employers. Both the Associated Builders and Contractors and the Associated General Contractors \"commented that there is no basis for the Department's concern.\" Various employer-oriented spokespersons suggested a preference for helpers over apprentices or, at least, that employment of helpers was a useful alternative.", "The Department, however, held \"that formal structured training programs are more effective than informal on-the-job training alone.\" DOL, like the unions, expressed concern that \"implementation of the suspended rule would discourage the growth of such programs and result in the replacement of DBRA-covered [Davis-Bacon] projects of apprentices and trainees enrolled in formal programs, by helpers who,\" the Department stated, \"could perform the same work as apprentices and trainees at a lower cost to the construction contractor and without any restrictions as to how helpers are used.\" It concluded that \"the increased use of helpers under the suspended rule poses a significant risk that formal apprenticeship and training programs on DBRA-covered projects would be undermined.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Final Definition of Helper", "paragraphs": ["After more than 2 decades of consideration, the definition of helper was restored, essentially, to its original meaning.

However, interest in restructuring the regulation dealing with helpers continued in the Congress.", "In the 107 th Congress on May 23, 2001, Representative Norwood again introduced legislation dealing with the helper issue (the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act,\" H.R. 1972 ). No action was taken in the 107 th Congress on the Norwood proposal.", "On June 2, 2003 (the 108 th Congress), Representative Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), with Representatives Norwood and Steve King (R-IA), introduced H.R. 2283 : again, the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act.\" The proposal mandated that helpers \"of laborers and mechanics shall be considered to be a separate classification\" for Davis-Bacon purposes and \"shall be paid the prevailing wage of helpers and laborers or mechanics employed on projects which are of a character similar\" to the project in question in the locality of the construction work.", "Under the Blackburn proposal, a \"helper\" was defined as \"a semi-skilled worker (other than a skilled journeyman mechanic)\" (a) who \"works under the direction of and assists a journeyman\" (b) who, \"under the journeyman's direction and supervision,\" assists the journeyman in a series of\u00a0specified tasks, and (c) who \"may use tools of the trade at and under the direction and supervision of the journeyman.\" The bill was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce and, subsequently, to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, but no action was taken on the proposal.", "On September 27, 2005 (the 109 th Congress), Representative Blackburn, with Representative Norwood, reintroduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunities Act\" ( H.R. 3907 ).

Thus far, the specific issue of helpers does not appear to have reemerged during the 110 th Congress\u2014though Davis-Bacon has frequently emerged."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Comment", "paragraphs": ["The Davis-Bacon Act had been subjected to substantive review by the Congress in the early 1960s and has remained a focus of public policy debate since that time: frequently the subject of congressional hearings, reports from GAO, and expressions of concern by the parties directly at interest: contractors and the building trades unions. The only major change in the act, however, that this oversight produced was the expansion of the concept of prevailing wage to include a fringe benefit component (1964).", "A new round of review of Davis-Bacon occurred in the late 1970s during the Carter Administration, resulting in rulemaking, a process that continued to the final days of the Carter Presidency and carried over into the Reagan Administration. The Carter regulations were withdrawn and, in 1981, new regulations were proposed. These dealt, in part, with the issue of helpers. Litigation followed. Portions of the proposed rule won court approval and, through the years, were implemented. The helper provision won such approval only in 1992, a decade after it was first proposed. At that point, Congress intervened and, through the appropriations process, blocked enforcement of the helper regulation until the middle of 1996.", "By that time, DOL was having second thoughts about the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon construction. The regulation, now, was simply not enforced. Indeed, DOL declared the regulation to be \"non-administrable\" and suspended it for further review. When the Associated Builders and Contractors sought a court order for enforcement of the regulation (summer 1996), the Department reopened the rulemaking process and, in December 1996, suspended implementation of the regulation until further notice. In so doing, DOL reverted to the status quo prior to the Reagan Administration: that is, to the late 1970s.", "In issuing its final (December 1996) suspension of the helper regulation, the Department indicated that new evidence had been developed that would make it advisable for the agency to reassess the basis upon which the original rule (and its subsequent amended editions) had been issued. During July 1997, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Department had acted appropriately in its withdrawal of the helper regulation. Then, on April 9, 1999, the Department published in the Federal Register notice of a new proposed rule. Essentially, the new rule would reinstate the Department's longstanding practice with respect to the use of helpers. A comment period was set, expiring after June 8, 1999. On November 20, 2000, the Department published its final helper rule which took effect on January 19, 2001, just hours before the end of the Clinton Administration.", "To this point, the process of defining appropriate wage treatment of helpers employed on Davis-Bacon projects had consumed over 2 decades. Through that period, the regulation had never fully been implemented, though through a brief period in the mid-1990s, implementation was allowed. Between 1981 and 1993, the Department defended, at times vigorously, different versions of its proposed administrative reforms. Then, after 1993, it began to reassess its position, becoming increasingly critical of its own earlier efforts. With publication of its new rule in April 1999, the Department would revert to its longstanding (1970s) practice where helpers were concerned. With the release of a final rule in November 2000, DOL would largely repudiate its helper policy of the 1980s and 1990s\u2014and the documentation upon which it was based.", "Congress had followed the administrative proposals dealing with the \"helper\" issue. Variously, it had entered into the debate and, at times, had endorsed the new helper classification. In the 109 th Congress, legislation ( H.R. 3907 ) was introduced by Representative Blackburn, with Representative Norwood, once again proposing recognition of a separate \"helper\" classification on Davis-Bacon projects. However, the Blackburn-Norwood bill died at the close of the 109 th Congress. To date, the issue has not reemerged in the 110 th Congress."], "subsections": []}]}}
