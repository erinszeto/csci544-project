The recent global economic downturn has renewed congressional debate over the role of the federal government in promoting exports. This debate has been heightened with the Obama Administration's efforts to double U.S. exports under the National Export Initiative (NEI) and policy debates about possible reorganization of federal trade-related agencies. Some Members of Congress have placed greater priority on understanding the functions, coordination, and budgets of federal agencies involved in export promotion. Such an understanding may support increased congressional oversight of export promotion policy and related legislative activity.", "Federal government agencies perform a wide variety of functions that contribute to export promotion, including providing information, counseling, and export assistance services; funding feasibility studies; financing and insuring U.S. trade; conducting government-to-government advocacy; and negotiating new trade agreements and enforcing existing ones.", "Approximately 20 federal government agencies are involved in supporting U.S. exports directly or indirectly. Nine key agencies with programs or activity directly related to export promotion are the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Commerce, Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank), Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), Small Business Administration (SBA), Department of State, Trade and Development Agency (TDA), Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and Department of the Treasury. The USDA has the largest level of export promotion funding, followed by Commerce. Some agencies charge fees for their services.", "Coordination of export promotion activities is conducted through interagency bodies. In 1992, Congress attempted to enhance coordination of U.S. export promotion policy by creating the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), an interagency task force chaired by the Department of Commerce. The TPCC releases the National Export Strategy (NES), an annual report that serves as an effort to guide federal export promotion policy, goals, and activity. Executive Order 13534, issued in March 2010, formalized the NEI and established the Export Promotion Cabinet, a higher level coordinating body that is to work with the TPCC to make the NEI operational.", "The export promotion activities of federal government agencies raise a number of issues for Congress; among the most prominent are the following:", "The economic arguments for and against the involvement of the U.S. government in promoting exports in the context of issues such as market failures and foreign governments' support for their national exports; The effectiveness of interagency export promotion coordination through the TPCC and the Export Promotion Cabinet; The level of U.S. government spending on export promotion; its adequacy and efficiency of use; and The extent to which the export promotion activities conducted by federal government agencies may be similar or overlapping, and could be reorganized."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In times of economic crisis, including the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and ensuing economic downturn, Congress often has debated on how best to promote U.S. commercial exports as a policy tool for economic growth and job creation.

The NEI is a strategy for doubling U.S. exports by 2014 in order to help generate 2 million new jobs in the United States through increased coordination and funding of federal export promotion activities; greater financing for U.S. exporters; increased government advocacy on behalf of U.S. exporters; and negotiation of new trade agreements and stronger enforcement of existing U.S. trade agreements.", "With the increased focus on export promotion efforts, some Members of Congress have placed greater priority on understanding the functions, coordination, and budgets of federal government agencies involved in export promotion. Such an understanding may support increased congressional oversight of U.S. export promotion policy and related legislative activity. It also may assist Members of Congress in supporting the efforts of their constituents to learn about federal export promotion services and to become involved in exporting. The 113 th Congress could conduct oversight and legislate on a range of export promotion issues.

Some of these services directly assist U.S. companies to overcome information and market entry barriers related to exporting. ", "Export assistance services: The U.S. government provides export assistance services, such as distribution of trade-related information to exporters, foreign country market research, and counseling to both new and seasoned exporters. The federal government also conducts business matchmaking services, including trade missions (official business development missions led by senior U.S. government leaders to foreign countries) and reverse trade missions (bringing foreign buyers to the United States to meet with U.S. firms). Key agencies that offer direct export assistance include the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Commerce, Department of State, Small Business Administration (SBA), and Trade and Development Agency (TDA). Feasibility studies: The U.S. government conducts feasibility studies, which evaluate the economic, financial, technical, and other aspects of proposed projects in foreign countries that may generate exports of U.S. goods and services. USDA and the TDA both conduct such studies. Export financing and insurance: U.S. government agencies may finance and insure U.S. exports to foreign countries for a number reasons, including (1) to assume commercial and political risks that exporters or private financial institutions are unwilling or unable to undertake alone; (2) to overcome maturity and other limitations in private sector export financing; and (3) to counter officially backed export credit financing offered to foreign exporters by their governments. USDA takes the lead on agricultural export financing, while the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is the lead agency for providing financing and insurance for non-agricultural exports. Export financing for small business exporters is available from the Ex-Im Bank and SBA. Related to exports also is the role of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) in financing and insuring U.S. private investment for projects overseas. For example, OPIC-supported investment in infrastructure projects in developing and emerging markets may lead to the sale of U.S. goods and services for these projects and in these markets more broadly. Government-to-government advocacy: In many situations, U.S. companies face direct competition from foreign enterprises with access to greater foreign financing, subsidies, and other forms of support from their governments. The United States may use diplomatic tools to advocate on behalf of U.S. companies to ensure that they can compete on a level playing field with foreign competitors in export markets. Key agencies involved in such efforts are the Departments of Commerce and State and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). ", "The federal government also promotes exports in broader ways, such as through negotiating new multilateral, regional, and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) and monitoring the implementation and enforcement of existing trade agreements. Such efforts work to address constraints, barriers, and unfair trade practices faced by U.S. exporters, including foreign countries' tariff and other import policies, export subsidies, inadequate protection of intellectual property rights, barriers to exports of services and foreign direct investment, and anti-competitive practices. They also help to develop foreign markets for U.S. goods and services. The lead agency in such efforts is the USTR. Other agencies, including the Departments of Commerce and State, also play a role in FTA negotiations and enforcement. ", "In addition, the U.S. government conducts activities that may help to promote exports indirectly. Government programs, such as OPIC, that are not charged directly with the promotion of U.S. exports may contribute to the expansion of exports through their activities.

These programs are authorized in farm bills, the most recent being the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ), which expired on September 30, 2012. \"Fiscal cliff\" legislation ( H.R. 8 , P.L. 112-240 ) extended the 2012 farm bill, including its provisions for export market development, through September 30, 2013, at funding levels in effect at the end of FY2012. Congress is expected to continue work on a five-year farm bill during 2013. ", "In addition to administering USDA's export market development programs, FAS also administers export credit programs that guarantee the commercial bank financing of up to $5.5 billion of U.S. agricultural exports annually and can make available export subsidies for dairy products. These authorities also were extended through the end of FY2013 by P.L. 112-240 . Finally, FAS provides information, counseling, and assistance to potential U.S. exporters of agricultural products.", "Funding levels for all of USDA's export promotion, export financing, and subsidy programs are specified in farm bills and financed through the borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) . They are thus not subject to annual appropriations, although such legislation has on occasion limited funding for these programs or placed other restrictions on their operation. ", "The Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP) aims to develop long-term export markets for U.S. agricultural products. FMDP funds are allocated each fiscal year mainly to non-profit U.S. agricultural and trade organizations that represent an entire industry or are nationwide in membership and scope. FMDP agreements with private organizations also are sometimes approved. FMDP promotes generic U.S. commodities, rather than brand-name products. Activities financed include consumer promotions, market research, technical assistance, and trade servicing. The 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) authorized funding of $34.5 million annually for each fiscal year from FY2008 through FY2012. \"Fiscal cliff\" legislation ( P.L. 112-240 ) continues FMDP funding at $34.5 million through FY2013.", "The Market Access Program (MAP) helps U.S. producers, exporters, private companies, and other trade organizations to finance promotional activities for U.S. agricultural products, both generic and branded products. Activities financed include consumer promotions, market research, technical assistance, and trade servicing. The 2008 farm bill made organic produce eligible for the program for the first time, and funds the program at $200 million each fiscal year from FY2008 through FY2012. \"Fiscal cliff\" legislation ( P.L. 112-240 ) continues MAP funding at $200 million through FY2013. ", "Both MAP and FMDP work in partnership with the private sector. Both reimburse program participants for a portion of the cost of carrying out overseas export promotions. One estimate is that government funding accounts for 37% of export promotion under these two programs while private sector funding accounts for 63%. ", "The Emerging Markets Program (EMP) funds technical assistance activities to promote exports of U.S. agricultural commodities and products to emerging markets. An emerging market is any country that \"is taking steps toward a market-oriented economy through the food, agriculture, or rural business sectors of the economy of the country,\" and \"has the potential to provide a viable and significant market for United States commodities or products of United States agricultural commodities.\" Activities funded by the EMP include feasibility studies, market research, sectoral assessments, orientation visits, specialized training, and business workshops. Funding is set at $10 million each fiscal year from FY2008 through FY2013.", "The Qua lity Samples Program (QSP) helps U.S. agricultural trade organizations provide small samples of their agricultural products to potential importers in emerging markets overseas. Focusing on industry and manufacturing, as opposed to end-use consumers, QSP allows manufacturers overseas to assess how U.S. food and fiber products can meet their production need best. Funding for QSP has averaged $2 million annually in recent years. ", "The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program is designed to assist U.S. organizations by providing funding for projects that address sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical barriers that prohibit or threaten the export of U.S. specialty crops. Examples of activities TASC may cover include seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys, pest and disease research, and pre-clearance programs. The 2008 farm bill authorized $9 million for TASC in FY2012. \"Fiscal cliff\" legislation ( P.L. 112-240 ) continues TASC funding at $9 million through FY2013.", "Separate from these programs, FAS makes available resources, products, and services to help companies explore the potential for international sales of agricultural products. FAS assists both beginning and experienced exporters, targeting especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). ", "USDA operates two export financing programs for U.S. agricultural exports\u2014the Export Credit Guarantee (GSM-102) Program and the Facilities Guarantee Program (FGP) . GSM-102 guarantees against defaults of commercial bank financing of agricultural commodity exports. FGP provides payment guarantees to facilitate the financing of manufactured goods and services exported from the United States to improve or establish agriculture-related facilities in emerging markets. FAS carries out these programs and finances them through the CCC. Both GSM-102 and the FGP are authorized in farm bills, again most recently in the 2008 farm bill. Financing of an estimated $5.5 billion of U.S. agricultural exports was guaranteed in FY2012 under GSM-102. (See Table 1 .) FAS also operates an export subsidy program, the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) , which allows exporters to sell certain U.S. dairy products in foreign markets at prices lower than the exporter's costs of acquiring them.", "In addition to USDA programs, U.S. agricultural exporters may receive help in financing the marketing and distribution of their products abroad through the SBA International Trade Loan Program, which provides financing for small businesses to expand their market or upgrade their facilities to improve their competitive position; the Ex-Im Bank, which operates loan, guarantee and insurance programs for exporters; and OPIC, which provides insurance for overseas investments.

ITA resources include (1) trade specialists in over 100 U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) and approximately 150 overseas offices; (2) industry experts and market and economic analysts; (3) market access experts; and (4) import policy and trade compliance analysts. The ITA is divided into four policy units and an Executive and Administrative Directorate. ", "The Trade Promotion and the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (Commercial Service) is the main trade promotion unit of ITA. It has trade specialists in 109 U.S. cities and in more than 75 countries who work with U.S. companies to help them get started in exporting or increasing sales in foreign markets. Its services include market research; trade events to promote U.S. products and services; introductions of qualified buyers and distributors in foreign countries to U.S. companies; and counseling and advocacy services throughout the export process. The Advocacy Center of this unit serves as an advocate for U.S. companies by assisting them in pursuing foreign business opportunities and dealing with foreign governments. It also has liaisons to five Multilateral Development Banks (World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, African Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank) to counsel U.S. companies on working with the Banks and on procurement and contracting issues.", "The Commercial Service, through its domestic network of trade specialists, leads U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs), which constitute a key component of support services provided by federal government agencies to U.S. exporters. USEACs are intended to serve as a \"one-stop shop\" for firms\u2014primarily SMEs\u2014that are new to exporting or want to expand their exporting activities. They provide export counseling, planning, and financing services, such as working with firms to identify target markets, to formulate marketing strategies, and to identify export financing options. In addition to the Commercial Service, the USEAC network also includes participation from the SBA, the Ex-Im Bank, and USDA. Through USEACs, the agencies work to coordinate their export education, promotion, and finance services to U.S. businesses. USEACs coordinate with Foreign Commercial Service posts that provide export assistance services. USEACs also work closely with non-federal export service providers, such as state agencies and world trade centers, to provide export assistance for U.S. businesses. USEACs are located in over 100 U.S. cities. Some USEAC services are free, while others are fee-based.", "The Commercial Service unit's role has expanded beyond export promotion. The Commercial Service houses the SelectUSA Initiative, a federal effort launched by President Obama on June 15, 2011 through Executive Order 13577 to coordinate inward investment promotion. Historically, U.S. inward investment promotion has been conducted largely at the state and local levels. As part of SelectUSA, Foreign Commercial Service officers in overseas markets now also promote opportunities to invest in the United States. ", "The Manufacturing and Services (MAS) unit works to strengthen the global competitiveness of U.S. industry, expand market access for U.S. businesses, and increase U.S. exports. As the research arm of ITA, the MAS undertakes industry economic and trade policy analysis, helps formulate U.S. trade policy, participates in trade negotiations, organizes trade capacity building programs, and evaluates the impact of U.S. and foreign regulations on U.S. manufacturing and service industries. The MAS works with other federal agencies, private sector partners, and Congress in developing a public policy environment to help advance the competitiveness of U.S. firms at home and abroad. ", "The Market Access and Compliance (MAC) unit monitors foreign country compliance with trade agreements with the United States, identifies compliance problems and market access obstacles, and informs U.S. firms of foreign business practices and opportunities. The MAC has country desk officers with expertise on the commercial, economic, and political climates in their assigned countries. The desk officers focus on resolving trade complaints and market access issues. ", "ITA has other functions, such as countering unfair foreign trade practices, in order to boost exports. The Import Administration (IA) unit is ITA's lead unit on enforcing trade laws and agreements. Its primary role is to enforce U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws and to develop and implement other policies and programs aimed at countering unfair foreign trade practices.", "ITA is playing a major role under the NEI's goal of boosting exports. It is increasing certain export promotion activities such as conducting trade missions, bringing foreign buyers to U.S. trade shows, and promoting foreign market access for U.S. companies. The ITA also has a New Market Exporter Initiative (NMEI), which works with the ITA's Strategic Partners to identify customers who sell to at least one international market and support those customers in expanding to additional markets. ITA's Strategic Partners include FedEx, UPS, and the U.S. Postal Service. The effort focuses on U.S. SMEs that already are familiar with exporting. ", "The Obama Administration requested an increase of 131 full time employees and $78.5 million through the end of 2014 for the NEI and proposed that the ITA support an agency-wide, comprehensive, multi-year export expansion strategy under the NEI. ITA's strategy is to focus on increasing U.S. exports to major emerging markets. The strategy also includes leading more trade missions, bringing more foreign buyers to U.S. trade shows, and providing more business-to-business matchmaking services to U.S. companies. In addition ITA will continue to assist U.S. companies in creating trade opportunities by identifying foreign buyers for their exports and by identifying and overcoming foreign trade barriers. ITA works with large and small businesses to help ensure that they benefit from U.S. trade agreements.", "The budget request for FY2013 for direct funding for ITA is $517 million, an increase of $57 million from the FY2012 estimated funding amount (See Table 2 ). In the 2012 State of the Union Address, the President called for the creation of a new trade enforcement unit to enhance U.S. capabilities to aggressively challenge unfair trade practices around the world, particularly in China. On February 28, 2012, President Obama issued Executive Order 13601 to establish a new Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC), for the purpose of strengthening and coordinating enforcement of U.S. rights under international FTAs and of U.S. trade laws. The Administration's FY2013 request for ITA includes an increase of $24.0 million to help create an ITEC for this purpose (see also USTR discussion).

Its main programs are direct loans, export credit guarantees, working capital guarantees, and export credit insurance, and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The Ex-Im Bank participates in the regional network of USEACs. The Bank operates under a renewable charter, the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended. Congress has authorized the Ex-Im Bank through FY2014 ( P.L. 112-122 ). The Ex-Im Bank charges fees for its services and collects interest on its loans.

The Ex-Im Bank estimated that its credit and insurance supported nearly $50 billion worth of U.S. exports in FY2012. The Ex-Im Bank also estimated that the exports supported by its financing were associated with 255,000 U.S. jobs in that year. While the Ex-Im Bank finances less than 5% of U.S. exports annually, a significant portion of its financing is for exports of capital-intensive U.S. goods. ", "Ex-Im Bank is a demand-driven agency. At the same time, Ex-Im Bank programs are subject to certain congressional directives. The Bank's charter requires it to make available not less than 20% of its aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance authority to finance exports directly by small business. The charter also requires the Bank to promote the export of goods and services related to renewable energy sources. In recent years, appropriations language further has specified the Bank should make available not less than 10% of its aggregate credit and insurance authority for the financing of exports of renewable energy technologies or energy efficient end-use technologies. The charter further directs the Bank to promote the expansion of its financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa, but does not include any quantitative target. In FY2012, the Ex-Im Bank continued to provide enhanced levels of financing to small business exporters and exporters of renewable energy exporters (see Table 4 ).", "Ex-Im Bank financing support must meet several other statutory and policy criteria. Congress requires that Ex-Im Bank projects have no adverse effect on U.S. industry. Chiefly, the Ex-Im Bank may not support projects that enable foreign production of an exportable good that would compete with U.S. production of a same, or similar, good and that would cause \"substantial injury\" to U.S. producers. The Ex-Im Bank also may not support projects that result in the foreign production of a good that is substantially the same as a good subject to specified U.S. trade measures, such as anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigations. In addition, the Bank places certain limits on the maximum amount of foreign content that can be included in the transactions it supports. The Ex-Im Bank is permitted to deny applications for credit for non-financial or non-commercial considerations only in situations where the President, after consultation with relevant congressional committees, determines that such action would be in the national interest and would advance U.S. policy in areas such as international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, environmental protection, and human rights.
