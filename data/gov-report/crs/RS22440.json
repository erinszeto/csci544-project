The funds would then be transferred to California's account within the UTF to reimburse California for those UCX benefit expenditures. ", "A former servicemember may receive a combined unemployment benefit (UC and UCX) if the unemployment benefit is based upon a period that included military service as well as other employment. In general, based upon each state's law, only the amount of the benefit that is attributable to military service would be charged to the agency.", "For FY2015, approximately $474 billion in unemployment benefits were distributed to former military personnel based upon military service.

UC eligibility criteria and benefits vary by state. Former servicemembers must meet the same criteria that civilian workers are required to meet for their UC benefit eligibility. Thus, two former servicemembers with the same earnings and work history may qualify for different amounts of benefits if they file for UCX in different states.

In the majority of states, a quit to follow a transferred spouse may be deemed a \"good personal\" cause and the newly unemployed worker may receive UC benefits. However, some state UC programs do not award UC benefits to workers who quit their jobs because a spouse was transferred, deeming this as a \"voluntary quit.\" The laws of the state may go further and include a specific disqualification for claimants who quit work to relocate with a spouse until certain additional income is generated. ", "The disqualification following a \"voluntary quit\" continues until the claimant returns to work, completes a specified duration of work, and earns wages of a specified amount. In other states, the disqualification is time-limited. These states penalize the worker for quitting, but recognize that economic conditions may be such that even a person who diligently seeks work may find none. The reasoning is that beyond a certain point, if a diligent job seeker is still unemployed, such continuing unemployment is attributable to labor market conditions rather than their decision to quit. Thus, spouses relocating to areas of high unemployment or limited opportunities may become eligible for benefits even if initially disqualified.", "Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow UC benefits if a worker quits to accompany a spouse who has been transferred regardless of military status (labeled \"Y\" in Table 2 ).

Generally, employers with a greater history of unemployed workers would have a worse experience rating and would pay higher state unemployment taxes. Military service of business owners or employees may impact the tax rate that certain employers face. Furthermore, if workers who quit to join a transferred military spouse receive UC benefits, this may impact the overall state unemployment tax burden of most, if not all, of the state's employers. Below are some examples of these situations:", "A business owner, if called up for active military service, may need to lay off some or all of the business's workers. Once the business owner returns from military service, the revival of the business may mean that the small business may face a new, higher state unemployment tax rate. If the servicemember serves for less than two years, some of the worker's UCX benefit may be based on nonmilitary work. (These workers receive a hybrid UC/UCX benefit.) In some states, their former (civilian) employers may face a state unemployment tax increase as a result. Workers who quit their jobs and move to accompany their military spouse may receive UC benefits in many states as listed in Table 2 . These states do not charge UC benefits to employer accounts when workers voluntarily quit their jobs to accompany a transferred military spouse. The benefits paid to a worker accompanying a military spouse generally would not increase the state unemployment taxes of the worker's former employer. However, these benefits are still charged to the state's account within the UTF. As a result, the cost of benefits is passed on to the state's employers as a socialized cost and may increase the overall state unemployment tax rate.", "States may choose to create provisions that remove or limit these tax increases in certain situations. For example:", "In Illinois, business owners who are called to active duty from the reserves and had to close their firms are not charged for the increases attributable to UC benefits for the workers who lose their jobs on account of the closure. When the business owner returns and reopens his or her business, the business's state unemployment tax rate is not increased.
