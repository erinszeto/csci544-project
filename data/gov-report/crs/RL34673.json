Some Members of Congress, citizens, and public administration scholars have argued that federal employee pay advancement should be more closely linked to job performance. With explicit congressional authorization enacted in 2003, the Department of Defense (DOD) created the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) as a unique pay scale attempting to more closely link employee pay to job performance.", "NSPS has been plagued by criticisms since it went into effect in 2006. The system has faced legal and political challenges from unions and employees who claim it is inconsistently applied and causes undeserved pay inequities, among other concerns.", "On October 7, 2009, House and Senate conferees reported a version of the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2010 that included language to terminate NSPS.

A supervisor and an employee who use NSPS are to work together to create an annual appraisal plan that accurately reflects an employee's performance. A supervisor then is to use the appraisal to evaluate the employee. At the end of each appraisal year, an employee may be assigned a percentage increase in pay based on his or her performance. These increases are called pay shares. Lower-performing employees may receive fewer pay shares or no pay shares. An employee must acquire at least a satisfactory performance rating to be eligible for any performance-based bonuses.", "This report reviews the creation of the NSPS, examines how NSPS operates, discusses litigation against it, and analyzes lessons that can be learned from NSPS as Congress decides whether to maintain the GS, create a new federal pay system, or modify existing ones.

Federal employees rise within grades in the GS pay scale based on performance and length of service. ", "The Department of Defense (DOD), however, operates a pay system called the National Security Personnel System (NSPS), which attempts to link pay increases more closely to employee performance without the use of grades or steps. NSPS is \"the first civilian alternate personnel system to be implemented on a broad basis, across an entire Executive Department,\" and DOD is \"the largest department in the Federal government.\" As of June 2009, DOD employed more than 717,000 civilian employees\u2014about 35.4% of federal civilian executive branch personnel worldwide.

Bush Administration assertions that the GS system was incapable of creating a responsive and flexible national security workforce. In April 2003, DOD sent a proposal, entitled \"The Defense Transformation for the 21 st Century Act,\" to Congress. The proposal recommended changing the statutory basis for much of DOD's civilian personnel system to create a \"more flexible, mission-driven system of human resources management\" that could \"adequately address the 21 st century national security environment.\" Many provisions in the DOD proposal were ultimately included in Title XI of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 ( P.L. 108-136 )\u2014including personnel flexibilities to create NSPS. The act made some DOD personnel policies more flexible than those governed by Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which includes most of the provisions governing civilian employees. The flexibilities, including the authority to eliminate pay grades and steps, gave DOD and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) officials the opportunity to design a pay system that attempted to more closely link employee performance to pay. The new system was to help the department \"develop a more flexible civilian personnel management system that would enhance [the department's] ability to execute [its] national security mission.\" ", "On June 2, 2003, shortly after DOD released its proposed changes in personnel flexibilities for NSPS, Senator Susan Collins, then-chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, introduced S. 1166 (108th Congress). The bill, entitled the National Security Personnel System Act, would have granted DOD additional pay flexibilities for its large civilian workforce. The bill was referred to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. On June 4, 2003, the committee conducted a hearing on the bill. Following the hearing, Senators George V. Voinovich and Thomas Carper asked then-Comptroller General David M. Walker to respond to several additional questions about DOD's ability to motivate and control its workforce. Walker's response, submitted on July 3, 2003, included the following comments:", "Based on our experience, while DOD's leadership has the intent and the ability to transform the department, the needed institutional infrastructure is not in place in a vast majority of DOD organizations.... In the absence of the right institutional infrastructure, granting additional human capital authorities will provide little advantage and could actually end up doing damage if the authorities are not implemented properly by the respective department or agency.", "The bill was reported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs on September 9, 2003, and was placed the Senate Legislative Calendar, but was not passed. Another bill that addressed DOD personnel, however, H.R. 1588 , was concurrently moving through the legislative process. H.R. 1588 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, set definitions and provided guidelines for a new DOD personnel system. The Senate passed the bill, as amended, by voice vote on June 4, 2003. Then-President George W. Bush signed the legislation on November 24, 2003, as P.L. 108-136 (117 Stat. 1392).", "P.L. 108-136 , among other things, authorized the director of OPM to \"establish, and from time to time adjust, a human resources management system for some or all of the organizational or functional units of the Department of Defense.\" The law protected employees' collective bargaining rights, and required that the system be \"fair, credible, and transparent\" and provide \"effective safeguards to ensure that the management of the system is fair and equitable and based on employee performance.\"", "DOD began transitioning employees to NSPS in 2006. The system has weathered several delays in its implementation, but currently covers 211,000 of DOD's civilian employees.", "On January 28, 2008, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 ( P.L. 110-181 ) was enacted. The law required the NSPS system to pay annual bonuses and supplements that are closer in value to those given GS employees. More specifically, the law required NSPS employees with satisfactory ratings to receive at least 60% of the annual pay increase given to GS employees, and ensured that all employees receive a pay supplement to keep pace with growing labor costs. Additionally, on May 22, 2008, DOD and the Office of Personnel Management jointly published proposed rules in the Federal Register that clarified NSPS labor-management regulations. The July 2009 Review of the National Security Personnel System performed by the Defense Business Board recommended DOD a \"reconstruction\" of NSPS, saying a \"'fix' could not address the systemic problems discovered\" during the review.

A March 12, 2004, letter from Senator Daniel Akaka to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, for example, urged DOD and OPM to jointly publish all proposals on the NSPS in the Federal Register and not as internal regulations in order to promote \"openness, transparency, public comment, and scrutiny of the details.\"", "Government Executive reported that Senator Edward Kennedy wrote to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and OPM Director Kay Coles James on November 19, 2004, to voice opposition to DOD's refusal to share the details of the new personnel plans with union officials representing DOD employees in advance of the publication of regulations in the Federal Register . Reportedly, DOD believed that to share its intentions would \"depart from the intent of the Administrative Procedure Act.\" Senator Kennedy, in a December 10, 2004, press release, also emphasized development of the new system \"in the most transparent way possible.\" According to the Senator:", "Congress gave the Department of Defense the authority to make major personnel changes affecting 700,000 defense employees, but only with the understanding that those changes would be made in consultation with representatives of the employees.

Although the current Federal personnel management system is based on important core principles, those principles are operationalized in an inflexible, one-size-fits-all system of defining work, hiring staff, managing people, assessing and rewarding performance, and advancing personnel. These inherent weaknesses make support of DoD's mission complex, costly, and ultimately risky. Currently, pay and the movement of personnel are pegged to outdated, narrowly defined work definitions; hiring processes are cumbersome; high performers and low performers are paid alike; and the labor system encourages a dispute-oriented, adversarial relationship between management and labor. These systemic inefficiencies detract from the potential effectiveness of the Total Force.

Each employee in the NSPS system is assigned to a career group, a pay band, and a pay schedule. Instead of the 15-step GS pay system, those who are in NSPS have pay bands that usually encompass a wider pay range than a single GS grade. The wider pay bands are designed to give managers greater flexibility to hire qualified employees at a higher rate of pay than they could under the GS scale, and to retain high-performing employees by increasing their pay at a faster pace than was possible under the GS scale. Pay bands, like GS grades, limit minimum and maximum pay rates. Unlike the GS scale's pay grades, pay bands do not have steps through which employees advance automatically with satisfactory job performance. Instead, in NSPS, funds formerly used to pay for within-grade, quality-step, and other increases in the general schedule are pooled and used to fund the pay increases determined at the end of the performance appraisal cycle.", "NSPS contains four career groups: Standard Career Group; Scientific and Engineering Career Group; Investigative and Protective Services Career Group; and Medical Career Group. According to DOD's NSPS website, \"[c]areer groups are sets of occupations that involve similar types of work and have similar career and pay progression patterns. Career groups are based on mission or function, nature of the work, qualifications or competencies, promotion or pay progression patterns, and relevant labor market features.\"", "Finally, NSPS has four pay schedules: Professional/Analytical; Technician/Support; Supervisor/Manager; and Student. And there are between two and four pay bands within each pay schedule. Pay schedules divide employees into groups by the \"types of work being performed, knowledge or skill level, and pay ranges.\" Because of the nature of career groups, some groups have higher starting salaries and higher salary caps than others. A Professional/Analytical employee, for example, has a higher salary cap than a Technician/Support employee. Most pay schedules have three pay bands: Expert; Journey; and Entry/Development.

The performance expectations in the plan \"shall support and align with the DoD mission and its strategic goals, organizational program and policy objectives, annual performance plans, and other measures of performance.\" These goals can be generalized across the department, or they can be specific to an individual employee. Performance elements can include knowledge of the department's standard operating procedures, specific goals or objectives, contributions to the department that are expected of the employee, and overall employee conduct and behavior. An employee is required to meet with his or her supervisor at least one time during his or her performance-appraisal period prior to a final evaluation. The interim evaluation is to \"acknowledge achievements and suggest areas for improvement, and provide meaningful dialogue and exchange of concerns.\" A supervisor is responsible for informing an employee which performance criteria are considered more important and may be weighted higher in his or her evaluation. A supervisor should also communicate \"measures of job objective accomplishment (quantitative, qualitative, timeliness).\" Performance expectations, or competencies, \"should be reviewed regularly,\" and \"[s]upervisors are encouraged to involve employees in the development of their job objectives and the identification of applicable contributing factors.\" Supervisors are encouraged to engage in continued dialogue with employees throughout the performance appraisal period, and to update individual performance plans as necessary.", "An employee has 24-hour online access to his or her performance plan through the Performance Appraisal Application (PAA) 2.0.

The DCPDS website also includes a conversion calculator for employees who are scheduled to transition from the GS to NSPS.", "At the end of the performance appraisal period, employees are encouraged to provide supervisors with a self assessment in each competency to \"better inform the rater of performance and contribution.\" Supervisors are to evaluate narratively each employee using the performance criteria, and then translate the narrative into a five-point numeric scale, with the lowest score of 1 and the highest of 5. When evaluating individual criteria, supervisors may choose to include a \"contributing factor\" that reflects \"the manner of performance important for the accomplishment of the job objective.\" Contributing factors include technical proficiency, critical thinking, cooperation and teamwork, communication, customer focus, resource management, and leadership. In general, no more than three contributing factors should be considered when evaluating a single criterion, and leadership should be considered when evaluating any supervisory element. Each contributing factor may be used to increase or decrease a competency's numeric rating by one point. For example, if the employee demonstrated critical thinking when performing a competency, his or her score for that criterion could rise from 3 to 4. In contrast, if the employee failed to use critical thinking, he or she would receive no additional point, or a supervisor may decide to take a point away from his or her numeric assessment, dropping a score from 3 to 2.

Each pay share represents a monetary value that is a predetermined percentage of pay that will be used to calculate performance-based pay increases. The amount of pay shares allocated to each employee reflects his or her numerical performance rating: the higher an employee's numeric rating, the more shares he or she is allocated. Employees with a performance rating of 1 or 2 are assigned no performance shares. The pay pool panel, which consists of DOD administrators and senior staff and assigns performance shares to employees, may award an employee with a rating of 3 either one or two shares; a rating of 4 can warrant three or four shares. An employee with a rating of 5 may receive either five or six performance shares.

The pay pool manager ensures that the pay performance shares are distributed in a legal and consistent manner. An employee who is at the maximum level of his or her pay band may receive his or her performance-based bonus as a one-time lump sum paid at the beginning of the following year. The lump sum does not count as basic pay, and is not included when calculating an employee's pension, life insurance, premium pay, or other retirement benefits.", "NSPS pay also includes a local market supplement (LMS), which functions much like locality pay or special rates on the GS scale. LMS is an \"additional payment to employees in specified local market areas, occupations, specializations, or pay bands.\" The supplements are used to attract certain employee expertise, bridge the difference in labor costs in the public or private sector, and provide additional pay to employees who work in a hazardous environment. LMSs are added to base salary, and, therefore, are included when calculating pension, life insurance, premium pay, and other retirement benefits. Employees must have been employed by the agency for at least 90 days and have a performance evaluation of 2 (\"Fair\") or higher to be eligible for the LMS increase.
