Three selected issue areas associated with technological convergence are regulatory jurisdiction, digital privacy, and data security. First, merging and integrating multiple technologies from distinct functional categories into one converged technology may pose challenges to defining regulatory policies and responsibilities. Determining oversight jurisdictions and regulatory authorities for converged technologies can become unclear as the boundaries that once separated single-function technologies blend together. A challenge for Congress may be in delineating which government agency has jurisdiction over various converged technologies. Defining policies that regulate technological convergence industry may not be simple or straightforward. This may further complicate how Congress oversees government agencies and converged industries due to blending boundaries of existing categories.", "Second, converged technologies collect and use personal and machine data which may raise digital privacy concerns for consumers. Data collection and usage are tied to digital privacy issues because a piece or aggregation of information could identify an individual or reveal patterns in one's activities. Converged or smart technologies leverage large volumes of data to try to improve the user experience by generating more tailored and anticipatory results.

Regulating technological convergence may entail policies for jurisdictional deconfliction, harmonization, and expansion to address blended or new categories of technology. One approach could be for Congress to define the role of federal government oversight of digital privacy and data security by introducing new legislation that comprehensively addresses digital privacy and data security issues or by expanding the current authorities of federal agencies. When considering new legislation or expanding the authorities of federal agencies, three potential policy decisions are (1) whether data privacy and data security should be addressed together or separately, (2) whether various types of personal data should be treated equally or differently, and (3) which agencies should be responsible for implementing any new laws."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Technological convergence, in general, refers to the trend or phenomenon where two or more independent technologies integrate and form a new outcome.

This broad, complex concept encompasses a wide range of technologies, including IoT and smart home devices. When a converged technology emerges, it often replaces single-function technologies or renders them obsolete. In this sense, technological convergence can be viewed as a progression or evolution of technology.", "A discussion of technological convergence in isolation is difficult because technological convergence is closely associated with media convergence and network convergence. Technological, media, and network convergences are interdependent, but each possesses subtle distinctions. These three terms are often used interchangeably, further complicating the discussion of an already complex topic. Figure 1 illustrates relationships between technological, media, and network convergences.", "Technological convergence : This occurs when the functions of different technologies are merged and interoperate as a single unit. A converged unit can typically process multiple types of media that correspond to each technology that merged. Technological convergence includes devices and systems that interface with end users. For example, a user interacts with converged devices, such as a smart television (TV), to access the contents that are distributed over a network. A smart TV has combined the functions of a traditional TV, a computer, and several other devices that used to have one specific purpose. In addition to displaying over-the-air broadcast TV channels, smart TVs interface with users to surf the internet, view photos taken from smartphones and stored in the \"cloud,\" display feeds from home security cameras connected to a network, play music, notify users of incoming calls and messages, and allow video teleconferencing. Smart TVs can process a variety of formats of media to perform multiple functions.", "Media convergence : This refers to content that is made available through multiple forms, formats, and access points. Media convergence proliferated as analog mediums of communication became digitized. For example, the contents on a newspaper used to be available only in print. The same content is currently available in both print and digital forms, as text, visual, and/or audio formats, and through multiple devices and platforms including social media. ", "Network convergence : This refers to a single network infrastructure that handles and distributes multiple types of media. Network convergence became prominent when telecommunications and information networks integrated; it became prevalent when mobile cellular communications incorporated access to the internet and made it widespread. For example, today's cable companies process information in forms of voice, video, and data on a single network and often offer their services as a bundle package (e.g., phone, television, and internet services). Similarly, cellular networks, which distribute information to and from mobile devices and fixed platforms, process voice, video, and data. ", "Prior to network, media, and technological convergences, a separate, independent network was dedicated to handling and distributing one particular type of media that was processed by a single-function device. For example, a telephone network distributed audio information (i.e., voice) between telephone handsets. A broadcasting network delivered video to television sets. Convergence removes such pairing (i.e., \"decouples\") between media, network, and device. Decoupling gives convergence its versatility, flexibility, and complexity.

The IoT is a system of devices that are connected to a network and each other, exchanging data without necessarily requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. In other words, IoT is a collection of electronic devices that can share information among themselves (e.g., smart home devices). The IoT possess all three characteristics of converged technologies: multiple functions, data collection and use, and ubiquitous access. Various categories of IoT include industrial Internet of Things, Internet of Medical Things, smart city infrastructures, and smart home devices.", "IoT industry is a growing market both globally and in the United States. According to some estimates, in 2018, the IoT retail market in the United States was almost $4 billion, and over 700 million consumer IoT devices were in use in 2017 in the United States. Figure 2 illustrates global revenue of the IoT from 2012 to 2018, according to Statista, a company that consolidates statistical data, based on information from IC Insights. In 2018, consumer IoT devices, such as wearable and connected smart home devices, generated over $14 billion globally. The connected cities category, or smart cities, was the largest (41%) of 2018 global IoT revenue. The industrial Internet of Things, such as smart factories, had the biggest growth in terms of global revenue between 2017 and 2018 among the different categories of the IoT. An estimate of various IoT markets by McKinsey also shows the industrial IoT as potentially increasing the most by 2025 compared to other IoT systems. The development, application, and usage of IoT will likely continue to grow with Fifth-Generation (5G) Technologies cellular service, which will allow a larger number of devices to be connected simultaneously to a network, supporting not only consumer but industrial use of IoT devices and systems. ", "IoT devices are used in many different fields and serve a variety of functions. The IoT encompasses a broad range of applications. Selected categories of IoT devices are discussed below.", "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT): Examples of commercial application of the IoT can be found in the manufacturing industry. Referred to as industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), networked machines in a production facility can communicate and share information to improve efficiency, productivity, and performance. The application of IIoT can vary significantly, from detecting corrosion inside a refinery pipe to providing real-time production data. Also, IIoTs can enable a variety of industries, such as manufacturing, chemicals, food and beverage, automotive, and steel, to transform their operations and potentially yield financial benefits. Currently in North America, there are more consumer IoT connections than IIoT connections, but this may change in the future. Incorporation of IIoT and analytics is considered by some as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).", "Internet of Medical Things (IoMT): Some experts project the use of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is increasing. IoMT devices, such as heart monitors and pace makers, collect and send a patient's health statistics over various networks to healthcare providers for monitoring, remote configuration, and preventions. In 2017, over 300 million IoT devices in the medical sector were connected worldwide, and, in 2018, over 400 million devices were connected. At a personal health level, wearable IoT devices, such as smart watches and fitness trackers, can track a user's physical activities, basic vitals, and sleeping patterns. In 2017, over 40 million fitness tracker IoT were in use in the United States.", "Smart Cities: IoT devices and systems in transportation, utilities, and infrastructure sectors may be grouped under the category of \"smart city.\" An example of utilities IoT in a smart city is \"smart\" grid and meters for electricity, water, and gas where sensors collect and share customer usage data to enable the central control system to optimize production and distribution to meet demand real-time. An example of transportation IoT in a smart city is fare readers and status trackers or locaters that interface across all public transportation platforms. Columbus, OH's winning proposal for the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Smart City Challenge of 2016, included connected infrastructure that interacts with vehicles, trip planning and common payment system across multiple transit system, and electric autonomous vehicles and shuttles.

These obligations are centered on a category of data called \"consumer\" \"nonpublic personal information\" (NPI), and generally relate to: (1) sharing NPI with third parties, (2) providing privacy notices to consumers, and (3) security NPI from unauthorized access.", "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): Under the HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has enacted regulations protecting a category of medical information called \"protected health information\" (PHI). These regulations apply to health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses (covered entities), as well as certain \"business associates\" of such entities. The HIPAA regulations generally speak to covered entities': (1) using or sharing of PHI, (2) disclosure of information to consumers, (3) safeguards for securing PHI, and (4) notification of consumers following a breach of PHI.", "Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA): The FCRA covers the collection and use of information bearing on a consumer's creditworthiness. FCRA and its implementing regulations govern the activities of three categories of entities: (1) credit reporting agencies (CRAs), (2) entities furnishing information to CRAs (furnishers), and (3) individuals who use credit reports issued by CRAs (users). In contrast to HIPAA or GLBA, there are no privacy provisions in FCRA requiring entities to provide notice to a consumer or to obtain his opt-in or opt-out consent before collecting or disclosing the consumer's data to third parties. FCRA further has no data security provisions requiring entities to maintain safeguards to protect consumer information from unauthorized access. Rather, FCRA's requirements generally focus on ensuring that the consumer information reported by CRAs and furnishers is accurate and that it is used only for certain permissible purposes.", "The Communications Act : The Communications Act of 1934 (Communications Act or Act), as amended, established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and provides a \"comprehensive scheme\" for the regulations of interstate communication. [T]he Communications Act includes data protection provisions applicable to common carriers, cable operators, and satellite carriers.", "Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA): The VPPA was enacted in 1988 in order to \"preserve personal privacy with respect to the rental, purchase, or delivery of video tapes or similar audio visual materials.\" The VPPA does not have any data security provisions requiring entities to maintain safeguards to protect consumer information from unauthorized access. However, it does have privacy provisions restricting when covered entities can share certain consumer information. Specifically, the VPPA prohibits \"video tape service providers\"\u2014a term that includes both digital video streaming services and brick-and-mortar video rental stores\u2014from knowingly disclosing [personally identifiable information] (PII) concerning any \"consumer\" without that consumer's opt-in consent. The VPPA does not empower any federal agency to enforce violations or the Act and there are no criminal penalties for violations, but it does provide for a private right of action for persons aggrieved by the Act.

However, \"ECPA's three acts also contain privacy obligations relevant to non-governmental actors. ECPA is perhaps the most compressive federal law on electronic privacy, as it is not sector-specific, and many of its provisions apply to a wide range of private and public actors.

As some commentators have observed, ECPA \"was designed to regulate wiretapping and electronic snooping rather than commercial data gathering,\" and litigants attempting to apply ECPA to online data collection have generally been unsuccessful.", "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA): The CFAA was originally intended as a computer hacking statute and is centrally concerned with prohibiting unauthorized intrusions into computers, rather than addressing other data protection issues such as the collection or use of data. Specifically, the CFAA imposes liability when a person \"intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains\u2026 information from any protected computer.\" A \"protected computer\" is broadly defined as any computer used in or affecting interstate commerce or communications, functionally allowing the statute to apply to any computer that is connected to the internet.", "Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act): The FTC Act has emerged as a critical law relevant to data privacy and security. As some commentators have noted, the FTC has used its authority under the Act to become the \"go-to agency for privacy,\" effectively filling in gaps left by the aforementioned federal statutes. While the FTC Act was originally enacted in 1914 to strengthen competition law, the 1938 Wheeler-Lea amendment revised Section 5 of the Act to prohibit a broad range of unscrupulous or misleading practices harmful to consumers. The Act gives the FTC jurisdiction over most individuals and entities, although there are several exemptions. For instance, the FTC Act exempts common carriers, nonprofits, and financial institutions such as banks, savings and loan institutions, and federal credit unions.", "Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA): Similar to the FTC Act, the CFPA prohibits covered entities from engaging in certain unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts. Enacted in 2010 as Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the CFPA created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent agency within the Federal Reserve System.

Converged technologies, such as IoT devices, offer the users ubiquitous access: access from anywhere, at any time, using any device. While this is an extremely convenient characteristic, it also poses cybersecurity concerns. Multiple access points equate to increased points or opportunities for potential exploitation by malicious actors. This is often described as increased attack vectors, or broadening attack surface, which is a sum of attack vectors. The same entry points a user may use for remote access can be exploited by an adversary to steal personal information. From the data security perspective, this is a tradeoff to consider between convenience and vulnerability. ", "Cybersecurity and physical security are directly linked through converged technologies. For example, when smart doors and smart locks are remotely controlled by a malicious actor through cyberattack, the physical security of that building also becomes compromised. The damage may not be limited to loss of digital content or information. Loss of personal data stored in the compromised location as well as personal security could be in jeopardy.

Not implementing strong encryption may be intentional due to associated benefits\u2014it usually keeps the cost low, increases battery life of devices, minimizes memory requirements, reduces device size, and is easier to use or implement. This means, not only is the attack vector increased, but a system is also easier to break into. IoT devices may be the most vulnerable points of a system targeted by malicious actors for exploitation.
