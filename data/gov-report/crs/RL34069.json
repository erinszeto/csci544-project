In the most general terms, technical assistance is a service assisting landowners and agricultural producers in conserving natural resources. Addressing natural resource concerns across different landscapes frequently requires multiple disciplines working together to provide a collective pool of conservation knowledge. The current federal framework for applying this conservation knowledge lies with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Several agencies within USDA support conservation technical assistance, however, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the federal lead.", "NRCS provides conservation technical assistance to producers through various programs using field staff located across the country. Some level of technical assistance is required for participation in all of USDA's conservation programs; however, there is no single overarching description of technical assistance for all programs. Similarly, there is no single method of providing technical assistance. The full scope of technical assistance is best understood by examining how it operates within each conservation program. Some see the lack of technical assistance as the foremost barrier to adoption of conservation practices and enrollment in federal conservation programs.", "While most technical assistance work is funded through annually appropriated programs, an increasing amount is funded through mandatory programs authorized through omnibus, multi-year, farm bills. The seemingly complex manner in which USDA implements and pays for technical assistance through its conservation programs has created general confusion on the subject. Congress continues to take interest in conservation technical assistance given its complexities and impact on the distribution of conservation financial assistance to producers.", "Technical assistance has been discussed extensively at congressional hearings on agriculture conservation. Producers, ranchers, environmentalists, and wildlife advocates continue to raise the issue of technical assistance and the need or desire for additional support. The question of which federal agency should be involved with administering technical assistance and how this relates to the administration of conservation programs continues to be of interest. The expanding use of non-federal, third party providers of technical assistance is also of interest, especially when addressing the demand for additional capacity without an expansion of the federal workforce. A broader perspective on technical assistance raises questions about the capacity of the current technical assistance structure as well as future limitations.", "Historically, technical assistance has evolved in the range of topics addressed; it currently addresses a wide variety of natural resource concerns. Recent farm bills have repeatedly added natural resource concerns to the conservation mission, leaving many to question whether the current technical assistance delivery system has retained the capacity to function effectively. Demands on available capital (both human and financial), combined with additional questions for technological capacity and an ever-expanding list of natural resource concerns, have generated an ongoing discussion in the current congressional debate."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Agricultural conservation technical assistance has taken on a number of dimensions over its long and continuously evolving history. Congress continues to take interest in conservation technical assistance given its complexities and impact on the distribution of conservation financial assistance to producers. Frequently, technical assistance for agriculture is discussed in the context of omnibus farm legislation (referred to as farm bills), although most technical assistance is discretionary and funded through the annual agricultural appropriations bill rather than mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill. Questions concerning the current and future capacity of the technical assistance system are highlighted by a perceived lack of boundaries and understanding of what technical assistance is and is not. One challenge for Congress lies in finding an acceptable balance between how much technical assistance capacity currently exists and how much is needed to meet demand. In the search for this balance many policy questions arise regarding what technical assistance is and does, especially in the areas of funding and implementation. This report does not attempt to directly answer these questions, but rather provides a framework for the debate.", "This report describes the past progressions that made conservation technical assistance what it is today, and also poses questions on where it might be headed in the future.

It is a basic service that provides conservation knowledge to producers and landowners. It includes information, technical expertise (e.g., engineering, biological, etc.), and a delivery system for assisting landowners and users to conserve and use natural resources. In broader terms it involves outreach, education, and training in practices and technological advances that create compatibility between production and the land. Perceptions of technical assistance vary by region, land use type, accessibility, and individual stewardship. Technical assistance is considered by some to be science-based and therefore subject to the continuous progression of advances in the field. By this definition, inflexibility and static change is undesirable. Others view conservation technical assistance as limited to preparing a conservation plan. The scientific underpinnings add to the stability of the plan; however, without additional follow-through this definition remains narrow, implying that technical assistance is just a plan, and nothing more. Increasingly, this service is not only provided through the federal government by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), but also by other public and private experts.", "NRCS is the current federal provider of technical assistance for agriculture conservation. The statutory authority to provide conservation technical assistance is derived from the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-46; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7590 et seq.). NRCS provides technical assistance at the request of the landowner to conserve and improve natural resources. It includes technical expertise combined with knowledge of local conditions and is provided through a network of federal staff located throughout the United States. Although the 1935 act provided authority for technical assistance it was not until an amendment under the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 farm bill, P.L. 110-246 ) that conservation technical assistance was defined in statute. Through this amendment, technical assistance is currently defined by law as: ", "\"(2) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.\u2014", "\"(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The term 'technical assistance' means technical expertise, information, and tools necessary for the conservation of natural resources on land active in agricultural, forestry, or related uses.", "\"(B) INCLUSIONS.\u2014The term 'technical assistance' includes\u2014", "\"(i) technical services provided directly to farmers, ranchers, and other eligible entities, such as conservation planning, technical consultation, and assistance with design and implementation of conservation practices; and", "\"(ii) technical infrastructure, including activities, processes, tools, and agency functions needed to support delivery of technical services, such as technical standards, resource inventories, training, data, technology, monitoring, and effects analyses.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Assistance Funding and Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Technical assistance is funded through virtually every USDA mandatory and discretionary conservation program.

Funding for mandatory conservation programs is provided at the level authorized in law unless limited to a smaller amount during the appropriations process.

CTA also funds many of NRCS's collaborative research and data collection projects, such as the Natural Resources Inventory (NRI), which tracks natural resource conditions and trends on non-federal land in the United States. CTA also funds compliance status reviews under highly erodible cropland compliance and wetlands compliance provisions and was funded at close to $756 million in FY2010 ( Figure 1 ). ", "The second-largest activity conducted under CO is the Soil Survey program, which maintains an inventory of the soil resources on all U.S. land. This information is publically available and is utilized by not only agricultural interests but increasingly by developers and planners, as well as the transportation industry. Scientists are using soil survey information in studying climate change and evaluating the environmental impacts of land use and management practices.", "Other discretionary programs include four watershed programs (Watershed Surveys & Planning, Watershed & Flood Prevention Operations, Watershed Rehabilitation, and Emergency Watershed Protection) that provide technical assistance using various approaches to watershed planning, local coordination efforts, and flood prevention structures. Most watershed program funding is provided as financial assistance through contracts with local partners. The watershed programs were largely created in the 1940s and 1950s in response to flood control and water quantity concerns. Reduced appropriations and an increasing number of congressional earmarks have reduced program support within recent administrations. Congress, however, continues to fund many of these programs through annual appropriations.", "The Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) Program is another discretionary program that establishes or improves coordination systems in rural areas for the development and utilization of natural resources. Funding for the RC&D program largely provides staff support for local RC&D councils across the United States. Very little, if any, financial assistance is provided though this program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Assistance for Mandatory Programs", "paragraphs": ["Unlike discretionary programs, mandatory programs derive their funding authority from legislation that specifies an annual amount, unless reduced in the appropriations process.

", "Conservation program advocates prefer mandatory funding to discretionary because supporters believe that it is easier to protect mandatory funding levels than it is to protect spending subject to annual appropriations. Discretionary funding for agriculture conservation technical assistance has remained relatively constant in recent years compared to mandatory funding, which continues to increase. The 2008 farm bill provided much of this increase in mandatory conservation funding and continues to shift NRCS staff from technical assistance funded though discretionary programs to those funded through mandatory programs. Despite this shift, discretionary funding still remains the larger source of technical assistance funding ( Figure 2 ). ", "Most technical assistance activities within mandatory programs are in support of delivering some level of financial assistance as part of a contract or agreement. These activities could include providing designs, standards, and specifications needed to install scheduled conservation practices and activities. According to NRCS policy, all technical assistance prior to a producer entering into a contract for financial assistance is considered to be part of CTA.

In late 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that technical assistance funding for mandatory programs was limited by a cap established in Section 11 (15 U.S.C. 714i) of the CCC Charter Act and enacted in the 1996 farm bill.", "In the mid-1990s, the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which manages the operations of the farm commodity support programs, began to utilize CCC funding for large computer expenditures. These purchases were met with criticism for being too expensive and outdated. An amendment to the CCC Charter Act was made in the 1996 farm bill that limited the amount of funds that could be transferred for reimbursement of administrative expenses, referred to as the \"Section 11 cap.\" The 1996 amended language states that \"the total amount of all allotments and fund transfers from the Corporation under this section (including allotments and transfers for automated data processing or information resource management activities) for a fiscal year may not exceed the total amount of the allotments and transfers made under this section in the fiscal year 1995.\" While this cap was not specifically directed toward NRCS and technical assistance, the agency was affected because FSA had been reimbursing NRCS for technical assistance provided in support of the Conservation Reserve Programs (CRP) and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), both funded through the CCC.", "In late 2002, following the enactment of the 2002 farm bill, OMB determined that the Section 11 cap was still in effect, and used it to limit technical assistance funding within mandatory conservation programs. OMB was supported in an opinion by the Department of Justice, which stated that CO appropriations (discretionary funds) could fund technical assistance for farm bill programs (mandatory funds). Congress disagreed with this determination, believing that the language it had added in the 2002 farm bill allowed for technical assistance for each program to be funded out of allocations for each program. Congress was supported by a Government Accountability Office (GAO, then known as the General Accounting Office) opinion stating that USDA improperly obligated CO appropriations to fund technical assistance for farm bill programs.", "For three years following these opinions, the President's budget included a proposal to fund farm bill program technical assistance through a new separate account using annual appropriations. Congress rejected these proposals and prohibited using any discretionary CO appropriations for technical assistance to implement mandatory farm bill program technical assistance. The combination of this congressional prohibition and OMB's opinion on the Section 11 cap led to the \"shifting\" of funds for technical assistance between mandatory programs, thereby reducing the amount of financial assistance funding available in the \"donor\" programs. In FY2003, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), authorized at $700 million, used $145 million for technical assistance. However, technical assistance shortfalls in other programs led to the shifting of more than $107 million in additional technical assistance funding from EQIP to those programs, thereby reducing the available EQIP financial assistance funding to $442 million. The Farmland Protection Program (FPP), Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) shifted a total of $50 million to other programs in FY2003.", "In late 2004, Congress addressed the funding situation with a new law ( P.L. 108-498 ) requiring technical assistance for each mandatory program to be paid from funds provided to that program each year. It prohibits the use of discretionary program funds for technical assistance in mandatory programs, and the transfer of funds among mandatory programs.", "Despite the P.L. 108-498 amendment and the enactment of the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ), the issue of whether CCC funds could be used for technical assistance remained. Congress again addressed it, this time through section 103 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act, P.L. 111-5 ). The Recovery Act states that CCC funds may be used \"for the purpose of covering salaries and related administrative expenses, including technical assistance, associated with the implementation of the program, without regard to the limitation on the total amount of allotments and fund transfers contained in section 11\" of the CCC Charter Act. The provision only applies to FY2009 and FY2010 and does not include activities under Title I of the 1985 farm bill, as amended.

NRCS uses a model (referred to as the cost of programs model) to estimate the total cost of technical assistance necessary to administer each mandatory program. This model came under scrutiny by GAO in 2004, when it reported the model's inaccuracies in estimating technical assistance costs. According to GAO, these inaccuracies were a result of delays in technical assistance work, the inclusion of external costs not reported in actual costs, and inaccurate assumptions. In 2006, NRCS conducted a national update to more accurately ascertain the true workload cost of providing technical assistance, called Activity Based Costing (ABC) data. These data were collected at national, state, and county levels.", "Though NRCS uses the updated model to estimate the level of technical assistance funding needed for each program, the agency does not have total control in determining the actual level of funding provided for technical assistance. Instead, this level is set nationally by an OMB apportionment. After NRCS receives an apportionment, the funding available for both financial and technical assistance is allocated to NRCS state offices. The NRCS State Conservationist is then responsible for administering the state allocation. In FY2009, technical assistance funding for mandatory programs was distributed to states, by program, using the formulas unique to each program.

It was not until the 1990s that NRCS assumed greater responsibility in USDA's financial assistance programs for conservation. As part of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-354 ), USDA was reorganized. On October 13, 1994, through a USDA memorandum (1010-1) the Soil Conservation Service was renamed the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The newly created NRCS also received responsibility for the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Water Bank, Colorado River Basin Salinity Control, and Forestry Incentives programs from the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (now known as the Farm Service Agency). While leadership for these programs transferred to NRCS, the function of making payments to program participants remained with FSA.", "Following enactment of the 1996 farm bill ( P.L. 104-127 ), NRCS became responsible for administering the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), a combination of several financial assistance programs. NRCS was given the leadership role for the financial as well as the technical aspects of the conservation programs, including developing the type of practices available, assisting producers with preparation of applications, ranking applications, and checking on installation of practices.

It was not until the enactment of the 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) that NRCS became responsible for most of the conservation programs under the conservation title, including payment responsibility. FSA retained the administration of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), with NRCS continuing to provide technical assistance; administration of the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) was split between NRCS and FSA.

The first type is when congressional language dictates the specific amount of technical assistance funding and for what purpose. For example, in FY2010 the manager's report directed technical assistance funding for the NRCS plant materials center in Hawaii. A second type is similar to the first, but it directs financial assistance funding to specific projects. These directives are seen more in the watershed programs. For example, in FY2010, congressional language directed over $5.5 million in Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations program funding to specific watershed projects located in West Virginia. A third type is what the Administration calls \"pass-through\" funding, in which the agency is directed to enter into agreements with specific external entities (ranging from non-profits to state or local governments) for congressionally specified amounts. These funds are not used for technical assistance provided by NRCS and are therefore passed through directly to the external entity.

Conservation Operations (CO) had seen an increase in congressional directives between FY2001 and FY2006, but they have leveled off in recent years (see Figure 3 ). CO contains the largest number of pass-through directives and the highest level of funding directed.

As local soil conservationists (employees of NRCS) were placed throughout the country, usually at the county level in conservation district offices, materials and handbooks were developed to provide guidance across disciplines. This guidance, known as the field office technical guide, contains technical information about the conservation of soil, water, air, and related plant and animal resources tailored to each county.

When the federal agriculture conservation effort was limited primarily to soil erosion control and water supply, technical assistance was limited in the number of resource concerns addressed as well as funding. Technical assistance has expanded in both scope and funding recently, and has been brought to the forefront of the debate for both implementation and funding levels. How this process evolved is discussed below.", "Federal Conservation Assistance", "Not until the 1930s and the occurrence of the Dust Bowl did soil conservation become a national priority. On August 25, 1933, through the use of public works program funding, the Department of the Interior (DOI) created the Soil Erosion Service. In March 1935, the President ordered Soil Erosion Service moved to the USDA.", "The severity of soil erosion at the time helped gain congressional support for the passage of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (P.L. 74-46, 49 Stat. 163) in April 1935, establishing the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) within the USDA. The SCS was established for the purpose of providing \"permanently for the control and prevention of soil erosion and thereby to preserve natural resources, control floods, prevent impairment of reservoirs, and maintain the navigability of rivers and harbors, protect public health, public lands and relieve unemployment.\"", "Following the enactment of the 1935 legislation creating the SCS, most of the services provided to landowners were through demonstration projects. Agreements (usually five years in length) were entered into with landowners who agreed to contribute access to their land, labor, and some resources in exchange for following a conservation plan. The SCS provided technical assistance, materials, labor (using the Civilian Conservation Corps and Emergency Conservation Work camps). The overlapping mission with other federal and state agencies (the Extension Service and land grant universities in particular) and limited landowner buy-in forced the USDA to look toward more localized entities to carry out these demonstrations. This brought about the establishment of the soil conservation districts.", "Model state legislation to create and operate districts was presented to state governors in February 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who encouraged adoption. This level of interest directly from the President highlights the significant level of political support for soil conservation during this time. In 1937, twenty-two states passed legislation creating districts. Following the creation of these districts, SCS increasingly concentrated on providing technical assistance to farmers through these new local entities. The current role of Conservation Districts is discussed in the \" Outlook for Technical Assistance \" section, above.", "Expansion of Technical Assistance", "The SCS mission has expanded beyond soil erosion and conservation assistance through multiple legislative and administrative mandates. The focus of conservation technical assistance has shifted with changes in national priorities. Technical assistance has fluctuated between addressing a limited number of resources and most or all natural resources on agricultural lands.", "Small Watershed Programs (P.L. 83-566)", "The addition of water resources as a technical assistance responsibility added to the scope of SCS functions. The enactment of the Flood Control Act of 1936 (P.L. 74-738) authorized SCS to measure, study, and plan run-off and erosion prevention activities in selected watersheds through technical assistance. The Flood Control Act of 1944 (P.L. 78-534) and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-566) expanded the watershed program to include not only the traditional planning function created in the 1936 act but also added financial assistance funding for projects. These projects involved a holistic approach to watershed planning and included a multi-disciplinary team consisting of a wide range of technical experts (e.g., geologists, hydrologists, engineers, economists, etc.). SCS provided this technical assistance and federal support through a coordination role. Local communities were expected to provide land rights and maintenance responsibility upon project completion. Projects were intended to treat the whole watershed, thereby providing benefits beyond flood control and prevention, including drainage, recreation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife enhancement, irrigation, and water quality protection.", "Compliance", "Provisions in the 1985 farm bill ( P.L. 99-198 ) dramatically changed technical assistance functions and responsibilities. It authorized conservation compliance (commonly referred to as sodbuster) and wetlands compliance (commonly referred to as swampbuster) regulations, transforming many technical assistance functions that SCS historically performed by requiring enforcement of conservation under certain circumstances. Sodbuster prohibits participation in numerous specified USDA programs when annually tilled commodity crops are produced on highly erodible land (HEL) without adequate erosion protection. Swampbuster provisions prohibit participation in numerous specified USDA programs when annually tilled commodity crops are produced, or land is drained to make production possible, on certified wetlands. SCS had, and NRCS (successor to SCS) continues to have, primary responsibility for providing technical assistance for determining whether land should be classified as highly erodible or a wetland. This task of certifying and determining cropland across the country required time and shifted resources away from the whole-farm planning approach to a narrower focus on soil erosion. Whereas the conservation technical assistance movement had begun with the Dust Bowl and soil erosion, over time it had broadened and expanded to include other resource concerns. With the emergence of conservation compliance much of the focus had moved back to an old issue, soil erosion (and a new one, wetlands).", "New Name, Expanded Responsibilities", "The 1990s brought about a new trend in technical assistance, linking financial incentives to technical assistance in many new ways. Traditionally, technical assistance provides the planning, design, and technical consultation functions, while financial assistance offers monetary support for implementation capacity. In 1994, national priorities changed and the Soil Conservation Service was reorganized by Congress as part of an overall reorganization of USDA. Its name was changed to reflect its expanded responsibilities; the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Also, NRCS assumed additional responsibilities for administration and leadership of some conservation programs from FSA. One such program was the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), which expanded technical assistance responsibility into easement management. Authorized in the 1990 farm bill, the WRP purchases long-term or permanent easements and funds restoration on wetlands. Following the 1996 farm bill, NRCS became responsible for administering the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), a combination of several financial assistance programs. Following the 2002 farm bill, NRCS became responsible for not only technical assistance and the administration of many conservation programs, but also for making payments on contractual agreements. Along with this additional increase in responsibility and an expanding list of natural resource concerns came a significant increase in funding authority.", "Appendix B.

Changes in the 2008 farm bill to FWP are expected to increase technical assistance costs because constructed wetlands are considerably more expensive than other conservation practices. This, in addition to the general signup (number 39) in FY2010 and another possible signup in FY2011, could increase the amount of technical assistance from NRCS and increase reimbursements from FSA.", "Grassland Reserve Program (GRP)", "The Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) is different from CRP in that functions of the program are not split along financial and technical assistance lines.
