Identity theft is one such crime. In 2012, about 12.6 million Americans were reportedly victims of identity fraud, and the average identity fraud victim incurred a mean of $365 in costs as a result of the fraud. Identity theft is often committed to facilitate other crimes such as credit card fraud, document fraud, or employment fraud, which in turn can affect not only the nation's economy but its security. Consequently, in securing the nation and its economic health, policymakers are also tasked with reducing identity theft and its impact.", "Identity theft has remained the dominant consumer fraud complaint to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Nevertheless, while the number of overall identity theft complaints generally increased between when the FTC began recording identity theft complaints in 2000 and 2008, the number of complaints decreased in both 2009 and 2010 before rising in 2011 and 2012. Identity theft case filings and convictions peaked in 2007 and 2008, and have generally declined since. Aggravated identity theft case filings and convictions, on the other hand, have largely continued to increase since aggravated identity theft was added as a federal offense in 2004.", "Congress continues to debate the federal government's role in (1) preventing identity theft and its related crimes, (2) mitigating the potential effects of identity theft after it occurs, and (3) providing the most effective tools to investigate and prosecute identity thieves. With respect to preventing identity theft, one issue concerning policymakers is the prevalence of personally identifiable information\u2014and in particular, the prevalence of Social Security numbers (SSNs)\u2014in both the private and public sectors. One policy option to reduce their prevalence may involve restricting the use of SSNs on government-issued documents such as Medicare identification cards. Another option could entail providing federal agencies with increased regulatory authority to curb the prevalence of SSN use in the private sector. In debating policies to mitigate the effects of identity theft, one option Congress may consider is whether to strengthen data breach notification requirements. Such requirements could affect the notification of relevant law enforcement authorities as well as any individuals whose personally identifiable information may be at risk from the breach. Congress may also be interested in assessing the true scope of data breaches, particularly involving government networks.", "There have already been several legislative and administrative actions aimed at curtailing identity theft. Congress enacted legislation naming identity theft as a federal crime in 1998 (P.L. 105-318) and later provided for enhanced penalties for aggravated identity theft (P.L. 108-275). In April 2007, the President's Identity Theft Task Force issued recommendations to combat identity theft, including specific legislative recommendations to close identity theft-related gaps in the federal criminal statutes.

Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint data indicate that the most common fraud complaint received (18% of all consumer fraud complaints) is that of identity theft. In 2012, for instance, about 12.6 million Americans were reportedly victims of identity fraud. This is an increase from the approximately 11.6 million who were victimized in 2011 and 10.2 million who were victimized in 2010.

Nonetheless, this cost is about 42% less than the average expense roughly a decade ago.", "An increase in globalization and a lack of cyber borders provide an environment ripe for identity thieves to operate from within the nation's borders\u2014as well as from beyond. Federal law enforcement is thus challenged with investigating criminals who may or may not be operating within U.S. borders; may have numerous identities\u2014actual, stolen, or cyber; and may be acting alone or as part of a sophisticated criminal enterprise. In addition, identity theft is often interconnected with various other criminal activities. These activities range from credit card and bank fraud to immigration and employment fraud. In turn, the effects felt by individuals and businesses who have fallen prey to identity thieves extend outside of pure financial burdens; identity thieves affect not only the nation's economic health, but its national security as well.

For example, identity theft may make possible crimes such as bank fraud, document fraud, or immigration fraud, and it may be aided by crimes such as theft in the form of robbery or burglary. Therefore, one of the primary challenges in analyzing the trends in identity theft (e.g., offending, victimization, or prosecution rates)\u2014as well as the policy issues that Congress may wish to consider\u2014arises from this interconnectivity between identity theft and other crimes.

It is implemented pursuant to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions (FACT) Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-159 ). The FACT Act amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) by directing the FTC, along with the federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration, to develop Red Flags guidelines. These guidelines require creditors and financial institutions with \"covered accounts\" to develop and institute written identity theft prevention programs. According to the FTC, the identity theft prevention programs required by the rule must provide for", "identifying patterns, practices, or specific activities\u2014known as \"red flags\"\u2014that could indicate identity theft and then incorporating those red flags into the identity theft prevention program; detecting those red flags that have been incorporated into the identity theft prevention program; responding to the detection of red flags; and updating the identity theft prevention program periodically to reflect any changes in identity theft risks. ", "Possible \"red flags\" could include", "alerts, notifications, or warnings from a consumer reporting agency; suspicious documents; suspicious personally identifiable information, such as a suspicious address; unusual use of\u2014or suspicious activity relating to\u2014a covered account; and notices from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other businesses about possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts.", "The deadline for creditors and financial institutions to comply with the Red Flags Rule was originally set at November 1, 2008. However, many of the organizations affected by the Red Flags Rule were not prepared to institute their identity theft prevention programs by this date. Therefore, the FTC moved the deadline to May 1, 2009, further extended the compliance date to November 1, 2009, and later to June 1, 2010. The final enforcement date was set at December 31, 2010, and this last extension was, in part, a result of the debate over whether Congress wrote the FACT Act Red Flags provision too broadly by including all entities qualifying as creditors and financial institutions (discussed further below).", "The effect that the Red Flags Rule will have on the prevalence of identity theft remains uncertain. One potential effect is that the Red Flags Rule may help creditors and financial institutions prevent identity theft by identifying potential lapses in security or suspicious activities that could lead to identity theft. This could possibly lead to an overall decrease in the number of identity theft incidents reported to the FTC, as well as the number of identity theft cases investigated and prosecuted. Once detected, the Red Flags Rule requires that the creditor or financial institution respond to the identified red flag. One response option that creditors and financial institutions might include in their prevention programs is to notify consumers or law enforcement of data breaches that could potentially lead to the theft of consumers' personally identifiable information. While notification is not a required element in the identity theft prevention programs, early notification could lead to consumers taking swift action to prevent identity theft or mitigate the severity of the damage that could result if they had not been notified as quickly. ", "When the Red Flags Rule was created, the FTC originally estimated that it would impact approximately 11.1 million creditors and financial institutions required to implement the identity theft prevention programs. The FTC estimated the total annual labor costs (for each of the first three years the rule is in effect) for all creditors and financial institutions covered by the rule to be about $143 million. Some entities considered creditors or financial institutions under the rule expressed concern that the burden of the rule overlaps with burdens already incurred under other regulations. For example, the American Bar Association (ABA) questioned whether lawyers are considered \"creditors\" under the Red Flags Rule because they generally do not require payment until after services are rendered. Further, the American Medical Association indicated that physicians should be exempt from the Red Flags Rule because of patient privacy and security protections required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In addition, there may have been concern that to avoid being considered creditors, some physicians could possibly require full payment at the time of service (rather than allowing deferred payments). This could in turn lead to some patients avoiding potentially necessary treatment if they are unable to pay in full at the time of service; on the other hand, the rule may have no effect on patients' willingness to seek medical treatment. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-319 ) limited the Red Flags Rule's definition of a creditor, excluding any creditor \"that advances funds on behalf of a person for expenses incidental to a service provided by the creditor to that person.\" This legislation did not exempt any broad categories of businesses or entities, but the majority of businesses in certain categories\u2014such as physicians\u2014would be exempt from Red Flags Rule compliance. Any actual effects of the Red Flags Rule\u2014including effects on identity theft rates as well as any indirect consequences\u2014have not yet been evident. Congress may consider monitoring the effects of the impending Red Flags Rule on subsequent identity theft rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trends in Identity Theft", "paragraphs": ["A number of studies have aimed to measure the prevalence of identity theft. Due to a number of factors, including a lack of a consistent definition of identity theft victimization across studies and differing survey populations, there is not a clear understanding of the true scope of identity theft in the United States. For instance, a Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) study estimates that 16.6 million U.S. residents were victims of at least one identity theft incident. Another study by Javelin Strategy & Research estimates that in 2012, about 12.6 million Americans were victims of identity theft; this is an increase from the approximately 11.6 million estimated to have been victimized in 2011. ", "In addition to survey research on identity theft victimization, trends in consumer complaints of victimization provide additional insight into the issue. Similar to the increase in estimated victimization exhibited in surveys, consumer complaints of identity theft to the FTC exhibited a corresponding increase. The FTC received 369,132 consumer complaints of identity theft in 2012, up from 279,156 complaints in 2011. Nonetheless, identity theft incidents reported to the FTC remain a fraction of the estimated victim population. There is a noted difference between the 369,132 complaints received by the FTC in 2012 and survey data indicating that between 12.6 million and 16.6 million people may have actually been victimized. This disparity between research on identity theft victimization and consumer reports could be a result of several factors. For one, while some identity theft victims may file a report with the FTC, others may file complaints with credit bureaus, while still others may file complaints with law enforcement. Not all victims, however, may file complaints with consumer protection entities, credit reporting agencies, and law enforcement. Another possible factor contributing to the disparity is that victims may not\u2014for any number of reasons\u2014report an identity theft incident. These individuals, however, may be more likely to indicate the incident on a survey prompting them about their experiences with identity theft or fraud.", "Since the FTC began recording consumer complaint data in 2000, identity theft has remained the most common consumer fraud complaint.

Consequently, these investigations may be reported by each participating agency. If the total number of reported investigations from each agency were combined, it is likely that the overall number of identity theft investigations would be inflated because of double (or more) reporting of an investigation from multiple agencies.

One possibility is that there has been a decrease in the overall number of actual identity theft incidents, and law enforcement has been responding proportionally by arresting fewer identity thieves and filing fewer cases with the U.S. Attorneys' Offices. However, research indicating that the number of individuals victimized by identity thieves is actually continuing to increase, which would suggest this is not a viable explanation. A second possibility is that there has actually been an increase in the number of identity theft incidents, but that either these criminals are evading federal law enforcement or law enforcement has dedicated fewer resources toward combating identity theft, which has resulted in decreased investigations and prosecutions. Yet another explanation may be that fewer perpetrators are actually impacting a greater number of victims.

One explanation is that some cases in which defendants would have been charged with identity theft in earlier years may more recently have resulted in defendants being charged with aggravated identity theft. Therefore, a decrease in identity theft case filings may be complemented with an increase in aggravated identity theft case filings.

If a victim does not receive the bill, and therefore does not pay it, this could adversely affect the victim's credit. In addition to abusing existing credit card accounts, a thief could also open new accounts in the victim's name, incurring more charges on the victim's line of credit. These actions could in turn affect not only the victim's immediate pocketbook, but future credit as well. The Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) has predicted that organized crime groups will become more involved in identity theft-related crime such as credit card fraud and that these crimes will become increasingly transnational.

The medical sector was followed in number of breaches by the business (33.9%), government (10.2%), educational (9.0%), and banking (3.7%) sectors.", "Several factors may influence the number of reported breaches. One such factor may be the increasing number of states that have enacted laws requiring data breach notification. California was the first state to enact such legislation in 2002. As of December 2013, 46 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted data breach notification laws. The increasing prevalence of state laws requiring breach notification could lead to an increase in reported breaches to law enforcement, media, or the individuals affected. Nonetheless, the actual number of data breaches remains underreported, and the number of reported breaches does not reflect the magnitude of data breaches. Because of these factors, analysts are unable to say with certainty whether the increase in the number of reported data breaches in 2013 is an accurate reflection of the trend in data breaches.", "Furthermore, the number of records affected by each data breach is variable, and in many cases unknown. In 2013, for example, at least 57,868,922 records were put at risk, but information on the exact number of records exposed was only available for 366 (about 59%) of the 619 reported data breaches. Of note, however, \"due to the mandatory reporting requirement for healthcare industry breaches affecting 500 or more individuals, 84% of [the] healthcare breaches publicly stated the number of records exposed.\"", "Because available data on known data breaches and reported identity theft incidents are not comprehensive, and because year-to-year changes in one measure may not trend with changes in the other, it can be difficult to determine whether there is a relationship between the two. Intuitively, the data breaches and identity theft may seem to correlate, but some analysts have found that the link may not be very strong. There are several ways to analyze the relationship between data breaches and identity theft. One is to examine the set of data breach victims and determine the proportion of those victims that are also victims of identity theft. Some claim that data breaches are a direct cause of identity theft and may rely on this position to advocate the need for increased data security and data breach notification laws to protect consumers and help with quickly mitigating any potential damage from such data breaches. Meanwhile, other experts claim that less than 1% of data breach victims are also victims of identity theft. Some may use this data to argue against the need for increased data security and breach notification laws, suggesting that such laws could produce a larger cost for businesses than prevention for consumers. Results from one study note that 25% of surveyed individuals had, at some point, received a \"notification about a data breach that involved the loss or theft of their personal information\" (and 51% of respondents couldn't recall whether they had received such a notification. And, Javelin Strategy & Research data suggest that nearly one in four (22.5%) individuals receiving breach notifications became victims of fraud. ", "Another means to evaluate the relationship between data breaches and identity theft is to examine identity theft victims and analyze the proportion of those victims whose identity was stolen as a result of a data breach. Javelin Strategy and Research found that about 11% of victims' identities that were stolen had been under the control of a company and were stolen from the company through methods such as data breaches. Most victims (65%) did not know how their identities had been stolen, and some proportion of these could have occurred as a result of a data breach. Synovate conducted a similar study on behalf of the FTC and found that about 12% of victims' stolen identities had been under the control of a company and were thus accessed via a data breach. The Center for Identity Management and Information Protection at Utica College evaluated identity theft cases handled by the U.S. Secret Service between 2002 and 2006 and found that in nearly 27% of the cases, a breach of company-controlled data was the source of the identity theft.", "It appears that the stronger relationship between identity theft and data breaches is found when analyzing identity theft victims whose data were obtained through a data breach rather than in analyzing data breaches that result in identity theft. In efforts to curb identity theft, policymakers are left with the issue of how to target data breaches. The question is whether the federal government's role in curbing identity theft should be more preventative, more responsive, or both. One policy option may be for Congress to increase data security for the purpose of preventing those data breaches that could potentially result in identity theft. Congress has already enacted data breach laws targeting certain components of the public and private sectors, such as the Veterans Administration and healthcare providers. Another option could be for Congress to dedicate resources to assisting victims of identity theft and providing sufficient deterrence and punishment measures (in the form of penalties or sanctions). These options are analyzed further below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["As Congress debates means to prevent identity theft, mitigate the potential effects of identity theft, and investigate and prosecute identity thieves, there are several issues policymakers may wish to consider.

There are few restrictions on the use of SSNs in the private sector, and therefore the use of SSNs is widespread. Some industries, such as the financial services industry, have stricter requirements for safeguarding personally identifying information. There are greater restrictions on the use of SSNs in the public sector, as Congress has already taken direct steps in reducing the prevalence of SSNs in this arena. For example, in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ), Congress prohibited states from displaying or electronically including SSNs on driver's licenses, motor vehicle registrations, or personal identification cards. One document that continues to display SSNs, however, is the Medicare identification card. Congress may consider whether the continued display of SSNs on Medicare cards places individuals at undue risk for identity theft as well as for becoming a victim of other crimes facilitated by identity theft and whether it should enact legislation to prohibit the display of SSNs on Medicare cards. Proponents of legislation to remove SSNs from Medicare cards cite reports that as of 2013, approximately 50 million Medicare cards displayed Social Security numbers, potentially placing these individuals at risk for identity theft. Opponents of such legislation may cite that transitioning to a different Medicare identifier has most recently been estimated to cost between $255 million and $317 million.", "Another policy option to safeguard personally identifiable information that Congress may consider is increasing restrictions on the disclosure of certain forms of personally identifiable information, such as SSNs, in connection with federally funded grant programs. One example of Congress taking such action is in the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-162 ). Provisions in this act prohibit grantees that receive funds under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 from disclosing certain personally identifiable information\u2014including SSNs\u2014collected in connection with services through the grant program. Congress may consider whether existing SSN restrictions for federal grant recipients are sufficient or whether the federal government should play a larger role in limiting the use of SSNs\u2014and more specifically, whether it should set limitations as part of eligibility requirements for federal assistance.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified vulnerabilities in federal laws protecting personally identifiable information\u2014and specifically, SSNs\u2014across industries. For one, some industries, such as the financial services industry, have more restrictions on safeguarding this information, while information resellers are not covered by the same restrictions. In order to reduce discrepancies across industries, one policy option may be to provide certain federal agencies with authority to curb the prevalence of SSN use in the private sector; for example, GAO has recommended that Congress provide SSA with the authority to enact standards for uniformly truncating SSNs so that the entire nine-digit numbers are not as readily available. A similar option may be to provide the Attorney General, the FTC, or the SSA with the authority to set rules and standards for the sale and purchase of SSNs.", "Others have suggested that policies should be focused on eliminating the use of SSNs as authenticators rather than on securing their use. The premise is that SSNs are often public information and, if not already available, they can be predicted with relative ease. For instance, researchers have demonstrated how the public availability of names and birth data allow for SSN predictability and subsequent vulnerability. As such, some have recommended that efforts not be focused on securing SSNs that are often already public and predictable.

In order to prevent any proportion of identity theft that may result from data breaches, or to mitigate the extent of the damage resulting from breach-related identity theft, Congress may wish to consider whether to strengthen data breach notification requirements. Such requirements could affect both the notification of the relevant law enforcement authorities as well as the notification of the individual whose personally identifiable information may be at risk from the breach. ", "Proponents of increasing breach notification requirements point to research on recent trends in identity theft and the resulting monetary loss. As mentioned, the sooner people become aware that they are victims of identity theft, the faster they take compensatory steps to mitigate the damage. Proponents also argue that placing enhanced reporting requirements on industries may influence businesses to increase their data security standards, which could, in effect, decrease data breaches and any possibly resulting identity theft. Results from one study suggest that the adoption of state-level data breach disclosure laws could reduce the identity theft from these breaches by, on average, 6.1%. On the other hand, opponents of increasing notification requirements point to research suggesting that the percentage of data breaches that result in identity theft could be less than 1%, as previously discussed. Opponents may then argue that the costs that businesses could incur from increased notification (in terms of dollars and personnel time) could thus exceed the costs incurred by potential identity theft victims from the small proportion of data breaches that may actually result in identity theft.", "In addition to strengthening post-breach notification requirements, another policy option aimed at decreasing data breach-related identity theft involves strengthening data security.

The task force specifically suggested adding identity theft-related crimes such as mail theft, counterfeit securities, and tax fraud. However, the task force did not cite specific data to support the claim that these specifically mentioned crimes are in fact those most often related to (either facilitating or facilitated by) identity theft. If Congress considers expanding the list of predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft, it may request that the U.S. Attorneys as well as the appropriate investigative agencies (e.g., FBI, USSS, ICE, and USPIS) provide a report detailing the relationship between identity theft and other federal crimes not yet codified as predicate offenses.
