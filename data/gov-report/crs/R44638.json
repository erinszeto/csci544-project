{"id": "R44638", "title": "Corporate Tax Integration and Tax Reform", "released_date": "2016-09-16T00:00:00", "summary": ["In January 2016, Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, announced plans for a tax reform that would explore corporate integration. Corporate integration involves the elimination or reduction of additional taxes on corporate equity investment that arise because corporate income is taxed twice, once at the corporate level and once at the individual level. Traditional concerns are that this system of taxation is inefficient because it (1) favors noncorporate equity investment over corporate investment, (2) favors debt finance over equity finance, (3) favors retained earnings over dividends, and (4) discourages the realization of gains on the sale of corporate stock. Increasingly, international concerns such as allocation of investment across countries, repatriation of profits earned abroad, shifting profits out of the United States and into tax havens, and inversions (U.S. firms using mergers to shift headquarters to a foreign country) have become issues in any tax reform, corporate integration included.", "This report first examines the four traditional efficiency issues by comparing effective tax rates. These estimates suggest that there is little overall difference between corporate and noncorporate investment or even favorable treatment of corporations, for several reasons. A larger share of corporate assets benefits from tax preferences. Moreover, only a quarter of shares in U.S. firms is held by taxable individuals; the remainder is held by tax-exempt and largely tax-exempt pension and retirement accounts, nonprofits, and foreigners. Additionally, tax rates on individual dividends and capital gains are lower than ordinary rates.", "However, effective tax rates across assets differ markedly, with intangible assets most favored and structures least favored. Debt is treated favorably in both the corporate and noncorporate sectors, but more so in the corporate sector, so that the total stock of assets in the corporate sector is taxed less heavily than in the noncorporate sector when both debt and equity are considered. The distortion between debt and equity finance is large in each sector, with negative tax rates for debt finance in many cases, while differences in taxes affecting dividend payout choices or realization of capital gains on stock appear to be small because of low tax rates.", "The report outlines several approaches to integration. Full integration would address both dividends and retained earnings. One approach would tax on a partnership basis by allocating income to shareholders and using the firm to withhold taxes. Credits for withheld taxes would be provided to shareholders, and credits could be made nonrefundable for tax-exempt and foreign shareholders. A different full integration approach would eliminate shareholder taxes and tax only at the firm level. A third would tax at the shareholder level and not the firm by imposing ordinary rates and taxing not only dividends and realized capital gains but also unrealized gains by marking shares to market prices (i.e., mark-to-market). Partial integration focuses on dividends and could provide either a dividend deduction by the firm (with a withholding tax and credits) or a dividend exclusion to the shareholder. Disallowing interest deductions in full or in part could be combined with most proposals.", "The report compares these proposals with respect to impact on revenue, administrative feasibility, and effects on both traditional and international tax choices. Shareholder allocation or deductions with refundable credits produce relatively large revenue losses, as does mark-to-market. Nonrefundability and making modifications in mark-to-market can substantially reduce these revenue losses. Most proposals would have modest efficiency gains, and some would modestly increase efficiency losses. Mark-to-market would tax economic income and potentially produce a number of efficiency gains but may not be feasible on administrative grounds. Disallowing or restricting deductions for interest would lead to efficiency gains on a number of margins and provide revenue to help achieve revenue-neutral reforms."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In January 2016, Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, announced plans for a tax reform that would explore corporate integration. Corporate integration involves the elimination or reduction of additional taxes on corporate equity investment that arise because corporate income is taxed twice. The corporation pays corporate tax (at 35% for large corporations) on its taxable income. Individuals, in turn, pay individual income taxes on dividends and on capital gains (which arise from corporate retained earnings) when realized. This system of taxation produces differential tax burdens, potentially discouraging the realization of gains on the sale of corporate stock and favoring noncorporate equity investment over corporate investment, debt finance over equity finance, and retained earnings over dividends. One goal of corporate integration is to reduce or eliminate these distortions.", "Work has continued on this proposal. Congress held hearings on May 17, 2016, on allowing a corporate dividend paid deduction and on May 24, 2016, on corporate integration and debt.", "The focus on corporate tax integration differs from the approach in some recent tax reform plans that have largely proposed broadening the base of the corporate tax, reducing the corporate tax rate, and revising the tax treatment of foreign source income. A number of these elements were addressed in the report of a Senate Finance Committee Working Group in 2015. Former Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Dave Camp introduced a corporate tax reform bill ( H.R. 1 ) in the 113 th Congress. A tax reform could combine these elements with an integration proposal.", "Corporate tax integration was the focus of a major Treasury study issued in 1992. That study recommended approaches to integration that generally reduced or eliminated taxes at the shareholder level while retaining taxes at the corporate level, including an exclusion of dividends for shareholders. Over the years, taxes on shareholders have been reduced. Capital gains, taxed at ordinary rates under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ) and capped at 28% in 1990, were revised in 1997 and taxed at a maximum rate of 20%. In 2003, the President proposed a dividend exclusion for shareholders. Congress instead lowered tax rates on dividends (which had been taxed historically at ordinary rates) and capital gains, with a maximum rate of 15%. These 2003 provisions, along with the 2001 tax cuts, were set to expire after 2010. After some extensions, in 2013 an agreement was reached to retain the lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains but to tax these amounts at high-income levels of 20%. Additionally, in 2010, as part of the Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 , as amended), an additional 3.8% tax was imposed on investment income, including dividends and capital gains, of high-income taxpayers.", "Several factors that are important in considering proposals have changed in the almost 25 years since the 1992 study, aside from the lower shareholder taxes that exist today. One of these factors is the increased importance of a global economy and multinational firms with investments and activities in many countries. These firms' choices with respect to the location of investment and profits are affected by firm-level rather than shareholder-level taxes. A second change is that the fraction of shareholders who are not subject to U.S. shareholder taxes has increased, so that currently only about a quarter of corporate stock of U.S. firms is estimated to be owned by shareholders subject to U.S. individual taxes on dividends and capital gains (compared to about half at the time of the study). Inflation and the expectation of inflation have also declined, affecting various relative tax rates. Finally, the growth and recognition of the importance of intangible assets that are tax-favored and are more dominant in the corporate sector affect the relative treatment of the corporate and noncorporate sectors in the aggregate.

", "This system departs somewhat from the classical system in that tax rates on dividends and capital gains are lower than ordinary rates. Taxpayers with ordinary rates of less than 15% pay no tax on dividends or capital gains; taxpayers with ordinary rates of 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35% pay a 15% rate; taxpayers at the top rate of 39.6% (with $400,000 or more of taxable income for single returns and $450,000 for joint returns) pay a 20% rate.

One of the non-tax differences between corporations and ordinary noncorporate businesses is that shareholders of corporations have limited liability for the firm's debts (in the amount of their corporate stock). Many, although not all, pass-through firms have full liability, putting personal assets at risk. Pass-through businesses include sole proprietorships (one owner) and ordinary partnerships (more than one owner where the owners have full liability). Limited partnerships usually have a general partner with full liability and limited partners whose liability, similar to stockholders in ordinary corporations, is limited to their investment. Subchapter S corporates are corporations with a limited number of shareholders who elect to be taxed as pass-through businesses. Limited liability companies (LLCs) are incorporated and organized in a way that allows them to be taxed as pass-throughs.", "All of the income of sole proprietorships is subject to payroll taxes, including OASDI (Social Security) taxes and the 2.9% Medicare tax.

The 3.8% additional tax on income in excess of $250,000 ($200,000 for a single person) that applies to dividends and capital gains (as well as interest) also applies to passive income of partnerships and Subchapter S firms. A proprietor was already paying a 2.9% Medicare tax prior to the Affordable Care Act, and the health reform imposes an additional tax of 0.9% on these high incomes, making the tax a total of 3.8%. Active income of partnerships and Subchapter S firms is exempt. ", "Another type of pass-through firm is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), which is a corporation whose treatment is similar to a pass-through firm. REITs largely hold real estate assets but must distribute most income to shareholders. These distributions are deducted from income and taxed to shareholders at ordinary rates. ", "The difference in tax burden between investing in a noncorporate firm and a corporate one depends on the tax rate of the individual and whether the corporate investment option is through a taxable ownership or tax exempt. It is also affected by whether the noncorporate investment is in a form subject to the 3.8% tax on investment income.

The estimated value of accounts, such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s, that were at the maximum would not be included in the CBO estimates because individuals were no longer able to make an additional investment in these accounts.

When the deduction for costs matches economic depreciation, the effective tax rate is equal to the statutory tax rate in the absence of other subsidies. When costs are deducted immediately, as is the case of investment in intangibles, the effective tax burden on a marginal investment (one that just breaks even) is zero. The recovery of investments in oil and gas is highly accelerated, making mining investments treated most favorably of investments other than intangibles. Depreciation is significantly accelerated compared to estimates of economic depreciation on equipment investments in the aggregate and public utility structures, but less so on structures. Residential buildings are more favorably treated than some forms of nonresidential structures, such as commercial and industrial buildings. The latter have effective tax rates around the statutory rate.", "Also in effect on a temporary basis is bonus depreciation, which allows the immediate expensing of half of the cost of investment in equipment. Bonus depreciation has been periodically extended since enactment in 2008; it is currently scheduled to be phased out after 2019.", "Another important tax provision is the production activities deduction, which allows a deduction of 9% of taxable income for profits associated with domestic production, including manufacturing, construction, and some other industries. ", "Finally, the research and experimentation credit, which applies to intangible investment in research, also reduces effective tax rates. The credit had been a temporary one since 1981 but was made permanent in December 2015.", "Another important feature that reduces effective tax rates is the treatment of foreign source income, which will be discussed below (see \" Treatment of Foreign Source Income \").

The deduction of interest goes beyond eliminating the corporate tax on profits attributable to debt finance, because the rate at which profit is effectively taxed is lower than the rate at which interest is deducted due to tax preferences and inflation. To explain, consider that neither of these effects exists. If the interest rate on borrowed money is 5%, a firm can earn a 5% return and pay no taxes, because the corporate profits tax due is exactly equal to the deduction for interest expense. Suppose, however, that because of special tax benefits the effective rate is 25% and the statutory rate is 35%. The firm will have a tax savings of 0.35 times 5%, or 1.75%, but will pay on the profit 0.25 times 5%, or 1.25%. This negative tax at the firm level means that a firm could make investments that yield less than 5% and still be able to cover interest payments. ", "The negative tax rate at the firm level on debt finance is further increased because of inflation. Tax depreciation rules generally are beneficial enough to offset inflation (and often provide a subsidy in addition), but nominal interest (the real interest rate plus inflation) is deductible. In this example, suppose there is an inflation rate of 2% along with the effective 25% rate on real profit. Keeping the real interest rate the same, the nominal interest rate would be 7% (the real rate plus the inflation rate). The tax benefit of interest deduction is now 2.45% (0.35 times 7%).", "Interest income, including the inflation portion of the nominal interest rate, is subject to tax by creditors, but the tax rates are lower, meaning the combined effect of the firm/creditor tax net result is likely to be small or even zero. The estimated effective tax rate is 22%, but, as with corporate stock, a large fraction of that income is not expected to be subject to tax. There is no study of the distribution of interest similar to the study of corporate stock; however, only 19% of interest income paid from all sources appears on individual tax returns. This measure does not account for interest received and paid abroad. In the last reconciliation of National Income and Products Accounts (NIPA) and IRS data done by the Commerce Department (in 2005), 74% of interest income in personal income was excluded, with the largest shares 42% in pensions and insurance and 19% in imputed services. (This calculation also would not account for interest paid to foreigners.) The CBO study cited above and using 2007 data from the Flow of Funds accounts finds a slightly smaller taxable share for corporate interest than for corporate stocks. A comparison of corporate stocks and bonds for 2015 found smaller shares of bonds taxable directly to individuals and a larger share of foreign investors as compared to stock ownership. These studies suggest that a smaller share of debt is taxable than equity and that a larger share is foreign.", "Interest paid to foreign persons is subject to a negligible withholding tax but may be subject to tax in the countries of residence.

Thus, a lower corporate tax generally encourages more equity (although not necessarily debt-financed) investment in the United States as compared to foreign countries. The shareholder and creditor taxes are largely imposed on a residence basis and apply regardless of where the investment is located. As a result, the proposals that were recommended in 1992, which largely relieved tax at the shareholder and individual level and not the corporate level, might be less efficient today. The lower tax rates proposed and eventually enacted on dividends also would not affect the location choices of multinational firms.", "The corporate tax is not wholly a source-based tax; technically, it is imposed on worldwide income. Effectively, however, little tax is paid on foreign source income due to deferral and foreign tax credits. Income earned by foreign subsidiaries is not subject to tax unless it is repatriated (paid as a dividend to the U.S. parent). Because a fraction of profits is reinvested permanently (as plant and equipment), some share of this income is never taxed. In addition, dividends (and branch profits, which are taxed currently) are eligible for credits against U.S. tax liability for taxes paid to foreign governments. Because excess credits from higher-tax countries can be used to offset U.S. tax liability from low-tax countries, the effective tax rate is small.", "In addition to suggesting relief be provided at the corporate level rather than the shareholder level, global considerations raise important issues of how to treat foreign source income under some integration approaches.

The firm-level rates are relevant to decisions by multinational corporations (both U.S.-parented and foreign-parented) about where to locate investments. (Shareholder taxes are paid regardless of where the firm invests.) The firm-level corporate taxes also show how much the statutory rate of 35% is reduced by tax preferences, and the treatment of these preferences is an important design issue in corporate tax integration plans. In the corporate sector, the provisions allowing for accelerated cost recovery, the production activities deductions, and research tax credits result in an effective tax rate of 20%. The production activities deduction has a minor effect, reducing the overall statutory tax rate in the corporate sector by less than a percentage point. Accelerated cost recovery reduces effective tax rate for all assets. The most favorable (and negative) rate is that for intangible investment in research and development (R&D), which benefits from expensing (which in isolation produces a zero tax rate) and the R&D credit, which leads to a negative rate. Investment in branding through advertising and other intangible investments (generally workforce training) have a zero tax rate because they are eligible for expensing.

Including it would lower the firm-level corporate tax rate for equipment to 13.4% and for public utilities to 14.2%, or by about 10 percentage points. The overall tax rate would be reduced by about 5 percentage points, to 14.6%. Thus, bonus depreciation is important. It would be less important, however, in the noncorporate sector because these assets account for about 23% of noncorporate capital stock but about 45% of the corporate capital stock. The tax rates also do not reflect the Section 179 expensing provision for equipment, which has dollar caps and phase-outs and the graduated rate structure.

Studies of the average tax rate paid by subsidiaries of U.S. firms abroad indicated that firms paid an overall average tax of 14.1% tax paid to foreign jurisdictions and a residual tax of 3.3% paid to the United States. Although this total of 17.4% is not very different from the 18.9% reported in Table 1 , it is calculated on a different basis and is likely lower, perhaps around 13%. According to Commerce Department data (NIPA), earnings from abroad constitute about 21.7% of total corporate profits. To consider its effects on the burdens of U.S.-owned investments, adjustments can be made using the earlier data indicating that the direct holdings of foreign firms were 79% of the value of portfolio holdings.

Outside of intangibles the differentials between corporate and noncorporate investment are between 7 and 9 percentage points. Overall, the corporate sector has about the same effective tax rate as the noncorporate sector because it has more of the favorably treated assets, intangibles, and to a lesser extent equipment and public utility structures.

The large negative rates occur because effective tax rates are calculated assuming the after tax rate of return is fixed, and taxes cause the pretax return to vary. Tax rates are calculated as a share of the pretax return. As noted earlier, when tax subsidies become very large the pretax rate of return becomes very low, causing the tax subsidy as a percentage the pretax return to become very large, and in fact to approach infinity as the pretax return approaches zero.", "An alternative way of expressing the effect of taxes (and one that is used in welfare analysis) is the tax wedge, which is the addition (or reduction) in the after tax return to achieve the required pretax returns that results from taxes. It is measured as t/(1-t). Compare the overall firm level tax. In the equity case, it is 19.7% and in the debt case, -53.5%. The respective tax wedges are 24.3% and -34.9%. That is, the tax system increases the required return to break even by 23% in the equity case, but reduces it by 35% in the debt case. Tax wedges when tax rates become highly negative provide better information about the magnitude of distortions. For example, the tax rate for research is -63.3% for equity investment and -701.4% for debt investment. Expressed as tax wedges, they are -38.7% and -87.5%. These numbers indicate that returns from investment are lowered by about almost 40% due to the tax system for equity and close to 90% for debt.

The first is deducting from income the nominal interest rate (which includes inflation) rather than the real interest rate. In the case of the estimates in Table 2 , the nominal interest rate is 7.5% and the real interest rate (after subtracting inflation of 2%) is 5.5%. The second is that tax on earnings is scaled back by tax preferences, whereas the deduction for interest is not. Without these two elements, the tax rate on debt-financed investment would be zero.

That is, corporate debt-financed investment has a larger subsidy than noncorporate debt-financed investment. In the base case in which the assumptions about creditors' tax burdens are similar, the tax wedges are -31% for the corporate sector and -17% for the noncorporate sector. The difference is due partly to the mix of assets but also to the statutory tax rate; the higher the firm's statutory rate, the larger the subsidy.

However, a favorable treatment of capital gains still exists, because capital gains taxes are not due until gains are recognized and tax is not paid on gain assets passed on at death. Estimates suggest that about half of gains are never taxed. At a 15% tax rate, overall, capital gains would be taxed on average at around 7.5% (because half is taxed at 0% and half is taxed at 15%). The effect is further diminished because a large fraction of the firm's stock is held by tax-exempt or foreign investors. As discussed previously, foreign shareholders account for about a quarter and pay an effective U.S., withholding tax rate of around 6% on dividends, with no tax capital gains. These amounts could eventually be taxed (and credits allowed) in the country of ownership, although evidence suggests that 20% or more of these dividends are paid to foreign tax-exempt investors.

Under some circumstances, such as those where tax rates are increased at the shareholder level in return for reduced tax at the corporate level, this treatment could be seen as appropriate.

It would probably not be possible to precisely allocate income because stocks change hands constantly. Therefore, the practical rule would be to allocate taxable income to shareholders of record at the time dividends are paid. Shareholders would pay taxes on them (unless dividends were a return of capital), and tax would be due on both the actual dividend paid and any earnings retained. Shareholders would increase the basis of their stock by the amount of income received less any distribution. Losses would be passed through to shareholders to offset other income, although current law contains a restriction on passive loss deductions that would presumably apply. ", "In addition, tax preferences would be passed through to shareholders, and shareholders would receive their share of credits. For most tax-exempt shareholders, no tax would be paid at any level; thus, a significant revenue loss would occur. Nonprofits would be subject to an unrelated business income tax at 35% for any corporate earnings financed by debt. Foreign portfolio shareholders would, under the standard treatment of partnerships operating a business in the United States, be required to file a tax return and pay ordinary individual income taxes. Foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries also would have to pay income tax because partnerships doing business in the United States would be subject to tax (because their income is effectively connected). Depending on the dividend policy of the firm, individuals could have tax liability in excess of income received, because retained earnings would be subject to tax. For example, if a firm's taxable income were $100, but only $20 was paid as a dividend, a shareholder in the 30% bracket would owe $30 on the $100 of earnings, an amount in excess of his or her dividend. If the full partnership rules applied, corporations would have to report each item of income and deduction and individuals would have to include those items in their tax returns.

Thus the taxpayer would have to report only corporate income as an aggregate amount on the tax return but not file a business income schedule.", "The Treasury prototype also addresses the possibility of owing more tax than the amount distributed by requiring the corporation to withhold the corporate tax due and then provide it as a credit to shareholders. In the previous example, if the corporate tax was $35 (35% of $100), and a $20 dividend were paid, the shareholders would have $100 of income, a $30 individual tax due, and a $35 tax credit. The basis of stocks (the amount deducted from the sales price to determine capital gain) would be increased by the income allocated minus the corporate tax credited and the dividend because the value of the stock would be expected to rise by this amount, which is the after tax earnings retained by the corporations.", "The Treasury prototype also made this credit nonrefundable to tax-exempt shareholders and refundable only by treaty agreement to foreign shareholders. This treatment would significantly reduce (but not eliminate) the revenue loss associated with integration. It would basically establish a shareholder level tax on taxable individuals and a corporate level tax on tax-exempt investors, while applying little or no U.S. tax for some foreign shareholders. There would still be a revenue loss because taxable shareholders would pay less tax than they did before, as would foreign shareholders if allowed refundable credits by treaty.

Basically, the major preferences for domestic income in the form of deferral (e.g., accelerated depreciation) would be automatically passed through to the shareholder through allocations based on taxable income; the shareholder would benefit from the timing. But some gain would be realized when stock is sold if economic profits exceed taxable income. Exclusions under the prototype would be automatically excluded as well, and the prototype also would increase the basis in the stock by the amount of the exclusion so it would never be taxed. Credits would be allowed directly but would not increase the basis of the stock, so that the credit would be taxable capital gains income. ", "How this system would work might be best explained by an example. Suppose corporate taxable income is $100, but profits before tax include an additional $10 of excluded income (such as tax-exempt interest) and an additional $20 of profit due to deferred income (such as accelerated depreciation and expensing). The firm also has a $10 credit (for example from the research credit). Total profits before tax, therefore, are $130. The withholding tax is $35, reduced by $10 of credits to $25. The average effective corporate withholding rate in this example is $25/$130, or slightly over 19%. If $20 is distributed, the value of the stock should rise by profits minus tax payments and dividends or $85 ($130 minus $25 of tax and minus $20 of dividends). Under the prototype the shareholder would receive an allocation of $100 and a credit of $35, paying a tax of $30. The shareholder would be left with $25 in cash ($20 in dividends and $5 in excess credits). The shareholders' basis would increase by $55: $65 for the allocation of after corporate tax, reduced to $45 after subtracting the dividend, but increased by the $10 of excluded income to $55. Thus, the stock's value increases by $85 and the basis increases by $55. If the shareholder were to sell the stock, the capital gain would be $30, the sum of the deferred income and the credit. ", "Although it would be difficult in practice to adjust the basis of stock for deferral (which would require measurement of an alternative economic recovery system), it would be possible to increase the basis for both the credit and the exclusion, leaving a gain tax only on the deferred income. Similarly, neither basis adjustment could be made, so that both the credit and exclusion, along with deferred earnings ($40), would be taxed when or if the stock is sold.

This regime would apply to publicly traded firms, whereas privately traded firms would receive pass-through treatment, which would be a much simpler proposition if not extended to public corporations. This proposal was not included in the Treasury study but has been made by some academics, including Joseph M. Dodge. More recently, these ideas have been advanced by Eric Toder and Alan Viard.

One option for the tax-exempt shareholder is to impose a tax on this income (an unrelated business income tax already applies for debt financed partnership income of nonprofits).

Moreover, imputation credit systems for dividends have been used in the past in several European countries and are currently in effect in Australia and New Zealand. As is the case of full imputation, the major issues are the treatment of tax-exempt and foreign investors and the pass-through of preferences. Pensions in Australia are subject to tax, so the issue of whether credits are refundable is less important in its system; dividend credits are limited to income subject to tax.

The two approaches to achieving this result are (1) the credit limitation and (2) the compensatory tax. Under the credit limitation approach, if dividends are larger than the income subject to U.S. tax, shareholders will receive only partial credits (e.g., if half is from taxed income and half from preference income, only credits at half the corporate rate would be allowed). The alternative approach is a compensatory tax, which requires an additional corporate-level withholding tax to be assessed when a dividend is paid out of income not subject to tax. If the dividend deduction with a withholding tax is to be a true withholding tax, then it would appear that the compensatory tax method would be consistent with a dividend deduction or withholding tax approach.

Unlike the modified partnership prototype, preferences including credits, are not passed through. Thus foreign source income with foreign taxes that are offset by the foreign tax credit would be considered nontaxed income and thus disallowed dividend credits. ", "Another issue is how these provisions interact with treatment of tax-exempt and foreign shareholders. Assuming tax credits are not refundable to these shareholders, a compensatory tax where dividends exceed income subject to tax could increase burdens for tax-exempt shareholders, because it would impose a tax where none existed before. It would also increase burdens if credits were refundable only against the tax on dividends rather than all income for taxable shareholders. A tax refundable only against the tax on dividends would tax at a minimum of the corporate tax rate or the individual rate, and a compensatory tax could increase the burden.

This treatment would be beneficial for firms paying cash dividends that were less than the income subject to U.S. tax. ", "Although the preference provision limits shareholder credits to amounts subject to U.S. corporate-level tax, all provisions have a stacking order, in that dividends are first paid out of income subject to tax, which is beneficial because it leaves much of the retained earnings potentially not subject to any level of tax. This issue is lessened with nonrefundable credits, especially if nonrefundability applies to foreign shareholders. ", "As analysts have pointed out, there may be some non-tax differences between the shareholder imputation credit approach and the dividend deduction or withholding tax method. Professor Edward Kleinbard notes that book accounting would not treat a withholding tax as a corporate tax, increasing earnings and profits, and allowing income to be repatriated to pay dividends without reducing profits because of the tax payment. In analysis by Alvin Warren, the author noted that dividends would be reported net of corporate tax in an imputation credit approach and gross of tax in a dividend deduction or withholding tax approach. The two approaches also might be perceived differently with an imputation credit seen as reducing individual tax liability (and possibly leading to no taxes paid by high-income individuals) and the dividend deduction as reducing corporate tax liability (and corporate effective tax rates).

Table 3 shows that it is the noncorporate sector that is disfavored (although by a small amount) when the treatment of debt is taken into account.

If the corporate tax were converted to a partnership basis (implemented by income allocation, and pass-through of preferences, and refundable credits), the distortion would reverse.

Similar, although slightly larger, rates would apply with the dividend deduction proposal with refundable withholding credits. (That proposal would involve slightly higher taxes because although the dividend deduction absorbs the corporate tax, there is still a capital gains tax on retained earnings.) The mark-to-market proposal would simply impose the statutory tax rates on economic income at the shareholder level, with a tax rate of 7.85% for the basic assumptions and 18.4% for the CBO assumptions. This change would create uniform rates across assets within the corporate sectors, but would now favor corporate investment overall and for fixed assets, while disfavoring intangible assets (which are of little importance in the noncorporate sector).

The weighted statutory tax rate for the shareholder allocation proposal is 32.3% for the basic assumption and 33.5% for the CBO assumptions.

Thus these proposals would slightly narrow the inter-sectoral differences for fixed assets, create a system that favors the corporate sector overall, and slightly narrow differences across assets.
