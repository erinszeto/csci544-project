A deduction for sales taxes in lieu of income taxes is also available. The federal deduction for state and local taxes results in the federal government paying part of these state and local taxes through lower federal tax collections. Theory would suggest that taxpayers are willing to accept higher state and local tax rates and greater state and local public spending because of lower federal income taxes arising from these deductions. In addition, there is some evidence that state and local governments rely more on these deductible taxes than on nondeductible taxes and fees for services.", "Repealing the deductibility of state and local taxes would affect state and local government fiscal decisions, albeit indirectly. Generally, state and local public spending would decline, although the magnitude of the decline is uncertain. And, repealing the deduction for state and local taxes would shift the federal tax burden away from taxpayers in low-tax states to taxpayers in high-tax states. Maintaining the current deductibility would continue the indirect federal subsidy for state and local spending.", "Expanding deductibility, such as reinstating the sales tax deduction option or allowing non-itemizers to deduct taxes paid, would likely increase the subsidy for state and local spending. The sales tax deduction option would primarily benefit taxpayers in states without an income tax that are already itemizing. The effect of allowing non-itemizers to deduct taxes paid would depend on the type of deductible tax. For example, property taxes are only paid (directly) by property owners whereas all consumers pay sales taxes in states that levy a sales tax. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295) extended the sales tax deduction option through the 2014 tax year, but it has since been allowed to expire.", "Recent tax reform proposals have included changes to state and local tax deductibility. The \"A Better Way\" tax reform proposal published by the House Budget Committee in June 2016 included a repeal of the deductions for state and local taxes. In April 2017, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn also indicated an interest in repealing state and local tax deductions as part of a larger tax reform proposal.", "The Obama Administration's FY2016 budget proposed a limit on the tax rate (generally a 28% marginal tax rate) at which itemized deductions would reduce tax liability, but did not specifically address deductions related to state and local taxes. In the 114th Congress, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) permanently extended the deduction of state and local sales taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes.

The special deduction was available for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and was in response to the housing crisis. Unlike the sales tax deduction option, the special property tax deduction was not extended beyond 2009. The tax savings from the special property tax deduction likely benefited taxpayers that did not have other potentially deductible expenses that were high enough to merit itemizing. Taxpayers with no mortgage (or low mortgage debt) in states with relatively low state and local tax burdens were the most likely to have benefited the most from this expired tax provision.", "Previously, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 111-5 ) provided for an above-the-line deduction for sales and excise taxes paid on new vehicle purchases for non-itemizers.

The deductibility provision was frequently modified over the years, including the introduction of the standard deduction in lieu of itemizing deductions in 1944, but significant revision did not occur until 1964 with enactment of the Revenue Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-272).", "Before the 1964 act, a deduction was allowed for all state and local taxes paid or incurred within the taxable year except those taxes explicitly excluded. After the 1964 act, only taxes explicitly mentioned were deductible. Included in the list of deductible taxes were state and local taxes on real and personal property; income; general sales; and the sale of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other motor fuels. A new subsection in the 1964 act spelled out the test for deductibility of general sales taxes. First, the tax must be a sales tax (a tax on retail sales) and second, it must be general, that is, imposed at one rate on the sales of a wide range of classes of items. \"Items\" could refer either to commodities or services.", "The deductibility provision remained largely unchanged until the deduction for sales taxes was repealed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA 1986, P.L. 99-514 ). One of the primary goals of TRA 1986 was to broaden the base of the federal income tax. Eliminating the deduction for all state and local taxes paid was one of the policy options considered to broaden the tax base. The final version of TRA 1986 repealed the deduction for general sales taxes but preserved the deduction for ad valorem property taxes and income taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) summary of TRA 1986 suggested that Congress chose to repeal the sales tax deduction and not income or property taxes, because:", "only general sales taxes were deductible and not selective sales taxes (e.g., tobacco and alcohol taxes), which created economic inefficiencies arising from individuals changing consumption patterns in response to differential taxation; the deduction was not allowed for taxes paid at the wholesale level (and passed forward to the consumer), thus creating additional inequities and inefficiencies; the sales tax deduction was administratively burdensome for taxpayers who chose to collect receipts to justify sales tax deduction claims; and the alternative sales tax deduction tables generated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not accurately reflect individual consumption patterns, thereby diminishing the equitability of the tax policy.", "The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA 2004, P.L. 108-357 ) reinstated deductible sales tax in lieu of income taxes. The in lieu of treatment in AJCA 2004 is in contrast to the \"in addition to\" treatment in pre-TRA 1986 tax law. The concerns noted above would still hold. A secondary concern\u2014presented during the debate before repeal in 1986\u2014that states would alter their tax structures in response to the elimination of sales tax deductibility, would not arise. The AJCA 2004 sales tax deductibility provision expired after the 2005 tax year, but was extended on multiple occasions: through 2007 by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-432 ); through the 2009 tax year by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 ); through the 2011 tax year by The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ); through the 2013 tax year by The American Taxpayer Relief Act ( P.L. 112-240 ); and through the 2014 tax year by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-295 ).

The federal tax savings from the deduction is equal to the taxpayer's marginal tax rate multiplied by the size of the deduction. Because the federal income tax rate regime is progressive, a deduction for itemizers, in contrast to a tax credit for all taxpayers, favors taxpayers in higher income tax brackets.

More taxpayers would claim a sales tax deduction because all but five states imposed a sales tax and, in contrast to property taxes, paying the tax is not conditioned on owning property, real or personal. The current sales tax deduction is not as common because it is in lieu of income taxes. In 2014, 9.8 million (or 6.6%) of taxpayers claimed a deduction for sales taxes paid, and the percentage of taxpayers who claimed a deduction for income taxes paid dropped from 25.8% in 2006 to 21.8% in 2014.", "The percentage of itemizers has remained relatively stable since 2003 (see Table 1 ).

If this taxpayer is in the 28% marginal tax bracket, taking $1,000 out of taxable income reduces taxes by $280 ($1,000 multiplied by 28%). In most cases, both the taxpayer's tax bracket and home value increase with income. Thus, higher-income taxpayers in higher tax brackets receive a greater tax savings than low-income taxpayers because of the typically progressive state income tax.

In 2009, an additional 15.7 million non-itemized returns were filed that claimed $11.3 billion in deductions for real estate taxes paid, as part of the temporary additional standard deduction. Personal property taxes, such as annual car taxes (based on the value of the car), generated $9.2 billion in deductions in 2014.

As noted earlier, state and local governments may lower tax rates and shift to other revenue sources if the relative tax price of raising revenue through property taxes increases.
