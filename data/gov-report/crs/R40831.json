Experts point to a growing body of evidence of the health care system's failure to consistently provide high-quality care to all Americans.", "In a November 2008 report outlining its goals for health reform, the National Priorities Partnership, representing all the major stakeholder groups in the health sector, identified four major challenges to the delivery of high-quality care. The first is to improve patient safety by eliminating medical errors and other adverse events. These errors mostly result from faulty systems, processes, and conditions that lead to mistakes. The second challenge is to eradicate disparities in care. Racial and ethnic minorities and low-income groups face disproportionately higher rates of disease, disability, and mortality, largely because of variations in access to care, and quality of care. The third challenge is to reduce the burden of chronic disease, which affects almost half of all Americans and accounts for three-quarters of health care spending. The final challenge is to eliminate unnecessary and ineffective care that compromises quality, drives up costs, and neglects the needs of patients. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), an estimated 30%-40% of health care spending is wasted on unnecessary and even unsafe care."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Care Delivery Reform", "paragraphs": ["While primarily focused on health care financing issues, the health reform debate has embraced a number of proposals to address these challenges and improve the delivery of health care services.

Delivery reform proposals focus on (1) expanding the primary care workforce, (2) encouraging the use of clinical preventive services, and (3) strengthening the role of chronic care management. The current system places a high value on specialty care, rather than primary care. Patients with multiple chronic conditions often receive care from several providers in different settings. Among other things, this can compromise patients' understanding of their conditions and ways to manage them. And the incomplete or inaccurate transfer of information among providers can lead to poor outcomes. Care coordination is seen as an important aspect of health care that helps avoid waste, and the over- and underuse of medications, diagnostic tests, and therapies.", "Health workforce policy has emerged as an important component of the health reform debate. Transforming the nation's health care delivery system\u2014from one that is focused on fragmented specialty care for acute illness to one that places a greater emphasis on primary care, disease prevention, and the coordination and management of care for chronic illness across settings\u2014will require significant changes in health professions education and training. While some advisory groups have warned of a future physician shortage, based on the growing patient demand for services, others caution that simply adding more physicians to the current health care system will increase costs and not improve accessibility or quality. Currently, the number of physicians per capita varies significantly across the country. But that variation is largely driven by where physicians like to live and practice, rather than by patient need. Moreover, higher physician supply is not associated with better patient outcomes or satisfaction, or improved quality of care. Instead of focusing on overall physician supply, health policy analysts recommend a workforce policy that couples the training of more primary care physicians (and other primary care providers) with the promotion and development of integrated systems of care.", "Expanding the use of clinical preventive services is a key goal of delivery reform and often touted as having the potential to reduce health care costs. Such services include immunizations and other interventions that prevent the onset of disease (known as primary prevention), and screening tests that detect the presence of an incipient disease (known as secondary prevention). While there is clear evidence that clinical preventive services can improve health and may be cost-effective (i.e., providing good value for their cost), few of these interventions are cost-saving.", "Proponents of delivery reform have also embraced the concept of a medical home, intended to improve the quality of care through partnerships between patients and specially trained primary care physicians. The physician helps the patient manage his or her own care and coordinates services across settings (specialists' offices, hospitals, and laboratories) and types of care (acute, chronic, and preventive). Concern about the rising costs of treating chronic disease and the lack of coordination of care also has generated keen interest in disease management programs. These programs, typically focused on a specific disease such as diabetes, help patients manage their own care. Program elements include patient education, symptom monitoring, and adherence to treatment plans. Disease management programs share similarities with the medical home concept. But whereas the medical home is built around a physician-patient partnership, disease management programs typically are run by health plans or specialized vendors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drivers of Reform", "paragraphs": ["Health care delivery reform cannot happen unless mechanisms are in place to drive change in the systems of care. Key drivers include performance measurement and the public dissemination of performance information, comparative effectiveness research, adoption of health information technology, and, perhaps most importantly, alignment of payment incentives with high-quality care. Most health policy experts concede that improvements in the quality of health care will not be fully realized unless providers have financial incentives to change the way they deliver health care services. Under fee-for-service, the predominant method of payment, physicians are paid based on the volume of billable services, rather than the value or quality of care they provide. Increasingly, public and private payers are linking a portion of provider payments to their performance on a set of quality measures. Policymakers are interested in expanding these pay-for-performance initiatives to incentivize other changes to the health care delivery system.", "The use of performance measures to track the quality of care is growing in both the private and public health sectors, though concerns about the development and use of such data remain.

It encompasses interoperable electronic health records (EHRs)\u2014including computerized systems to order tests and medications, and support systems to aid clinical decision making\u2014and the development of a national health information network to permit the secure exchange of electronic health information among providers. The promise of HIT comes not from automating existing practices, but rather its use as a tool to help overhaul the delivery of care. HIT has the potential to enable providers to render care more efficiently; for example, by eliminating the use of paper-based records and reducing the duplication of diagnostic tests. It can also improve the quality of care by identifying harmful drug interactions and helping physicians manage patients with multiple conditions.

In particular, HIPAA prohibits a group health plan or health insurance issuer from basing coverage eligibility rules on health-related factors, including health status (physical or mental), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability, or disability. In addition, a group health plan or health insurance issuer may not require that an individual pay a higher premium or contribution than another \"similarly situated\" participant, based on these health-related factors. However, HIPAA clarifies that this requirement \"do[es] not prevent a group health plan and a health insurance issuer from establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and disease prevention [i.e., wellness programs].\" On December 13, 2006, the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and HHS issued joint final regulations on the nondiscrimination provisions of HIPAA that provide a framework for structuring wellness programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Insurance Reform", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sec. 101.

In addition, the section creates new statutory requirements relating to wellness programs offered through group health plans, as well as insurers offering group or individual insurance coverage. The section would, in large part, codify provisions of the HIPAA wellness program regulations, subject to certain exceptions. Accordingly, wellness programs under this section may be classified into two basic types. First, if a program does not condition a premium discount, rebate, or other reward based on an individual satisfying a health status factor (or does not provide a reward), the program complies with the section as long as the program is made available to all similarly situated individuals. Alternatively, if a wellness program is structured so that the conditions for receiving a reward are based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor, then the program must meet certain additional requirements. Among these requirements, the reward offered by this type of wellness program must not exceed 30% of the cost of employee-only coverage under the plan, which may be increased to 50% by the Secretaries of HHS and Treasury if they determine an increase is appropriate. This section differs from the current HIPAA wellness program regulations, under which a reward offered by this type of wellness program must not exceed 20% of the cost of employee coverage under the plan.", "In addition, similar to the current regulations, a wellness program that conditions receipt of a reward based on an individual's satisfying a standard relating to a health status factor must be reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease.

The 340B discount is based on the average manufacturer price (AMP) reduced by the Medicaid rebate percentage of 15.1% for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, and 11% for non-innovator multiple source drugs. AMP is defined in Medicaid statute as the average price paid to the manufacturer by wholesalers for drugs distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade.

These new 340B-eligible facilities also would need to meet the specified 340B participation requirements.
