Annually, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) looks back at the past 10 years of disaster relief appropriations. For fiscal years prior to FY2012, OMB has identified appropriations associated with major disaster declarations for use in the calculation. For FY2012 and later years, OMB relies on explicit Congressional designations of appropriations as disaster relief pursuant to the BCA. OMB takes these 10 annual totals of disaster relief appropriations, drops the highest and lowest years, and averages the remaining 8. This modified average is then supplemented by any unused amounts from the average calculated for the previous fiscal year. This calculation generates a limit up to which the discretionary budget caps can be adjusted to accommodate appropriations on major disasters. In practice, this limitation on the size of the disaster relief adjustment has also limited the application of the disaster relief designation. Funds that would meet the definition of disaster relief may not be classified as such.", "Implementation of the disaster relief allowable adjustment has allowed Congress to fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to a greater degree through annual appropriations, rather than through supplemental appropriations as it had before enactment of the BCA. Allowing the discretionary budget limitations to be adjusted to pay for disaster costs has removed, to an extent, the costs of disaster relief from competing with other annual priorities for funding. However, the allowable adjustment is expected to drop significantly in the near future as two of the highest disaster cost years roll out of the calculated average used in setting the adjustment.", "This report examines how the adjustment has functioned over the first five years, and what the future of disaster relief (as defined by the BCA) may look like for the next five years and beyond. Under current law, the allowable adjustment is expected to decline from a high of almost $18.5 billion in FY2015 to between $7.5 billion and $9.5 billion by the time the BCA discretionary spending limits expire after FY2021.", "As Congress considers budget planning and potential changes to how it budgets for disaster assistance for a variety of different types of incidents, it may consider whether the allowable adjustment has worked as planned.

", "Reliance on this total of annual congressional disaster relief designations as a measure of major disaster costs is not wholly accurate either. Some major disaster costs are absorbed by federal agencies within their budgets after the completion of the appropriations cycle, when those costs were not anticipated. Congress also has chosen not to designate all costs of major disasters as \"disaster relief.\" The application of this designation has been limited to the allowable size of the disaster relief adjustment in a given year, with costs beyond that limit being designated by Congress as emergency funding.", " Figure 1 , below, shows the OMB-calculated amounts of disaster relief from FY2001 through FY2011, and the amount designated as disaster relief by Congress from FY2012 through FY2016 as solid bars on the chart.

Beginning in FY2017, the only other year in the data set with disaster relief spending in excess of $20 billion (FY2008), will be the high year, and therefore be excluded from the calculation for the allowable adjustment.

Due to the unpredictable nature of disasters, FEMA did not make annual projections. For purposes of developing a hypothetical scenario, CRS estimated annual levels by dividing the total projected spending for years two through five (FY2018-FY2021) evenly among those years. As noted above, given that the predominant usage of the allowable adjustment has been for the DRF, the DRF projection is being used as a surrogate for all disaster relief spending in this scenario.", "In this scenario, like the \"maximum usage\" scenario, the allowable adjustment declines through FY2018, but then rebounds in FY2019 to almost $9.7 billion due to the impact of carryover of unused adjustment from the prior year. This effect is temporary, as the carryover effect expires after a year. Lower levels of annual usage ultimately begin to impact the average and drive the allowable adjustment back down, falling to just above $8.4 billion in FY2021."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Minimum Usage Scenario", "paragraphs": [" Figure 6 shows a projected future scenario for the allowable adjustment based on a FEMA projection from November 2015, of anticipated usage of the DRF over the next five fiscal years, funding only the costs of previously declared disasters.

As noted above, given that the predominant usage of the allowable adjustment has been for the DRF, the DRF projection is being used as a surrogate for all disaster relief spending.", "In this scenario, the carryover has a greater impact, with the larger carryover from FY2017 boosting the allowable adjustment in FY2018 to a greater extent than in the medium scenario, and a larger-still carryover applied to FY2019 boosting the allowable adjustment to almost $10.8 billion. As in the medium usage scenario, lower levels of expenditure on disaster relief result in further decline in the underlying 10-year average in ensuing years, leading to a decline in the projected allowable adjustment to slightly less than $9.6 billion in FY2021. ", "To facilitate comparison, Figure 7 shows the maximum, medium, and minimum scenarios for the future of the disaster relief allowable adjustment in a single graphic. In the near term, lower usage of the allowable adjustment tends to support higher allowable adjustments due to the impact of carryover. However, those lower spending levels ultimately reduce the level of the adjustment by pulling down the average. As higher-usage years continue to roll out, if the BCA structure and allowable adjustment were continued past 2021 unchanged, the allowable adjustments in medium and minimum usage scenarios would continue to decline, while the allowable adjustment in the maximum usage scenario would remain relatively stable.

With each year, the calculation uses less of OMB's historical analysis, and more congressional designations of disaster relief appropriations, in its rolling average. These congressional designations have not been applied to all costs of major disasters, as noted above. One specific year of interest is FY2013. In FY2013, Congress provided $41.6 billion in supplemental disaster assistance in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in excess of the allowable adjustment\u2014assistance that was designated as emergency spending rather than disaster relief\u2014and therefore not included in the annual disaster relief total. This raises the question, what would be allowable adjustment look like if all the disaster assistance provided in FY2013 had been included in that year's disaster relief total?", "Had OMB's methodology been used to account for disaster relief spending in the 10 years prior to the enactment of the BCA been used in FY2013, virtually all of the funding provided in P.L. 113-2 would have been included in the total disaster relief for FY2013. As a result, the allowable adjustment would have been significantly higher for FY2014-FY2016. ", " Figure 8 illustrates the effect of including Sandy-related supplemental disaster assistance designated as emergency spending in the allowable adjustment calculation. With FY2013 becoming the new \"high year,\" other years with more than $20 billion in disaster relief remain part of the calculation for a longer period. Including Sandy-related supplemental disaster assistance in future allowable adjustment calculations would require a change in law. Options include retroactively designating the Hurricane Sandy funding as disaster spending, or modifying how OMB calculates the adjustment.", " Figure 9 further illustrates the effects of including disaster relief appropriations from P.L. 113-2 when calculating the allowable adjustment. Specifically, the maximum, medium, and minimum usage scenarios described above are recalculated, assuming inclusion of disaster relief appropriations from P.L. 113-2 . In this scenario, FY2013 becomes the new \"high year,\" making FY2005 disaster relief eligible for inclusion in the average for the first time and keeping FY2006 and FY2008 included in the calculation for more years than they would have otherwise. Larger carryovers are available in FY2015 and FY2016, but as existing levels went unused, and the allowable adjustment in future years still settles below $10 billion per year by FY2020. This exercise suggests that even if an exception was made to include more of the cost of catastrophic disasters, a single high year may have a limited impact on the level of the allowable adjustment over the long term because it is tossed out of the average as the \"high year.\" ", "Higher spending over multiple years\u2014such as the two years of higher disaster relief spending associated with the Gulf Coast hurricanes\u2014has a much greater impact.

By essentially removing the funding for the costs of major disasters from the debate on discretionary spending, the annual appropriation now more closely resembles the annual expenditure. Prior to the enactment of the BCA, there was an incentive to fund the DRF at lower amounts annually in favor of other priorities, with the assumption that any shortages could be made up through a supplemental appropriations bill should the need arise during the fiscal year. By making the majority of the DRF eligible for funding outside discretionary spending limits, the BCA removed that incentive, and it became easier to request and appropriate more budget authority for the DRF on an annual basis.", "As noted above, the allowable adjustment has largely been used to fund the DRF: yet both FY2015 and FY2016 consolidated appropriations bills funded other disaster accounts using the disaster relief designation. Use of the disaster relief designation and the allowable adjustment to more broadly pre-fund commonly used disaster relief accounts may allow some federal agencies to exercise their disaster response authorities after major disasters without waiting for emergency funding, or relying on transfers from other funded activities. However, removing the urgency from the supplemental appropriations process may have unintended consequences for programs whose agencies may anticipate relying on supplemental appropriations to fund their efforts.", "When Hurricane Sandy struck, a combination of two timely features ensured that the DRF had adequate resources to deal with the immediate needs presented by the storm: a $6.4 billion supplemental appropriation for the DRF in FY2012 and a continuing resolution for the beginning of FY2013 that provided interim funding for the DRF at a rate based on that large supplemental appropriation. The immediate availability of those resources may have allowed the Administration to move more deliberately in response to the storm than would have been the case had the DRF not been relatively flush\u2014for example, the Administration's request for supplemental appropriations was not sent to Congress until six weeks after the storm had passed. Other programs\u2014even some of those included in the supplemental request\u2014did not have the benefit of those ready resources, and had to rely on transfers or reprogramming of resources if they wished to move ahead, or wait for the passage of a supplemental appropriations bill."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Does the Allowable Adjustment Cover All Disaster Relief?

FMAGs authorize various forms of federal assistance such as the provision of equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for the control, management, and mitigation of any fire on public or private forest land or grassland that might become a major disaster. ", "Spending levels for emergency declarations and FMAGs are much lower than the spending level for major disaster declarations. From FY1992-FY2015, $155.60 billion was spent pursuant to major disaster declarations, an average of $6.48 billion per year. Over that same period, $4.23 billion was spent pursuant to emergency declarations and fire management grants, an average of $176 million per year\u2014less than 3% of spending on major disaster declarations.

Another significant example is the U.S. Forest Service (FS) and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) which provide assistance to suppress wildfires and protect lives. These examples of federal disaster assistance would not be part of the annual calculation of the allowable adjustment, specifically because of their lack of a nexus to a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. ", "Some might argue that the definition of disaster relief and the calculation of the allowable adjustment should capture all instances of federal disaster relief\u2014not just what is provided under the Stafford Act as a major disaster. Doing so would require much more complete reporting of disaster assistance spending, which in turn could allow for more thorough congressional oversight and policy innovation.", "It should be noted, however, that historically, obtaining a comprehensive financial picture of federal funding for disaster assistance has proven to be a difficult task for a variety of reasons: ", "It is difficult to identify all of the federal entities that provide disaster assistance because many federal entities provide aid through a wide range of programs, not necessarily through those designated specifically as \"disaster assistance\" programs. The degree of transparency in reporting funding levels for disaster relief varies tremendously among federal entities. As an example, Congress requires FEMA to submit monthly status reports on the DRF, detailing balances, obligations, allocations, and expenditures for a range of major disasters. This requirement has not been extended to other agencies, and limited data exist, particularly on a state-by-state or disaster-by-disaster basis, on other federal funding for emergencies and major disasters. Scoping what constitutes a disaster is difficult because disaster definitions vary by statute, regulation, and program. Some might argue that all these definitions should be combined to get an accurate measure of federal expenditures for disaster assistance. Others might argue it makes the universe of disaster assistance too broad and may include items such as emergency preparedness and mitigation efforts, livestock losses, economic disasters, and search and rescue missions.
