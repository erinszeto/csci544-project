Japan's current participation in the U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD) program dates fromAugust 1999, when the Japanese government agreed to conduct cooperative research on fourcomponents of the interceptor missile being developed for the then U.S. Navy Theater-Wide (NTW)anti-missile system--a sea-based \"upper tier\" (exo-atmospheric) capability against short- andmedium-range missiles up to 3,500 kilometers.", "In the spring of 2001, the Administration changed the context of the cooperative researcheffort when it reorganized and redirected the U.S. missile defense program to emphasize theemployment of specific technologies across the entire spectrum of missile defense challenges, butespecially to gain a limited, near-term capability to defeat missile attacks on U.S. territory by \"rogue\"states. The Pentagon redesignated the NTW program as the Sea-Based Midcourse System, with agoal of developing a capability for attacking missiles of all ranges in the initial or middle phases oftheir flight path. This change added to an already complex list of Japanese policy concerns, byputting Japan in the position of possibly cooperating in the development of technology that couldbecome part of an American national missile defense capability -- a step that many Japanese see astransgressing a constitutional ban on \"collective defense.\"", "Thus far, the Administration's program change has not deterred Japan from cooperativeresearch on missile defense, but the policy shift has unsettled Japanese leaders and created additionalpolitical obstacles to bilateral BMD cooperation. The new U.S. approach has been criticized in theJapanese press and the Diet (parliament), both because of the potential violation of the implied banon \"collective defense\" contained in Article 9 of Japan's U.S.-imposed \"Peace Constitution,\" and alsobecause the Bush initiative requires the United States to withdraw from the U.S.-RussianAnti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, which Tokyo has long regarded as an important element ofstrategic stability. An integrated U.S.-Japan BMD capability aimed at protecting third countrieswould raise the same constitutional issues.", "Japan has not made a decision regarding the acquisition of a missile defense capability. Japanese policymakers and defense firms generally are enthusiastic about missile defensecooperation, but the political parties, the media, and the general public are split over the issue. Proponents view BMD cooperation as a means to counter a perceived North Korean missile threat,and perhaps a Chinese threat as well. Other Japanese are fearful of aggravating relations with Chinaor triggering an Asian missile race. Even groups in Japan favoring BMD cooperation are concernedabout the large costs associated with the still-unproven technology. The popular Koizumiadministration seems inclined to finesse the constitutional issue, if possible.

Following China's firing of ballistic missiles in the vicinityof Taiwan during a Taiwan Strait confrontation in early 1996, Congress acted to support thedevelopment and deployment of a missile defense system explicitly oriented towards Asia and thewestern Pacific. Section 1533 of the FY1999 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 105-261 ,signed into law on October 17, 1998) required the Secretary of Defense to \"carry out a study of thearchitecture requirements for the establishment and operation of a theater ballistic missile defensesystem in the Asia-Pacific region that would have the capability to protect key regional allies of theUnited States,\" and to submit a report to Congress not later than January 1, 1999. The report wasto describe any U.S. missile defense system either currently deployed or being developed \"that couldbe transferred to key allies of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region to provide for theirself-defense against limited ballistic missile attacks.\" It was to be submitted in both classified andunclassified versions.

The report focusedon five ballistic missile defense systems currently under development for U.S. forces, and describedoptions for the defense of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan against an attack by fewer than fivemissiles of under 3,500 km (2,170) range. The report assumed that the missiles would not employspecial measures to evade destruction, such as the use of decoys or altered trajectories. Theunclassified version of the DoD report addressed hypothetical architectures for each country'ssituation, but did not attempt to suggest or describe any region-wide system architecture, nor did itaddress the most challenging types of threats.

Congress continued to show support for developing anddeploying a \"theater\" level missile defense capability in 2001, but also for more ambitiousdevelopment objectives that might allow TMD systems--especially the Navy's sea-based TMDcapability to serve as a basis for an early national missile defense capability. (3) For instance, on March 28,2001, Rep. Vitter introduced two related bills expressing strong support for an Asian missile defensecapability but also for upgrading the planned speed of the Navy Theater-Wide (NTW) interceptormissile to give it the ability to intercept North Korea's Taepo Dong I missile and Iran's Shahab 5missile, and requiring the Department of Defense to conduct at least one test against an incomingmissile with the flight characteristics, including velocity, of the Taepo Dong I. (4) Rep. Vitter also introduceda companion bill, the Defense Against Regional Threats Act of 2001, Sec. 2 of which would makeit U.S. policy \"to provide for deployment as soon as is technically possible of effective missiledefense systems capable of defending Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and all membernations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization against ballistic missile attack.\" Sec. 3 of the billwould make it U.S. policy \"to seek continued negotiated burdensharing agreements with the nationsspecified in section 2 to share the costs of development and deployment of ballistic missile defensesystems.\"", "Both H.R. 1282/1283 appeared to reflected impatience on the part of a number of Membersof Congress at the determination of the Clinton Administration to avoid testing or deploying missiledefense systems that would violate the ABM treaty. Although neither bill went beyond referral tothe Armed Services Committee, the proposed legislation implicitly supported the decision of theBush Administration to radically revamp the U.S. BMD program, with the goal of applying variousABM technologies across a range of missions, including the early deployment of a capability todefend U.S. territory against limited attacks by intercontinental-range ballistic missiles that mightbe launched by \"rogue\" states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BMD, NMD, and TMD -- What is the Difference?", "paragraphs": ["The United States military uses the term Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as a genericdesignation for systems designed to defend against ballistic missiles of whatever range--fromshort-range \"Scud\" type missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Thus, both TMDand National Missile Defense (NMD) systems are BMD systems. TMD systems are intended to bedeployed in a military theater of operations to defend against short-range and theater-range (up to3,500 km) ballistic missiles; NMD systems are intended to defend U.S. national territory againstcontinent-spanning missiles, i.e., ICBMs. Currently, both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy aredeveloping anti-missile systems for theater-wide defense, but the U.S. Defense Department haschosen the former Navy Theater Wide (NTW) anti-ballistic missile system, now designatedSea-Based Midcourse Defense (SMD), as the most appropriate system for an \"Asian\" TMD."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Bush Administration Policy Changes Related to U.S. NMD and TMD Programs", "paragraphs": ["In a series of policy statements beginning with a speech by the President at the NationalDefense University on May 1, 2001, the Bush Administration indicated an intention to enlarge andredirect current BMD programs in a way that tends to erase the clear distinction between TMD andNMD. The reasoning behind this decision appears to be at least two-fold. First, the relevanttechnologies are applicable across the whole range of BMD threats. Second, and relatedly, certainprograms currently in development for lower tier threats are deemed to have the potential, if suitablyenhanced, of serving as a stop-gap, near-term NMD capability in the absence of a full-scope NMDsystem.", "This reasoning applies particularly to the former Navy Theater Wide (NTW) program, whichhas been the focus of U.S.-Japan TMD cooperation. One possible sea-based option would buildupon the technologies being developed in the former NTW program to develop a system that couldbe deployed on the Navy's Aegis cruisers stationed off the U.S. Pacific coast, with the mission of intercepting ICBMs in mid-course, outside the atmosphere. Another concept is to deploy a sea-basedsystem in the Sea of Japan with a capability to intercept North Korean intercontinental missiles intheir assent, or \"boost\" phase, when they are most vulnerable. (5) A more technologicallyambitious concept under active consideration involves deploying aircraft with laser systems capableof destroying missiles in their boost phase.", "This report discusses and analyses the Administration's approach to missile defense and itsimplications for U.S.-Japan cooperation on missile defense, but the report's point of departure is thetraditional delineation of types of anti-missile systems based on the characteristics of the specificballistic missile threats that they seek to counter. In other words, the main ballistic missile threat toU.S. forward-deployed forces in the Asia-Pacific region, and to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, isfrom short- and medium-range, or \"theater\" range ballistic missiles."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Continuing Technological Distinctions", "paragraphs": ["Another reason not to lose sight of the NMD/TMD distinction is that from a technologicalperspective, the challenges involved in attacking ICBMs and theater-range missiles remain markedlydifferent. Even though some of the technology being developed in the NTW program would berelevant to the defense against strategic missiles, the design characteristics for Standard SM-3interceptor missile being developed for the NTW are deficient in speed and range for the task ofintercepting an ICBM. This is especially the case if the interceptor missile is launched from aposition that requires it to chase down an ICBM from behind. (6) Hence, if the United Statesdecides to deploy a sea-based system to protect the United States against ICBMs in their mid-courseor terminal phase, it may have to develop a more capable interceptor missile than is currently beingdeveloped to defend U.S. ships, bases, and port facilities against short-and medium-range ballisticmissiles. In addition to having a higher velocity and longer range, the job of intercepting anddestroying an ICBM may require a different kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) -- the cannister-shapedprojectile that smashes into the missile warhead. It also may need an upgraded sensor. ", "How challenging this requirement would be is a matter of some dispute. Critics of theClinton Administration's approach to TMD argued that the designed velocity of the interceptormissile had been artificially kept below 5 km/second in order to comply with 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile (ABM) Treaty with the former Soviet Union. They asserted that with relatively minortechnical changes the planned velocity of interceptor missile could and should be upgraded to betterdeal both with medium-range missile threats as well as ICBMs. (7) Others, including somesupporters of an early national or global defense capability based on the NTW/SMD technology, areconvinced that intercepting an ICBM will require a larger and faster missile than can be achievedby upgrading the Navy's Standard missile. (8) ", "As for other proposed \"contingency\" BMD systems aimed at defending U.S. territory againststrategic missiles, the relevance of the current technology cooperation between the United States andJapan is unclear. Some analysts argue that in theory, attacking missiles close to the point of launch-- as in the proposed boost-phase interceptor -- would require different sensors than those beingdesigned for the SMD. In action on the FY2002 defense authorization bill, both the House andSenate Armed Services Committees reduced the Defense Department's request for boost-phaseinterceptor testing on grounds that the concept design had not been completed. The Senate Reportnoted that \"Boost-phase technology is extremely challenging ....\" (9) Reportedly, the Departmentof Defense plans to seek Japanese cooperation on a Sea-based boost-phase interceptor in order togain access to Japanese sensor and early detection technology, (10) but such intention is notmentioned in the FY2003 Budget Justification of the Missile Defense Agency that was released atthe end of February 2002.

Both were intended to defend against short- and medium-range ballisticmissiles, but at different points in their flight path. The Navy Area Defense (NAD) system, was tobe the Navy's \"lower tier\" BMD program, providing local-area defense against ballistic missiles byintercepting them within the atmosphere. The NAD was roughly analogous to the Army's Patriot-3(PAC-3), also a lower tier system to protect military forces against high value targets from short-andmedium-ballistic missiles, such as the ubiquitous Scuds and their variants. The NAD was cancelledby the Pentagon in December 2001 because of poor performance of components and related unit costincreased which exceeded limits established by Congress. The Defense Department declined to useit authority to certify the program for continued funding. (12) Cancellation of the NAD leaves the Navy, for the moment,anyway, without any program under development to provide \"lower tier\" defense against ballisticmissiles, and none against cruise missiles. (13) ", "The second Navy missile defense program, now called Sea-Based Midcourse Defense(SMD), which has been the object of U.S.-Japan cooperation, remains intact and may be accelerated. There are, however, several uncertainties about the future of this system. One is technological. Thebasic building block of the SMD is the same Standard Missile that was to be employed by the NAD,but with much higher performance characteristics than the cancelled lower tier system. Also, theformer NTW had been described as \"the least mature\" of the various systems under development bythe Pentagon by one expert. (14) Another uncertainty arises from the determination of thePentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Office (BMDO) -- redesignated the Missile Defense Agency(MDA) in January 2002, to acquire an early sea-based NMD capability, and the eagerness of theNavy to provide the platform for an NMD capability. These changes raise some questions aboutorganizational lines of control between the MDA and the Navy, and mission priorities.", "Navy plans had called for the NTW system to enter service around FY2010. As of February2002, the Pentagon anticipates that the Sea-Based Midcourse System could achieve initial capabilityfor short- and intermediate-range sea-based missile defense by about 2006, with an ICBM capabilityto come several years later. (15) In the past, these estimates have been subject to considerablechange, depending on test results and other factors.", "The program called Sea-Based Midcourse Defense (SMD) is designed to achieve a capabilityto intercept short- and medium ballistic missiles in mid-course or in their early terminal phase, andto defend a much larger geographic area than the canceled NAD. The SMD is designed to interceptenemy missiles at altitudes above the atmosphere (i.e., exo-atmospheric intercept) and destroy themwith a hit-to-kill kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) called the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile(LEAP).", "Intercepting a ballistic missile in midcourse, i.e. above the atmosphere, requires differenttechnology than intercepting a missile in its terminal phase, when it has reentered the atmosphere. A missile within the atmosphere follows a flight path that is affected by air pressure on its reentryvehicle (nose cone with warhead), whereas a missile in mid-course--above the atmosphere--followsa more predictable ballistic trajectory.", "Figure 1 shows the different areas of coverage that would be provided by the now-cancelledNAD system--or any replacement terminal missile defense system, and the Sea-Based MidcourseDefense system. If the latter achieves its design objectives, an appropriately positionedAegis-equipped ship deploying the SMD could -- for instance -- shield most of Japan from an attackby a North Korean missile.

Japan declined to participate but did partly relax its post-World War II arms export ban to open theway for sharing military and dual use technology with the United States. Subsequently, Japan sharedtechnology with the United States for several weapons systems, including portable surface-air missile(SAM) systems, naval ship construction, a ducted rocket engine, and the controversial FS-X,next-generation fighter program.", "The FS-X collaboration, which involved transfer of technology used in the USAF's F-16fighter, produced by what was then General Dynamics, proved a searing experience for the Japanese. It is widely accepted among students of US-Japan alliance relations that the Japanese government,backed by domestic industry and influential Diet Members, strongly preferred to develop anindigenous fighter aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of F-1 fighters, but decided reluctantly that themaintenance of smooth alliance relations required yielding to pressure from the ReaganAdministration for co-development. Among other considerations for the Nakasone government inTokyo, the Reagan Administration had imposed stiff sanctions on semiconductor imports as a resultof Japan's failure to meet the terms of a trade agreement, and Members of Congress were stronglycriticizing Japan and the Toshiba Corporation for the sale of some sensitive U.S. metal millingtechnology to the then-Soviet Union.

Opponents of the FS-X cooperationdeal were concerned that Japan might use U.S.-supplied technology to erode the U.S. lead inaerospace production, one of the few areas of U.S. high technology dominance that had not beenconquered by Japanese industry. In early February 1989 the newly inaugurated George H. W. Bushadministration yielded to these pressures and initiated a policy review that eventually required Japanto renegotiate the terms of technology transfer in the co-development project.

(67) While campaigning forthe LDP presidency, Koizumi said that he would give high priority to constitutional revision, butsince taking office he has given first priority to his call for the direct election of the Prime Minister,and appears to have downgraded the urgency of revising Article 9, while calling for continueddiscussion of the issue. The Prime Minister's caution may reflect repeated polls consistently showingthat 70% or more of the respondents oppose revising Article 9. (68) ", "3) Impact of Japan's active involvement in regional deploymentof a BMD system on U.S. operational flexibility. Given the historical mistrust ofJapan's intentions and programs among its Asian neighbors, a highly visible involvement by Japanin missile defense, were it otherwise possible, could have negative implications for U.S. securityinterests in Asia. China, for instance, might see an integrated U.S.-Japan BMD capability as morethreatening to its interests than a U.S. system alone, because of the implication that Japan is joininga de facto collective security arrangement that is aimed at China, especially in a confrontationinvolving Taiwan. China and other neighboring countries may be less than convinced that Article9 will continue to inhibit Japan's participation in collective security with the United States, especiallybecause the restriction has become the target of nationalist opposition in Japan. Thus for China,North and South Korea, and some Southeast Asian countries, an integrated U.S.-Japan BMD systemcould be viewed as symbolizing the remilitarization of Japan under the cloak of alliance cooperationwith the United States. To the extent that joint BMD deployment generated fears of a rearmedJapan, it could detract from the acceptability of a U.S. BMD capability.", "On the other side of the equation, Japan's neighbors are likely to regard an independentJapanese BMD with even greater concern. For some of Japan's neighbors, such as South Korea, aJapanese capability firmly linked to that of the United States would seem more desirable. China, onthe other hand, opposes both deployment options.", "4) Command, control, communication, and intelligence (C\u00c2\u00b3I)issues. These could be critical issues in the case of an integrated U.S.-JapaneseBMD capability. To what degree would the United States be dependent on the decision-makingcapability of the Japanese Cabinet, which has yet to develop effective crisis managementcapabilities? Would, some ask, Japan allow a U.S. commander to control the \"button\" that wouldactivate a joint system? This would be most unlikely, according to Japanese sources? (69) ", "A similar dilemma could arise if U.S. and Japanese missiles were integrated into a jointsensor and command and control system. In scenarios that do not involve the defense of Japaneseterritory, such as the deployment of U.S. BMD systems to protect Taiwan, the question arises as towhether Japan could or would allow the involvement of jointly operated satellite and command andcontrol facilities. Several defense commentators and private analysts have suggested that thisproblem could be circumvented by the creation of a joint command and control system that wouldalso allow either party to act independently, if necessary. (70) ", "Japanese officials and defense analysts are well aware of the inadequacy of their current crisismanagement and C\u00c2\u00b3 capabilities. Prime Minister Koizumi reportedly hopes to succeed where hisrecent predecessors have failed in getting the Diet to approve legislation giving him the emergencypowers necessary for crisis decisionmaking. As of early 2002, however, the prospects for theintroduction of such legislation remain doubtful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The United States and Japan have shared concerns about the proliferation of ballistic missilesin Asia and, therefore, a shared interest in the theater missile defense. The technological andfinancial contributions that Japan may bring into cooperative research on the Sea-Based MidcourseSystem element of the U.S. BMD program are potentially significant, although not critical. Japancontinues to keep its options open regarding the acquisition and deployment of a BMD capability. Subject to flexible enough rules of engagement and crisis management capabilities, Japan'spossession of an operationally compatible BMD capability would contribute importantly to theability of U.S. military forces to deploy an effective missile defense system in the Asian region, asseems to be envisioned by BMD supporters in Congress and the Bush Administration. Also, the veryfeasibility of deploying a BMD system in Asia depends on the availability of bases in Japan, mostnotably the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka, on Tokyo Bay, which is the home port for the U.S. SeventhFleet.", "Considering the wide range of issues that the Japanese government must resolve beforeproceeding with a decision to acquire a BMD capability, the future of an interoperable U.S.-Japancapability cannot be taken for granted, let alone an integrated binational system. On the positiveside, Japanese defense officials seem clearly to be leaning in the direction of at least a national BMDcapability that would be interoperable with that of the United States. Even if Japan does opt toprocure and deploy an operationally compatible BMD system, however, it remains highlyquestionable whether Japan will agree to an integrated command and control arrangement. Atpresent, a substantial majority of the Japanese public appears opposed to constitutional changes thatwould allow collective self-defense, either for missile defense or other purposes.", "Senior Bush Administration officials, most notably Deputy Secretary of Defense Armitage,have expressed a strong desire for Japan to address the constitutional constraints. Were Japan toamend or reinterpret Article 9, however, Japanese policy would still be based on its national interestperceptions. Thus any decision by Japan to opt for joint deployment of a BMD capability would itself raise additional foreign policy issues for Japan and operational challenges for U.S. forces.", "Several of these foreign policy issues are trilateral rather than bilateral. For instance,Japanese policy could turn on the evolution of U.S. relations with the PRC and Taiwan, and whetheror not the United States succeeds in negotiations to eliminate the North Korean missile threat. NorthKorea's Taepo Dong launch of August 1998 provided an important public relations asset to BMDsupporters in Japan. On the other hand, a number of indicators suggest that the main concern amongdefense analysts and planners in Japan, and those in the political world who think about suchmatters, is fear that China may one day threaten Japan with ballistic missiles. From this perspective,a missile defense capability is one means to counter China's rising military power.", "It is difficult to assess the impact of future political change on Japanese decisionmakingconcerning BMD cooperation, especially regarding any matters touching on the constitution. Ingeneral, political change since the split in the LDP in July 1993 seems not to have had muchperceptible impact on the trend towards a more assertive defense posture and increased U.S.-Japansecurity cooperation. Because of the steady decline of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ),the two most likely alternatives to the status quo are a revitalized Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ),which remains divided between former members of the SDPJ and more conservative defectors fromthe LDP, and the more nationalistic wing of the LDP, as represented by Shintaro Ishiharo, thepopular, iconoclastic Governor the Tokyo Metropolitan Prefecture. For different reasons, neitherof these alternatives to the political status quo has been enthusiastic about missile defensecooperation with the United States. What stance they would take were they to attain power isdifficult to forecast with any confidence.", "Another imponderable at this time is the longer term prospect for retaining U.S. bases inJapan. At present, the principal targets of public opposition to U.S. bases in Japan are facilities inOkinawa whose training and other operations have a large impact on the environment and qualityof life. These mainly involve the U.S. Marines stationed there. In general, U.S. Navy and Air Forcebases receive less criticism. Nonetheless, some of the same groups that support a defense buildupand closer alliance relations are ambivalent about hosting a major U.S. military presence more thanfive decades after the end of the U.S. post-World War II occupation. Already, Okinawans havesucceeded in getting the Japanese government to \"relay\" their desire to put a fifteen year limit on useby the U.S. Marines of a proposed replacement for the current Futenma Marine Air Station. Fornow, issues concerning U.S. access to bases in Japan are limited to Okinawa, and to forces that donot relate to BMD. Should this situation change, it would become more difficult for the United Statesto maintain an \"Asian\" BMD capability. (71) ", "Japan's involvement in joint development of the SMD element of the U.S. missile defenseprogram represents considerable progress by Japan towards greater alliance burden sharing, but itsfull implications remain to be seen. Neither Japan's participation in joint research and development,nor a decision by Japan for or against acquisition or deployment of a BMD capability, are likely tohave critical impact on the development of a U.S. missile defense capability or on the deploymentof an American sea-based capability in Asia. Nonetheless, Japan's participation in the research anddevelopment phase is viewed by U.S. officials as possibly contributing important technology, anda decision by Tokyo to acquire a BMD capability could have considerable foreign policy significancefor the United States and important military implications. Given the prevailing uncertainties aboutJapanese policy and the implications of its future decisions, Congress may decide to considercarefully the assumptions of the Administration and the terms of any further steps in BMDcooperation with Japan. Part of such consideration could be obtaining additional information on thethreat perceptions of the Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) and Self-Defense Forces (SDF), thepossible implications of a change in the perceived threat from North Korea's missiles, the attitudeof Japanese political leaders and Ministry of Foreign Affairs policymakers towards China, Japan'sfiscal situation and defense budget trends, public and political attitudes towards U.S.-Japan securitycooperation and U.S. bases in Japan, and the prospects for constitutional revision and the acquisitionof emergency powers by the Japanese national command authorities."], "subsections": []}]}}
