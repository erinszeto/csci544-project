H.R. 5855, the House-passed DHS appropriations bill in the 112th Congress, would have provided $39.114 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, while S. 3126, its Senate-reported counterpart in the 112th Congress, would have provided $39.514 billion.", "Congress did not enact final FY2013 appropriations legislation prior to the end of FY2012. From October 1, 2012, through March 26, 2013, the federal government (including DHS) operated under the terms of P.L. 112-175, a part-year continuing resolution. While operating under this resolution, two major events impacted the DHS budget. First, Hurricane Sandy struck the east coast of the United States, which started a legislative process that resulted in enactment of legislation that provided $50.7 billion in disaster relief and emergency appropriations, including $12.072 billion for DHS, and $9.7 billion in additional borrowing authority for the National Flood Insurance Program. Weeks later, On March 1, 2013, an across-the-board reduction in budget authority, or sequestration, was ordered as required under the terms of the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25). The Office of Management and Budget's sequestration report indicated that DHS would lose $3.191 billion as a result of sequestration.", "On March 26, 2013, the President signed into law P.L. 113-6, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. Division D of that act is the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013, which includes $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. Two across-the-board cuts unrelated to the March 1 sequestration that were included in the final legislation to ensure the bill complies with discretionary budget caps reduced this by $54 million to $39.592 billion.", "The above enacted funding levels for FY2013 are subject to sequestration cuts.

Because deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by that date, an automatic spending reduction process established by the BCA was triggered; this process consists of a combination of sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, initially scheduled to begin on January 2, 2013. The \"joint committee\" sequestration process for FY2013 required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding at a percentage to be determined after enactment, under terms specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), as amended by the BCA. For further information on the Budget Control Act, see CRS Report R41965, The Budget Control Act of 2011 , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed].", "The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA), enacted on January 2, 2013, made a number of significant changes to the procedures in the BCA that will take place during FY2013. First, the date for the joint committee sequester to be implemented was delayed for two months, until March 1, 2013. Second, the dollar amount of the joint committee sequester was reduced by $24 billion. Third, the statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 (and FY2014) were lowered.", "Pursuant to the BCA, as amended by ATRA, President Obama ordered that the joint committee sequester be implemented on March 1, 2013. The accompanying OMB report indicated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled to each account containing non-exempt funds. The sequester will ultimately be applied at the program, project, and activity (PPA) level within each account. Because the sequester was implemented at the time that a temporary continuing resolution was in force, the reductions were calculated on an annualized basis and will be apportioned throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Although full year FY2013 funding has been enacted, the effect of these reductions on the budgetary resources that will ultimately be available to an agency at either the account or PPA level remain unclear until further guidance is provided by OMB as to how these reductions should be applied.

As enacted, Section 3001 provides two separate across-the-board rescissions\u2014one for \"nonsecurity\" budget authority and one for \"security\" budget authority \u2014to be applied at the program, project, and activity level. DHS falls under the \"security\" category, and therefore receives a 0.1% across-the-board cut. This across-the-board cut was made to bring the bill's budget authority as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office in line with the FY2013 discretionary spending limits.", "However, the Office of Management and Budget is the final arbiter of whether those spending limits have been exceeded. Therefore, Section 3004 provides two other separate across-the-board rescissions\u2014again, one for nonsecurity budget authority and one for security budget authority\u2014to be applied at the program, project, and activity level. The section requires the percentages to be increased if OMB estimates that additional rescissions are needed to avoid exceeding the limits. Subsequent to the enactment of P.L. 113-6 , OMB calculated that additional rescissions of 0.032% of \"security\" budget authority (which would apply to DHS) and 0.2% of \"nonsecurity\" budget authority would be required. ", "Since these cuts were intended to reduce the amount of discretionary budget authority in the bill, funding that is not included in that total\u2014specifically funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and funding designated as being for disaster relief under the Budget Control Act\u2014are not subject to the across-the-board cuts.
