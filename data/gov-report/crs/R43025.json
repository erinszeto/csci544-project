All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have earned a part of the $424 million in Adoption Incentive funds that have been awarded since the program was established as part of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA, P.L. 105-89). Discretionary funding authorized for this program has been extended twice since it was established, most recently in 2008 (P.L. 110-351).", "Although funding authority for the Adoption Incentive program expired on September 30, 2013, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) permits states to continue to receive the Adoption Incentive payments and appropriates $37.9 million for them. In addition, Title II of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (H.R. 4980), which was introduced on June 26, 2014, would extend current annual discretionary funding authority ($43 million) for Adoption Incentive payments through FY2016. Beyond this, Title II of H.R. 4980 would add incentive payments for states that make improvements in appropriately moving children from foster care to legal guardianship and would determine awards based on the percentage (or rate) of children leaving foster care to adoption and/or guardianship, instead of the absolute number of children leaving. In similar statements issued on June 26, 2014, by the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance, Representatives Camp and Levin, along with Senators Wyden and Hatch, announced H.R. 4980 as \"bipartisan legislation [that] reflects agreements reached between House and Senate negotiators\" on legislation previously approved in the House and in the Senate Finance Committee. Specifically, Title II of H.R. 4980 draws on H.R. 3205, passed by the House in October 2013, and provisions included in Title I of S. 1870, approved by the Senate Finance Committee in December 2013.", "Congress has long shown interest in improving the chances of adoption for children who cannot return to their parents and who might otherwise spend their childhoods in temporary foster homes before \"aging out\" of foster care. Since ASFA's enactment in 1997, the annual number of children leaving foster care for adoption has risen from roughly 30,000 to more than 50,000 and the average length of time it took states to complete the adoption of a child from foster care declined by close to one year (from about four years to less than three). Over the same time period, and in significant measure due to the greater number of children leaving foster care for adoption and at a faster pace, the overall number of children who remain in foster care declined by 29%\u2014from a peak of 567,000 in FY1999 to 400,000 in FY2012. Despite these successes, however, the number of children \"waiting for adoption\" (102,000 on the last day of FY2012) remains about double the number of children who are adopted during a given year. Adoptions of older children remain far less common than adoptions of younger children, and some 23,000 youth aged out of foster care in FY2012, compared to just 19,000 in FY1999.", "Under the current award structure, a state's adoption incentive payment equals the specified incentive amount for a given category of adoptions multiplied by the number of adoptions in the category that is above the number completed by the state in FY2007. The specified incentive amount is $4,000 for foster child adoptions, $8,000 for older child (9 years or more) adoptions, and\u2014provided a state is eligible for an incentive in another award category\u2014$4,000 for special needs (under age 9) adoptions. Additionally, if sufficient appropriations are available in the fiscal year, a state may also earn incentive payments for improving the rate (or percentage) of foster child adoptions. In the five years (FY2008-FY2012) that this incentive structure has been in place, states received combined incentive payments of nearly $202 million, including $95 million for increases in the number of foster child adoptions, $57 million for increases in older child adoptions, and $48 million for increases in special needs (under age 9) adoptions. They also received about $2 million for increases in the rate of foster child adoptions. (This amount was significantly less than the nearly $12 million states were eligible to receive based on improved adoption rates. However, that full amount was not paid because nearly all appropriations provided were needed to make incentive payments for increased numbers of adoptions.)", "States are permitted to use Adoption Incentive payments to support a broad range of child welfare services to children and families. Many states report spending incentive funds on adoption-related child welfare purposes, including post-adoption support services, recruitment of adoptive homes, and training or conferences to improve adoption casework. A smaller number of states report using these funds for adoption assistance payments, improved adoption homes studies, child protection casework, foster care maintenance payments, or other child welfare purposes.", "In addition to amending and extending Adoption Incentive payments, Title II of H.R. 4980 would extend funding for Family Connection Grants (Section 427 of the Social Security Act) for one year, add new reporting and spending requirements for states with regard to certain federal funds they receive under the adoption assistance component of the Title IV-E program, and make possible continued federal Title IV-E guardianship assistance eligibility for children already receiving that assistance who are subsequently placed with a \"successor guardian.\" Additionally, the bill would make changes to federal foster care requirements intended to further facilitate placement of siblings together while in foster care."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Adoption Incentive program (Section 473A of the Social Security Act) provides federal payments to state child welfare agencies that increase adoptions of children who are in need of new permanent families.

A rigorous study of the model's effectiveness found that children served under this recruitment and placement model were one and a half times more likely to leave foster care for permanent homes than those who received traditional adoptive home recruitment services. The model's impact is greatest among older children and those with mental health disorders.

Interested families may begin the adoption process at the event, where speakers stress that adoption is about meeting the needs of the child (not the needs of adults), discuss common behavioral challenges for adoptees from foster care, and offer strategies to enable successful child and family outcomes.

One witness asked that the longer-standing federal focus and financial support for increasing adoptions be coupled with a greater focus on (and financial support for) post-adoption services and suggested that Congress require states to spend their Adoption Incentive funds on post-adoption support. Another asked that Congress ensure that children who were adopted did not lose access to education, mental health-related, or other services that would be available to them if they remained in foster care.

Additionally, one witness asserted the need for child welfare agencies to place a greater value on finding and involving family members in meeting the needs of the children they serve.

In 1978, the Adoption Opportunities program (Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act, P.L. 95-266 ) was enacted to require federal administrative coordination of adoption and foster care programs and to support research and other activities to \"facilitate elimination of barriers to adoption and to provide permanent and loving home environments for children who would benefit from adoption, particularly children with special needs.\" In 1980, Congress enacted the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act ( P.L. 96-272 ), including the first federal support for ongoing subsidies to eligible adoptees with \"special needs\" (under a new Title IV-E of the Social Security Act). In this context the \"special needs\" designation applies to children in need of new permanent families (i.e., they cannot be returned to their parents) and who have conditions or factors that make it harder to find them adoptive homes without offering assistance.

As part of that law, Congress made changes to federal child welfare policy that were intended to ensure that states focused on achieving expeditious permanence for children in foster care, including through adoptions whenever appropriate. Among other changes, the law tightened or added new permanency planning timelines for children in foster care, required states to spend certain federal child welfare funds (under the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program) for adoption promotion and support services, and authorized financial incentives to states that increase adoptions of children out of foster care under the newly created Adoption Incentive program.", "In 2008, as part of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act ( P.L. 110-351 )\u2014and in addition to extending the Adoption Incentive program\u2014Congress expanded eligibility for federal (Title IV-E) adoption assistance principally by removing income criteria tied to the family from which a child had been removed (usually this is the child's biological family).

All children who leave public foster care for adoption are adopted with public child welfare agency involvement and they represent the very large number of children shown in the adoption column. A small number of children who do not enter foster care may also be adopted with public child welfare agency involvement and that number is also included in the number shown in the adoptions column.", "Appendix D. Adoption Incentive Payments ", "At each reauthorization of the Adoption Incentive program, Congress has adjusted the incentive structure. New award categories and adjustments to the baselines have placed greater emphasis on adoption of harder to place children, helped to ensure that earning an incentive was possible even as caseloads declined, and protected the value of the incentive payments from erosion by inflation.", "Appendix E.
