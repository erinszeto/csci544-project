Since the mid-1990s, Qatari leaders have overseen a course of major economic growth, increased diplomatic engagement, and limited political liberalization. The Qatari monarchy founded Al Jazeera, the first all-news Arabic language satellite television network, in 1995. Over time, the network has proven to be as influential and, at times, as controversial as the policies of its founders, including during recent unrest in the Arab world.", "In June 2013, Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani abdicated in favor of his son Tamim bin Hamad, marking the first voluntary and planned transition of power in Qatar since it became an independent country in 1971. In a 2003 referendum, Qatari voters approved a new constitution that officially granted women the right to vote and run for national office. The constitution envisions elections for two-thirds of the seats in a national Advisory Council. However, elections have not been scheduled, and the term of the current Advisory Council has been extended to 2016. Central Municipal Council elections were last held in May 2011.", "Following joint military operations during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Qatar and the United States concluded a defense cooperation agreement that has been subsequently expanded and was renewed in 2013.

Al Udeid and other facilities in Qatar serve as logistics, command, and basing hubs for the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) area of operations.

According to the report, \"The government made efforts to prevent and eliminate forced labor, although the existence of the restrictive sponsorship system left some migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation.\" These concerns are drawing increased attention as Qatar implements large scale infrastructure projects in preparation for hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup.", "Qatari officials have positioned themselves as mediators and interlocutors in a number of regional conflicts in recent years. Qatar's deployment of military aircraft to support NATO-led operations in Libya and U.S.-led operations against the Islamic State in Syria signaled a new assertiveness, as has reported Qatari support for armed elements of the Syrian opposition. Some of Qatar's positions have drawn U.S. scrutiny and raised the ire of its Gulf Arab neighbors, including its leaders' willingness to engage Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Taliban and allegations of Qatari support for extremists in Syria. It remains unclear whether Qatar's active and\u2014for the United States\u2014at times vexing policies may change under Emir Tamim.

Qatari-U.S. defense relations have expanded to include cooperative defense exercises, equipment pre-positioning, and base access agreements. U.S. concerns regarding alleged material support for terrorist groups by some Qataris, including reported past support by a prominent member of the royal family, have been balanced over time by Qatar's counterterrorism efforts and its broader, long-term commitment to host and support U.S. military forces active in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the rest of the CENTCOM area of responsibility.

Secretary Hagel visited Doha in July 2014 and announced the sale of more than $11 billion in weapons and air defense systems previously notified to Congress. The sale of Patriot missile batteries, Apache attack helicopters, and Javelin anti-tank missiles marks the highest value sale of U.S. weaponry to date in 2014. Qatar's purchase of U.S. weapons systems, including U.S. air and missile defense systems, corresponds to trends that have seen increased interest in such systems from other governments in the region, ostensibly to defend against potential missile attacks from Iran.

However, Qatar has the third-largest gas reserves in the world, an estimated 25.2 trillion cubic meters (tcm). Qatar Petroleum (QP), the state-owned oil and natural gas company, increased its crude oil output from 593,000 barrels per day (b/d) in 1999 to approximately 824,000 b/d in December 2008. However, production has been lowered closer to 700,000 b/d as investments are made in technology to extend the life and productivity of the country's oil fields. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Japan and South Korea are the top importers of Qatari oil. ", "As part of a long-term development strategy, Qatar has tapped international financial markets and invited foreign investment in order to finance the expansion of its gas extraction and liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export facilities. U.S. companies, particularly ExxonMobil, are partners in most of Qatar's LNG export projects. The Export-Import Bank of the United States has provided over $1 billion in loan guarantees to support the development of Qatar's gas production facilities in cooperation with a range of U.S., European, and Asian companies, banks, and export credit agencies. Qatar expanded its yearly natural gas production from 31.4 billion cubic meters annually in 2002 to 158.5 billion cubic meters in 2013, and is now the world's largest exporter of LNG. More than 60% of Qatari LNG exports go to Asian markets, and most export sales are conducted under the auspices of multi-year supply-purchase arrangements. The large natural gas production and shipping facilities at the coastal city of Ras Laffan in northern Qatar serve as the main site for the country's gas development projects, including the world's largest gas-to-liquids facility. Qatar owns numerous LNG import terminals in other countries, including the United States. Qatar participates in and hosts the headquarters of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, an assembly of major gas exporting countries that some have described as a potential natural gas OPEC.", "Qatar has paused its rapid expansion of export-oriented natural gas projects through 2015 in expectation of clearer market signals about long-term investment needs. However, limited off-shore exploration activities are now underway. Global economic uncertainty and natural gas market changes have complicated global demand projections for Qatari energy exports. However, steady growth in regional energy consumption and the recent effects of regional unrest have created new opportunities for growth. For example, Jordan is constructing a new LNG import terminal at Aqaba to relieve pressure placed on Jordanian supplies by unrest in Egypt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S.-Qatar Trade", "paragraphs": ["According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the value of U.S. exports to Qatar reached $4.95 billion in 2013, consisting mainly of transport equipment, manufactured goods, and machinery\u2014up from $3.57 billion over the same period in 2012. The value of U.S. imports from Qatar, mainly oil, totaled $1.3 billion in 2013 up from $1.01 billion in 2012. U.S. crude oil imports from Qatar have declined to zero, but U.S. imports of Qatari petroleum products have grown. Reflecting the impact of the increase in U.S. domestic natural gas production, U.S. LNG imports from Qatar declined from a peak of 90.9 million cubic feet in 2011 to zero beginning in April 2013.

However, Qatar and the United States did sign a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in April 2004.\" Qatar has made a series of large investments in the United States in recent years, including a real estate investment in the City Center project in Washington, DC. In November 2013, Qatar Airways signed a letter of intent to purchase 50 additional Boeing 777 airplanes in a deal that may be worth more than $19 billion. As noted above (See \" U.S. Military Cooperation and Foreign Assistance \"), Qatar's purchase of U.S. arms and defense equipment also should contribute to an expansion in the value of U.S. exports in coming years.

Emir Tamim and his government appear to be taking an equally active, if quieter approach to diplomacy than that of the emir's father and his counterparts. Nevertheless, increasing scrutiny is being applied by some observers to Qatar's relationships with Islamists and certain armed groups. Most observers expect Qatari policy makers to favor policies that will consolidate the political and economic gains that Qatar has made in recent years and set the country on a sustainable path. Expanding U.S.-Qatari defense relations also may signal a stronger commitment on the part of the new Emir to invest in relations with the United States. Decision makers in the United States appear likely to continue to debate how best to maintain improved defense and counterterrorism relations with Qatar while seeking to address more challenging issues related to regional security, human rights, political reform, and labor conditions."], "subsections": []}]}}
