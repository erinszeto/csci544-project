Striking an appropriate balance of responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, and accountability in the provision of federal assistance programs during and following a disaster remains a difficult goal.", "Federal leadership for mental health and substance abuse programs resides in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). SAMHSA carries out numerous activities to address mental health and substance abuse problems following disasters, including the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), which is authorized in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) and implemented jointly by SAMHSA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).", "The response to the 2005 hurricanes has prompted a re-examination of CCP and other federal assistance programs that address disaster mental health. Concerns include the timeliness and effectiveness of services provided, the appropriate scope and duration of these services, and matters of cost and accountability. In particular, the respective roles and responsibilities of SAMHSA (which provides technical expertise for CCP programs), FEMA (which funds them), and states and their contractors (which implement them), are not always clear.", "Following a news investigation, some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about Project H.O.P.E., the CCP program implemented in Florida in response to Hurricane Wilma. Others have sought to expand CCP to provide substance abuse services, and to require that SAMHSA, other federal agencies, and state and local governments conduct resource assessments and develop strategies to address mental health and substance abuse service needs following disasters. (See S. 3721, reported in the Senate.)", "This report describes federal assistance programs in HHS that address mental health and substance abuse problems following disasters. In addition, relevant policy issues are presented in the context of the 2005 hurricanes, and several prior disasters.

According to government sources, the storm, one of the worst natural disasters in the nation's history, killed at least 1,464 people in Louisiana, more than 200 in Mississippi, and about 20 more in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Hurricane Rita made landfall along the Gulf Coast in late September 2005. While not as deadly, Rita re-flooded New Orleans and impacted other areas where Katrina evacuees were struggling to recover. (Rita was directly responsible for seven deaths and 55 \"indirect\" deaths, some during the pre-storm evacuation.) Hurricane Wilma made landfall in south Florida in late October 2005, killing five people and also causing extensive damage. These three hurricanes, as well as hurricanes Dennis and Ophelia and Tropical Storm Cindy, each resulted in federal disaster declarations for affected areas in 2005.", "Previous research has shown that substance abuse and various manifestations of mental illness\u2014including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidality\u2014often occur or worsen following disasters, and that some effects may persist for years. Early studies suggest a similar trend in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These disasters were especially challenging, given the extensive relocation of victims, the loss of the medical records of victims with pre-existing conditions, and the loss of infrastructure and healthcare workers to support the response. It is reported, for example, that New Orleans now has only about one-third of the 462 psychiatric beds it had before Hurricane Katrina, though the remaining population is at more than half of the city's pre-storm level, and, by some accounts, has an even greater need for the beds.", "In 1974, Congress enacted broad disaster assistance legislation, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act). Section 416 of the act provides authority, when there is a presidentially declared disaster, for federal assistance to state and local governments to address the mental health needs of victims. Called the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), the program met its first major challenge with the bombing of the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995. Funding for the program that was established by Oklahoma in response, named Project Heartland , was extended several times to accommodate the immediate needs of victims as well as the stress experienced by victims in the long term, such as during the trials of the accused bombers. Following the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, New York established a CCP program, called Project Liberty , to assist victims in the greater New York City area. Funding for Project Liberty was also extended several times. CCP programs were established in 29 states in response to Hurricane Katrina, reflecting the widespread dislocation of the storm's victims. One year later, with many victims still facing problems with mental illness, 17 states have asked for program extensions. These include Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi, which were directly affected, and 13 states that hosted hurricane evacuees.", "The objective of CCP is to help disaster victims understand the breadth of normal behavioral responses to stressful events, recognize which responses may warrant specific intervention (including professional treatment), and locate follow-up services when needed. CCP is not designed to provide or pay for medical, including psychiatric, treatment for those victims who may need it. Rather, victims needing treatment are to be referred to existing service systems. Given that many Americans lack health insurance, and that mental health and substance abuse services may not be adequately covered for those who are insured, Congress and others remain concerned that, despite CCP and other federal assistance programs, the mental health and substance abuse treatment needs of many disaster victims may go unmet.", "In October 2006, a local newspaper ran a story questioning a number of aspects of Project H.O.P.E ., the CCP program established by the state of Florida in response to Hurricane Wilma. The story, which raised questions about the effectiveness of the program in targeting victims and in addressing their mental health needs, prompted calls by some Members of Congress for investigations.", "This report describes CCP and other programs administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS) to provide federal assistance for the mental health and substance abuse treatment needs of disaster victims. (When a disaster is caused by terrorism or other forms of violence, a number of federal programs to assist victims of violence may be available through the Department of Justice or other agencies. Those assistance mechanisms are not discussed here. ) Several issues associated with CCP are discussed, including whether the services provided are well matched to need, and whether the effectiveness of the program has been demonstrated.

(See the subsequent section on \" Scope of Mental Health Services under CCP .\") Congress has amended CCP authority only once since it was first enacted in 1974. In 1988, Congress removed a reference to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the institute within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that was originally responsible for administering CCP.", "Through executive orders, the President has delegated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), responsibility for administering the major provisions of the Stafford Act. FEMA has published regulations that specify, among other things, the scope and duration of services provided under CCP. The program is largely administered by SAMHSA through an interagency agreement with FEMA. SAMHSA has published program guidance that further describes the scope of services eligible for funding, and other matters. Eligible awardees are state mental health agencies or other local or private mental health organizations designated by the governor of the affected state. Eligible services are reimbursed by FEMA through its Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), a no-year account in which appropriated funds remain available until expended. The DRF is typically replenished through supplemental appropriations, especially in the aftermath of catastrophic disasters.", "States apply for funds by preparing a formula-based needs assessment within 10 days of the date of the disaster declaration, documenting the inadequacy of their available resources, and presenting a plan for service delivery. (The needs assessment takes into account the level of casualties and destruction of property that result from the disaster.) There is no matching requirement, and requested CCP funds must supplement, not supplant, existing local or state resources. CCP consists of two smaller programs: the Immediate Services Program (ISP) and the Regular Services Program. The ISP provides funds directly from FEMA to states for up to 60 days of services immediately following a disaster declaration. The RSP provides funds for up to nine months following a disaster declaration. (Regulations permit extensions in certain cases, as discussed in the subsequent section on \" Duration of Mental Health Services under CCP .\") RSP funds are provided to the states through SAMHSA, which is reimbursed by FEMA through the DRF.", "CCP services may be provided to victims of presidentially declared disasters even if they have relocated. Hence, HHS reported that in response to Hurricane Katrina, all 50 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia would be eligible to apply for CCP grants, presumably because they all could potentially host evacuees from presidentially declared disaster areas. Not all states applied, however. As of October 2006, 29 states had been awarded CCP funding for Hurricane Katrina, totaling $132 million.

SERG may be awarded whether or not there has been a Stafford Act declaration, based on a determination by the HHS Secretary of the existence of a substance abuse or mental health emergency. Hence, SERG may be used to provide assistance when there has not been a major disaster declaration, or, when there has been, to fund substance abuse and mental health treatment services that are not permitted under CCP. SERG grants have been awarded following the 2002 Washington, DC -area sniper incidents and the 2003 Rhode Island nightclub fire. Following Hurricane Katrina, FY2005 SERG grants totaling $600,000 were made to Alabama ($100,000), Louisiana ($200,000), Mississippi ($150,000) and Texas ($150,000).

For example, substance abuse and mental health treatment services, psychotropic medication expenses, methadone treatment, suicide prevention programs, and major administrative expenses for mental health and substance abuse resulting from the disaster may be addressed through this mechanism. Congress provided funding for the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita through several supplemental appropriations, but SAMHSA did not receive any of this funding.

While SAMHSA was the primary federal agency that provided mental health and substance abuse services, key services were also provided by: the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which funded Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs); the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which funded deployments of mental health providers; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which conducted surveillance of mental health needs.", "Coordination of Services: SAMHSA established the SAMHSA Emergency Response Center (SERC) to provide on-the-ground coordination of its mental health services. The SERC, which was in operation until January 2006, was a point of contact to receive information and have access to resources, regarding staffing and resources to be deployed. The SERC coordinated delivery of mental health services by managing the deployments of mental health providers to the affected area, and by organizing daily conference calls with representatives from all HHS agencies.", "Suicide Prevention: SAMHSA administered a combination of grants and other programs for suicide prevention. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes, SAMHSA expanded its toll-free suicide prevention crisis hotline, and coordinated deployments of counselors to the affected areas. In September 2006, SAMHSA awarded Louisiana and Mississippi $2.4 million over three years, through the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, for youth suicide prevention activities.", "Mental Health Services: SAMHSA's National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) made its resources available to help parents and service providers assist children, in both immediate crisis responses and long-term recovery settings. In addition, SAMHSA's critical incident stress management program addressed the mental health needs of first responders who were exposed to the aftermath of the hurricanes.", "Public Education: In December 2005, SAMHSA launched a public awareness campaign through Public Service Announcements and brochures. The campaign sought to enable victims to recognize the need for mental health treatment for themselves and their children in the aftermath of the hurricanes. Coinciding with the one year anniversary of the hurricanes, SAMHSA launched a series of new national public service print and billboard ads, encouraging survivors who experienced continued psychological distress to seek mental health services. Some of these new ads targeted first responders as well as parents and caregivers who can assess their children's emotional well-being.", "Substance Abuse Services: On August 31, 2005, SAMHSA issued a guidance for State Methadone Authorities and Opioid Treatment Programs in hurricane-affected states providing short and long-term emergency methadone and buprenorphine treatment services to heroin-addicted populations affected by the disaster.

The NRP establishes a comprehensive framework for the coordination of federal resources in response to disasters. In the current version of the NRP, leadership for the federal coordination of mental and behavioral health services following a disaster appears to be split. The NRP includes 15 Emergency Support Functions, or ESFs, which are specific plans for certain sectors, such as transportation. Emergency Support Function 6 (ESF-6), Mass Care, under the leadership of FEMA and the American Red Cross, lays out the coordination of emergency shelter, feeding, and related activities for affected populations. Emergency Support Function 8 (ESF-8), under the leadership of the Secretary of HHS, lays out the coordination of the public health and medical response to disasters. \"Crisis counseling\" is among the responsibilities delegated in ESF-6, while federal coordination of \"behavioral health care\"\u2014including assessing mental health and substance abuse needs, and providing disaster mental health training for workers\u2014is delegated in ESF-8.

Officials from the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals reported that there was no coordination of services provided by individuals who were not deployed through SAMHSA. While the federal government plays an important role in addressing the mental health needs of survivors in the aftermath of a disaster, there may be value in engaging in joint disaster planning efforts with state and local governments and the private sector to prepare for future disasters. Norris et al. conclude that coordination of delivery of mental health services through a public health or population-based approach, and continued coordination to provide services as the long term effects of the crisis unfold, are likely to be beneficial for the survivors' mental health.

That expertise, at the federal level, clearly resides with HHS and SAMHSA. Establishing authority for CCP in the Stafford Act, which is administered by FEMA, is a means to provide funding for crisis counseling services quickly and as needed through the DRF, assuring that such services can be provided without regard to constraints that may be imposed by HHS's or SAMHSA's annual appropriations. It has the effect, however, of placing FEMA in the position of fiscal responsibility for a program for which it lacks the requisite technical expertise.", "Mechanisms for shared federal responsibility for CCP, and for disaster mental health and substance abuse services in general, may work well if federal agencies coordinate with each other and with the states. A recent news report has raised questions about how well recent CCP programs have been carried out in Florida in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma.

The press release did not mention SAMHSA or its role.", "In May 2005, GAO published its review of financial accounting for CCP services provided under Project Liberty, in response to the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. GAO reported that FEMA and SAMHSA did not require grantees to submit revised budgets as the services provided evolved, and that SAMHSA did not keep track of program expenditures as well as it tracked the program's delivery of services. GAO recommended that SAMHSA and FEMA develop mechanisms for improved budgetary oversight, as well as mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of the program.

Unfortunately, these discussions are hobbled by a weak knowledge base. Research in this area is challenging for several reasons. First, there are technical challenges in mental health research in general, including a limited suite of standardized measurement tools, limited information on the baseline prevalence of mental illness in populations, and difficulty in comparing studies that use different measurement tools or follow-up times. Second, disasters are by their nature episodic, varying in type, severity and location, making comparisons difficult. Finally, different types of disasters may affect the mental health of victims in different ways. For example, some experts feel that victims' responses to war or terrorism are substantially different from their responses to natural disasters.", "SAMHSA reports that it will be conducting an evaluation of CCP services delivered in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, in collaboration with the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (NCPTSD), a center within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The NCPTSD supports a broad national network for PTSD research, including several federal departments, academic and private sector collaborators, making it well suited for the kind of complex outcomes research that is needed for a better understanding of CCP effectiveness.

According to SAMHSA:", "In contrast to the crisis counseling services provided through the CCP, mental health treatment ... implies the provision of assistance to individuals for an existing pathological condition or disorder. In this context, it involves providing a variety of interventions following the assignment of a diagnosis .... This diagnosis is made following an evaluation and/or psychological testing by a licensed mental health professional.... During treatment, the provider maintains a documented treatment plan and record.

CCP's scope of services do not, therefore, provide disaster victims with medications, office-based therapy, diagnostic services, psychiatric treatment, or inpatient and outpatient services for mental health conditions that are caused or aggravated by the disaster. CCP funds are not intended to support long-term or traditional mental health or substance abuse services.", "As compared with several other federal programs, SAMHSA's definition of \"individual and group treatment procedures\" for CCP is narrow, and the types of mental health services available under CCP are limited. For example, in the context of reporting the number of people receiving mental health services, SAMHSA's Office of Applied Statistics' (OAS) definition of mental health treatment/counseling includes inpatient and outpatient care, as well as some prescription medication. Medicare includes, in the mental health services that it covers, outpatient and in-hospital programs, as well as treatment for mental health problems. The U.S. Courts include inpatient and outpatient counseling and medication in their definition of mental health treatment, in the context of services provided to individuals on probation, parole or awaiting sentencing period.

However, assuming that CCP services are potentially beneficial, limiting services to those provided by licensed professionals would likely make the program more costly, and be hampered by the limited numbers of these professionals.", "In Project Liberty, CCP services were expanded to provide enhanced screening methods and a broader array of brief counseling approaches, for individuals who continued to experience trauma symptoms and functional impairment after initial crisis counseling. In August 2006, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported S. 3721 , the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006.

Project Heartland found that traditional crisis counseling techniques were not sufficient, and new approaches were developed to reach survivors.

Each approach carries the risk that the awards made could erode the agency's budget for the subsequent fiscal year.", "SAMHSA could also finance emergency response grants through the Public Health Emergency Fund, a no-year funding authority provided by Congress to the HHS Secretary upon his determination of a public health emergency. The fund has not received a recent appropriation, however, and contains no monies. As a consequence, the fund was not available for any aspect of the responses to the 2005 hurricanes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Resources and Long-term Needs", "paragraphs": ["Some immediate needs assessments and resource assessments were carried out by states and federal agencies in the aftermath of the hurricanes. However, there have been no longer-term assessments and none are statutorily required.", "An assessment of resources and needs in the initial stages of disaster response can improve cost-effective disaster response through prioritization, program planning and management. As individuals return to their homes and start rebuilding their lives in the months following a disaster, it would be helpful to reassess the mental health needs of the community and the state's resources to meet those needs. In other words, conducting a follow-up needs and resources assessment can provide a better understanding of the resources needed to meet the longer-term mental health needs of the community.", "The transition from immediate to long-term disaster mental health services can be a complex and bureaucratic process, often involving multiple providers with varying levels of expertise and training. Experts believe that the field of disaster mental health should match the intensity of help with survivors' need. A higher intensity of help may reach those at greatest need if initial and follow-up needs assessments are conducted.", "Needs assessments are required by FEMA's regulations and SAMHSA's guidance, not by the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act does not assign responsibility for conducting an initial or a follow-up needs assessment. FEMA regulations assign the responsibility to state governors or their designees. SAMHSA guidance provides greater detail about the initial needs assessment, along with the formula that the state must use. The requirement to conduct an initial assessment of resources is implicit in the application for CCP funds: states are required, in their ISP and RSP applications, to document that their capacity is inadequate to meet the needs created by the disaster. Also, for the RSP, the guidance requires that states incorporate FEMA damage assessments into their assessments of mental health and crisis counseling needs.", "Several initial needs assessments were conducted in the aftermath of the hurricanes. Following Hurricane Katrina, SAMHSA streamlined the needs-assessment requirement for states applying for CCP funding. As part of this streamlined process, states used only preliminary data to submit a needs and resources assessment for counseling services, as part of their CCP application. In two separate surveys in October 2005, SAMHSA projected the potential overall mental health needs of those impacted by the hurricanes, and the CDC conducted a survey of returning New Orleans residents. SAMHSA estimated that 500,000 residents may have needed mental health assistance, and CDC found that 83% percent of returning New Orleans residents indicated some need for mental health assistance.", "No longer-term needs assessments have been conducted and none are statutorily required. A follow-up needs assessment could document the chronic mental health needs of the survivors and inform the development of a strategy to address these needs, using public and private resources. States are not required to submit any follow-up needs or resources assessments in the months following the disaster. However, states are required to submit a report on how CCP funds were used. While FEMA's regulations provide for a mechanism for extension of RSP, they do not explicitly require a follow-up needs assessment to accompany the application for extension. Rather, the regulations only require states, for \"documented extraordinary circumstances,\" to justify their need for extension of RSP.", "In August 2006, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported S. 3721 , the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. Section 219 of the bill would require that SAMHSA, other relevant federal agencies, and state and local governments, conduct resource assessments and develop strategies to address mental health and substance abuse service needs following disasters. There has been no corresponding legislation introduced in the House. ( S. 3721 would also expand CCP to cover substance abuse services. See the prior section, \" Scope of Mental Health Services under CCP .\")"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Hurricane Katrina was one of the most devastating natural disasters in the nation's history. One year later, Congress and others continue to study the adequacy of the response and approaches for future improvement. The field of disaster mental health continues to evolve with lessons learned from the 2005 hurricanes and their aftermath.", "The 2005 hurricanes prompted, once again, a familiar set of questions. What types of mental health and substance abuse problems are victims likely to face after a disaster? How long might these problems last, and how might they change over time? Are there interventions that are likely to be of benefit? If so, when should they be delivered, and by whom? How can victims who would benefit from assistance be identified, and how should they be monitored? What can the federal government offer, through assistance to states, individuals, and others, that would be helpful to victims in enabling them to recover and move on with their lives? The federal programs set up to address mental health and substance abuse problems in those affected by the 2005 hurricanes offer opportunities for scrutiny. Careful study of these programs, and those established after the Oklahoma City bombing and the 2001 terrorist attacks, could lend clarity to, and improve the effectiveness of future federal responses.", "Appendix A. State CCP Awards", "Appendix B. DRF Allocations for CCP", "Since the fall of 2005, FEMA has provided weekly reports to Congress on its allocations from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for CCP activities in response to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The weekly reports provide budget lines for \"Crisis Counseling - NIMH\" and \"Crisis Counseling - SCC\" for each disaster. SCC is not defined. NIMH is the National Institute of Mental Health, an Institute in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which administered CCP in the past. NIMH staff have told CRS that the institute does not administer CCP at this time, and has not received the reported funds from FEMA.", "FEMA has advised that its reported SCC amounts correspond with SAMHSA's Immediate Services Program (ISP) awards\u2014amounts that FEMA provides directly to states\u2014and that its reported NIMH amounts correspond with SAMHSA's Regular Services Program (RSP) awards\u2014amounts that FEMA provides to SAMHSA. FEMA accounts for the discrepancy between its reported NIMH allocations and SAMHSA's reported RSP awards by noting that the RSP awards reflect amounts that have been approved, while the FEMA allocations reflect current information about states' use of the funds. The latter is subject to a lag in reporting, and is further complicated by requests for program extensions that have been made by many states.", "The table below shows amounts for CCP spending for the three disasters, as reported to CRS by SAMHSA, and as published by FEMA in its weekly reports to Congress.", "Appendix C. Scope of Mental Health Treatment Services", "Mental health treatment is a term that has been used in the fields of psychology as well as psychiatry.
