Public financing supporters maintain that replacing private funds with public money would most effectively reduce potentially corrupting influence from \"interested\" money. On the other hand, opponents of public financing question whether real or apparent corruption from private fundraising is as serious a problem as critics claim. They also argue that public financing would be an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars and would compel taxpayers to fund candidates they find objectionable.", "In the early 1970s, supporters succeeded in enacting public financing in presidential elections, a system that has been available since 1976. In addition, many states and localities have provided public financing in their elections since the 1970s (or before). Today, 16 states offer some form of direct aid to candidates' campaigns through fixed subsidies or matching funds. Perceptions about the presidential and state public financing systems have shaped opinions about adding public financing to congressional elections. Also shaping that debate was the Supreme Court's landmark 1976 Buckley v. Valeo ruling, which struck down mandatory spending limits, but sanctioned voluntary spending limits accompanying public financing.", "Proposals for publicly funded congressional elections have been offered in almost every Congress since 1956; the issue was prominently debated in the mid-1970s and the late 1980s through early 1990s. Proposals were passed twice by the Senate in the 93rd Congress and by both the House and Senate in the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses. Only the 102nd Congress proposal was reconciled in conference but was vetoed by the President.", "Thus far in the 112th Congress, Senator Durbin and Representative Larson introduced the latest versions of the Fair Elections Now Act (FENA) on April 6, 2011. These include S. 750 and H.R. 1404; S. 749 is a separate measure that would finance the program proposed in S. 750. The two versions of FENA, S. 750 and H.R. 1404, are similar to three bills introduced during the 111th Congress (H.R. 6116, which superseded H.R. 1826, and S. 752). Like their predecessors, the current versions of FENA propose to provide participating candidates with a mix of base subsidies, matching funds, and broadcast vouchers. The current versions of FENA propose two changes in incentives for participating candidates compared with 111th Congress versions of the legislation. First, although the types of available funding remain consistent, participants would be eligible for larger funding amounts. Second, coordinated party expenditures would be unlimited if funds used for those expenditures came from individual contributions of less than $500. Appendix D and Appendix E at the end of the report summarize major provisions of legislation introduced in the 111th and 112th Congresses respectively.", "In addition to discussing recent legislation, this report reviews past proposals for, and debate over, congressional public financing. It also discusses experiences with the presidential and state public financing systems.

The first is the presidential public financing system that has been in place since 1976 and has had mixed success in realizing the goals of its original sponsors. The second is the interplay between the concepts of public financing and campaign spending limits, which are often linked but which have very distinct characteristics; the 1976 landmark Supreme Court decision in Buckley v. Valeo contributed to that linkage because of its allowance for only voluntary spending limits, such as in conjunction with a public financing system. The section concludes with a summary of arguments for and against public financing, arguments which have not changed in essence over time but which have been shaped by the political realities noted above.", "The second section provides a historical review of efforts in Congress to enact public financing of its elections (although some attention is paid to presidential public financing as a precursor). The section begins with a brief review of early congressional interest and activity in the 20 th century, followed by a more detailed Congress-by-Congress discussion beginning with the 90 th Congress. Special attention is paid to the two periods in which congressional activity on public financing was the greatest: the Watergate-focused 93 rd Congress and the 100 th -103 rd Congresses. Public finance bills were passed by at least one chamber in those two periods, although the latter period was marked by a move toward downplaying public funds per se in favor of the broader concept of public benefits. The section concludes with a review of the major features of congressional proposals, presented as policy options to choose from in devising a congressional public finance system.", "The third section examines the experience of the 16 states that provide some form of public subsidies to candidates for state office. This section features a table ( Table 1 ) detailing these systems, and concludes with an analysis of the impact of public finance programs in the states. It is important to note from the outset, however, that this report does not examine recent constitutional and other legal challenges to some states' public financing programs. As developments in this area become clearer over time, this report will be updated.", "The fourth section offers a discussion of public opinion data on support for public financing of elections, as well as for the related idea of campaign spending limits. Public opinion is not as extensive on these questions as in the 1970s, when the idea of public financing was particularly prominent.", "The final section reviews the experience from public finance systems at both the state and presidential levels to offer some overarching observations for Congress possibly to consider in devising a public finance system for its elections, should it choose to do so.", "The report concludes with appendices to augment the information in the section on congressional proposals. Appendix A is a table ( Table A -1 ) providing details of the public finance (or benefits) measures that have passed either chamber (from 1973 -1993); because they passed at least one chamber, these bills are perhaps the most important for Congress to review before beginning a fresher look at the idea.

First, the nation has had public financing in presidential elections since 1976. That system serves both as a model for proposals to extend public financing to congressional elections and as a case study of how a congressional system might and might not be structured. Second, in striking down mandatory expenditure limits in 1976 while allowing voluntary limits in the context of a public finance system, the Supreme Court's Buckley v. Valeo ruling resulted in a closer linkage between the distinct concepts of public subsidies for election campaigns and limitations on campaign spending."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Presidential System Since the 1970s: A Model", "paragraphs": ["Since 1976, public funds have helped finance presidential elections, with the level of funds determined by a taxpayer designations on a voluntary check-off. This system was established initially under the Revenue Act of 1971 and augmented by the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) Amendments of 1974. Candidates who meet eligibility requirements and agree to voluntary limits on campaign expenditures are eligible for matching funds in the primaries. In the general election, major party candidates automatically qualify for full subsidies equal to the spending limit; minor party and independent candidates may also qualify for public funds by meeting specified criteria. Also, political parties may receive funding for their nominating conventions. Additional discussion of the provisions and evolution of the presidential public financing program appear in another CRS product."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Linkage with Spending Limits", "paragraphs": ["At the outset of any discussion on public financing proposals, it is important to address the question of expenditure limits because, almost invariably, legislative proposals for public funding are linked with candidates' adherence to spending limits. (In fact, the absence of spending limits in some public financing proposals, first offered in the 111 th Congress, marks a notable departure from most proposed public financing programs.) Despite this common linkage, public financing and spending limits are distinct concepts, with distinct potential benefits and drawbacks. Public financing of elections, at its core, is aimed at reducing reliance by politicians on private, interested sources of money for their elections. Expenditure limits are essentially aimed at curbing rising and, in the view of many, excessive amounts of money spent on elections.", "In fact, from the time public financing was first proposed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907 until the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Buckley v. Valeo (424 U.S. 1 (1976)), the impetus for passage stemmed more from the concern over the source of campaign money than the overall amount spent. In that landmark ruling, the Court struck down mandatory spending limits (such as those imposed on congressional candidates by the FECA Amendments of 1974), but allowed that in a voluntary system of public financing, it was permissible to require candidate adherence to spending limits as a condition of a government-provided benefit (i.e., public funds). Hence, spending limits in conjunction with public funding would be permissible because candidates voluntarily accepted them. In light of the Buckley decision, the prevailing view among policymakers has been that public financing offers the only realistic means of controlling campaign expenditures in congressional elections, short of enacting a constitutional amendment to allow mandatory limits (which Congress has refused to support on several occasions).", "Finally, it should be noted that some of the goals sought in the public funding and spending limit measures have been addressed in other legislation, which has been less sweeping yet often with significant bipartisan support. Proposals to lower campaign costs, without spending limits, have been prominent in Congress at least until enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA). Bills to provide free or reduced-rate broadcast time and postal rates have sought to reduce campaign costs and the need for money, without the possibly negative effects of arbitrary limits. Bills to provide for tax credits for small individual contributions have sought to encourage a greater role for citizens vis-\u00e0-vis organized interest groups. These measures offer the potential of realizing some of the aims of the more comprehensive measures but without some of the perceived pitfalls."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Arguments Supporting and Opposing Public Financing: Brief Overview", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Supporting", "paragraphs": ["A few major points are common arguments in favor of public financing. Supporters say that public financing can reduce the threat of political corruption, enhance electoral competition, and allow candidates to focus on issues rather than raising money. To many observers, the amount of money spent in elections today is arguably corrupting the political system, forcing candidates and officeholders to spend increasing amounts of time raising money, possibly creating pressure on them to rely on affluent individuals and special interests for campaign assistance, conceivably deterring candidates without personal fortunes from attempting to run for office, and leaving an impression among some voters that elections are \"bought and sold.\" Accordingly, one of the most prominent goals behind public financing is reducing the potential for corruption or the appearance of corruption. As political scientists Donald A. Gross and Robert K. Goidel have explained, \"Public subsidies to candidates, whether in the form of direct grants or matching funds, are seen as a way to minimize the undue influence and corruption often ascribed to contributors and partisan fundraising.\" Many former lawmakers, interest group representatives, political professionals, and academic experts submitted written testimony for the McConnell v. FEC \u00a0lawsuit heard by a U.S. District Court and the Supreme Court of the United States in their consideration of BCRA. Some of this testimony included empirical analysis of claims about potentially corrupting influences from private money in campaign politics and related issues.", "Other public financing goals relate to electoral competition. Public financing provides candidates\u2014regardless of personal wealth\u2014with financial resources to wage campaigns. This allows candidates who might not otherwise run for office to do so. As is noted in the discussion of states' experiences with public financing, most programs require that candidates demonstrate political viability before being eligible for funds. If more candidates have access to funds, supporters say that electoral competition should increase.", "Finally, public financing is attractive to some because it is one of the few constitutional ways to limit campaign spending\u2014a major concern among campaign reformers. Although the Supreme Court's 1976 Buckley v. Valeo ruling held that campaign spending generally could not be subjected to mandatory limits, candidates could be required to limit spending in exchange for receiving public funding. As is discussed elsewhere in this report, some public financing systems\u2014including the presidential one\u2014are today in jeopardy because major candidates fear that observing spending limits associated with public financing will preclude them from spending enough money to wage competitive campaigns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opposing", "paragraphs": ["Objections to public financing are also varied. Many are rooted in philosophical opposition to funding elections with taxpayer money, compelling taxpayers to support candidates whose views are antithetical to theirs, and adding another government program in the face of some cynicism toward government spending. Opponents also raise administrative concerns: how can a system be devised that accounts for different natures of districts and states, with different styles of campaigning and disparate media costs, and is fair to all candidates\u2014incumbent, challenger, or open-seat, major or minor party, serious or \"longshot\"? Similarly, opponents assert that public financing could distort elections by imposing the same system on 50 different states with different degrees of competitiveness in individual races and by providing even greater advantages to incumbents than already exist, thereby decreasing the competitiveness of elections. In view of the relatively low rate of participation in the voluntary check-off for the existing presidential system, they see little evidence that the public would favor such a plan.", "Some public financing opponents believe that government-funded campaign subsides amount to \"welfare for politicians,\" and are an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars. These opponents argue that public financing could coerce candidates into limiting their campaign spending\u2014viewed as a form of political speech\u2014in exchange for funding, or that it could force taxpayers to indirectly fund campaign messages they might find objectionable. On a related note, opponents suggest that public financing could waste taxpayer money on \"fringe\" candidates who represent political views that may be far outside the mainstream and who have little chance of winning elections.", "In response to arguments that public funding is necessary to limit campaign expenditures, those opposed to public financing often argue that campaign spending is not high, especially compared with commercial advertising budgets or spending on consumer goods. They argue that worthy candidates will win public support without government intervention via public financing. Some researchers also suggest that concerns about rising campaign costs are overstated, and that most campaign fundraising comes from individuals who give less than the legal limit.", "Finally, opponents of public financing sometimes argue that proponents fail to sufficiently support their arguments in favor of public financing, relying instead on the \"self-evidence\" of its appeal. For example, although the appearance of corruption or potential corruption is a common argument in favor of public financing, political scientists Jeffrey Milyo and David Primo have found that scholarly research on the topic is limited or anecdotal. The same, they say, is true for fears about declining trust in government and declining voter turnout, which some contend could be buoyed by public financing."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Proposals for Public Financing of Congressional Elections", "paragraphs": ["While the idea of public financing of federal elections was first proposed in 1907, it was not until the 1950s that bills were first introduced in Congress to implement such a plan. Since that time, legislative proposals have been offered in nearly every Congress, while the extent of legislative activity around the issue has varied according to the political climate and circumstances. In two very active periods, bills to extend public financing to congressional elections have passed one or both houses but were never enacted.", "In the first period, during the 93 rd Congress (1973-1974), the Senate twice passed bills for public funding in congressional elections, widely seen as a response to the unfolding Watergate scandal. In 1973, a bill was passed providing full subsidies (equal to mandatory spending limits) to major party candidates in House and Senate general elections. In 1974, a bill was passed providing matching funds in House and Senate primaries and full subsidies (equal to the voluntary spending limits) to major party candidates in House and Senate general elections. Both provisions were later deleted in conference, in view of some strong opposition in the House.", "In the second period, the 100 th through 103 rd Congresses (1987-1993), the House and Senate spent considerable amounts of time debating bills that featured the twin ideas of voluntary spending limits and public financing. In the 101 st , 102 nd , and 103 rd Congresses, both chambers actually passed such bills; the 102 nd Congress bill was vetoed by President George H.W. Bush, but the bills in the other two Congresses were never reconciled in conference.", "In contrast to the first period, when one of the Senate-passed bills covered both primary and general elections, bills in the second period offered benefits only for general election candidates. More broadly, efforts in the more recent period reflected a move toward paring down the level of public treasury funds going to campaigns, in light of a less favorable political climate. The emphasis in this second period shifted from public funds per se to public benefits . Public benefits were those either financed with public resources\u2014whether directly, as with public subsidies, or indirectly, as with revenue forgone from tax incentives or postal discounts\u2014or mandated by government action, such as requirements for reduced broadcast rates, at no cost to the U.S. Treasury. The common element was that they all constituted incentives to participation in a voluntary system based on campaign spending limits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Evolution During the Early 20th Century", "paragraphs": ["The earliest suggestion to Congress of public subsidies for election campaigns was apparently made by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907 in his annual message to Congress. Roosevelt saw reforms such as requiring disclosure and prohibiting corporate contributions as worthwhile but difficult to enforce and inadequate in deterring \"an unscrupulous man of unlimited means from buying his own way into office.\" He suggested an admittedly radical approach of providing ample appropriations to the major national political parties to fund their \"organization and machinery.\" Parties receiving federal monies were to be limited to a fixed amount that could be raised from individual contributors, all of which would be disclosed to the public. It is unclear from the text of his message (the relevant portion of which is reprinted below) whether Roosevelt intended this plan to be limited to presidential, as opposed to all federal, campaigns. At the time, given the political parties' central role in financing all election campaigns, the distinction may not have been as great as it would be today, when candidates take the lead role in financing their campaigns. In any case, the section of the message was titled \"Presidential Campaign Expenses.\"", "Under our form of government voting is not merely a right but a duty, and, moreover, a fundamental and necessary duty if a man is to be a good citizen. It is well to provide that corporations shall not contribute to Presidential or National campaigns, and furthermore to provide for the publication of both contributions and expenditures. There is, however, always danger in laws of this kind, which from their very nature are difficult of enforcement; the danger being lest they be obeyed only by the honest, and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so as to act only as a penalty upon honest men. Moreover, no such law would hamper an unscrupulous man of unlimited means from buying his own way into office. There is a very radical measure which would, I believe, work a substantial improvement in our system of conducting a campaign, although I am well aware that it will take some time for people so to familiarize themselves with such a proposal as to be willing to consider its adoption. The need for collecting large campaign funds would vanish if Congress provided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate expenses of each of the great national parties, an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thorough organization and machinery, which requires a large expenditure of money. Then the stipulation should be made that no party receiving campaign funds from the Treasury should accept more than a fixed amount from any individual subscriber or donor; and the necessary publicity for receipts and expenditures could without difficulty be provided.", "Roosevelt was not exaggerating when he commented that it would take \"some time\" for people to familiarize themselves with such a proposal.", "From the mid-1920s through the 1970s, select and special committees had been established by every Congress (predominantly on the Senate side) to investigate campaign expenditures\u2014presidential or congressional\u2014in recent elections. Reports issued at the conclusion of the work of these committees often included recommendations designed to correct shortcomings perceived in existing campaign finance practices. In 1937, during the 75 th Congress, the report of the Senate's Special Committee to Investigate Campaign Expenditures of Presidential, Vice Presidential, and Senatorial Candidates in 1936 was released. Included in its section of recommendations was a proposal for public funding of all federal elections, which the committee passed along without judgment as to its merits. All private contributions were to be prohibited under this plan. Under recommendation no. 9, the report said,", "It has been suggested that private contributions to political campaigns be prohibited entirely and that instead all election campaign expenses should be defrayed from public funds.", "Congress apparently took no action on this proposal.", "Interest in public funding of political campaigns has often been aroused by allegations of unethical conduct by public officials for accepting particular campaign contributions. Such was the case on July 6, 1949, when Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., introduced a resolution to commission a study by the Committee on Rules and Administration on the mechanics of establishing a system of public funding of presidential campaigns. In introducing his resolution, Lodge responded to rumors government corruption. The resolution\u2014S.Res. 132\u2014read as follows:", "Resolved. That the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration is authorized and directed to make a full and complete study and investigation for the purpose of obtaining such information with respect to the problems involved in financing with governmental funds presidential election campaigns in the United States as may be necessary to enable the committee to formulate and report at the earliest practicable date a bill providing for such method of financing presidential election campaigns. ", "Lodge's support for this concept, the details of which he envisioned coming out of a congressional study, was summed up in this excerpt from his floor statement:", "All this talk of an \"office market,\" and of putting high executive and diplomatic positions on the auction block\u2014all this breeding of suspicion and cynicism would disappear, I believe, overnight if the primary cause of the evil were obliterated at its root. If no private individual or officer of a corporation were permitted by statute to contribute one cent to a presidential campaign there would be a far cleaner atmosphere surrounding political appointments, and this would encourage public-spirited men holding public office. If there are no bidders, there can be no auction.", "Lodge acknowledged that the same principle could also be applied to other offices, but he was limiting his suggestion to presidential races because of the enormous number of appointments to public office at the President's disposal. Apparently the type of corruption which motivated Lodge in S.Res. 132 was the selling of government positions rather than the broader notion of trading influence or access on policy questions for campaign contributions. A concern over the latter possibility would be a likely prerequisite for any proposal for public financing of congressional campaigns. No action was taken on S.Res. 132 by the Committee on Rules and Administration."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "First Public Finance Bills", "paragraphs": ["During the 84 th Congress, the name of Theodore Roosevelt was invoked when the first public funding bills were introduced in Congress, almost 50 years after being suggested by Roosevelt. On February 20, 1956, Senator Richard Neuberger introduced S. 3242, to provide for direct public subsidies for all major party campaigns for federal office, co-sponsored initially by Senators Wayne Morse, James Murray, Paul Douglas, John Sparkman, and Mike Mansfield. The identical bill was submitted two days later in the House as H.R. 9488 by Representative Frank Thompson. \"Sometimes I call my bill the Teddy Roosevelt bill, because of its origin,\" observed Neuberger; Thompson commented that the bill could \"appropriately, enough, I think be called the Theodore Roosevelt Campaign Contributions Act of 1956.\"", "Neuberger, who quickly became identified as the chief congressional proponent of public financing at the time, declared that S. 3242 was \"the most far-reaching bill ever proposed to strike loose the financial fetters from our democratic processes of government.\" The final impetus for the bill was the recent revelation of a large campaign contribution offered to a Senator by an oil company during debate on removing federal controls from natural gas prices. The alleged bribery attempt contributed to Neuberger's view that,", "These contributions, in my opinion, have become an unbearable yoke to many of the men who must accept them. They even have become onerous and objectionable to the individuals who parcel out such contributions.", "Neuberger based his proposal on the belief that the system of raising campaign funds from private sources hampered the independence of public officials, created doubts among the public about the integrity of the government, and created an inequality in gaining access to voters by various candidates. He continued in his statement to articulate what would remain the major motivation for later advocates of publicly financed elections:", "An undemocratic element is introduced when one nominee can eclipse his opponent not because of superiority of ability or of his policies, but merely through a preponderance of coin of the realm .... We would not dream of permitting our Presidents or our Senators and Representatives to draw their pay from a private payroll or in the form of private contributions; they get paid by the public for whom they act. Why, then, leave their campaigns for these offices to be lavishly financed from private sources?", "Neuberger's bill provided for the allotment of federal funds to the major political parties, to be used for campaign expenditures of its candidates for federal office. (In the 1950s, election financing was still substantially conducted by the parties, in contrast with today, when party support is considered ancillary to the expenditures of the candidates themselves.) A major party was defined as one which received at least 10% of the vote in the previous national election. The total federal contribution for a two-year period would be determined by multiplying 20 cents by the average number of votes cast in the previous two presidential elections (for presidential election years) and 15 cents by the average number of votes cast in the previous two House elections (for non-presidential election years). The system would be conducted on a voluntary basis and would allow for parties to accept donations from private sources, provided that no individual's contribution exceeded $100 and that the total raised from these sources did not exceed the total federal donation. The term \"matching funds\" was used by Neuberger to describe the system, but it differed from the present system of matching funds in presidential primaries in that the federal subsidy in the latter case is determined by the amount raised privately; in the Neuberger proposal, the amount that could be raised privately was to be determined by how much the federal subsidy would be.

Numerous hearings were held and bills introduced aimed at improving the nation's campaign finance laws generally. A few bills providing direct public financing were introduced in nearly every Congress since the 84 th Congress (1955-1956), but most of these were proposed and supported by a small minority of Members.

Kennedy to make recommendations for improving campaign finance practices and laws. While the report was ostensibly focused on presidential elections, its findings were more broadly applicable to all federal elections because of the extent to which the political parties were at that time the major financiers of all federal campaigns. Its recommendations, which included tax incentives to encourage individual donations to political parties, did not include the proposal urged on it by many for direct public subsidies. Rather, the commission expressed concern for public financing's potential to discourage citizen participation in campaigns, to redistribute power arbitrarily within the parties, to encourage fraud, and to be administered unfairly. However, the commission expressed interest in a \"matching incentive system,\" whereby small individual donations to parties would be equally matched with U.S. Treasury funds. Such a system found favor with the commission because the amount of subsidy would be determined not by governmental action but by \"private voluntary action.\" The 1962 commission report thus advanced the concept of direct government subsidies of campaigns for federal office.", "In 1966, Congress took its first step toward public subsidies in federal elections when it enacted the Presidential Campaign Fund Act, providing public subsidies to major political parties for their presidential campaigns.

As reported with only one dissenting vote, S. 3044 created a system for all federal elections, which is still in place in presidential elections: a voluntary system, with matching funds in the primaries and a fixed subsidy in the general election, all funded from the check-off on federal tax returns. The committee report expressed the view then in ascendancy about the need for public funding:", "The only way in which Congress can eliminate reliance on large private contributions and still ensure adequate presentation to the electorate of competing candidates is through comprehensive public financing.... The election of federal officials is not a private affair. It is the foundation of our government. As Senator Mansfield recently observed, it is now clear that \"we shall not finally come to grips with the problems except as we are prepared to pay for the public business of elections with public funds.\"", "Senate debate on S. 3044 lasted for 13 days, in which proponents were able to defeat four amendments to drop public financing completely, two amendments to reduce the level of public funds, one amendment to reduce funding to incumbents by 30%, and one amendment to add three free mass mailings to general election candidates.

Those advocating campaign finance reform set their sights on a less sweeping goal during the 1980s, and much of the 1990s: restricting the growing role of political action committees (PACs), the political agents of interest groups, in the financing of congressional elections.

First, the \"clean money, clean elections\" model (hereafter, clean money) is a national initiative developed by an interest group and is designed to cover full campaign costs.

All qualifying candidates receive the same amount of funding, which is, at least in theory, sufficient to cover all campaign costs.

The clean money model offers full public financing to candidates who agree to certain restrictions, particularly spending limits.

The plan originated with the interest group Public Campaign, which describes itself as \"a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to sweeping reform that aims to dramatically reduce the role of big special interest money in American politics.\" The group advocates the clean money program at the local, state, and federal levels around the country. Currently, clean money programs in Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey (a pilot legislative program), New Mexico, North Carolina, and Vermont offer public financing to the candidates for the offices noted in Table 1 . Although all clean money programs are adapted to states' individual needs (e.g., different offices are covered in each state), the major components of the program are similar nationwide. All programs were approved by voters or state legislatures between 1997 and 2005 (some have since been amended).", "By contrast, 10 states offer public financing through programs other than the clean money model: Hawaii, Florida, Nebraska, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey (gubernatorial campaigns), Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. While the clean money system features a uniform model for public financing and is a relatively recent initiative, other public financing programs in the states vary widely. Many of the latter programs were initiated in the 1970s, in the Watergate aftermath. Some of the most notable differences between clean money models and other programs are how candidates receive public funding and how much money is available to those candidates. Although clean money funds are generally distributed through subsidies that allocate fixed amounts to candidates, states that employ other programs rely primarily on matching funds. The amount of matching funds candidates receive depends on the amount of private contributions raised. States generally match 100%, and sometimes more, of the amount a candidate raises through private contributions.", "Whether clean money models or other systems, public financing programs do not guarantee unlimited funds. States generally limit the percentage of contributions that may be matched, or cap the total amount of funds that may be disbursed. Available revenues often influence these decisions. For example, in Michigan, a tax check-off system funds public financing for qualifying gubernatorial candidates.

Publicly financed candidates must agree to limits on spending and fundraising. Some states also require publicly financed candidates to participate in debates. Public funding recipients must demonstrate that they are politically viable by raising a minimum level of private contributions before becoming eligible for public funding. Some states' individual contributions are limited to as little as $5. Once candidates meet that threshold and other qualifying requirements, they become eligible for public financing.

Nebraska's public financing program has offered matching funds to a variety of statewide and legislative candidates since 1992, although it is rarely accepted. According to Frank Daley, Executive Director of the state's Accountability and Disclosure Commission, public financing in Nebraska becomes available only if one candidate adheres to spending limits while the other does not. If both candidates exceed spending limits, or if neither candidate exceeds spending limits, neither is eligible for public financing. Essentially, public financing in the state offers \"extra\" money for those facing high-spending opponents.

In theory, public financing should foster lower-cost campaigns because public financing generally requires observing spending limits and reduces fundraising costs. If more candidates have access to funding through public financing, races might also be closer on election day. Evidence on both fronts is mixed. In general, research suggests that public financing can foster more competitive elections. However, research on competition and public financing commonly emphasizes that most public financing programs are in their infancy, and that more time and cases are needed to draw definitive conclusions.", "Public financing does appear to reduce financial disparities among candidates, provided that all candidates participate in public financing.

More access to money via public funding does not always foster closer races, although it can provide ballot access for candidates who might not otherwise be able to run. From this perspective, public financing provides an avenue to consistent competition in elections, but not necessarily closer elections. On the other hand, in a comparative analysis of legislative elections in five states that offer public financing\u2014Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin\u2014political scientists Kenneth R. Mayer, Timothy Werner, and Amanda Williams found that competition generally increased after public financing was enacted, both in terms of the number of incumbents facing challengers, and the number of \"competitive\" races. These findings, however, were contingent upon sufficient funding to make the programs attractive to candidates. There is some anecdotal evidence of public financing favoring challengers or Democrats, although these findings are not systematic, and other research disputes such findings.

In 1996 and 1998, respectively, Maine and Arizona became the first states to provide full public financing for qualified candidates for statewide and legislative offices. These two states are often considered test cases for public financing because their programs are so comprehensive. In both states, the first disbursements under these programs were made in the 2000 election cycle. Both states adopted public financing modeled on the clean money program, advocated by Public Campaign. Arizona and Maine offer similar full public financing to statewide and legislative candidates. Connecticut's public financing program, which is similar to the Arizona and Maine programs, was fully implemented for the 2008 election cycle. Although the program appears to have been popular with candidates, it is too early to fully assess the impact of public financing in that state.", "Various accounts about the Arizona and Maine programs are available, although research (especially from secondary sources) tends to be limited or is produced by groups that support or oppose public financing. The Government Accountability Office (GAO, then the General Accounting Office) issued one of the first governmental assessments of the Arizona and Maine programs. The GAO report, issued in May 2003 and based on public financing offered in the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, found \"inconclusive\" and \"mixed\" results. According to GAO, \"In sum, with only two elections from which to observe legislative races and only one election from which to observe most statewide races, it is too early to draw causal linkages to changes, if any, that resulted from the public financing programs in the two states.\" GAO also found \"inconclusive\" and \"mixed\" results when examining whether the states met program goals in five areas: (1) voter choice (measured in candidate emergence and participation in public financing); (2) electoral competition (measured in percentage of competitive elections, decreases in incumbent reelection rates, or smaller victory margins for reelected incumbents); (3) interest group influence (measured by candidate and interest group reports through interviews and surveys); (4) campaign spending (measured in candidate spending and independent expenditures); and (5) voter participation (measured in turnout and awareness in surveys of public financing). ", "GAO revisited the topic in a 2010 report. In brief, the new GAO report found that participation greatly increased over time, as noted elsewhere in this report. As with the 2003 report, however, many of the 2010 findings could not necessarily be attributed to public financing in Arizona and Maine. In general, the 2010 report suggests that findings continue to be inconclusive, not clearly attributable to public financing, or both. ", "Other recent research generally suggests that public financing has enhanced competition and diversity among candidates and donors in Arizona and Maine. One group of scholars found that the number of contested races in Arizona legislative elections increased by more than 10% from 2002 to 2004. A 2008 report issued by the advocacy group Public Campaign found that small donors to publicly financed candidates in Arizona were more racially, economically, and geographically diverse than traditional donors to privately financed candidates.", "After reviewing Maine's public financing program between 2000 and 2006 the state's Ethics Commission determined that public financing had tightened competition between incumbents and challengers, and between winning and losing candidates. The Ethics Commission report also found (among other points) that public financing had: \"sharply reduc[ed]\" total private contributions to legislative candidates, increased the amount of time candidates had to spend communicating with voters, and encouraged more first-time candidates (including more women) to run for office. A 2009 report released by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which advocates public financing, also found evidence of increased competition in states with public financing. In the Maine case, the Brennan Center study found that accepting public financing slightly increased vote share among challengers (3 percentage points) and incumbents (2 percentage points).", "Some observers, however, have questioned the Arizona and Maine programs on ideological or legal grounds. Fundamental to those arguments is that citizens could be indirectly forced to provide financial support to politicians with whom they disagree, since Arizona's program is financed through various fines and fees. Some critics of Arizona's program also contend that increased competition in the state's elections could be due to other factors, such as the impact of term limits. In addition, Maine's program is, according to one report favoring public financing, \"plagued by private contributions to candidate leadership PACs.\" Political scientists Ray La Raja and Matthew Saradjian have raised the possibility that public financing could increase independent expenditures by interest groups and other organizations. An increase in independent expenditures is one of the drawbacks to public financing identified in the 2007 Ethics Commission review of Maine's public financing program.", "Despite contradictory data on effectiveness, candidate participation in both states' public financing programs has steadily increased over time. As Table 2 and Table 3 below show, about one-quarter of legislative candidates participated in Arizona's inaugural public financing effort in 2000, compared with about one-third of legislative candidates in Maine. By 2002, however, participation in both states reached at least 50%, and has increased during subsequent election cycles. By 2008, large majorities of legislative candidates in each state chose to participate in public financing. ", "Data on differences between Democrats and Republicans (or members of third parties or independents) are not uniformly available. The same is true for House versus Senate candidates. A review of data that are available, however, suggests that House and Senate candidates have embraced public financing in roughly equal numbers. More Democrats than Republicans typically participate in public financing, but majorities of candidates from both parties have done so in states with comprehensive programs. In Maine in 2008, for example, 94% of Democratic House candidates received public funds, compared with 70% of their Republican counterparts. In the Senate, 81% of Democratic candidates accepted public funds in 2008, compared with 75% of Republicans.", "Connecticut's program for legislative public financing was fully implemented for the 2008 election cycle. The Connecticut program appears not to have been fully evaluated thus far. Although it is too early to tell how consistent participation in Connecticut's program will be, approximately 75% of all candidates reportedly participated in public funding during the 2008 election cycle."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Public Opinion on Public Financing and Spending Limits", "paragraphs": ["Surveys indicate that Americans generally support campaign finance \"reform\" (generally meaning more regulation of money in politics) and are concerned about the amount of money in campaigns. Nonetheless, public opinion about campaign finance can be contradictory. These patterns are evident in the relatively limited available data about attitudes on public financing. Historically, surveys reveal that large pluralities or even majorities of Americans support public financing in principle, but are hesitant to invest tax dollars to facilitate public financing. These findings indicate that the wording, source, and timing of individual questions vary greatly and can affect campaign finance polling results, as is always the case with survey research, regardless of topic.", "Majorities tend to support public financing when asked questions suggesting favorable information about public financing, or in surveys conducted for pro-reform clients. On the other hand, majorities tend to respond negatively to questions focusing on costs of public financing or taxation. Survey respondents say that they are neutral or positive toward public financing if question wording suggests that public financing can limit the influence of \"special interests\" or campaign costs. On the other hand, survey questions that emphasize spending \"taxpayer dollars\" to support public financing often yield disapproval from respondents. Americans have been more willing in polls to support public financing after perceived scandals, such as during the 1970s and 1990s.", "In Gallup polling conducted between 1972 and 1996, between 50% and 65% of respondents favored \"provid[ing] a fixed amount of money\" for presidential and congressional campaigns, while banning private contributions. Similarly, in a 1997 Washington Post poll, 49% of campaign contributors answered favorably when asked if they would \"favor or oppose having all federal elections financed out of public funds, with strict limits on how much each candidate for president, US Senator or Congressman could spend\"; 48% were opposed. In the same poll, but with spending limits omitted from question wording, only 26% responded favorably when asked whether they would \"favor or oppose the federal government financing presidential and congressional elections out of tax money.\"", "The polling data reviewed above illustrate that Americans have more consistently supported containing campaign spending\u2014a hallmark of public financing programs\u2014than public funding per se. For example, in a 1997 New York Times /CBS News poll, 60% of respondents said that \"limit[ing] the amount of money that campaigns can spend\" should be a \"top\" or \"high\" priority within campaign finance reform efforts. In a Gallup poll from the same year, 79% of respondents favored \"putting a limit on the amount of money\" congressional candidates could \"raise and spend on their political campaigns.\" However, like all survey questions, answers to spending questions are also affected by wording. For example, in a 1999 NBC News poll, only 17% of respondents (but the second-most-common answer) presented with a list of potential campaign finance concerns said that \"unlimited contributions\" concerned them most, compared with 37% who were most concerned about \"special interests.\" More generally, in a 2002 ABC News/ Washington Post poll, 66% of respondents favored \"stricter laws controlling the way political campaigns raise and spend money.\" It appears that regular, national polling about public financing has been uncommon since the mid-1990s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Considerations for Congressional Public Financing", "paragraphs": ["Public financing has been debated in Congress and the states for decades. This suggests that interest in the topic will continue. As Congress considers how, or whether, to change the status quo, state experiences with public financing, as well as the nation's presidential public financing system, offer several potential lessons. However, the great diversity among state programs makes interpreting those lessons challenging. At the federal level, the presidential public financing system provides partial matching funds to qualifying candidates in primaries, but far more substantial fixed subsidies to candidates in the general election. At the state level, which campaigns are eligible for public funding, how much funding is available, what requirements are placed on candidates accepting public funding, and when programs were implemented vary. The presidential public financing system and those in the states all rely on either fixed subsidies (in the states, especially clean money models) or matching funds to distribute public financing. Despite similar ways of delivering funds to candidates, details about each program can vary greatly. These differences have produced research that describes individual components of public financing programs, but rarely draws systematic comparisons across states. In addition, only two states\u2014Arizona and Maine\u2014currently provide full public financing for legislative elections. (Others provide partial public financing for legislative elections, but, again, vary widely.) Consequently, there are few certainties about how public financing might apply to congressional campaigns. Nonetheless, several potential considerations remain.", "State models suggest two approaches to national public financing if Congress decides to pursue subsidized congressional campaigns. First, most public financing programs infuse public money into campaigns in hopes of limiting the impact of private money. This approach essentially provides candidates with money so that they do not have to raise their own\u2014or can at least raise less. Second, some models, such as Nebraska's public funding program, have reportedly encouraged the vast majority of candidates to limit spending on their own. Rather than providing public funding to candidates based on the assumption that they will spend those funds, the Nebraska program reserves public financing for candidates whose opponents refuse to abide by relatively low spending limits. These two approaches suggest a choice for Congress between public funding that concentrates primarily on distributing money in anticipation of campaign needs versus creating incentives for candidates to need less money by observing spending limits.", "In addition, creating a public financing system requires a choice between funding primary elections or general elections, or both. Most existing state programs have funded both types of elections, although general elections sometimes take priority over primary elections and might be funded differently from primary elections. While early congressional proposals generally covered primaries as well as general elections, most prominent proposals since the 100 th Congress have dealt only with general election financing to reduce both costs and program complexity, and to enhance chances for enactment.", "Regardless of the chosen approach, public financing does not altogether eliminate private money in politics. Even clean money programs require some private fundraising to establish viability, albeit far less than under private financing. In addition, some observers fear that public financing creates opportunities for more financial influence from less accountable non-candidate sources\u2014such as independent expenditures and election-related \"issue advocacy\" by interest groups\u2014compared with the current system of private financing. Public financing systems generally do not regulate fundraising or spending outside candidate campaigns, although legislation could address such issues.", "Congress might also wish to consider why some public financing programs have been curtailed. In a few states, decisions by voters and candidates\u2014not state governments\u2014appear to be most responsible for public financing programs falling into disfavor. Experiences in the states suggest that in order to be viable, public financing must have sufficient funding to make participation attractive to candidates. As with public funds for presidential candidates, if public financing provides too little money\u2014or sets accompanying spending limits too low\u2014to convince candidates that they can wage effective campaigns, major candidates are likely to opt out of the system, ultimately making it relevant only for minor candidates. (In 2004, for example, both of the eventual major-party nominees for President opted out of matching funds in the primaries.) Public support can also be important to enact and maintain public financing. Despite regular congressional interest in public financing since at least the 1950s, disagreements over many of the issues noted in this report have thus far thwarted efforts to adopt public financing in legislative elections.", "On a related note, effective public financing requires resources not only adequate to make participation attractive to candidates, but also sufficient to administer and enforce public financing. As law professor Richard Briffault has explained,", "Public [campaign] funding requires administrators to determine who qualifies for public funds, to disburse the funds, and to enforce whatever restrictions accompany the funds. Can public administrators handle the job? In fact, administrators have successfully handled the qualification of candidates and disbursement of public funds in presidential elections. The real question is whether they can enforce the rules\u2014particularly the spending limits\u2014that are likely to accompany public funding.", "Comprehensive congressional public financing would, therefore, almost certainly require substantial administrative and enforcement resources for the Federal Election Commission.", "Finally, public financing regulates only one area of campaign conduct. If Congress were to adopt public financing for its elections, other regulations\u2014including those currently in place\u2014would still be required to shape other areas of campaign politics, such as political advertising and party activities. Public financing would also not necessarily affect other factors that shape individual races. As one pair of scholars wrote in 1995,", "public financing of congressional elections, by itself, will not eliminate the problem of uncompetitive elections. As in Wisconsin, public subsidies may increase or prevent further deterioration in the competitiveness of contested congressional races by giving challengers more of a level playing field. They might not, however, encourage challengers to emerge in districts where the incumbent is perceived as unbeatable.", "Public financing could have diverse impacts on congressional elections. Data from the states show some evidence that public financing decreases financial disparities between candidates and fosters closer margins of victory. However, these findings are generally preliminary and are based on specific conditions in specific states. Because public financing limits the amount of private financing of campaigns, it is likely that public financing in congressional elections would reduce the amount of time candidates spend raising money\u2014at least for their own or others' candidate campaigns. On its own, however, public financing of candidate campaigns would not affect activities by 527s, political parties, or other organizations. The same is true for leadership PACs, unless they were prohibited by public financing legislation.", "Evidence from the states also suggests that if Congress chooses to fund congressional elections publicly, faith in the system and patience will be required. As is discussed throughout this report, much about the impact of public financing is simply unknown. Relatively few states offer public financing for legislative elections. Individual components of those programs, such as funding levels, conditions on candidates, and other factors, can vary substantially, making it difficult to compare public financing across states or to draw firm inferences about how state lessons might translate to congressional elections. It is clear from the presidential public financing program, and state programs, that assessing the impact of public financing takes multiple election cycles. As more states experiment with legislative public financing, and do so for longer periods of time, potential lessons for adopting congressional public financing will become clearer. It is also clear that in order to be effective, public financing programs require levels of funding sufficient to make them attractive to serious candidates, and to maintain those levels of funding over time. Similarly, spending limits associated with public financing must be high enough to convince candidates that they can compete in modern campaigns, including in expensive broadcast media markets.", "Appendix A.
