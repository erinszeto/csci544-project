{"id": "R45635", "title": "Categories of Federal Civil Service Employment: A Snapshot", "released_date": "2019-03-26T00:00:00", "summary": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service\u2014the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)\u2014that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements.", "The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances.", "The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes.", "The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees.", "The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions.", "The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is the nation's largest employer, with over two million workers employed in the United States, U.S. Territories, and foreign countries. A majority of these employees work in the competitive service of the executive branch. Applicants for competitive service positions compete with other applicants and are evaluated according to objective standards. The executive branch includes two other service classifications\u2014the excepted service and the Senior Executive Service (SES)\u2014with hiring and removal standards that diverge from those prescribed for the competitive service. Positions in the excepted service are specifically excepted from the competitive service by statute, by the President, or by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). SES positions are also not in the competitive service.

These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought[.]\" OPM identifies the relative weights for the subjects in an examination, and assigns numerical ratings on a 100-point scale. Applicants who meet the minimum requirements for entrance to an examination, such as citizenship and residence requirements, and are rated 70 or more in the examination are eligible for appointment in the competitive service. These individuals are placed on registers or lists of eligibles. When an agency seeks to fill a competitive service position, it requests a certificate of eligibles from OPM. This certificate is to include enough names from the top of the relevant register to allow an agency appointing official to consider at least three individuals for every position to be filled.", "The competitive service includes several types of appointments. An individual selected for a continuing position is generally appointed as a career-conditional employee subject to an initial one-year probationary period. After three continuous years of service in a career-conditional appointment, an employee will be converted to a career appointment. A term appointment is a nonpermanent appointment for a period of more than one year, but less than four years. An agency may make a term appointment when the need for an employee's services is not permanent, but involves a special project, extraordinary workload, or reorganization. A temporary appointment is a time-limited appointment for a period not to exceed one year. An agency may make a temporary appointment to fill a short-term position or meet an employment need that is scheduled to end within a specified timeframe."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pay Structure", "paragraphs": ["Employees in the competitive service are generally paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" The grades include 10 steps that provide for increasing rates of pay.

General Schedule salaries are based on the principles that there is equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area, that any pay distinctions are based on work and performance, that federal pay rates are comparable with non-federal pay rates for the same level of work, and that any pay disparities between federal and non-federal employees should be eliminated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adverse Action Protections and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Employees in the competitive service who are not serving a probationary or trial period, or have completed one year of current continuous service in a position other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less, maintain specified notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions.

The employee must also be provided a reasonable time to answer the notice and furnish affidavits and other evidence to support the answer.", "Similar notice is required before an agency may subject a qualifying employee to other adverse personnel actions.

First, the agency must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the charged conduct occurred. Second, it must establish a nexus between that conduct and the efficiency of the civil service. Finally, the agency must show that the penalty imposed on the employee is reasonable.

While noncareer appointees are not QRB-certified, OPM must approve these appointees. Limited term and limited emergency appointees make up a small subset of the SES, and their terms are non-renewable. These appointments are used when a position is needed for a specified period (such as to manage a special project), or a position is established to meet a \"bona fide, unanticipated, urgent need.\" Limited term and limited emergency appointments are also subject to OPM approval.

Performance appraisals of SES members may consider factors such as improvements in efficiency, productivity, and quality of work or service, cost efficiency, and performance timeliness. In response to earlier concerns that SES appraisal systems were flawed because most executives received the highest rating, Title 5 tasks OPM, in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget, with the establishment and maintenance of a government-wide performance appraisal system certification process, in an effort to ensure that an agency's appraisal systems for SES employees make \"meaningful distinctions based on relative performance.\"", "Title 5 also sets out different pay rates for the SES, with a minimum rate of basic pay equal to 120 percent of the rate for GS-15, step 1, and a maximum rate of basic pay equal to the rate for Level III of the Executive Schedule. But SES members' annual aggregate pay (that includes additional compensation such as bonuses, awards, and other payments in addition to basic pay) is capped at the rate for Level I of the Executive Schedule. If a senior executive's total compensation exceeds the aggregate limitation, the executive receives the overage in the following calendar year.

Under the 2017 Act, the VA Secretary has discretion to suspend, demote, remove, or take other actions against SES career appointees or other high-level executives if the Secretary determines that the individual's misconduct or performance warrants such action.
