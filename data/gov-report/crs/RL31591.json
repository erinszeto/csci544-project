In testimony at the hearing of Senate andHouse banking committees in the 108th Congress, the Fed's CTA in the Senate and H.R. 1474 in the House were supported by the Federal Reserve Board, which testified that it would liketo remove some of the consumer protection provisions that were in its 2001 proposal because theywere unnecessary. The Fed argued that the regulatory costs these provisions would place on bankswould outweigh the consumer benefits. Still, the bill is supported by America's CommunityBankers, the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers Association, and the FinancialServices Roundtable.", "The opposition to the Check 21 Act came from the Consumers Union, supported in its testimony by the Consumer Federation of America, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and theNational Consumer Law Center. The Consumers Union argued that the Act would make itimpossible for an estimated 45.8 million U.S. households who are currently getting their paperchecks back to continue to do so. These consumers would be less protected from fraud under theAct than under the existing check clearing process when there are disputes about check payments.The Consumers Union's suggested changes in the proposed legislation would significantly increaseconsumer protection.

The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has proposed legislation thatwould authorize the creation of \"substitute checks,\" an electronically produced instrument, thatwould allow banks to truncate the original check clearing process and complete the processelectronically with the substitute check.

In December 2001, the Federal Reserve Board drafted the Check TruncationAct (CTA) and sent it to both the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Committeeon Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to be introduced in Congress. On October 2, 2002, theCheck Truncation Act of 2002 ( S. 3034 ) was introduced by Senators Tim Johnson andThomas R. Carper. Prior to that time, on September 25, 2002, the Subcommittee on FinancialInstitutions and Consumer Credit of the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on theCheck Clearing for the 21st Century Act ( H.R. 5414 ), introduced on September 19 byRepresentatives Mike Ferguson and Harold E. Ford Jr. The bills, H.R. 5414 , and S. 3034 and the Fed's proposed bill, are almost identical. They would eliminate therequirement to physically return the original checks to the paying bank and therefore make it easierfor more banks to voluntarily adopt electronic check clearing instead of continuing to use the papercheck clearing process. The main difference between the Fed's proposal and H.R. 5414 was that the Fed's proposal had greater consumer protection against unauthorized debits. (1) After thehearing held on September 25, 2002, no further action was taken in the 107th Congress.", "In the 108th Congress , on April 3, 2003, the Senate held its first hearing on the Fed's CheckTruncation Act proposal that was received in December 2001. The Federal Reserve Board's ViceChairman Roger W. Ferguson Jr testified that the board would like Congress to remove someconsumer protection provisions that were in its 2001 bill. \"Upon further reflection, the Board hasnow concluded that the significant compliance burdens imposed by these provisions on banks thatreceive [the electronically produced] substitute checks outweigh the small incremental benefits thatthe provisions would provide to the consumers.\" (2) The vice chairman did not provide a new bill, butinstead pointed out that \"Nonetheless, Congress may conclude that the expedited recredit provisionsfor consumers should be included in the legislation. In that case, . . . it should not go beyond theprovisions proposed by the Board.\" (3)", "On April 8, 2003, the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on H.R. 1474 , the Check Clearing for the21st Century Act of 2003. The bill was introduced by Representatives Melissa Hart and Harold E.Ford Jr. on March 27, 2003. Substantively, the bill was not changed between the two Congresses. Vice chairman Ferguson's statement to the Committee was essentially the same as was the onepresented to the Senate Banking Committee. On May 21, 2003, the House Financial ServicesCommittee in its consideration and markup session amended H.R. 1474 and orderedit to be reported by voice vote. The amendment is a clarification amendment made byRepresentative Artur Davis. It would allow a consumer to make a claim for an expedited creditwithout possessing the substitute check.

Earlier, on June5, 2003, the Senate Banking Committee received H.R. 1474 , which was passed by theHouse of Representatives the same day and referred it to the Senate. The two bills are quite similar. The major differences between the bills are mainly in the area of consumer protection. The CTA ismore generous in its consumer protection provisions. For example, the CTA gives consumers 40days to file an expedited recredit claim, while H.R. 1474 would give only 30 days. In ", "addition, the Senate's CTA would shift the burden of documentation more on the banks and less onconsumers than the House's bill. ", "On October 1, 2003, House and Senate conferees reported H.R. 1474 ( Conference Report H.Rept. 108-291 ). The Conference Agreement adopted the House provision of 30 days tofile an expedited recredit claim providing that a consumer who receives a substitute check does nothave to have the check to make a claim for expedited recredit. On documentation, the ConferenceAgreement adopted the Senate provisions placing most of the burden on the banks, not theconsumers. A major sticking point was only indirectly related to the bills. It was between theFederal Reserve Board and the AirNet System Inc., the nation's largest check transportationcompany, over the Fed disclosure of its check transportation costs. The Conference Agreementrequires the Fed to disclose its expenses and revenues for shipping commercial checks betweenprocessing facilities. The Fed would have to publish the information in its annual report for 10years, but would not have to disclose specific prices. In addition, the act mandates a study on fundsavailability including the percentage of total checks cleared in which the paper check is not returnto the paying bank. The Department of the Treasury is mandated to do annual studies on depositoryinstitutions services efficiency and cost reduction. The Comptroller General of the United States atthe General Accounting Office (GAO) is also mandated to study and evaluate the implementationand administration of Check 21 Act and report the finding to Congress.

It begins withacustomer paying a store using a check; then the store deposits the check in its bank, which may bedifferent from the customer's bank. It is possible that the customer and the store have accounts inthe same bank, in which case the check would be settled as an \"on-us\" item. In the processing of anon-us item, the bank of first deposit would simply debit the customer's account and credit the store'saccount in the amount of the check. It is estimated that 33% of the checks written in the UnitedStates are on-us items. (4) Assuming this check is notan on-us item, there are a number of ways thatbanks may clear and settle checks among themselves by the rules of interbank check settlement. Therules for interbank check settlement are governed by articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform CommercialCode (U.C.C.) and by Federal Reserve regulations J and CC. ", "After the store deposits the customer's check in its bank, the bank of first deposit can return the check to the paying bank by mailing the check directly to the paying bank, or by sending it througha third party intermediary (private clearinghouse, (5) a correspondent bank, (6) or the Federal ReserveSystem). Whichever of these methods the store's bank selects, in most cases, the check must bephysically returned to the paying bank before it pays the check. This means that checks must bephysically transported to the banks on which they were drawn before they are settled. Consequently,the paper check clearing process is subject to transportation delays.", "If the customer does not have sufficient funds in the account to cover the payment to the store, the check is sorted out in the bank's backroom operations, and is returned directly to the depositorybank or to the intermediary that returns it to the depository bank (Figure 1). Usually the depositorybank returns the bounced check to the store, while charging a fee for depositing a check withinsufficient funds in the account. The store then tries to collect from the customer. At the sametime, the paying bank charges the check writer a fee for having insufficient funds in the account.", "Source: Federal Reserve of Boston.", "Which Bank Pays for Collecting the Funds. Under the Federal Reserve rules, a large portion of the costs of the clearing process, those relatedto collecting funds, falls on the depository bank -- the bank in which the check was first deposited. The store's bank in the above example has to pay for any intermediary check clearing charges andfor transporting the check to the paying bank. The legal requirement is that checks presented forpayment must be paid at face value, even though the depository bank incurs cost in collecting thefunds. It should be noted that the paying bank also incurs cost in paying the checks that arepresented. However, if banks have an equal amount of collection and payment, these costs on netcould tend to equalize among banks over time.", "Paper Check Clearing Is Inefficient. Economists have argued that the continued use of checks has made the society worse off, because it wastesresources such as transporting checks by planes throughout the United States for collection. A checkin the process of collection creates inefficiency, because it pays no interest (zero interest rate). Asa result, the greater the difference between the market rate of interest and the implicit interest rateof zero, the greater the income that can be earned by using checks. This income is called the float.The float is income earned by the check writer between the time a check is given as payment and thetime it is settled. The interest income earned from the float transfers income from the payee to thepayer. Even though the net benefit of the float between the payer and the payee is zero (the payee'slosses are the payer's gains), economists believe that the float is costly to society. Check usersemploy real resources to exploit the float for themselves. For example, the longer the plane takesto transport the check to the paying bank the greater the income the payer earns from the float. Ofcourse, from the view of the check issuer, the float is not an inefficiency, but a benefit.", "By one estimate (Wells), the cost to all parties involved in a check payment could average about $1.60 (in 1993 dollars) more than the cost of a payment made electronically. (7) According to theFederal Reserve in 2001, government, households, and businesses wrote about 42.5 billion checks. (8) If the Wells estimate is correct, this might indicate a saving of $68 billion if checks were replacedwith electronic payments.

Check truncation is a subset of the broader term ECP. Electronic check presentation is acheck collection process whereby a check is cleared based on information contained in an electronicfile or data, instead of the actual paper check. At a minimum, the file contains the amount of thecheck and the account number. The physical check may or may not follow the electronic file. Whenthe check is truncated, it is stopped before reaching the paying bank (the check writer's bank, whichis the bank holding the funds against which the check is drawn). Thus, under ECP with truncation,the writer of the check does not get his/her canceled check back. Instead, the transaction is indicatedon the monthly statement (Figure 2). A check returned for insufficient funds would be returned tothe depository bank electronically from the paying bank.

Theuse of an intermediary reduces the cost savings, since additional transportation, sorting and handlingcosts are involved when compared to truncation at the bank of first deposit. For these services, theintermediary charges fees that could be directly or indirectly passed through to the banks and theircustomers.

Under the paperprocess for example, the paying customer gets the float and the canceled check, while under ECP,the paying customer loses the float and does not get the canceled check back. That makes it difficultfor banks to adopt ECP without an explicit agreement about how they will share the benefits. Onnet, according to Stavins' study, represented in table 1, the paying bank's customers would sufferthe greatest cost from moving to the ECP process with the loss of canceled checks and the float. At the same time, the paying bank receives the greatest benefit. That benefit would be large enoughto compensate its customers for their losses if it so chose and still leave it better off after adoptingthe check truncation process. ", "For the depositing bank customers, their costs are unchanged and they benefit from not losing the float. The depository bank's costs and benefits are estimated to be closer to break-even, but thenet benefit is also positive. The higher infrastructure, storage, and operating costs are estimated tobe slightly less than the benefit from reduced risk of fraud, and return check handling.

The paying bank's customers incur78% of the costs and receive no benefit from changing from the paper check clearing process tocheck truncation. On the other hand, the depository bank's customers gain more than 14% of thebenefit. For the banks, the paying bank receives 61% of the benefits, while the depository bankreceives about 9% of the benefit.

These changes focus mainly on the recrediting procedure. (11) First, the Union would like to extend the recredit provisions in the Act to all checks where theoriginal checks are not returned to the consumer and there is a claim of improper payment or awarranty claim. This amendment would expand the indemnification coverage beyond the substitutechecks in the proposed H.R. 1474 . It could extend coverage to more than 20% of allbank checks that are currently not returned to customers and more than 80% of credit unions' draftsthat are also not returned to their members. Financial institutions are expected to oppose thisextension because it would significantly raise financial institutions' cost of handling disputed checksand drafts.", "Second, the Consumers Union argues that 10 days is too long for consumers to not have access to the disputed funds due to the use of the substitute check. It prefers the expedited recreditprovisions in the Fed's proposal. That is by the close of business the next day, the disputed amountof the payment (up to $2,500.00) would be credited to the consumer's account. The purpose of theprovision is to reduce consumer inconvenience due to the use of the substitute check. However, H.R. 1474 provides for a recredit after 10 business days, which the banking industryargues is appropriate.", "Third, Consumers Union would like to raise the expedited recredit amount from $2,500 to $5,000. In H.R. 1474 and the Fed's proposal, checks for less than $2,500 would berecredited by the next business day, if the check is being disputed. Consumers Union would like theexpedited recredit limit raised to $5,000 because the size of the amounts of these transactions isexpected to increase over time. In addition, the Union would like to shorten the number of daysrequired to complete the overall recrediting process to less than 20 days. Financial institutions, onthe other hand, prefer the longer time to clear up disputed checks in order to make sure thatcorrections are made accurately. In short, the Consumers Union's changes would protect consumersfrom the loss of the fraud protection provided by the right to have the original check returned tothem. This right is now protected by statute and regulations. These suggested changes, however,could significantly raise the cost to financial institutions to the point where it is no longer profitableto adopt check truncation. In P.L. 108-100 the expedited recredit amount stayed at $2,500.", "A counter to the Consumers Union's argument for protection against processing errors is the fact that in cases where check truncations have been used for years processing errors are practicallynonexistent and when they occur they are quickly resolved.
