Wind power has become \"mainstream\" in many regions of the country, and is no longer considered an \"alternative\" energy source.", "Wind energy has become increasingly competitive with other power generation options, although the impacts of the current financial crisis are uncertain. Wind technology has improved significantly over the past two decades. CRS analysis presented here shows that wind energy still depends on federal tax incentives to compete, but that key uncertainties like climate policy, fossil fuel prices, and technology progress could dominate future cost competitiveness.", "A key challenge for wind energy is that electricity production depends on when winds blow rather than when consumers need power. Wind's variability can create added expenses and complexity in balancing supply and demand on the grid. Recent studies imply that these integration costs do not become significant (5%-10% of wholesale prices) until wind turbines account for 15%-30% of the capacity in a given control area. Another concern is that new transmission infrastructure will be required to send the wind-generated power to demand centers.

New public-private partnerships have been established to address more comprehensively problems with avian (bird and bat) deaths resulting from wind farms. Some stakeholders oppose the construction of wind plants for visual reasons, especially in pristine or highly-valued areas. A debate over the potential for wind turbines to interfere with aviation radar emerged in 2006, but most experts believe any possible problems are economically and technically manageable.", "Federal wind power policy has centered primarily on the production tax credit (PTC), a business incentive to operate wind facilities. The PTC is currently set to expire on December 31, 2009. Analysts and wind industry representatives argue that the on-again off-again nature of the PTC is inefficient and leads to higher costs for the industry.

The report is divided into the following sections:", "Background on wind energy; Wind resources and technology; Industry composition and trends; Wind power economics; and Policy issues.", "Three policy issues may be of particular concern to Congress:", "Should the renewable energy production tax credit be extended past its currently scheduled expiration at the end of 2009, and, if so, how would it be funded? The economic analysis suggests that the credit significantly improves the economics of wind power compared to fossil and nuclear generation. Should the Congress pass legislation intended to facilitate the construction of new transmission capacity to serve wind farms? As discussed below, sites for wind facilities are often remote from load centers and may require new, expensive transmission infrastructure. Texas and California have implemented state policies to encourage the development of new transmission lines to serve wind and other remote renewable energy sources. Legislation before the Congress would create a federal equivalent. Should the Congress establish a national renewable portfolio standard (RPS)? As discussed in the report, the economics of wind are competitive, but not always compelling, compared to fossil and nuclear energy options, and because wind power is dependent on the vagaries of the weather it is not as reliable as conventional sources. Some benefits of wind power cited by proponents, such as a long-term reduction in demand for fossil fuels, are not easily quantified. To jump-start wind power development past these hurdles, many states have instituted RPS programs that require power companies to meet minimum renewable generation goals. A national RPS requirement has been considered and, to date, rejected by Congress.", "Other policy questions, such as federal funding for wind research and development, and siting and permitting requirements, are also outlined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The modern wind industry began in the early 1980s when the first utility-scale turbines were installed in California and Denmark. Wind power then, as today, was driven by high energy prices, energy insecurity, and concern about environmental degradation. Early wind turbines, installed primarily at Altamont Pass outside of San Francisco in California, were primitive compared to today's machines, and suffered from poor reliability and high costs. Like most new technology, early wind turbines had to go through a process of \"learning by doing,\" where shortcomings were discovered, components were redesigned, and new machines were installed in a continuing cycle.", "Today's wind industry is notably different from that in the early 1980s. Wind turbines now are typically 100 times more powerful than early versions and employ sophisticated materials, electronics, and aerodynamics. Costs have declined, making wind more competitive with other power generation options. Large companies and investment banks now drive most wind power activity compared to the early days of collaborating scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs.", "From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s the U.S. wind industry stagnated due to low energy prices and the technology's reputation for high cost and low reliability. But researchers continued to make improvements in the technology, driving down costs and improving reliability. New federal and state incentives encouraged developers to focus on the production of electricity at wind plants (also known as wind farms) and not just installing the equipment. In 1999, the U.S. industry began a period of rapid expansion, slowed occasionally by expiring federal incentives. Strong growth continues to this day, but whether that growth will continue in the face of the current financial crisis is unclear."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Rise of Wind", "paragraphs": ["Wind power is no longer an \"alternative\" source of energy in many regions of the country.

In 2007 the U.S. wind power industry brought over 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity on-line, the largest annual increase ever by any country. The United States was not alone in strong growth for wind power in 2007: global installations rose by 27% to reach a total of 94,123 megawatts. Only Germany, with 22,247 megawatts, has more wind power capacity than the United States.", "Wind power's growth is driven by a combination of the following:", "improvements in wind energy technology, high and volatile fossil fuel prices, the federal wind production tax credit (PTC) incentive, state renewable portfolio standards (RPS), difficulty siting and financing new coal-fired power plants given expectation of a future carbon constraint, and consumer preference for renewable energy.", "However, wind power still accounts for only about 1% of the total electricity generated in the United States. In some regions, a lack of transmission capacity is already beginning to constrain further growth in the wind power sector. And in states like Iowa, Texas, and Minnesota, where wind power has achieved a higher share of total electricity generation, there are concerns that additional wind power could lead to higher prices or threaten grid security. Finally, there is currently a shortage of wind turbine components and a backlog in scheduling transmission interconnection, leading to delays and rising costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits and Drawbacks of Wind Power", "paragraphs": ["There are frequently noted benefits and drawbacks to wind energy.

This variability can create added expenses and complexity in balancing supply and demand on the grid. Several recent studies note that system integration costs do not become significant ($3 to $5 per megawatt-hour) until wind turbines account for 15-30% of the capacity in a control area. These apparently modest cost estimates have yet to be confirmed within the context of the U.S. electricity system.", "Another concern is that new transmission infrastructure may be required to send the wind-generated power to where it is needed. This can be an expensive and time-consuming effort. There are debates over how construction costs should be allocated among end users and which pricing methodologies are most economically efficient. Although transmission constraints face all new power generating options, wind power is especially handicapped because wind resources are often far from demand centers and do not usually use the full capacity of the transmission line due to the variable output. Texas is analyzing new transmission capacity to send wind-generator power from West Texas to the more populated northern and eastern sections of the state that could cost from $3 billion to over $6 billion. On a national scale, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) states that the most cost-effective way to meet a 20% wind energy target by 2030 would be by constructing over 12,000 miles of new transmission lines at a cost of approximately $20 billion. (See the section on \" Transmission Constraints \" for more on this issue.)", "Wind power is supported by federal and state incentives. In 2007, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of DOE estimated that federal incentives for wind\u2014primarily the PTC\u2014totaled $724 million. In 2008, incentives could exceed $1 billion if wind generation expands from 32 billion kilowatt-hours to 48 billion kilowatt-hours as estimated by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), a national trade association promoting wind. Costs to states using RPS policies are difficult to estimate because they are mandated requirements. Some believe that these are high costs to pay for a relatively small amount of energy. Others note that wind energy is an evolving technology and additional breakthroughs are possible. Many in the industry believe that the on-again, off-again nature of the federal PTC incentives harm rational development of the\u00a0sector.", "Among some critics, wind power also results in unacceptable bird and bat deaths.

These issues are discussed in a later section of the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Wind turbines have no direct emissions of air pollutants, including oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, mercury, particulates, and carbon dioxide. They also offset the need to mine, process, and ship coal and uranium; drill and transport natural gas (and to a much lesser degree, oil); and construct or maintain hydroelectric dams. As noted previously, wind power contributed approximately 32 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to the U.S. electricity grid in 2007; if that electricity had been generated using the average mix of power plants in the United States, an additional 19.5 million tons of carbon dioxide would have been released that year.", "Given rising prices for coal, natural gas, and nuclear fuel, power suppliers are drawn to the certainty that wind\u2014while variable\u2014is inexhaustible and has no fuel cost. By displacing coal-fired and gas-fired generation, wind power would reduce the demand for these fuels, perhaps moderating future prices and price volatility.", "Wind plants can catalyze rural development because farmers and ranchers receive royalty payments from wind developers who lease their land; the vast majority remains available for crops or grazing. Farmers and ranchers typically receive from project developers $2,000-5,000 per year for each turbine on their land. The land taken out of production for wind turbine pads, access roads, and ancillary equipment reduces income for corn farmers, for example, by about $165 per turbine.", "Wind energy provides an additional source of revenue for local governments in the form of property taxes on wind plant owners. Wind turbines\u2014unlike fossil and nuclear power plants\u2014do not require water for cooling, a potentially important issue in areas with scarce water resources. Also, the lead time for planning and constructing wind plants is shorter than that for nuclear and coal, assuming transmission access is not an issue.", "Finally, wind power proponents argue that wind energy creates \"green collar\" manufacturing and field service jobs rather than traditional carbon-intensive employment. A study by Navigant Consulting in February 2008 estimated that 76,000 U.S. jobs in the wind industry were at risk if the PTC is not renewed well before its expiration in December 2008.

The generator, and accompanying power conditioning equipment, then delivers electricity to the transmission grid at the appropriate voltage and frequency. The process is roughly opposite to a common household fan, which uses electricity to turn the blades and create air motion.", "Wind turbines can stand alone or be integrated into wind farms with power generating capacity equaling that of a traditional power plant.

First, a wind turbine's power output varies with the cube of wind speed. Thus, all else held constant, if wind velocity doubles, power output increases eight-fold. Wind power developers, therefore, face the challenge of finding where winds blow best. Winds at 250 feet in altitude are stronger and steadier than those closer to the ground; this factor explains why wind turbine towers are placed high in the air.", "Second, power output varies with the area swept out by the turbine blades during their rotation. Doubling a turbine blade's length will yield a quadrupling of power output. Today's utility-scale wind turbine blades are commonly 130 feet long or more in an attempt to harness more energy. Turbine manufacturers have devoted attention over the past two decades to finding materials strong and durable enough to handle the twisting forces that are transmitted from the longer blades through the rotor and gearbox in fluctuating winds.", "Finally, power output increases directly with air density. Density is typically higher in winter months and at low altitudes, and lower in summer months and at high altitudes.

Additional mapping efforts characterize seasonal and even daily variations in average wind speed.

While this potential is not realistically achievable, wind power advocates, supported by a recent DOE study, believe that wind power could realistically contribute 20% of the nation's total electricity generation by the year 2030. The U.S. Great Plains states contain most of the best onshore wind resources.

Coal plants average a capacity factor of 70%, but individual plants can have a much higher or lower utilization rate. Wind plants, on the other hand, have capacity factors typically ranging from 20% to 40%. Wind turbines usually spin 65% to 90% of the time, but only at their full rated capacity about 10% of the time. A recent study pegs the typical capacity factor for wind turbines at 34%. Offshore wind turbines generally have higher capacity factors than onshore units because ocean winds are steadier than those over land.", "A high capacity factor helps lower a plant's levelized, or annualized, cost of electricity (see section on \" Wind Power Economics \").

For this reason power systems are built around generating technologies that are dispatchable and predictable\u2014that is, units that can be reliably turned on or off, or have their output ramped up or down, as needed to meet changes in load. However, because a wind turbine is weather dependent it is not dispatchable or as predicable as a fossil or nuclear unit. As noted previously, energy storage can help address this shortcoming in wind energy, although it also results in higher costs.", "When a power system is dependent on only small amounts of wind generation to meet load, the variations in wind output can be absorbed by the system's existing buffer capacity. This capacity is either fossil fuel, nuclear, or dispatchable renewable energy (e.g., hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass). However, when wind constitutes a large part of the system's total generating capacity, perhaps 10% to 15% or greater, the system must incur additional costs to provide reliable backup for the wind turbines. For example, in 2007 a utility in Montana built a gas-fired plant for the primary purpose of compensating for wind power variability. Various estimates have been made of the cost of integrating large blocks of wind capacity into a power system. Estimates for integration costs range from $1.85 to $4.97 per megawatt-hour. In 2008, the Bonneville Power Administration established a wind integration charge of $2.82 per megawatt-hour. (See Text Box 4 for a description of a recent system integration issue in Texas.)", "In summary, wind power has the economic advantage of zero fuel costs and no costs for the pollution controls associated with the consumption of fossil and nuclear fuel. However, wind plants have relatively high fixed costs, and the plants cannot be operated as intensively as fossil or nuclear plants due to the variability of the wind. Wind variability also creates system integration costs at high levels of wind penetration. These cost disadvantages are partly offset by the federal renewable production tax credit (discussed below) and also, in effect, by state renewable portfolio standards that mandate the use of renewable power."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Levelized Cost Comparison", "paragraphs": ["Although wind power is not dispatchable, it is often seen as a replacement or supplement for conventional baseload power plants. This is because when wind conditions are favorable a wind turbine is used like a baseload plant: the wind turbine is run at full load as continuously as possible. The following economic analysis therefore compares wind power to the primary baseload alternative technologies using coal, nuclear power, or natural gas. Each technology is described briefly in Text Box 5 .", "The generation costs of these technologies and wind power are compared using the financial analysis technique of levelized costs, which summarizes the estimated lifetime costs of each system as a levelized (\"annualized\") cost per megawatt-hour of generation. This analysis is for plants entering commercial service in 2015, and costs are measured in constant 2008 dollars. The financial methodology and the key assumptions concerning plant costs and operations are described in the Appendix . The current estimate of \"overnight\" construction costs for each technology\u2014that is, the cost that would be incurred if a plant could be built instantly\u2014are summarized in Table 2 , along with the assumed capacity factor. Table 2 also indicates the type of entity assumed to build each kind of plant. Coal and nuclear plants are assumed to be constructed by regulated utilities that have the financial resources and regulatory support to undertake these very large and expensive projects. The natural gas combined-cycle plant is assumed to be built by an independent power producer (IPP). IPPs generally prefer gas-fired projects because of their relatively low capital costs and risk profiles. The wind plant is also assumed to be an IPP project because regulated utilities normally cannot make use of the production tax credit. Again, the estimates in Table 2 do not include the impacts of the financial crisis that began in late summer 2008.", "Costs were estimated for six cases intended to illustrate some of the important economic, operational, and government incentive factors that influence the relative economics of wind power. The Base Case (Case 1) assumes continuation of the renewable production tax credit as currently formulated. It also assumes the nuclear plant qualifies for the nuclear production tax credit (at an effective rate of $12 per megawatt-hour) and loan guarantee program established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. No carbon costs are assumed. The five alternative cases have the following characteristics (each is identical to the Base Case except as indicated):", "Case 2: Reduced Incentives . The renewable production tax credit is assumed to terminate and is not renewed. The nuclear plant is assumed to not receive a loan guarantee. Case 3: High Natural Gas Prices . Natural gas prices are assumed to be 50% higher than the current EIA forecast used in the Base Case. Case 4: Carbon Costs . This case assumes the imposition of controls on carbon emissions from fossil fueled power plants. An illustrative allowance price of $25 per metric ton of carbon dioxide is assumed, escalating at a real rate of one percent per year, first imposed in 2013. Case 5: Wind Capacity Factor . This case assumes that the wind plant has a capacity factor of 44% rather than the 34% used in the Base Case. The higher capacity factor could be the result of improved technology or a better-than-average location. Case 6: Wind Integration Cost . A system integration charge is added to the cost of wind power. The assumed cost is the Bonneville Power Administration charge of $2.82 per megawatt-hour. This cost is assumed to remain constant in real dollar terms for the forecast period.", "The results for the six cases are summarized in Table 3 . These estimates should be viewed\u00a0as indicative and not definitive, and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. As shown\u00a0in the table:", "In Case 1, the levelized cost of wind power is a few percent higher than coal or gas-fired power; given the range of uncertainty in the assumptions, the costs of these options are essentially similar. Nuclear power, which is assumed to benefit from the full range of federal incentives (a production tax credit and loan guarantee) is about 10% less expensive than wind and the least expensive of all the alternatives examined. In Case 2, reducing incentives significantly changes the results. If the renewable production tax credit is assumed to terminate, the cost of wind power increases by 10%. In this situation coal and gas have a 14% to 15% cost advantage over wind. However, the biggest impact of reducing incentives is on nuclear power. Assuming no loan guarantee, the cost of nuclear power increases by 28% (from $60 to $77 per megawatt-hour). In this situation, wind power's cost (also without a production tax credit) is essentially similar (slightly lower) than nuclear\u00a0power. Natural gas prices have historically been difficult to forecast and often underestimated. When gas prices are assumed to be 50% higher than in the Base Case, wind has an 18% cost advantage over gas-fired electricity (Case 3). The imposition of an illustrative cost of $25 per metric ton of carbon dioxide on fossil-fired generation (Case 4) has the greatest impact on the relative competitiveness of wind with coal. The carbon cost takes coal from a 4% cost advantage over wind in the Base Case to a 19% disadvantage. The impact on gas-fired power is significant, but less dramatic; gas goes from a 6% cost advantage to a 4% disadvantage when carbon costs are imposed. As discussed above, the combination of high capital costs and relatively low utilization rates, as measured by the capacity factor, creates a cost disadvantage for wind power. The importance of utilization is illustrated by Case 5, which assumes a wind capacity factor of 44%, compared to the 34% rate used in the Base Case. With a high capacity factor, wind has the lowest cost of the alternatives examined, and in particular is over 25% less costly than coal or gas. The final case (Case 6) assumes the imposition of a system integration charge of $2.82 per Mwh on wind generation. As Table 5 shows, costs under this case and the Base Case are similar.", "In summary, the financial analysis suggests the following:", "Given the Base Case assumptions, including continuation of the renewable production tax credit, the cost of wind power is comparable to coal and gas. The addition of an illustrative system integration charge, to account for large-scale wind penetration of a utility system, does not greatly change these results. Federal financial incentive policies have a significant impact on the financial analysis. The economics of wind are materially worse when the production tax credit is eliminated, and materially improved versus nuclear power when nuclear incentives are reduced. Improved technology or prime locations that allow wind projects to achieve high rates of utilization would significantly lower the cost of wind power. Assuming higher natural gas prices than the current EIA reference forecast, or the imposition of carbon charges on coal and gas, greatly enhances the cost competitiveness of wind."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Wind Policy Issues", "paragraphs": ["This section of the report discusses government policy issues related to wind power.

These variables are encapsulated within an annualized capital cost for a project computed using a \"capital charge rate.\" The financial model used for this study computes a project-specific capital charge rate that reflects, for example, the assumed cost of money and the applicable depreciation schedule.", "In the case of publicly owned utilities the return on capital is a function of the interest rate. A \"capital recovery factor\" reflecting each project's cost of money is computed and used to calculate a mortgage-type levelized annual payment.", "Combining the annualized capital cost with the annualized cash flows yields the total estimated annualized cost of a project. This annualized cost is divided by the projected yearly output of electricity to produce a cost per Mwh for each technology. By \"annualizing\" the costs in this manner it is possible to compare alternatives with different year-to-year cost patterns on an apples-to-apples basis.", "Inputs to the financial model include financing costs, forecasted fuel prices, non-fuel operations and maintenance expense, the efficiency with which fossil-fueled plants convert fuel to electricity, and typical utilization rates (see Table A-1 , Table A-2 , and Table A-3 ). Most of these inputs are taken from published sources, such as EIA's assumptions used to produce its 2007 and 2008 long-term energy forecasts. Overnight power plant capital costs\u2014that is, the cost to construct a plant before financing expenses\u2014are estimated by CRS based on a review of public information on recent projects.", "Government incentives are also an important part of the financial analysis. EPACT05 created or extended federal incentive programs for coal, nuclear, and renewable technologies. This study assumes the following incentives:", "A renewable energy production tax credit of 2.0 cents per kWh, with the value indexed to inflation . The credit applies to the first 10 years of a plant's operation. The Base Case analysis assumes that the tax credit, which is currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2008, will be extended (as has happened in the past). The credit is available only to wind power production that is sold to an unaffiliated third party. Under most circumstances this requirement effectively limits the production tax credit to independent power producers. A utility that owns a wind plant and uses the power to serve its own load would not qualify. The credit is currently available to new wind, geothermal, and several other renewable energy sources. New solar energy systems do not qualify, and geothermal systems can take the production tax credit only if they do not use the renewable investment tax credit (discussed below). A nuclear energy production tax credit for new advanced nuclear plants of 1.8 cents per kWh . The credit applies to the first eight years of operation. Unlike the renewable production tax credit described above, the nuclear credit is not indexed to inflation and therefore drops in real value over time. This credit is subject to several limitations: It is available to plants that begin construction before January 1, 2014, and enter service before January 1, 2021. For each project the annual credit is limited to $125 million per thousand megawatts of generating capacity. The full amount of the credit will be available to qualifying facilities only if the total capacity of the qualifying facilities is 6,000 megawatts or less. If the total qualifying capacity exceeds 6,000 megawatts the amount of the credit available to each plant will be prorated. For example, EIA assumes in its 2007 Annual Energy Outlook that 9,000 megawatts of new nuclear capacity qualifies; in this case the credit amount drops to 1.2 cents per kWh. The Base Case for this study follows EIA in using the 1.2 cent per kWh assumption for the effective value of the credit. Loan guarantees for carbon-control technologies, including nuclear power. Under final DOE rules, the loan guarantees can cover up to 80% of the cost of a project. Guarantees are made available based on a case-by-case evaluation of applicants and are dependent on congressional authority (in April 2008, the Department of Energy announced plans to solicit up to $18.5 billion in loan guarantee applications for nuclear projects ). Entities receiving loan guarantees must make a \"credit subsidy cost\" payment to the federal treasury that reflects the net anticipated cost of the guarantee to the government, including a probability of default. The guarantees are, under current rules, unlikely to be available to public power entities. Energy Investment Tax Credit . Tax credits under this program are available to certain renewable energy systems, including solar and geothermal electricity generation, and some other innovative energy technologies. Wind energy systems do not qualify. The credit is 10% for systems installed after January 1, 2009. Geothermal projects that take the investment tax credit cannot take the renewable production tax credit.", "The results of the analysis are shown in the main body of the report. Note that these estimates are approximations subject to a high degree of uncertainty over such factors as future fuel and capital costs. The rankings of the technologies by cost are therefore also an approximation and should not be viewed as a definitive estimate of the relative cost-competitiveness of each option. Also note that site-specific factors would influence an actual developer's choice of generating technologies. For example, coal may be less costly if a plant is close to coal mines, and the economics of wind depend in part on the strength and consistency of the wind in a given area."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
