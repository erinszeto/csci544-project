This \"donor-donee\" state issue has been contentious during every reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs since 1982. It has again emerged during the congressional debate over reauthorization of the current highway funding program, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: a Legacy for Users (SAFETEA; P.L. 109-59), which has been extended through December 31, 2011.", "\"Donor states\" are states whose highway users are estimated to pay more to the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund than they receive. \"Donee states\" receive more than they pay.", "Traditionally, the donor states, located mainly in the South and Midwest, have asserted that they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of infrastructure in other parts of the country, especially in the Northeast. Donee state advocates have responded that some transportation needs are inherently federal rather than state, and that a national highway network cannot be based solely on state or regional boundaries. Although the argument continues, the facts on the ground have changed: Federal Highway Administration figures indicate that for FY2007-FY2009 all 50 states were donee states, because outlays from the Highway Trust Fund exceeded federal highway tax receipts in each year.", "This report examines the donor-donee issue in the context of the effort to reauthorize federal surface transportation programs. The main questions facing Congress are the following:", "How can the donor-donee controversy be resolved amid efforts to reduce the federal deficit, given that the solution in the past was to give all states more money? How might the donor-donee issue be resolved if highway program spending were limited to the annual revenues flowing into the highway account of the HTF? How can the donor-donee issue be resolved if highway spending over the next several years is restricted to the SAFETEA baseline level? Has the \"user pays\" principle, under which highway infrastructure is funded by taxes paid by the highway users who benefit from it, been violated and, if so, what are the implications for the \"equity\" of the distribution of federal highway spending?", "In recent years, Congress has provided three transfers from the general fund totaling $29.7 billion to shore up the highway account. These general fund transfers to the HTF are unrelated to highway taxes and thereby weaken the arguments for a guaranteed rate of return on each state's highway tax payments to the HTF.

", "Funds are allocated in one of two ways:", "The vast majority of highway grants are formula (apportioned) funds. The formula programs apportion funds to the various state departments of transportation (state DOTs) based on formulas set forth in legislation. The discretionary programs are programs nominally under the control of the FHWA that were designed to provide funds to projects chosen on a competitive basis. Since FY2000 nearly all of this funding has been earmarked by Congress, except in FY2007 and FY2011.", "The distinction between formula and discretionary programs becomes especially significant in the process of creating equity programs, such as the current Equity Bonus Program (EB), which was designed to make sure that states receive federal highway grants equal to at least a specified share of their federal highway tax payments\u2014a percentage referred to as the \"rate of return.\" It is difficult to conceive of how discretionary programs could be constructed to guarantee a designated rate of return to every state and still remain discretionary. Also, the formula programs were originally created to fulfill policy needs, such as maintenance of the Interstate System or the repair and reconstruction of deficient highway bridges.", "Some highway needs, such as roads on federal lands, border crossing infrastructure, trade corridors, and Interstate System maintenance, have inherently federal aspects that would likely not be addressed fully if the Federal-Aid Highway Program were predicated on a rate of return to all states. Even advocates of devolving the FAHP to the states have acknowledged the existence of some federal needs. In addition, donor states themselves have in the past recognized the need for some states to get larger than normal shares of federal-aid funds. During the debate that preceded passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 (ISTEA; P.L. 102-240 ), for example, donor states agreed that large, sparsely populated states and some small states should receive larger shares.", "To deal with these problems in a way that retains programmatic policy goals and at the same time achieves improvement in the uniformity of states' return on payments, Congress has decided to leave some programs outside of the equity programs, such as the Federal Lands Highways programs and the National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program.

Revenues from the fuel taxes are also distributed to the Mass Transit Account (2.86 cents per gallon) and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund (0.1 cents per gallon). All tire, truck and trailer, and heavy-vehicle use tax revenues go solely to the highway account.", "Because the federal taxes on fuel are collected at the first point of distribution (at the terminal \"rack,\" usually at a refinery or a fuel tank farm) rather than at the retail level, most of the revenue is collected from a small number of corporations (often large oil companies or distributors that own fuel farms) located in a relatively small number of places. This means that the Treasury has no way of knowing how much fuel tax should be attributed to each state.", "FHWA has a process to estimate each state's share of payments to the highway account. In simplified form, the process is as follows:", "The Treasury Department provides FHWA with national revenue estimates for each kind of tax (gasoline, diesel, special fuels, and truck-related sales, etc.). FHWA then examines state fuel tax data to produce estimates of on-highway gallons of fuel taxed in each state (use is difficult to track as vehicles can gas up in one state and then travel in another). Each state's estimated on-highway gallons are divided by national total gallons. The resulting distribution is a representation of each state's share of national consumption, measured in gallons. The Treasury's estimates of total revenues received from highway users are then multiplied by the derived state shares of gallons to produce each state's estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. The shares of the various truck-related taxes are extrapolated from estimates of diesel fuel use in each state. Gathering, compiling, reviewing and releasing the data usually takes more than a year from the end of each federal fiscal year. Consequently, the attribution estimates used to calculate the Equity Bonus are two years old."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Brief History of the Donor-Donee Issue", "paragraphs": ["The concern by states that federal spending might benefit other states' road infrastructure more than their own has a long history. In 1808, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin recommended that the federal government provide $20 million over a ten-year period for a national network of canals and roads. The plan, however, was never funded. Among the factors that mitigated against the plan was the view of Southern states, which generally opposed federal grants for roads and canals, that spending would benefit other regions more than the South. The New England states, which had relatively good roads, opposed federal funding for roads because they expected the money would be spent for roads outside New England. Anticipating these regional concerns, of the $20 million recommended in the report, Gallatin proposed that only $16.6 million be designated for the network of roads and canals. The remaining $3.4 million was to provide benefits to those \"eastern and perhaps southern states\" which \"are less immediately interested in those inland communications\" provided for in the plan. Even with this incentive, the Gallatin plan failed to gain sufficient support to be passed. This could be thought of as forerunner of the modern minimum guarantees within the context of the donor-donee debate.", "Donor-donee arguments emerged again during debate on the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 355), which established the first federal aid for roads on a programmatic basis. An opponent of the legislation, Senator Lippitt of Rhode Island, presented a table to his Senate colleagues showing the share of highway spending each state would receive out of each $25 million of road aid provided, in comparison to that state's share of every $25 million in federal income and corporate taxes paid. His table indicated that 12 states (except for California, all located in the Northeast and upper Midwest) would receive smaller shares of road aid than they contributed in taxes. According to his table, three states, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania, would together contribute more than 50% of the tax revenue but receive only between 11% and 12% of road spending. Senator Lippitt's table, however, did not forestall passage of the bill.", "Forty years later, the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 (70 Stat. 387) established the HTF. The impetus was the construction of the Interstate System (IS). Because the timing of construction would vary greatly from state to state, the construction of the Interstate System did not lend itself well to arguments in support of an equal rate of return on each year's highway tax payments. The act did, in creating the HTF, make it possible to attribute the flows of revenues from each state's highway users to the fund.", "Although the argument regarding a fair return on tax payments did not disappear entirely after the passage of the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, it did not surface as a major issue until after the first publication of Table FE-221 in the 1972 edition of the FHWA's annual Highway Statistics. The table's publication provided a statistical source that supported concerns about the state \"fair share\" issue that persist to this day. Table FE-221, \"Comparison of Estimated State Payments into and Receipts from the Highway Trust Fund, and Federal-Aid Apportionments: Fiscal Years 1957-1972,\" presented in side-by-side format each state's payments to and receipts from the HTF and the ratio of aggregate payments to receipts for the fiscal years since the creation of the trust fund (in nominal dollars). The receipt of federal aid for each dollar paid to the highway trust fund, from FY1957 through 1972, varied greatly from state to state. Alaska appeared to fare best and North Carolina worst at $8.34 and $0.52, respectively.", "During the 1970s, significant construction was still underway on the Interstate Highway System, and the amount of work continued to vary significantly from state to state. By the early 1980s, the Interstate System was nearing completion. At the same time, a general perception that U.S. roads and bridges had deteriorated coincided with growing support for increased spending on transportation infrastructure, in part, as an economic stimulus measure. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-424 ) included the first attempt to mitigate the dissatisfaction of donor states by providing that each state would receive a minimum core program allocation of 85% of its estimated highway tax payments to the highway account of the HTF. Since the 1982 act, all surface transportation reauthorization bills have included equity programs. For a detailed legislative history of these changes, see Appendix A .", "The debate over equity among donor and donee states has had a role in the shifting balance of control of and responsibility for highway spending between the federal government and the states. Some critics also see the donor-donee debate as one symptom of a loss of focus in the federal highway program. Under the 1956 Act the Interstate System was envisioned as being completed in the early 1970s, and the tax rates were to revert to their pre-FY1957 levels in FY1973. This was never allowed to happen. Instead, money was shifted to non-Interstate highway programs and eligibility criteria were expanded. For example, the federal matching share for non-Interstate projects increased from 50% to 70% of project cost in 1970, to 75% in 1978, and to 80% in 1992. As the federal financial commitment increased, the states successfully pressed for increased flexibility to move federal funds among the various federal highway programs and to transit. Another effect was earmarking, which emerged as a major force in ISTEA and has continued through SAFETEA. Earmarking allowed Members of Congress to directly control the spending of the growing HTF revenues and also to preempt or override project decisions made at the state level or by the federal Department of Transportation. The donor-donee fight is thus a symptom of the tension between the policy goal of concentrating spending on projects that have national or multi-state benefits and the political urge to spread funding as widely as possible."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Donor-Donee State Arguments", "paragraphs": ["The donor state argument is that for the sake of equity each state should receive federal highway funding roughly equal to the fees and taxes that the state's highway users pay into the HTF. Equity advocates tend to view highway account as if it were a sealed system in which the overall inflow and outflow are equal each year. In such a system, simply having each state's percentage of total national spending equal the state's percent of the total nation-wide payments to the HTF would achieve equity.", "Donor state advocates generally contend that they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure, especially of the older highway infrastructure in the Northeast. Most also argue that they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending to the same degree as some donee states. Southern and certain Western donor states also point out that they are fast growth areas, relative to most donee states, and that consequently their needs are as great or greater. Finally, they assert that since completion of the Interstate Highway System there is no valid rationale for any donor-donee disparity.", "Donee states argue that fairness should not be separated from need. They assert that the age of their highway infrastructures (especially those in Northeastern states), the high cost of working on heavily congested urban roads, as well as the limited financial resources of large, sparsely populated western states justify those states' donee status. They also argue that some needs are inherently federal, such as a national highway network, and that these needs cannot be funded solely according to state or regional boundaries. Furthermore, donee states argue that Midwestern and Southern donor states often spend less local and state money, relative to the federal funding they receive, on highways than donee states, and chide these donor states for pleading for federal funds when they are unwilling to ante up their own state and local resources.", "It is worth noting that the Federal-Aid Highway Program is the only federal program that considers rate-of-return criteria. Objections to viewing federal highway spending in the conceptual framework of donor and donee states are often based on the fact that some highway program donor states are donee states in terms of federal tax and spending flows overall, or with respect to specific federal spending such as defense or human service programs. Emphasis on each state's rate of return on highway tax revenues may constrain the federal government's ability to address changing national needs, and it also complicates efforts to make freight-related road improvements that may benefit surrounding states or the nation as a whole far more than the state in which t he project will be carried out."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Fund Transfers and the \"User Pays\" Principle", "paragraphs": ["Over the course of the first 50 years of the HTF's existence, significant amounts of money have been transferred to it from the Treasury's general fund. Although much of the transferred funding reflected federal interest payments on the HTF's unexpended balances (such transfers ended in 1998), the interest was paid by revenues provided by the general taxpayers, and not directly by highway user fees. Some other funds have been transferred to the HTF for a variety of reasons, including those compensating the HTF for lower ethanol tax rates. Over a 16 month period from 2008 to 2010, Congress approved appropriations of $29.7 billion of Treasury general fund revenues to the HTF's highway account. This amount was roughly equal to 35% of the Federal Highway Administration budget for FY2009 and FY2010 combined. ", "The pattern of revenue flow from the taxpayers to the general fund is unrelated to highway user taxes and charges. For example, some long-term HTF donee states, such as New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, are donor states when it comes to general fund expenditures. The larger the general fund contribution to the HTF, the harder it is to argue that states should get a return based on their highway users' payments to the highway account."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Trust Fund Sufficiency Dilemma", "paragraphs": ["Congress faces difficult policy choices in resolving the seemingly contradictory goals of meeting donor state demands for a higher rate of return and protecting the highway funding of donee states at a time when the revenue base of the highway account is insufficient to fund both goals at the same time. Legislatively, part of the problem is that a bill that simply reduces the shares of donee states to increase the shares of donor states might have difficulty passing Congress. To provide an equitable rate-of-return structure to overcome this obstacle, reauthorization bills have, in past practice, included \"hold harmless\" provisions that maintained certain base shares. This process of bringing donor state shares up to the guaranteed percentage return has required increasing the overall federal highway program size, usually by a large amount (since donee state funding could not be reduced). Achieving a sense of equity in this way is very expensive. The Equity Bonus program (EB) under SAFETEA, in fact, was the largest highway program ($41 billion over the five year life of the bill). Finding sufficient funds to support an equity distribution mechanism is likely to be a major difficulty in reauthorization.", "In a broader sense, the debate over equity remedies has implications for a number of transportation issues. A guaranteed rate of return that exceeds 95% could leave little room for addressing additional transportation needs that are viewed as uniquely federal, such as the Federal Lands Highway Program or the Interstate Maintenance Program. Further, as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%, the federal government would essentially be collecting HTF revenues only to return them to the states with no redistribution. This could place the rationale for a federal role in highway finance in question."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Which States Are Donors?", "paragraphs": ["The donor-donee debate revolves around the use, and some would say misuse, of statistics. One method of determining a state's status as a donor or donee is based on dollars; if the state's highway users are estimated to have paid more into the highway account in a given year than the state's apportionment and allocation of federal highway funding, it would be considered a donor state. The other method considers not dollars but rather shares; if a state's proportion of all revenue flowing into the highway account is less than its proportion of nationwide apportionments and allocations from the account, then the state would be considered a donor state even if it receives more dollars than its highway users paid in. This share-in/share-out method eliminates the impact of the spending down of the account's unexpended balances on the determination of donor-donee status and also treats general fund revenues transferred to the highway account the same as revenues generated from highway taxes. The share-in/share-out calculation makes the donor-donee controversy self-perpetuating: there will always be donor states unless the distribution of every cent of federal spending is based on 100% rate of return on state payments to the highway account.", "These two methods can lead to significant differences in reported donor or donee status. For example, in FY2007, Arizona's dollar-in/dollar-out ratio was 1.03, making it, by that measure, a donee state. On the other hand, in that same year Arizona's payments to the highway account were 2.127% of the national total whereas its allocations from the fund were 1.823% of the national total. Dividing its percentage of total nationwide allocations (1.823) by its percentage of nationwide payments into the fund (2.127) yields a ratio of 0.86, making it, by that measure, a donor state. ", "In that same year, using the dollar-in/dollar-out method there were no states that did not have more money made available to them than their highway users paid to the HTF. Using the share-in/share-out method for the year, however, produces 27 states that were below the 1.0 ratio and could claim to be donor states.", " Table 1 below, reproduces FHWA's Donor-Donee statistics for the SAFETEA years, FY2005 through FY2009, using the dollar in-dollar out method. These figures are compiled from the FE-221 tables in FHWA's annual Highway Statistics , which provides a consistent source for this information since 1972. Although the cumulative ratios since 1956 are widely cited in debate over transportation policy, these ratios are of limited value, as FHWA compiles them by adding up annual figures over time with no adjustment for inflation.", "Some states move back and forth across the donor-donee divide from year to year. HTF revenues are sensitive to the condition of the economy and can have a significant impact in the pattern of payments to the HTF. Some of the results can seem counterintuitive. For example, a donor state may become a donee state because an economic downturn reduces expenditures on fuel and sales of trucks and heavy tires, such that the state is generating fewer transportation tax revenues for the HTF. Another factor that can influence donor-donee status is shifts in fuel use. Gasoline and diesel fuel have different tax rates and, because of this, shifts in use due to a change in the vehicle mix can influence the amount of revenue produced in a state.", "The impact of the general fund transfers that began in late FY2008 has, however, dwarfed the impacts of any of these statistical changes. SAFETEA was written intentionally to draw down the unexpended balance of the highway account. Because the HTF was paying out more than was flowing in for these years, most states' ratios exceeded 1.0. For FY2007 and FY2008 all 50 states had ratios above 1.0 (received more than they were estimated to have paid in) so there were, on a dollar-in/dollar-out basis no donor states. For FY2009 general fund transfers had a significant effect on rates of return. Not only did all 50 states fall into the donee category, but the national ratio was 1.41 (the federal government was paying out $1.41 for every dollar it collected in highway user fees for the Highway Account, not counting ARRA stimulus funding).", "However, even if the highway account were self-sufficient, a 100% return on payments to all states would not be possible. The highway account must cover FHWA administrative as well as spending for programs such as the Federal Lands Highways Program, for which needs are not evenly distributed among the states. In recognition of these needs, during the last two reauthorizations donor state advocates have pressed for a guaranteed rate-of-return ratio of 0.95 rather than 1.0.", "The variety of possible ways to determine a state's status as a donor or donee\u2014the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has offered at least four \u2014has made it possible for those concerned with highway funding to cite whichever statistics best serve their purposes. In some cases, advocates selectively combine data from different years or in other ways modify the rate of return to derive figures and projections that show a particular state to be disadvantaged.

Other programs would have been taken over by the states. A four-year phase out of 12 cents of the 18.4 cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax would have corresponded with the declining federal role, leaving states the option raising their own gasoline taxes to replace federal grants. States would then have had the freedom to spend on their own roads and transit systems as they saw fit. Reaction to this proposal was mixed, with some state-level officials wary of the political implications of pushing large replacement gas tax increases through their state legislatures and keeping those revenues dedicated to transportation.", "More recently, in February 2011, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Jeff Flake introduced bills, S. 252 / H.R. 632 , the Highway Fairness and Reform Act of 2011 , which would allow a state to elect to receive the equivalent of its state contribution to the Highway Account in lieu of participating in the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The bills would require that general funds deposited in the HTF be treated as if they were taxes appropriated to the fund. Treating general fund transfers as if they were highway tax revenues, however, may weaken the \"equity\" rationale of the devolution argument. ", "Although no proposal to devolve the surface transportation programs has been enacted, restructuring the EB program so that each state receives close to 100% of its road users' payments in federal highway grants would tend to bolster the case for devolution, as the federal government's role becomes more like that of a tax collector for the states. The need for and efficiency of the federal government as middleman would come into question. At this time, however, there appears to be limited interest on the part of the states in any radical change in the federal role in the highway program. As is true with donor state complaints regarding a fair share, devolution arguments in regard to highway policy lose some of their appeal when the general fund is paying a significant portion of the Federal-Aid Highway Program's costs. As long as the general fund infusions prop up the HTF, the status quo will be attractive to most states. ", "This argument against devolution may be particularly compelling in a reauthorization that continues the spending baseline enacted in SAFETEA. Because this scenario would probably require an annual general fund contribution in the neighborhood of $10 billion, states would be unlikely to go along with a devolution plan that does not distribute the general funds to states that wish to opt out of the federal program. On the other hand, under the \"live within the trust fund's means\" scenario, the smaller program size and the alignment of payments to spending might make more states feel that devolution would not reduce the resources they have available for highways.

Then, the lowest percent share of any state or the District of Columbia (generally the District) was used to extrapolate the total program funding (as defined under minimum guarantee) needed for the District to retain its total program percentage.

These programs could be designated in law as being inherently federal. Any other programs whether formula or discretionary would be retained within the scope of the EB. The EB debate would then be focused on a more clearly defined concept of scope. Doing this would require a broad consensus among both donor and donee state Members of Congress.

HPP earmarks, however, do not add money to a state's total below the line funding (i.e., the total of core formula funds plus total HPP funds). This seemingly counterintuitive situation occurs because the below the line funding is subject to the EB Program. As has been mentioned earlier, under the EB, funds are distributed across the formula programs under a complex calculation that is designed to assure that all states get a certain minimum share of the below the line funding. Because the total funding under the line is fixed in the authorization bill, this leads to the situation where states that do not get many HPP earmarks tend to receive, in a relative sense, larger distributions from the EB program while states that get a high value of HPP earmarks tend to receive relatively smaller EB distributions (or no EB distribution). This means that the total amount received by a state under the line tends to be roughly the same whether or not they receive high or low dollar totals of HPP funds.", "A further implication of this situation is that the more of a state's total below the line funding is derived from HPP funds the less funding is ultimately available to the state for the federal-aid highway core formula programs, upon which the state DOTs depend to fulfill their state transportation improvement plans.", "\"Above the Line\" Programs", "In SAFETEA the major earmarked programs above the line are the National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program ($1.9 billion), Projects of National and Regional Significance ($1.8 billion), and Transportation Improvements ($2.5 billion).
