Also called the \"revolving door,\" these movements can take on many forms, including former federal employees lobbying for a domestic or foreign client or engaging in policy work, or individuals entering government to engage in regulatory activity. Some have argued that the revolving door can lead to undue influence by the private sector over governmental activities or vice-versa. Others have argued that government employees need to be restricted with regard to such activities to ensure their \"neutral competence\" and that they represent the interests of the government above all else. ", "Proponents of the revolving door, however, observe that the promise of future private-sector employment could potentially improve the quality of candidates applying for government jobs. They argue that direct connections to government officials are important, but a close relationship is not necessarily what drives lobbying. Some believe that government employees contemplating a move to the private sector will be friendly to industry interests at the expense of the public interest. On the other hand, studies have shown that regulators instead may engage in more aggressive actions against industry and do not favor industry, regardless of their job prospects. Another factor observers raise is that the flow of personnel between the public and private sectors may increase the knowledge base of both sectors.", "Regulating interactions between the public and the government may be carried out through law, executive order, Administration policy\u2014including regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) \u2014or a combination of all three.

Lobbying Activities", "paragraphs": ["All three executive order ethics pledges include additional restrictions on lobbyists. While the concept behind the additional restrictions appears to be similar\u2014prohibiting individuals from lobbying on particular matters they worked on in the public or private sector\u2014the language used to define the types of behavior is different. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) defines a lobbyist as", "any individual who is employed or retained by a client for financial or other compensation for services that include more than one lobbying contact, other than an individual whose lobbying activities constitute less than 20 percent of the time engaged in the services provided by such individual to that client over a 3-month period.

Thus, former appointees were restricted from making contacts with covered officials after their governmental service.", "President Trump's ethics pledge arguably uses a broader definition of lobbying. President Trump's lobbying ban prohibits former appointees from engaging \"in lobbying activities with respect to any covered executive branch official or non-career Senior Executive Service appointee for the remainder of the Administration.\" President Trump's executive order defines lobbying activities using LDA's definition, but provides exemptions for communication or appearances in regard to \"a judicial proceeding; a criminal or civil law enforcement inquiry, investigation, or proceeding; or any agency process for rulemaking, adjudication, or licensing.... \"", "The difference between lobbying contacts and lobbying activities is nuanced. Generally, lobbying contacts require an individual to engage in oral or written communication with a covered official. While there are exemptions to these communications (e.g., communications made by a media organization representative in gathering and disseminating news), in order to be considered a registered lobbyist, contact must occur between an individual being paid to represent others and a covered official. ", "Lobbying activities, on the other hand, include both lobbying contacts and the support of those contacts by people who do not communicate directly with a covered official. Therefore, using lobbying activities to define lobbying is arguably more expansive than using lobbying contacts because individuals who never call or meet with covered officials (but assist federally registered lobbyists in preparing for those communications) would likely fall under President Trump's ethics pledge lobbying ban. Individuals supporting registered lobbyists, but not making contact with covered officials, were not included in President Clinton's or President Obama's ethics pledge.", "The shift between lobbying contact and lobbying activities to define lobbying now potentially includes the activities of a group of individuals often referred to as \"shadow lobbyists.\" A \"shadow lobbyist\" is an individual who engages in some lobbying activities but does not necessarily strictly meet all of the requirements for registration as a lobbyist: makes more than one lobbying contact per quarter, is compensated for making contacts with covered officials, and spends more than 20% of his or her time on lobbying activities.
