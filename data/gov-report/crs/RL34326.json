The challenge is complying with federal law (e.g., the Endangered Species Act (ESA)); minimizing harm to the river and Apalachicola Bay species, ecosystems, and oyster industry; and providing flows for hydropower and thermoelectric cooling, while also providing municipal and industrial water supply security. The Corps' challenge has increased as basin water demands have increased (e.g., water supply to support the growing Atlanta metro area, agriculture's increased reliance on irrigation, and ecosystem and species needs), creating conflicts between water in storage and flows for in-stream purposes. Is the ACF a harbinger of conflicts between ESA implementation and other water uses across the nation? Is the ACF a testing ground for both federal river management and resource allocation during drought in multi-state basins with riparian water laws? Legislation in the 110th Congress related to the ACF and southeast water supply issues includes H.R. 135, H.R. 2650, H.R. 3847, H.R. 5587, and S. 2165.", "ACF drought management may set a precedent for drought responses on other rivers regulated by federal dams. In November 2007, the Corps began managing the ACF under an Exceptional Drought Operations (EDO) amendment to its previous operations plan (which consisted of a 2006 Interim Operations Plan (IOP) amending a draft 1989 comprehensive plan). The EDO lowered the minimum flow required in the Apalachicola River and allowed for greater reservoir refill before resuming normal operations, thus improving upper basin water supply security. Four species protected by the ESA depend on Apalachicola River flows. The EDO's immediate and long-term species impacts continue as subjects of study and debate. The EDO has not caused significant immediate harm to electricity generation or grid reliability. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) approved the EDO through June 1, 2008. On April 15, the Corps submitted to FWS a modification to the IOP; the Corps proposes that the modification be implemented starting June 1 until a new long-term ACF comprehensive plan is adopted. The Corps began revising its comprehensive plan during the 2007-2008 winter.

As runoff in the basin fell below the flows necessary to meet both consumptive demand (i.e., M&I and agricultural uses) and in-stream flow requirements (e.g., for species and thermoelectric power plant cooling purposes), water stored in the reservoirs was released to meet these needs. The lower basin reservoirs were drawn down first. In late summer 2007, Lake Lanier was the only reservoir with significant remaining storage. When the Corps released water from Lake Lanier in the upper basin to provide minimum flows in the Apalachicola River in the lower basin, the lake experienced significant drawdown, surpassing the reservoir's previous record low and triggering urgent concern from lake Lanier water users and recreational interests.", "Lake Lanier water storage is of critical concern because it provides 72% of the water supply for the Atlanta metro area and more than 62% of the storage space in federal ACF reservoirs, but refills slowly.

The water rights doctrines operating in the ACF states makes allocation particularly challenging. Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, like most eastern states, generally follow a riparian water rights doctrine, which permits those whose lands border waters to use them in a way that is reasonable relative to other users. When the water quantities are insufficient to meet all reasonable needs, all users are to reduce their usage proportionally. In contrast, most western states follow a prior appropriation doctrine, which provides a superior right to those who first put the water to use. When quantities are insufficient to meet all needs, those with the superior right receive their allocation first, and others receiving their share in order of priority. Because the ACF states follow the riparian rights doctrine, their relative rights to use the water are not determined by priority during drought. How to resolve water allocation during drought in a riparian context has few precedents, thus contributing to the challenge of the three states in successfully negotiating a water allocation compact. The three states most recently failed at such an effort in 2003 (see Appendix A )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Roles in the ACF", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has authority under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution to manage the nation's water resources, but it recognizes the states' authority to allocate and use water within their jurisdictions.

Although a state generally has broad authority over waters within its border, exercise of its intrastate authority cannot entirely dismiss the interests of other states. In the case of the ACF, although the three states have authority over their waters, federal investments were built and are operated for multiple purposes, thus affecting the states' water use. That is, the basin's federal dams regulate the flows of the Chattahoochee and Apalachicola Rivers, thereby shaping the states' water use. Federal laws also shape dam operations.

The 1989 WCP has not been finalized due to litigation and expectations before 2003 for a negotiated agreement on tri-state water allocation. Under the WCP, the Corps largely operated the reservoirs to meet the multiple uses in the basin while maximizing the quantity of stored water. The WCP established operational zones for the federal reservoir; these operational zones signaled to the Corps how to manage reservoir releases based on changing storage volumes over the course of the year.", "With the failure of the compact negotiations, the Corps had to address the ESA issues in the lower basin without a tri-state water allocation agreement. After years of informal communications and months of formal consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Corps adopted the Interim Operations Plan (IOP) for Woodruff Dam in October 2006. The plan is interim until an updated comprehensive ACF water control plan is adopted. The IOP added new in-stream Apalachicola River flow requirements for protection of threatened and endangered species to the Corps' ACF operational decision criteria. The IOP established minimum flows in the Apalachicola River based on different inflow rates into ACF reservoirs. The IOP, therefore, left in place the operational zones of the 1989 WCP but constrained the Corps' operations by requiring it to meet minimum flow requirements in both normal and dry conditions. Under the IOP, the Corps would make releases from reservoir storage to meet in-stream flow requirements if inflow into the reservoirs was insufficient to support the minimum flows. In sum, the IOP resulted in both the 1989 WCP operational zones and the IOP minimum flows guiding Corps' ACF operations during 2007.", "The IOP is the subject of litigation (see Appendix A ) and of upper basin interests' criticisms of the Corps' reservoir management during 2007. They argue that the Lake Lanier drawdown in 2007 under the IOP created an unnecessary risk of system storage depletion in an effort to provide minimum flows that have not been scientifically justified.

The EDO also largely lifted operational guidelines of the IOP until reservoir storage significantly refilled. The EDO, therefore, reduced the rate of drawdown as dry conditions persisted and allowed reservoirs to refill more quickly as climate conditions improved. One justification provided for the lower minimum flows was to lessen the risk of much lower flows in later months or years, if the drought continues. In effect, the EDO risked some harm to the species now, to reduce the risk of greater harm later. The effects of the lower flows on electricity generation also were raised as a concern and are discussed in detail in Appendix C ; as discussed there, the EDO does not appear to have caused significant immediate harm to electricity generation or grid reliability.", "As stipulated by the BiOp for the EDO, the Corps and FWS subsequently agreed upon triggers for how the Corps was to reduce flows from the previous low of 5,000 cfs (cubic feet per second) in the Apalachicola River, to 4,750 cfs, then 4,500 cfs. The Corps and FWS reportedly will consider triggers for reductions to 4,150 cfs in late spring 2008 when data are available and if the situation warrants. As of mid- to late spring 2008, flows in the Apalachicola River had yet to be reduced below 4,750 cfs due to winter rains.

Criticisms of Georgia's actions are countered by those arguing that the plan and its implementation are evolving and that they have performed well during this initial test. Upper basin stakeholders instead place the blame for the low storage levels and resulting adoption of the lower flows under the EDO on the IOP for allowing the reservoir drawdown.

Increasing pressures on the quality and quantity of available water supplies\u2014due to growing population, environmental regulation, in-stream species and ecosystem needs, water source contamination, agricultural water demand, climate variability, and changing public interests\u2014have resulted in heightened water use conflicts throughout the country. The federal government has a long history of involvement in water resource development and management to facilitate water-borne transportation, expand irrigated agriculture, reduce flood losses, and more recently restore aquatic ecosystems. Congress makes decisions that define the federal role in planning, constructing, maintaining, inspecting, and financing water resource projects. These decisions occur within the context of multiple and often conflicting objectives, competing legal decisions, and long-established institutional mechanisms (e.g., century-old water rights, contractual obligations, etc.).", "The ACF is a prime example of the complexity of the river management issues in which the Corps and other federal water management and resource agencies are embroiled along with state and local governments and the general public. How the nation uses and values its rivers has changed over time. Rivers are now seen as not only providing economic benefits but also recreational opportunities and ecosystem services, such as species habitat, which also have economic dimensions. These changes have manifested themselves in law (e.g., ESA) and implementation of water resources statutes. This shift has caused a reexamination by the courts, agencies, and stakeholders of the distribution of economic and other benefits of river management alternatives. The debate over ACF management raises some fundamental questions about water resources management in the nation, such as whether some river uses should take priority over others (e.g., threatened and endangered species protection over inland waterway transportation), how to evaluate alternatives (e.g., balancing multiple uses, maximizing economic benefits, reducing short-term or long-term risk), and how to manage extreme conditions and changing water availability and use. Actions by federal agencies remain controversial on the Middle Rio Grande, San Joaquin, Colorado, Klamath, Columbia, Snake, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers. Like the ACF, federal actions and facility operations on these rivers frequently are challenged in the courts and by state and local interests.", "Appendix A.

The suit alleged that the Corps exceeded its authority under the Water Supply Act of 1958 by reallocating storage in the ACF reservoirs. Under the Water Supply Act, a modification to reservoir projects \"which would seriously affect the purposes for which the project was authorized ... or which would involve major structural or operational changes shall be made only upon the approval of Congress.\" The authorized purposes of Lake Lanier are disputed among the parties and have become a recurring issue in each of the lawsuits filed.

Georgia has maintained that municipal and industrial use was also authorized.", "The parties suspended the proceeding in 1992 to negotiate a settlement. Settlement negotiations ultimately resulted in an interstate compact (the ACF Compact) which was approved by Congress in 1997 ( P.L. 105-104 ). Through the ACF Compact, the parties intended \"to develop an allocation formula for equitably apportioning the surface waters of the ACF Basin among the states while protecting the water quality, ecology and biodiversity of the ACF.\" In other words, the Compact provided an agreement to agree on allocations at some future date. Although the states negotiated for years, they never reached an agreement and, after many extensions of the 1998 date on which the ACF Compact was to terminate, the Compact expired on August 31, 2003.

The D.C. case involved a dispute brought by Southeastern Federal Power Customers (SeFPC), a non-profit corporate consortium of rural electric cooperatives and municipal electric systems. SeFPC alleged that the Corps contracts that provided for increased withdrawals from Lake Lanier exceeded the Corps' authority under the Water Supply Act of 1958. The increased withdrawals, they argued, consequently diminished the flow-through by which hydropower is generated. SeFPC claimed that its members were paying for Buford Dam hydropower at prices disproportionate to their residual share of water stored in Lake Lanier devoted to power generation.", "The proceedings of the Alabama and D.C. cases are interrelated. In the Alabama case, Alabama and Florida sued to prevent withdrawals of water from Lake Lanier made to the detriment of downstream users. While the action was suspended pending negotiations, the D.C. case was filed. In January 2003, the parties in the D.C. case, including Georgia and the Corps, reached a settlement agreement and requested the court's approval. Because the parties to the D.C. case attempted to implement a settlement agreement that would affect the use of the water at issue in the Alabama case, Alabama and Florida revived the Alabama case to challenge the settlement agreement. Alabama and Florida also intervened in the D.C. case to oppose the approval of the agreement as a violation of the suspension of proceedings in the Alabama case. In October 2003, the federal district court in the Alabama case granted Alabama and Florida's motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Corps and Georgia from implementing the agreement in the D.C. case. In 2004, the district court in the D.C. case approved the settlement agreement, but required that the injunction entered in the Alabama case be dissolved before the agreement could be implemented. In 2005, the 11 th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Alabama district court's injunction order, finding that Alabama and Florida did not establish an imminent threat of irreparable harm or a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the case.", "In February 2008, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's approval of the settlement agreement reached by the parties in the D.C. case. The settlement agreement, entered by Georgia and the Corps, provided for two 10-year contracts that allocated water to Georgia for municipal use. The court's opinion addressed only one of the statutory issues raised by the appeal\u2014the Water Supply Act. The court held that \"the Agreement's reallocation of Lake Lanier's storage space constitutes a major operational change on its face\" and therefore, under the Water Supply Act, required prior congressional approval. Because Congress did not authorize the change, the court ruled that the agreement could not be enforced. Florida and Alabama also claimed that the agreement violated the Flood Control Act and NEPA, but the court did not reach those issues.", "The Georgia I Case. In 2000, the Governor of Georgia made a written water supply request asking the Corps to commit to making increased releases of water from the Buford Dam until the year 2030 in order to assure a reliable municipal and industrial water supply to the Atlanta region. In 2001, after nine months without a reply to the request, Georgia sued the Corps to increase its water supply. While the Alabama and DC cases were being litigated, Florida and SeFPC filed motions to intervene in the Georgia I case, but the motions were denied by the district court. After this denial, the Corps denied Georgia's request, claiming that it lacked the \"legal authority to grant Georgia's request without additional legislative authority, because the request would involve substantial effects on project purposes and major operational changes.\"", "On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the 11 th Circuit overturned the district court's decision. The court permitted Florida and SeFPC to intervene and returned the case to the district court for further adjudication. The district court, noting the similarity of the parties and the subject matter, found the case to be parallel to the Alabama case. The court suspended the proceedings in the Georgia I case pending resolution of the Alabama case. (See discussion below on \" Consolidation of Cases .\")", "The Georgia II Case. In 2006, the Corps issued an interim operations plan (IOP) for Woodruff Dam for the purpose of protecting federally protected species in the Apalachicola River. (See discussion on p. 6.) Georgia sued the Corps to challenge the IOP, claiming that it constituted a change from the only approved water control plan (which was adopted in the late 1950s). Georgia argued that, by releasing more water from reservoir storage to meet the in-stream requirements for the Apalachicola River in the IOP, the Corps was jeopardizing the state's future water supply. The releases allegedly did not account for dry weather conditions and did not reserve enough water to supplement the dry summer conditions in northern Georgia. The suit also alleged that water supply was a contemplated purpose of the Corps' water project. (See discussion below on \" Consolidation of Cases .\")", "The Florida Case. In 2006, FWS issued a biological opinion (BiOp) regarding the impact of the IOP for Woodruff Dam on protected species downstream (see discussion on p. 6). Florida filed a lawsuit to review the BiOp, which was issued pursuant to the ESA. The BiOp concluded that the Corps' operations under the IOP were not likely to jeopardize the species or their habitat. Florida sought review, claiming that operations had already caused significant damage. The BiOp, according to Florida, violated rational decision-making standards. Florida also alleged that the municipal and industrial uses for which Georgia sought water were not authorized purposes.

Columbus asserted that the Corps failed to adopt a formally finalized water control plan for the ACF basin and that the Corps' current operation under the IOP violated its legal authority. The Corps was operating under a third revision of the IOP, each changing the flow levels in the rivers, at the time Columbus filed the lawsuit. Columbus claimed that the lack of reliable flow from the Chattahoochee River impaired its ability to discharge water that it used to provide services to the city in compliance with regulatory requirements. The city alleged that the IOP improperly revised the water control plan because it was published in final form without public comment and was put into effect for an indefinite period of time. According to Columbus, the IOP resulted in over-releases of water from the ACF reservoirs to the city's detriment.", "The City of Apalachicola Case. In 2008, the City of Apalachicola, Florida, sued the Corps, challenging its management and operation of the ACF facilities. The lawsuit arose from the city's interest in maintaining the Apalachicola Bay ecosystem, which the city claims as a basis for its economy and livelihood. Apalachicola alleged that the Corps did not complete an adequate NEPA review when it issued the original IOP, the modified IOP, or the Exceptional Drought Operations modification (EDO) to the modified IOP. The city also claimed that the Corps did not comply with environmental assessments required under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). Apalachicola also alleged that various contracts entered by the Corps, which provide for withdrawals for purposes other than those authorized by law, and the Corps' application of the draft water control plan violate the Water Supply Act, Flood Control Act, and NEPA.", "Consolidation of Cases .

That decision may affect the future path of litigation in the other cases.", "Although the court determined that the settlement agreement was unenforceable, the litigation of the D.C. case may continue at different levels. One or more of the parties may try to appeal the circuit court's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court accepts the case for review, it may or may not uphold the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of the issue. The D.C. Circuit's decision addressed only one of the statutory challenges raised before the court. As a result, the case may also be remanded to the original court (the D.C. district court) for further review of other issues raised but not resolved in the higher courts.", "If the case is remanded to the district court, it may be consolidated with the other cases. The D.C. case was omitted from the original consolidation because it was the only case not on the trial level. If it is remanded to the district court for further consideration, it would again be on the same level of review as the other cases and potentially be appropriate for consolidation.", "Generally, the consolidated cases, being litigated in a different jurisdiction (a district court within the 11 th Circuit), are not controlled by decisions in the D.C. Circuit. That is, the 11 th Circuit, or district courts within its jurisdiction (including Alabama, Florida and Georgia), may choose to interpret the issue of required congressional authorization differently than the D.C. Circuit did. However, other courts may be bound by the D.C. Circuit's decision under a legal principle known as collateral estoppel. The principle of collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, prevents parties from raising issues that have already been resolved in previous legal proceedings in later cases under certain circumstances. In order to raise the issue of collateral estoppel and prevent the consolidated cases from further litigating the issue decided by the D.C.

This EA-FONSI means the Corps determined that any adverse environmental effects were not so significant that an environmental impact statement (EIS) was required. Under NEPA, an agency is required to take a hard look at the environmental consequences of its action. The U.S. Supreme Court has said NEPA \"merely prohibits uninformed\u2014rather than unwise\u2014agency action.\" The original case (see Alabama Case in Appendix A ) raises a NEPA complaint.", "Legal challenges to EAs are based on the following: timing, contents, and conclusions. The timing factor is whether the document informed the agency decision, rather than providing an after-the-fact rationalization of the agency action. Challenges based on the contents of a document argue that the document does not show the agency took a hard look at the relevant environmental effects. The conclusion that no EIS was required can also be a basis for a legal challenge.", "Timing and Content", "NEPA requires federal agencies to comply \"to the fullest extent possible.\" However, NEPA does not require any particular results, such as choosing the least harmful project.

NEPA regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) address the timing of an environmental review. The regulations all require the environmental review before the agency decision, indeed, as early as practical. A section discussing timing of environmental reviews says:", "An agency shall commence preparation of an environmental impact statement as close as possible to the time the agency is developing or is presented with a proposal (Sec. 1508.23) so that preparation can be completed in time for the final statement to be included in any recommendation or report on the proposal. The statement shall be prepared early enough so that it can serve practically as an important contribution to the decisionmaking process and will not be used to rationalize or justify decisions already made.", "Although this section refers specifically to an environmental impact statement (EIS), the rationale of not using an environmental document to justify decisions already made applies to environmental assessments as well. After all, EAs are intended to be performed to see whether an EIS must be prepared. Therefore, since they precede an EIS (if an EIS is deemed necessary), they must also precede the agency decision on a course of action. A specific regulatory reference to EAs further supports that the document is intended to contribute to the discussion of choosing an action: \"Agencies may prepare an environmental assessment on any action at any time in order to assist agency planning and decisionmaking.\"", "Another section discusses the benefits of starting the environmental review at the earliest possible time: \"Agencies shall integrate the NEPA process with other planning at the earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, and to avoid delays later in the process, and to head off potential conflicts.\"", "Early in NEPA practice, the courts established that a NEPA review should occur before an agency action was decided upon: \"That the filing of an EIS should precede rather than follow federal agency action has been consistently recognized by the courts.\" The Fifth Circuit described the harm in reversing the order:", "Whenever an agency decision to act precedes issuance of its impact statement, the danger arises that consideration of environmental factors will be pro forma and that the statement will represent a post hoc rationalization of that decision. NEPA was intended to incorporate environmental factors and variables into the decisional calculus at each stage of the process.", "The courts agree that a NEPA review is intended to inform the decision-making process. The Ninth Circuit addressed the timing of the environmental review in relationship to the agency decision. It said the purpose of the review is to provide \"decisionmakers with an environmental disclosure sufficiently detailed to aid in the substantive decision whether to proceed with the project in light of the environmental consequences.\" A reviewing court is likely to find that an agency failed to take a hard look at the environmental consequences of its action when the decision on what action to take predates the consideration of the environmental effects.", "The contents of a NEPA document may also influence a court as to whether an agency took a hard look at the environmental effects of the proposed action. The regulations provide a general description of the contents. EAs are intended to be concise, but are also required to consider the need for the project, the environmental impacts of the project and its alternatives, alternatives required by section 102(2)(E), and a list of the agencies and persons consulted. In the context of an action that could affect species listed under the ESA, the NEPA review and the biological assessment (BA) under the ESA can be synchronized. The statutory provision for a BA contemplates that it will be used in conjunction with the NEPA process, and in fact can be considered part of a NEPA review, although it does not mandate that the two go together.", "Another issue related to the contents of an EA is whether the document indicates that an EIS is needed or that there is no significant impact. Reasonable people can disagree as to what conclusion the data in an EA justify. Deference is given to the agency's determination by courts, however. That judicial deference can be reduced under certain circumstances, including when a court finds the agency has pre-judged the environmental impacts. The environmental document must adequately support the conclusions within it in order for a court to uphold it. Also, the record must show how the agency reached its determination: \"mere perfunctory or conclusory language will not be deemed to constitute an adequate record and cannot serve to support the agency's decision not to prepare an EIS.\"", "If an EA with a finding of no significant impact is found to be inadequate, most courts will remand the action to the agency, where another EA could be prepared by the agency. In certain rare cases, courts have directed agencies to prepare an EIS, without leaving the matter to the agency's discretion.", "The Right to Sue Under NEPA", "NEPA suits are brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Therefore, courts review whether an agency's action was arbitrary or capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law. Parties have to show standing. That limits plaintiffs to those who could show they were adversely affected or aggrieved by the agency action and that NEPA intended to protect against that actual or threatened injury. For example, an economic injury by itself is not the type of harm NEPA protects against and could not be the basis for a lawsuit. However, the reduced use of the river by a recreational kayaker could be the basis for standing. Plaintiffs could include individuals and groups, provided they were able to show they suffered an injury in fact that was different from the injury suffered by the community at large.", "Appendix C. ACF Electric Power Generation Issues", "ACF Power generation includes hydroelectric facilities operated by the Corps, Georgia Power, and private entities as well as coal-fired, gas-fired, and nuclear plants operated by Southern Company and its subsidiaries, Southern Nuclear and Gulf Power.", "Hydroelectric Generation", "Historically, hydropower at dams on the ACF provides power primarily during peak demand. An issue is the effect of decreased river flows on turbine operations, specifically whether lower reservoir levels would drop below the turbine's water intake. Currently, water levels are sufficient to generate peaking power for the region. According to the Corps, the two main units at Buford Dam can generate as long as water levels do not fall below 1035 feet. Even before the reduced flows under the EDO, the two main units at Buford were projected to be operational at least until summer 2008.", "The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) markets the power generated at Corps-operated dams to its customers in the Southeast. SEPA enters into five-year contracts with its preference customers (cooperatives and municipal power systems) with power delivery obligations based on 1981 drought levels. SEPA is obligated to meet its contract requirements whether or not sufficient hydroelectric power is available to meet its obligations. In the event of a hydropower shortfall, SEPA purchases power on the open market, generally at a cost greater than hydroelectric generation. The additional cost is passed on to SEPA's customers. SEPA does not own transmission lines and must contract with other utilities for use of the transmission system.", "Nuclear Generation", "Plant Farley, located in southeastern Alabama near the town of Dothan, is a 1,711 megawatt (MW) nuclear plant; water is used in the cooling system. (See Figure 1 ) According to the SERC Reliability Corporation, in addition to being a large source of electricity, generation from Farley is also important for maintaining the stability of the local power system.", "Plant Farley requires a minimum water flow of 2,000 cfs to operate at full load under its current water permit. At lower flow, water discharges from the plant may have thermal or other impacts on the Chattahoochee River that could trigger regulatory action. Under the lowest flows in the EDO, the flow at Farley may drop to roughly 2,300 cfs, still above the plant's full load requirement.", "Because of the plant's design, it appears unlikely that all of the generation from Farley could be lost due to low water conditions, at least in the foreseeable future. Farley is a two-unit plant. On September 28, 2007, Unit 1 went off-line for refueling, and through October and early November, water flows often dipped far below 2,000 cfs (e.g., to a flow of 1,048 cfs on November 3, 2007). This indicates that the plant can operate with one unit at full load with much less water than required for two unit operation. However, according to Southern Company, during the period October to May, when other generation and transmission assets are taken off-line for maintenance, both Farley units are necessary for reliable operation of the local power system.", "According to the SERC Reliability Corp., alternative, albeit more expensive, natural gas-fired generation could be used to compensate for reduced generation from Farley during off-peak seasons. However, these alternatives may be otherwise committed during summer peaks and very cold winter periods, in which case reliability risks would be greater if Farley generation is unavailable or reduced.", "Coal-Fired and Natural Gas-Fired Generation", "Coal-fired power plants, older (steam electric) gas-fired plants, and modern combined cycle gas plants are dependent on water for steam processing, and primarily cooling. Older power plants, those whose construction began prior to 1972, use a once-through system where the water is discharged back into the water source. Newer power plants do not discharge water, but use cooling towers to evaporate the water. In low water years, once-through plants may encounter issues with thermal discharge. The discharge from the power plant is typically warmer than the water source, and increases in the surrounding water temperature could affect the ability of fish and other aquatic species to survive. This effect is more pronounced with low stream flows. For both older and newer plants, water intakes for the plant must be below water level.", "Although several large coal and gas-fired plants are located along the ACF rivers, only the coal-fired Plant Scholz in the Florida Panhandle has been mentioned as potentially being affected by low flow in the Apalachicola River. (See Figure 1 ) This plant is considered a base load plant which generates power throughout the day. Although Scholz is small (capacity of 92 MW), the plant is a low-cost source of generation and is used in some situations to maintain the reliability of the local power system. Specifically, Scholz is needed during high-demand periods to help prevent overloading power lines under some circumstances, and during low demand periods to maintain voltage levels.", "According to Southern Company affiliate Gulf Power, the plant's owner, the plant can operate with flows at 5,000 cfs. With the EDO flows, the plant should be able to continue operating without modifications for three months. The plant does not expect any issues with thermal discharge with the lower flows. Plant operators plan to make some modifications in its intake system to be able to continue operating into the summer of 2008.", "If Scholz needs to shut down, there do not appear to be any transmission constraints in the area that would prevent power from being delivered from other generating plants. However, the cost of purchased power or generation from other Southern Company assets may be more expensive than generation from Scholz and Farley. Also, the reduction in reserve margins from taking Plant Scholz and other generating plants off line could create reliability concerns, especially during the peak summer season."], "subsections": []}]}}
