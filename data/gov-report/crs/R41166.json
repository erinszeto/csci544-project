There is a notable difference among plans by firm size. For large employer (100 or more employees) plans, nearly half (45%) would lose grandfathered status by 2013, based on these estimates. For small employer (3-99 employees) plans, about two-thirds (66%) would do so.

", "For the individual health insurance market, the Departments relied on existing studies that estimated 40%-67% of individual policies are in effect for less than a year. Applying these same turnover rates under grandfathering rules, and assuming that some policies maintained for a longer period of time would eventually also lose grandfathered status, the Departments estimated that the proportion of individual health plans losing grandfathered status would exceed the 40%-67% range in a given year.

In contrast, consumers generally supported the rules, but in some instances argued for restricting even further the changes that a grandfathered plan could make. State regulators expressed views and made recommendations that spanned the different perspectives. Notably, across the comments, the assumption was that maintaining grandfathered status is desirable, so the commenter either wanted to be able to make more changes and still be grandfathered, or use the loss of grandfathered status to discourage changes.", "Plans and employers recommended that changes to prescription drug formularies and provider networks be allowed, in order for coverage to adopt innovation, promote high-quality care, and keep current with a dynamic health care marketplace. Consumers, however, supported the loss of grandfathered status with changes in formularies and networks that negatively affected access to care. Regulators expressed views on both sides of this issue. For example, one state regulator said that a significant change in the provider network should lead to loss of grandfathered status, while another stated that allowance should be given to a dynamic market where providers enter and exit regularly.", "Plans and employers recommended more flexibility with changes to cost-sharing that would be allowed. Some suggested that medical inflation was not an appropriate measure, and suggested a standard based on actuarial value. Plans and employers also argued for greater flexibility in general, whether it was plan options, funding of coverage, issuer of coverage, employer contributions, or other features. Consumers supported the grandfathering rules with respect to cost-sharing and plan structure. In specific instances, consumers identified other cost-sharing changes (e.g., visit limits) that should lead to loss of grandfathering status, as well as recommended further clarification of the cost-sharing rules. In keeping with this perspective, consumers generally supported the regulations regarding changes to issuer, employer contributions, and overall plan design. State regulators, again, expressed different views on these issues; for instance, one state recommended more flexibility in the cost-sharing rules, while another state recommended that prescription drug copayments be added to the rules.", "The same range of concerns and recommendations applied to the requirement to provide enrollees with health plan information, including whether their plan has been grandfathered. Health plans and employers uniformly argued that the notice be issued less frequently and the information streamlined, to minimize the burden and cost.

Therefore, if the retiree coverage is offered through the same plan offered to current employees, then those plans, by default, must comply with the same provisions.

", "Retiree-only plans may not have to comply with ACA's insurance provisions:", "The authority to regulate employer-provided health benefits, including retiree health benefits, rests with the federal government. ACA's insurance reforms are examples of the federal regulation of employer-provided health benefits. However, states are the primary enforcers of health insurance requirements, even post-ACA. Therefore, the states have the authority to enforce ACA's insurance reforms on retiree health plans offered through state-licensed insurance companies. (Note: self-insured plans are not offered through state-licensed insurers, so they generally are not subject to state law or regulations. Self-insured plans are subject to federal standards. ) Each state will decide whether it will actively enforce the ACA insurance reforms on retiree plans. For states that do not adequately enforce applicable health insurance requirements, the enforcement responsibility typically falls back to the federal government. However, HHS has stated that it will not enforce ACA insurance reforms with respect to retiree-only coverage. This statement was made in the preamble to the interim final rules regarding grandfathered plans. In other words, at this time, there is no federal role in enforcing the ACA insurance reforms on retiree-only plans. However, given the Administration's aforementioned authority to promulgate regulations and issue administrative guidance relating to federal health insurance standards, it is possible that the Administration may reconsider its position on enforcement. ", "The federal exemption for retiree-only health plans is not a new exemption. Retiree-only health plans have been exempt from federal health insurance requirements since enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
