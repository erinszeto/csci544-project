In May 2017, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) formally notified Congress of the Administration's intent to renegotiate NAFTA.

As a share of U.S. agricultural trade, Canada and Mexico rank second and third (after China) as leading U.S. export markets. Leading NAFTA-traded agricultural products were meat and dairy products; grains; fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables; oilseeds; and sweeteners.

As part of its 2015 retrospective analysis of the impacts of NAFTA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) concluded in a 2015 report that \"NAFTA has had a profound effect on many aspects of North American agriculture over the past two decades,\" contributing to increased market integration and cross-border investment and resulting in \"important changes in consumption and production.\"", "Although NAFTA resulted in tariff elimination for most agricultural products and redefined import quotas for some commodities as tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), some products\u2014such as U.S. exports to Canada of dairy and poultry products\u2014are still subject to high above-quota tariffs. In addition to tariffs and quotas, NAFTA addressed sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and other types of non-tariff barriers that may limit agricultural trade. SPS regulations are often regarded by agricultural exporters as one of the greatest challenges in trade, often resulting in increased costs and product loss and disrupting integrated supply chains.", "The extent to which the terms of agricultural trade may be altered in a NAFTA renegotiation is unclear; however, what is clear is that U.S. agriculture has a large stake in NAFTA.

Accordingly, within-quota trade occurs at the duty-free tariff treatment agreed to in CUSTA, but the over-quota trade occurs at the WTO bound tariff equivalent of the old quota, which is not liberalized. Under CUSTA, Canada excluded dairy, poultry, and eggs for tariff elimination. In return, the United States excluded dairy, sugar, cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and peanut butter. Because Canada was able to exclude dairy products, poultry, and poultry products (including eggs) from tariff elimination in NAFTA, Canada is able to maintain a supply management system for these sectors by limiting imports through restrictive TRQs.

Additionally, trade with Canada and Mexico comprise an ever-larger share of U.S. agricultural markets. Many attribute generally lower U.S. consumer prices and improved consumer choices and variety (e.g., imports of off-season produce and greater variety of food products) to NAFTA's elimination of tariffs and quota restrictions under the agreement. Others note that as Mexico's consumer incomes improve, U.S. agricultural exporters could benefit from increased market demand for some food products.", "Some claim that NAFTA has resulted in both benefits and losses, and that positive and negative impacts attributed to the agreement have been overstated or mixed. Economic impacts under NAFTA depend on what is produced and where it is produced. This is also true regarding the agreement's effects on employment and wages, as some workers and industries have faced disruptions due to loss of market share from increased competition, while others have gained from the new market opportunities that were created. Yet others claim that NAFTA has further contributed to consolidation in North America's agriculture, resulting in fewer small farms, particularly in Mexico.

Other factors have influenced regional agricultural trade, including changes in Mexico's agricultural policies and workforce, advances in technology (e.g., e-commerce, greenhouse production), disruption due to the peso devaluation in the 1990s and the economic downturns in 2001 and 2009, and competing buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities in countries outside of NAFTA. Other market developments that may have influenced North American trade since NAFTA's implementation include alternative product uses (e.g., corn used in ethanol production and corn byproducts, such as dried distiller grains) and other market substitution effects, changes in crop mix, mechanization, increases in labor efficiencies, and growing integration of the global economy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improved Market Integration", "paragraphs": ["As part of its 20-year retrospective analysis of the impacts of NAFTA on the U.S. agricultural sectors, USDA concluded that \"NAFTA has had a profound effect on many aspects of North American agriculture over the past two decades,\" contributing to increased market integration and cross-border investment and other \"important changes in consumption and production.\" USDA's assessment is based on cross-border economic activity (primarily agricultural trade and intraregional foreign direct investment [FDI] ) as well as tariffs, quotas, and other barriers to trade and investment.

In reality, fruit and vegetable production places demands on capital, technology, management, research, marketing, and infrastructure. Mexico's principal advantage is seasonal (climatic advantage) rather than a cost advantage. Mexican farm labor is generally less well-trained and less efficient, offsetting some of its wage rate advantage. Some Mexican growing areas also experience labor shortages. In addition, Mexican growers often provide social services for workers, such as housing and schools, which raises production costs. Most Mexican producers who grow for export markets must also meet necessary product quality and safety standards and be third-party certified. Mexico also has a disadvantage in marketing and in the buyers' perception of its products, as well as in research and development (R&D) and infrastructure, compared to the United States.", "These same UC researchers further highlight some the competitive advantages of agricultural production in United States compared to Mexico.

Some claim that Mexico has been impacted by transitory poverty created by economic adjustments and also social exclusion to the benefits of globalization. Although Mexico's farm exports rose sharply, rural poverty levels in Mexico remain the same as before the agreement, and the expected wage and income convergence between Mexico and the United States did not happen. Some have called for reform of NAFTA to address these and other perceived concerns in Mexico's farming community. Others dispute the role of trade in Mexico's rural poverty.
