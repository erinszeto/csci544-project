The Senate may, however, use provisions of Senate Rule XIV to bypass referral of a bill or joint resolution to a Senate committee, and have the measure placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business.", "Although placing a bill or joint resolution directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full Senate will ever consider it, the measure is available for floor consideration and certain procedural steps or requirements may be obviated. Such procedural steps include committee reporting or discharging a committee from a bill's consideration, and such procedural requirements include the two-day availability of a committee report.", "Senate rules contain procedures for processing concurrent and simple resolutions, treaties, and nominations, which are not covered in this report.

Amendments are also not covered in this report.", "This report will not be updated again in the 115th Congress unless Senate procedures change.", "For a fuller examination of the Senate's use of the Rule XIV procedure and other procedures and actions to bypass committees, and also both to bypass committees and pass legislation, see CRS Report RS22299, Bypassing Senate Committees: Rule XIV and Unanimous Consent, by Michael L.

When the House informs the Senate that it has passed a bill or joint resolution that was introduced in the House, and the Senate receives the measure, the measure is also usually referred to a Senate committee. (Senate rules contain procedures for processing concurrent and simple resolutions (Rule XIV, paragraph 6), treaties (Rule XXX), and nominations (Rule XXXI), which are not covered in this report.) ", "Senate Rule XIV, paragraph 2 requires that bills and resolutions have three readings before passage, and that they be read twice before being referred to committee. (The \"third reading\" occurs before a vote on final passage.) Although a Senator may demand (under paragraph 2) that the readings occur on three different legislative days, bills and joint resolutions may be read twice on the same day \"for reference\" (referral) if there is no objection (under paragraph 3). Most bills and resolutions are read twice and referred to committee on the same day that they are introduced by a Senator or received from the House.", "The Senate may, however, use provisions of Senate Rule XIV to bypass referral of a bill or joint resolution to a Senate committee in order to have the measure placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business. The calendar's General Orders section lists measures eligible for Senate floor consideration.", "Broadly, the two purposes of preventing the referral of a bill or joint resolution to a committee and placing it directly on the calendar are (1) to facilitate the full Senate's opportunity to consider the measure; or (2) to bypass a committee's potential inaction or, to the measure's sponsor, potential hostile action. Although placing a bill or joint resolution directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full Senate will ever consider it, the measure is available for floor consideration and certain procedural steps, such as committee reporting or discharging a committee from a bill's consideration, and procedural requirements, such as the two-day availability of a committee report, may be obviated.", "In this report, the terms bill ( s ) or measure ( s ) refer to bills and joint resolutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedure to Place a Measure Directly on the Calendar", "paragraphs": ["Senate Rule XIV, paragraph 4, states: \"... every bill and joint resolution introduced on leave, and every bill and joint resolution of the House of Representatives which shall have received a first and second reading without being referred to a committee, shall, if objection be made to further proceeding thereon, be placed on the Calendar .\" ( Emphasis added .)", "Therefore, through objection, a bill or joint resolution after two readings is prevented from being referred to committee and is placed directly on the calendar. It is usually the majority leader (or another Senator in his stead), acting on his own or at the request of any other Senator, who objects to \"further proceeding\"\u2014committee referral\u2014on a measure.", "For example, this procedure was used to place S. 1035 directly on the calendar.
