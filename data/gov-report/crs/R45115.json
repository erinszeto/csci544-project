The HEA was last comprehensively reauthorized by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HEOA; P.L. 110-315 ). The HEOA extended the authorization of the appropriation of funds for most HEA programs through FY2014, while the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) provided an extension of that authority for an additional year, through FY2015.

It also contains two programs that authorize the awarding of funds to states, which may, among other activities, use the funds to award student financial aid to state residents. ", "Although each of the authorized federal student aid programs has its own student eligibility criteria, award rules, and administrative structures, there are five primary ways in which they may be characterized: general form of aid (grant, loan, work-study, or service payback assistance); broadly available or targeted aid (aid that is widely available to support qualified students pursuing a broad array of educational programs versus aid targeted toward certain fields of study or types of service), aid available by level of study; need-based/non-need-based aid; and portable/non-portable aid. ", "General type of aid : A grant is gift aid that does not need to be repaid by the recipient. A loan is student aid that must be repaid by the recipient at some later point in time. Work-study assistance is student aid provided to a student as compensation for part-time employment while enrolled. Service payback assistance is aid that is provided contingent on the recipient completing a service obligation in return for the assistance provided. Broadly available versus targeted aid : Student aid may be made available on a broad basis to support the pursuits of qualified students in a wide array of eligible postsecondary programs of study. Aid may also be made available on a targeted basis, serving populations of students pursuing programs in certain specified fields of study or to those connected to certain types of service. Level of s tudy : Student aid may be made available to individuals based on whether they are enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate/professional course of study. Need-based/Non- need-based aid: Need-based student aid is aid for which a student's eligibility is based on his or her demonstrated need for the funds. Nonneed-based aid is aid for which a student's eligibility is determined without regard to his or her financial need. Portable/Non-portable aid: Portable aid may be characterized as being widely available across Title IV-participating IHEs, and as being awarded to eligible students on the basis of statutorily specified, nondiscretionary award criteria. Non-portable aid may be characterized as being less widely available, such as from fewer participating IHEs, and as being awarded to eligible students according to discretionary award criteria that may be institution-specific.", "In academic year (AY) 2017-2018, federal student aid is being made available to students only through a subset of the total number of programs authorized under Title IV. Those operational programs comprise aid available by level of study, both need-based and non-need-based aid, and both portable and non-portable aid. They include the following:", "Three grant programs: the Federal Pell Grant program, the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program, and the Scholarships for Veteran's Dependents program (also known as the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants). Aid under each program is only available to undergraduate students. The Pell Grant and FSEOG programs are need-based aid programs. The Pell Grant and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants are portable aid. Two loan programs: the William D. Ford Direct Loan program and the Federal Perkins Loan program. Direct Loans are available to help finance the cost of both undergraduate and graduate/professional study; however, loan terms and conditions may vary depending on the level of study. Federal Perkins Loans are only available to undergraduate students. The Direct Loan program offers one need-based loan (i.e., the Direct Subsidized Loan) among a mix of other non-need-based loans, while the Federal Perkins Loan program is need-based. Direct Loans are portable aid. One work-study assistance program : the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, which is need-based, non-portable aid that is available to both undergraduate and graduate/professional students. One s ervice payback program: the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program, which is non-need-based, portable aid that is available to both undergraduate and graduate students.", "Collectively, these programs made approximately $123 billion available in the most recently completed academic year, AY2016-2017. All told, Title IV aid comprises roughly 49% of all student aid provided to students and their families nationwide. All but two of the operational programs provide broadly available aid. The two providing targeted aid, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants and TEACH Grants, collectively provide $86 million in aid, a relatively small share of federal student aid.", "H.R. 4508 would redesign the current federal approach to student aid programs by transitioning toward the provision of aid through a smaller number of programs. To do so, the bill would eliminate those student aid programs that are not currently operational, immediately eliminate or phase-out some others that are currently funded and operational (e.g., TEACH Grants, FSEOG, Direct Loans), continue to wind down the Perkins Loan program (current statute specifies new Perkins Loans may not be made after September 30, 2017), and create a new federal student loan program, the Federal ONE Loan program. As proposed in H.R. 4508 , for students who would be new recipients of federal student aid on or after July 1, 2019, the mix of available federal student aid programs would consist of the following:", "Two grant programs : Pell Grants and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants. Pell Grants would be need-based aid, and both programs would be portable. One loan program : Federal ONE Loans, which would be non-need-based, portable aid. Aid administrators would be authorized to exercise discretion in specifying, within some limits, the amount eligible students may borrow. One work-study assistance program : FWS, which would be need-based, non-portable aid.

H.R. 4508 would make changes to the procedures for determining students' eligibility for federal student aid and determining the amount of aid that students would be able to receive. Recently implemented provisions for calculating a student's EFC on the basis of income from the second year prior to enrollment would be incorporated into statute. Students from families with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $100,000 also would be eligible to have their EFC determined according to a Simplified Needs Test (SNT) that does not require the reporting of information on assets. ", "Under the amendments proposed in H.R. 4508 , the availability of need-based aid would be limited to undergraduate students and made available through the Pell Grant and FWS programs. All other forms of federal student aid would be made available without regard to a student's financial need. In the Federal Pell Grant program, a new Pell Grant bonus would be made available to students who enroll for at least 30 credit hours per award year. In the Federal Work-Study program, federal funding would be distributed to participating IHEs according to a revised allocation formula, and the generally applicable cap on the federal share of compensation for work-study employment would be reduced from 75% to 50%.", "In the proposed Federal ONE Loan program (in contrast to the Direct Loan program, which it would replace), all loans would be made without borrowers being charged loan origination fees, while interest subsidies would not be offered during periods while borrowers are in school, during a grace period, or during periods of deferment. For undergraduate students, annual borrowing limits would be set at $2,000 above what may currently be borrowed through the Direct Loan program. For graduate students and the parents of undergraduate dependent students, borrowing would be constrained by the establishment of specified annual and aggregate loan limits. A small set of repayment plans would be offered in the Federal ONE Loan program, and loans would be eligible to be discharged in only a limited set of circumstances. ", "The HEA also contains numerous provisions relating to when Title IV aid recipients are eligible to receive disbursements of their federal student aid and the timing of such disbursements. To borrow a Direct Loan, the HEA requires that a borrower sign a master promissory note (MPN), which contains the loan's terms and conditions. An individual may borrow multiple loans under a single MPN for up to 10 years without being required to acknowledge having reviewed the loan terms and conditions prior to borrowing a new loan under that MPN. The HEA also requires that certain Direct Loan borrowers undergo loan entrance counseling prior to loan disbursement, and that certain borrowers undergo exit counseling after a student drops below half-time enrollment. Both of these requirements are intended to help ensure that borrowers are aware of their loan terms and conditions and of the potential consequences of borrowing a student loan. The HEA also specifies the timing for Title IV aid disbursement from IHEs to students and the rate at which students are deemed to have \"earned\" Title IV aid. As a consequence of being deemed to have earned aid, students may be held responsible for repaying a portion of it to ED should they withdraw from school before completing their term of enrollment.", "H.R. 4508 would make several changes to the provisions relating to when Title IV aid recipients are eligible to receive disbursements of their federal student aid and the timing of such disbursements. Many of these changes represent a more scaled-back approach to aid disbursement to recipients, potentially helping to ensure that recipients are better able to manage their aid and fully understand the responsibilities that come along with aid receipt. For instance, under the bill, borrowers would continue to be permitted to borrow multiple loans under a single MPN for an extended amount of time, but they would be required to acknowledge the receipt of loan terms and conditions prior to disbursement of the new loans. In addition, all Title IV loan borrowers and Pell Grant recipients would be required to receive annual counseling to assist them in understanding the terms and conditions of the federal student aid they are receiving and the potential consequences of accepting such aid. H.R. 4508 would require that IHEs disburse Title IV funds more frequently and in smaller increments than current practice generally, and would specify that borrowers earn federal student aid at a slower rate than under current law. Taken together, these changes would temper the process of making federal study aid available to students."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elimination and Winding Down of Programs", "paragraphs": ["The HEA authorizes numerous programs to support both individuals pursuing postsecondary education and institutions of higher education. Included in such programs are those that provide federal student aid directly to students and those that provide federal support directly to institutions to support postsecondary education programs with the aim of meeting specific policy goals (e.g., to support international education programs, to prepare postsecondary students who are preparing for careers in teaching). ", "H.R. 4508 would eliminate or wind down numerous programs authorized under the HEA and other statutes related to higher education. One of the larger programs that provides aid to students that would be eliminated under H.R. 4508 is the FSEOG program, which in FY2017 provided nearly 1.5 million FSEOG awards totaling $712 million. One of the larger programs that provides support for institutions and the programs they operate that would be eliminated is the Strengthening Institutions program, which in FY2017 provided approximately $85 million to support development of 178 IHEs with a high percentage of needy students and financial limitations. ", "Many programs that H.R. 4508 would eliminate have never or have not recently received appropriations and, therefore, are not currently operational. This is especially true regarding Title VIII of the HEA, which includes 27 parts, each of which establishes one or more programs focusing on a broad array of topics. All of the programs in Title VIII were incorporated into the HEA by the HEOA and most of them have never been funded. ", "H.R. 4508 would also wind down some currently operational programs. That is, H.R. 4508 would authorize the programs to operate for a limited number of future years but would subsequently curtail the programs' operations. Programs that would be wound down under H.R. 4508 include the TEACH Grant program and the Direct Loan program. ", "The elimination or wind-down of these programs relates to an effort to streamline and scale back the number of programs included in the HEA, most of which receive small amounts of or no funding. Doing so could lead to a more-focused, discrete federal effort to support postsecondary education that may be easier to administer and could lead to reduced federal expenditures.

H.R. 4508 would address educational accountability in multiple ways. ", "H.R. 4508 would make adjustments to the standards IHEs must meet to participate in the Title IV student aid programs. The HEA currently specifies that accrediting agencies must meet certain institutional evaluation standards to be recognized by ED as \"reliable authorit[ies] regarding the quality of education or training offered.\" ED relies on the accrediting agencies it has recognized to certify that an IHE offers quality programs of study. H.R. 4508 would eliminate many of the current institutional evaluation standards required of ED-recognized accrediting agencies (some of which gauge inputs that may be associated with quality programs, such as facilities and equipment, and some of which gauge outcomes such as \"success with respect to student achievement in relation to the institution's mission\") and would require that such agencies evaluate IHE's success with respect to student educational outcomes in relation to expected measures of educational outcomes. ", "The bill would also repeal the current regulatory definition of \"credit hour,\" a measure of how much instruction must be provided in a program, which can be seen as an indicator of the depth of a program.", "H.R. 4508 would also repeal several existing regulatory or statutory outcome measures that have been relied upon to gauge education quality. In addition, it would repeal regulatory requirements applicable to certain types of sub-baccalaureate educational programs at public and nonprofit IHEs and most educational programs (including degree programs) at proprietary IHEs that prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The institutional cohort default rate metric, which is applicable to IHEs participating in federal student loan programs, would be phased out. ", "These metrics would be replaced with a new programmatic loan repayment rate metric. Most educational programs offered by IHEs would be required to meet loan repayment rate performance targets for continued Title IV participation. The loan repayment rate metric would measure the extent to which students who borrowed Title IV loans to attend an educational program are able to remain in a positive repayment status on their qualified Title IV loans (e.g., not being delinquent on the loan for 90 days or longer). It appears a presumption behind the metric would be that if an educational program is of sufficient quality, then individuals who borrow to attend the program should be able to earn adequate wages to make sufficient payments on their loans to remain in positive repayment status. The new loan repayment rate differs from the cohort default rate in that it would be used to assess the educational quality of a program of study rather than the entire IHE, and would differ from current gainful employment metrics in that it would apply to all programs at all IHEs regardless of institutional sector.", "H.R. 4508 would also add educational performance requirements to HEA programs not part of Title IV. For instance, to be eligible for funding under several of the minority-serving institution (MSI) grant programs under Title III and Title V, H.R. 4508 would require that IHEs have completion rates of at least 25%.", "Taken together, these revisions in educational accountability seem to signal an interest in shifting the focus of the overall postsecondary education accountability framework across all institutions and education program types, as opposed to only a subset of institutions or educational programs.

In general, when a student withdraws from an IHE, the IHE first determines the portion of Title IV aid considered to be earned by the student while enrolled and the portion considered to be unearned. Unearned aid must be returned to ED. Up to the 60% point of a payment or enrollment period, unearned funds must be returned on a pro rata schedule. After the 60% point, the total amount of funds awarded is considered to have been earned by the student and no funds are required to be returned. Whether an IHE and/or student are required to return the funds to ED depends on a variety of circumstances. Among other amendments, H.R. 4508 would reduce the rate at which federal student aid would be considered as having been earned by a student and would require IHEs to return a larger portion of aid after a student withdraws than under current law. This may ultimately provide financial incentives for IHEs to work toward ensuring that students complete their period of enrollment and, thus, boost both educational and fiscal accountability.", "H.R. 4508 would also expand upon the current conditions under which IHEs could be considered financially responsible to participate in the Title IV aid program. In addition, it would repeal the 90/10 Rule (applicable only to proprietary institutions), which specifies that for Title IV eligibility purposes, IHEs may not derive less than 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV funds for any two consecutive years (i.e., no more than 90% of their revenues can come from Title IV funds).

Direct Loans are made to students and their families using funds borrowed by ED from the U.S. Treasury. The institution a student attends originates and disburses Direct Loans, while federal contractors hired by ED perform loan servicing and collection functions. Several types of loans are made available through the program: Direct Subsidized Loans to undergraduate students, Direct Unsubsidized Loans to undergraduate and graduate students, Direct PLUS Loans to graduate students and the parents of undergraduate dependent students, and Direct Consolidation Loans, which enable individuals who have previously borrowed federal student loans to combine them into a single new loan. Loan terms and conditions (e.g., interest rates, borrowing limits) are specified in statute.

Beginning July 1, 2019, Federal ONE Loans would be the only type of federal student loans made available to new borrowers under Title IV of the HEA. A different type of Federal ONE Loan would be made available to each of three borrower types: Federal ONE Loans to undergraduate students, Federal One Loans to graduate and professional students, and Federal ONE Parent Loans to parents of dependent undergraduate students. In addition, Federal ONE Consolidation Loans would enable borrowers to combine existing federal student loans into a single new loan. Many of the terms and conditions of loans that would be made through the Federal ONE Loan program would be similar to the terms and conditions of Direct Loan program loans, but with some important differences. IHEs would be eligible to participate in the Federal ONE Loan program on a basis similar to their current participation in the Direct Loan program.", "Interest Rates and Fees. Federal ONE Loans would be made with market-indexed, fixed interest rates according to the same interest rate formulas that currently apply to the Direct Loan program. Thus, a different interest rate formula would apply to each loan type. Each year, interest rates would become effective for loans disbursed during the period from July 1 through June 30. For Federal ONE Loans to undergraduate students, the interest rate would be the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate plus 2.05%, with a cap of 8.25%. For Federal ONE Loans to graduate students, the interest rate would be the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate plus 3.6%, with a cap of 9.5%. For Federal ONE Parent Loans, the interest rate would be the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate plus 4.6%, with a cap of 10.5%. For Federal ONE Consolidation Loans, the interest rate would equal the weighted average of the interest rates in effect on the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest higher one-eighth of 1%. For all loan types, interest would begin to accrue once a loan was made. Unlike Direct Loans, no loan origination fees would be charged on Federal ONE Loans.", "Interest Subsidies. Under the Federal ONE Loan program, borrowers would generally be responsible for paying the interest that accrues on their loans during all periods. An interest subsidy for the period while a borrower is enrolled in an eligible program on at least a half-time basis and during grace periods (akin to what is currently available with Direct Subsidized Loans) would not be available. However, a limited set of interest subsidies\u2014some of which are substantially similar to benefits currently offered on Direct Loans\u2014would be available on Federal ONE Loans. These include an interest rate reduction of 0.25% for borrowers who agree to have their monthly loan payments automatically debited from a bank account and no accrual of interest for up to 60 months for borrowers who are serving on active duty or performing qualifying National Guard duty in an area of hostilities during a war or national emergency. ", "Loan Eligibility . All types of Federal ONE Loans would be made available to borrowers without regard to financial need. However, in two instances applicants could be required to obtain an endorser to borrow some types of Federal ONE Loans: (1) if the parent of an undergraduate student seeks to borrow a Federal ONE Parent Loan but has an adverse credit history; and (2) if an existing borrower seeks to include a Federal ONE Parent Loan, a FFEL Parent PLUS Loan, or a Direct Parent PLUS Loan in a Federal ONE Consolidation Loan, which could lead to the term of the loan being extended to a period of up to 30 years.", "Borrowing Limits. On an annual basis, loans could be borrowed in amounts up to the lesser of the amount by which the student's cost of attendance (COA) exceeds the total estimated financial assistance (EFA) made available to the student, or specified annual loan limits that would vary by borrower type and academic class level. Borrowing would also be limited by aggregate loan limits.", "In general, undergraduate students would be eligible to borrow up to $2,000 more per year through the Federal ONE Loan program than they currently may borrow through the Direct Loan program. In contrast, graduate students and parents of undergraduate dependent students generally would be eligible to borrow less per year through the Federal ONE Loan program than they currently may borrow through the Direct Loan program, as annual and aggregate borrowing limits would newly apply to these borrowers.", "For undergraduate dependent students, borrowing would be limited to $7,500 for the 1 st year of study, $8,500 for the 2 nd year, $9,500 for the 3 rd and each subsequent year; and $39,000 in the aggregate. For undergraduate independent students, borrowing would be limited to $11,500 for the 1 st year of study, $12,500 for the 2 nd year, $14,500 for the 3 rd and each subsequent year; and $60,250 in the aggregate. For graduate students, in general, borrowing would be limited to $28,500 per year and $150,000 in the aggregate; however, higher borrowing limits would apply to students in health professions programs. For Federal ONE Parent Loan borrowers, on a per-student basis, borrowing would be limited to $12,500 per year and $56,250 in the aggregate.", "Financial aid administrators would be newly permitted to reduce the amounts that students enrolled in a particular program of study at an IHE could borrow on the basis of certain factors, which would be required to be uniformly applied. Borrowing could be limited based on the IHE's ability to reasonably demonstrate that student debt levels would otherwise be excessive for occupations typically pursued by graduates of a particular program, a borrower's enrollment on less than a full-time basis, the credential level of the program (e.g., degree, certificate), or a student's year of enrollment. Financial aid administrators would also be permitted, upon request, to authorize borrowing up to otherwise applicable limits for students with special circumstances or who have exceptional need.", "Loan Repayment Plans. Under current law, numerous loan repayment plans are available to borrowers of loans made through the Direct Loan program. These include the standard repayment plan, the graduated repayment plan, the extended repayment plan, and several income-driven repayment (IDR) plans: the income-contingent repayment (ICR) plan, the income-based repayment (IBR) plan, the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan, and the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan. In general, borrowers may choose any of these repayment plans and may switch from one repayment plan to another. However, PLUS Loans made to parent borrowers may not be repaid according to any of the income-driven repayment plans. ", "H.R. 4508 would attempt to reduce the number of repayment plans available to borrowers. Borrowers of Federal ONE Loans would be permitted to choose between a fixed-term standard repayment plan and an income-based repayment (IBR) plan. Under a standard repayment plan, for loans other than Federal ONE Consolidation Loans, borrowers would make level payments over a period of 10 years; while for Federal ONE Consolidation Loans, borrowers would make level payments over a period that could range from 10 to 30 years, depending on the loan balance. The IBR plan would be available for loans other than Federal ONE Parent Loans and Excepted Federal ONE Consolidation Loans, and, in general, borrowers would make monthly payments equal to the greater of 1/12 th of 15% of the amount (if any) that their adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeded 150% of the federal poverty guideline applicable to their family size, or $25. (For borrowers who become unemployed or who have high medical expenses that constitute an extreme economic hardship, minimum monthly payments could be reduced to $5 for a period of up to three years.) In the case of a married borrower, the AGI of both spouses would be considered for purposes of calculating payment amounts, regardless of their tax filing status. If two borrowers were married and each wished to repay their loans according to the IBR plan, monthly payment amounts would be calculated on the basis of both borrowers' combined loan balance. ", "Limitations on maximum cumulative payments required to be made would apply to Federal ONE Loans repaid exclusively according to either the IBR plan or a standard repayment plan with a term of no more than 10 years. For these loans, borrowers would be required to make cumulative payments of no more than the amount of principal and interest that would otherwise have been paid based on a 10-year repayment period beginning when the borrower entered repayment on such loans, plus any interest that accrued during periods of in-school deferment. Any remaining loan balance would be forgiven. Borrowers of Federal ONE Consolidation Loans who ever opt to repay their loans according to a standard repayment plan with a term greater than 10 years would be ineligible for the IBR limitation on maximum cumulative payments.", "Deferment. A deferment is the temporary cessation of a borrower's obligation to make payments on a loan. In contrast to the Direct Loan program, borrowers of all types of Federal ONE Loans would generally be eligible for deferments based on only a limited set of criteria (e.g., on the basis of being enrolled in-school at least half-time or performing certain types of qualifying military service). Borrowers and endorsers of Federal ONE Parent Loans and Excepted Federal ONE Consolidation Loans would also be eligible for deferments on the basis of having an economic hardship, having exceptionally high medical expenses, or being unemployed but seeking to obtain employment. Any interest that would accrue during a period of deferment would be capitalized into the principal balance of the loan when the deferment ended. ", "Loan Forgiveness and Loan Discharge due to Death or Total and Permanent Disability. The Direct Loan program currently authorizes two loan forgiveness benefits: Loan Forgiveness for Teachers and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Through the Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, teachers in general may have up to $5,000 of their student loan debt forgiven following five years of service as a full-time teacher in a qualifying low-income school, while those who are also special education teachers or secondary school teachers of mathematics or science may have up to $17,500 forgiven. Through the PSLF program, borrowers who make 120 qualifying monthly payments on or after October 2, 2007, according to an IDR plan or any of the standard, graduated, or extended repayment plans in amounts equal to or greater than the monthly amount due as calculated according to a standard 10-year repayment period, while concurrently being employed full-time in one or more public service jobs, may have the remaining balance of their Direct Loans forgiven. H.R. 4508 would retain these loan forgiveness benefits for borrowers of Direct Loans. However, the Loan Forgiveness for Teachers and PSLF programs would not be made available to borrowers of Federal ONE Loans.", "Under current law, liability for federal student loans made through the Direct Loan, FFEL, and Perkins Loan programs is discharged in the case of borrowers who die, become permanently and totally disabled, or are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted continuously or can be expected to last continuously for 60 months.

HEA Section 455(h) provides that ED shall specify in regulations the acts or omissions of an IHE that a Direct Loan borrower may assert as a borrower defense to repayment (BDR). Current regulations promulgated under this authority require that an IHE's acts or omissions must give rise to a cause of action against an IHE under applicable state law. In addition, FFEL regulations provide that in more limited circumstances, FFEL borrowers may assert claims similar to Direct Loan BDR to receive debt relief. Perkins Loan borrowers may not assert BDR claims. In implementing the regulations, ED has established subregulatory procedures and standards, which include specifying that FFEL and Perkins Loan borrowers may consolidate their loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan to have the underlying FFEL and Perkins Loans evaluated under the same BDR standards as a Direct Loan.", "Effective July 1, 2018, H.R. 4508 would establish new standards and procedures for BDR that would apply to Direct Loans and Federal ONE Loans. FFEL and Perkins Loan borrowers seeking relief under the BDR procedures would first be required to consolidate their loans into a Federal ONE Consolidation Loan. H.R. 4508 would specify that a borrower has a BDR if (1) the borrower has obtained a nondefault, favorable contested judgment based on state or federal law against the IHE; (2) the IHE for which the borrower received the loan failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student; or (3) the IHE made a substantial misrepresentation that the borrower reasonably relied on when the borrower decided to attend or continue attending the IHE. The bill would also specify the following:", "ED may approve a borrower's BDR application in full or in part; ED may consolidate individually filed applications that have common facts and claims to allow for faster processing of applications; a borrower may not recover amounts previously collected by ED later than three years after the IHE's actions giving rise to a cause of action have occurred; and ED may initiate proceedings against IHEs to recover amounts resulting from successful BDR claims from IHEs.", "Finally, H.R. 4508 would repeal BDR regulations promulgated in 2016 but delayed in implementation until July 1, 2019.", "Other Types of Loan Discharge . The HEA specifies that borrowers of FFEL and Direct Loan program loans may have the balance of their loans discharged if they (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) are unable to complete the educational program in which they enrolled due to the closure of the school or if they were falsely certified as eligible for the loan by an IHE or as a result of a crime of identity theft. The HEA also provides that FFEL and Direct Loan borrowers may have a portion of their loans discharged if an IHE failed to make a refund of loan proceeds that the IHE owed to the borrower. Regulations add specificity to borrower qualification requirements and procedures for each of these discharge options.", "H.R. 4508 would largely codify the current FFEL and Direct Loan regulations relating to borrower qualifications and procedures for closed school discharge and apply them to FFEL, Direct Loan, and Federal ONE Loan program loans.
