Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 60 million people have been infected with HIV, approximately 30 million of whom have died of HIV-related causes. At the end of 2010, an estimated 34 million people were living with the virus, the vast majority of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the past decade, due in large part to U.S. support, has contributed to declines in deaths among people living with HIV. Nonetheless, new infections continue to outpace access to treatment. The second session of the 112th Congress will likely be faced with determining how, and to what extent, the United States should respond to the continued challenge of global HIV/AIDS.", "The United States has recognized HIV/AIDS as a key foreign policy priority. Congress has passed several pieces of legislation related to global HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care. In particular, in 2003, Congress enacted the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-25), authorizing $15 billion to combat global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), an initiative proposed by the George W. Bush Administration. In 2008, Congress enacted the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-293), authorizing $48 billion for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2009 through FY2013.", "PEPFAR is the largest commitment in history by any nation to combat a single disease and makes up the majority of donor funding for global HIV/AIDS. When PEPFAR was announced, health experts were debating whether the international community had a responsibility to provide ART in developing countries and whether they could be safely administered in such environments. PEPFAR responded to calls from those advocating treatment for the world's poor and demonstrated that ART could be effectively provided in low-resource settings.", "PEPFAR is coordinated by the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) at the Department of State and is implemented by a range of U.S. agencies that include, among others, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The United States also supports several multilateral organizations responding to HIV/AIDS, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) and the United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).", "Due in part to the global response to HIV/AIDS, substantial progress has been made in combating the epidemic. New HIV infections fell by more than 25% in 33 countries between 2001 and 2009, and a total of 2.5 million deaths have been averted in low- and middle-income countries since 1995 due to antiretroviral therapy. At the same time, major challenges remain in the fight against HIV/AIDS. For example, with new infections outpacing available treatment, experts have increasingly debated how to best allocate limited resources. This report outlines basic facts related to global HIV/AIDS, including characteristics of the epidemic and U.S. legislation, programs, funding, and partnerships related to global HIV/AIDS. It concludes with a brief description of some of the major issues that might be considered by the 112th Congress in its response to the disease.

The final stage of HIV is AIDS, which occurs when an individual's immune system is so damaged it can no longer fight off other infections. If left untreated, AIDS is fatal. HIV is spread through contact with the bloodstream or by passing through delicate mucous membranes, including the vagina, rectum, and urethra. Transmission primarily occurs in three ways: (1) unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner; (2) injections with a needle, syringe, or other equipment that has been used by an infected person; and (3) between a child and an infected mother, during pregnancy, birth, or breast-feeding. High-risk groups include sex workers, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users.

The number of people living with HIV continues to rise as a combined result of new infections and improved access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) that has lowed AIDS-related mortality.", "Incidence : Incidence measures the number of people who contract a disease within a given time period (usually one year). In 2010, 2.7 million people contracted HIV, including 390,000 children under the age of 15. New infections are thought to have peaked in 1996 at 3.5 million ( Figure 1 ).

In 2010, 1.8 million people died of AIDS, including roughly 250,000 children. AIDS-related deaths are thought to have peaked in 2004 at 2.2 million and declined since then due to the improved access to ART.

", "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the region most affected by HIV/AIDS ( Figure 2 ). In 2010, an estimated 22.9 million people were living with HIV/AIDS in SSA, accounting for 68% of all people living with HIV worldwide. Southern Africa is home to the nine countries with the world's highest HIV prevalence rates worldwide and was home to an estimated 11.1 million people living with HIV in 2010. Swaziland has the world's highest prevalence rate (25.9%), and South Africa has the world's largest population with HIV (5.6 million). In 2010, about 1.9 million people in SSA contracted HIV and some 1.2 million people in the region died from AIDS. In 2010, an estimated 4.8 million people were living with HIV in Asia, including 360,000 people who became infected in 2010. Also in 2010, approximately 310,000 AIDS-related deaths occurred in the region, the largest number of deaths outside of sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, the rate of HIV transmission is slowing and the death toll has remained stable, while the epidemic among men who have sex with men appears to be growing. In 2010, an estimated 1.7 million people were living with HIV in Latin America and the Caribbean, including 112,000 people who became infected in 2010. In the region, the Bahamas has the highest prevalence rate, while Brazil has the largest population living with virus. Overall, the epidemic in Latin America has stabilized and the rates of new infections and AIDS-related deaths in the Caribbean have slowed. Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) has experienced the largest regional increase in HIV prevalence, most prominently in Russia and Ukraine. Since 2001, the number of people living with HIV in the region has increased by 250%. In 2010, an estimated 1.5 million people were living with HIV in EECA, including 160,000 people who were infected in 2010.

ART coverage\u2014the percentage of people on ART among those eligible for treatment\u2014was 47% in 2010, up from 7% in 2003. While lowering AIDS-related deaths, access to ART has also increased HIV prevalence around the world, as infected individuals are now living longer. ART also has preventive benefits as it lowers viral loads, consequently reducing the likelihood of transmission. ", "Care Activities : Care for individuals infected and affected by HIV/AIDS constitutes a wide range of activities, including support for ART adherence, treatment of opportunistic infections, nutritional counseling, mental health services, prevention education, and livelihood activities, along with attention to orphans and vulnerable children.", "Prevention Activities : A number of prevention efforts are being used to combat HIV/AIDS, including male circumcision, reduction of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), behavior change programs (including advocacy of abstinence, being faithful, and using condoms), HIV testing, blood supply safety programs, harm reduction programs aimed at high-risk groups, and increased provision of antiretroviral therapy, which can reduce the potential of transmission. ", "Prevention Research : Several studies published in 2010 and 2011 have demonstrated progress in developing new prevention technologies. Antiretroviral therapy has been shown to have important preventive benefits: among couples with one infected partner, early use of ART was shown to reduce transmission by at least 96%. Efforts to develop HIV preventive vaccines and microbicides\u2014compounds that can be applied inside the vagina or rectum to protect against sexually transmitted infections\u2014are also underway. Results from a 2010 study in South Africa, funded in part by the United States, showed that the use of a microbicide was 39% effective in reducing a woman's risk of contracting HIV during sex. Many health experts support microbicide research as it offers women vulnerable to violence and sexual coercion some degree of protection against HIV.

Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) : CDC's Global AIDS Program (GAP) operates in 38 countries and four regional programs. CDC HIV/AIDS programs assist ministries of health and local implementing organizations to implement HIV/AIDS prevention programs, analyze program impact and cost effectiveness, and build the capacity of public workforce, as well as public health information, laboratory, and management systems. National Institutes of Health (NIH) : NIH supports HIV/AIDS research and training in approximately 100 countries. This research focuses on tools to prevent HIV transmission, such as vaccines and microbicides; strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission; and approaches to treating HIV and its associated opportunistic infections and co-infections in resource poor settings. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) : HRSA provides education and training HIV/AIDS programs in more than 25 countries that increase rapid roll-out of ART, support health system strengthening and improvements in human resources for health, and facilitate innovative approaches to health data collection and evaluation. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) : FDA ensures the availability of safe and effective AIDS treatment. Since 2004, FDA has supported an accelerated review process for ARTs, including generic drugs and fixed dose combination drugs (FDCs)\u2014multiple antiretroviral drugs combined into a single pill\u2014for PEPFAR programs. As of 2011, 136 ART formulations had been approved or tentatively approved by FDA. Department of Defense (DOD) : DOD operates HIV/AIDS programs in 73 countries. DOD's primary role under PEPFAR is to support military-to-military HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care efforts; assist in the development of military-specific HIV/AIDS policies; and provide HIV/AIDS counseling, testing, and care for military families. DOD also provides HIV prevention scientific and technical assistance to non-military PEPFAR programs.

Given the United States' central role in the fight against HIV/AIDS, many experts assert that the future direction of the U.S. response to HIV/AIDS will have significant implications for the global response to HIV/AIDS as a whole. The 112 th Congress may consider the following issues as it considers the U.S. response to global HIV/AIDS: ", "Treatment efforts : Without a vaccine or cure to HIV, people continue to contract HIV and require lifelong treatment. As such, despite efforts by the international community to expand access to treatment, the number of people in need of ART outpaces treatment resources. Global health experts have increasingly debated the sustainability of HIV/AIDS treatment programs and how to use limited resources to both treat those in need while also preventing new infections. Prevention efforts : There is widespread support within the global health community for intensifying prevention efforts, particularly in light of the persistent need for HIV/AIDS treatments. At the same time, experts disagree on what prevention efforts are most effective, how to measure the success of any one prevention activity, and how to incentivize leaders of developing countries to increase financial investment in prevention, particularly given its less immediate and dramatic results when compared with treatment. Recent scientific evidence regarding the preventive benefits of ART, as well as topical and oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis, including microbicides, may increase support for and discussion of the use of these technologies. Health System Strengthening: Many global health experts argue that an effective long-term approach to global HIV/AIDS requires efforts to strengthen health systems (HSS) in low- and middle-income countries. However, there is little consensus within the global health community over how to define, implement, and measure HSS activities, and over whether PEPFAR has had a beneficial or detrimental impact on the broader functioning of health systems. Country ownership: Donor governments have increasingly supported the concept of country ownership as a way to promote sustainable and country-appropriate responses to the epidemic. To this end, a number of PEPFAR programs have implemented \"Partnership Frameworks\" with partner countries to clarify joint goals and strategies. Several issues related to country ownership are being debated within donor governments, including how to best align donor priorities and country priorities and how to maintain effective levels of oversight while shifting control to host governments."], "subsections": []}]}}
