The controversy surrounding funding a needle exchange program touches on issues of home rule, public health policy, and government sanctioning and facilitating the use of illegal drugs. Proponents of a needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of HIV among illegal drug users by reducing the incidence of shared needles. Opponents of these efforts contend that such programs amount to the government sanctioning illegal drugs by supplying drug-addicted persons with the tools to use them. In addition, opponents contend that public health concerns raised about the spread of HIV and AIDS through shared contaminated needles should be addressed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs. Another view in the debate focuses on the issue of home rule and the city's ability to use local funds to institute such programs free from congressional restrictions.", "The prohibition on the use of federal and District funds for a needle exchange program was first approved by Congress as Section 170 of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999, P.L. 105-277. The 1999 act did allow private funding of needle exchange programs.

Section 150 of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 made it unlawful to distribute any needle or syringe for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug in any area in the city that is within 1,000 feet of a public elementary or secondary school, including any public charter school. The provision was deleted during congressional consideration and thus from the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of FY2002, P.L. 107-96. The act also included a provision that allowed the use of private funds for a needle exchange program, but it prohibited the use of both District and federal funds for such activities. At present, one entity, Prevention Works, a private nonprofit AIDS awareness and education program, operates a needle exchange program. The FY2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act required such entities to track and account for the use of public and private funds.", "During consideration of the FY2004 District of Columbia Appropriations Act, District officials unsuccessfully sought to lift the prohibition on the use of District funds for needle exchange programs. A Senate provision, which was not adopted, proposed prohibiting the use of federal funds for a needle exchange program, but allowing the use of District funds. The House and final conference versions of the FY2004 bill allowed the use of private funds for needle exchange programs and required private and public entities that receive federal or District funds in support of other activities or programs to account for the needle exchange funds separately.

The act allowed the use of District funds for a needle exchange program aimed at reducing the spread of HIV and AIDS among users of illegal drugs. The provision was a departure from previous appropriations acts which prohibited the use of both District and federal funds in support of a needle exchange program. In addition, the explanatory statement accompanying the act encouraged the George W. Bush Administration to include federal funding to help the city address its HIV/AIDS health crisis.", "The President's budget proposal for FY2013 and House and Senate bills included language that retained language included in the FY2012 appropriations act that allowed the use of District funds, but prohibited the use of federal funds, in support of a needle exchange program. However, the Obama Administration, in a Statement of Administration Policy issued on June 28, 2012, included language that urged the House to remove language prohibiting the use of federal funds in support of a needle exchange program arguing that current federal law allows the use of federal funds for such programs to prevent or limit the spread of HIV/AIDS among intravenous drug users.

Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). On September 17, 1999, District Court Judge Richard Roberts ruled that Congress, despite its legislative responsibility for the District under Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, did not possess the power to stifle or prevent political speech, which included the ballot initiative. This ruling allowed the city to tally the votes from the November 1998 ballot initiative.

Opponents of the provision contend that such congressional actions undercut the concept of home rule.", "The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2002, P.L. 107-96 (115 Stat. 953), included a provision that continued to prohibit the District government from implementing the initiative. Congress's power to block the implementation of the initiative was again challenged in the courts. On December 18, 2001, two groups, the Marijuana Policy Project and the Medical Marijuana Initiative Committee, filed suit in U.S. District Court, seeking injunctive relief in an effort to put another medical marijuana initiative on the November 2002 ballot. The District's Board of Elections and Ethics ruled that a congressional rider that has been included in the general provisions of each District appropriations act since 1998 prohibits it from using public funds to do preliminary work that would put the initiative on the ballot. On March 28, 2002, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the congressional ban on the use of public funds to put such a ballot initiative before the voters was unconstitutional. The judge stated that the effect of the amendment was to restrict the plaintiff's First Amendment right to engage in political speech. The decision was appealed by the Justice Department, and on September 19, 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the ruling of the lower court without comment. The appeals court issued its ruling on September 19, 2002, which was the deadline for printing ballots for the November 2002 general election. On June 6, 2005, the Supreme Court, in a six-to-three decision, ruled that Congress possessed the constitutional authority under the Commerce clause to regulate or prohibit the interstate marketing of both legal and illegal drugs. This includes banning the possession of drugs in states and the District of Columbia that have decriminalized or permitted the use of marijuana for medical or therapeutic purposes.

In 2010, the District of Columbia Council approved legislation (A18-0429) regulating the medical use of marijuana. Although the legislation was subject to a 30-day congressional review period, which would have allowed it to pass a resolution of disapproval, Congress took no action to block its implementation.

District officials have cited the prohibition on the use of District funds as another example of congressional intrusion into local matters. Since 1979, with the passage of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of 1980, P.L. 96-93 (93 Stat. 719), Congress has placed some limitation or prohibition on the use of public funds for abortion services for District residents. From 1979 to 1988, Congress restricted the use of federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life was endangered or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. The District was free to use District funds for abortion services. When Congress passed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1989, P.L. 100-462 (102 Stat. 2269-9), it restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were taken to term. The inclusion of District funds, and the elimination of rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services, was endorsed by President Reagan, who threatened to veto the District's appropriations act if the abortion provision was not modified. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush twice vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue. He signed P.L. 101-168 (103 Stat. 1278) after insisting that Congress include language prohibiting the use of District revenues to pay for abortion services except in cases where the woman's life was endangered. ", "The District successfully sought the removal of the provision limiting District funding of abortion services when Congress considered and passed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1994, P.L. 103-127 (107 Stat. 1350). The FY1994 act also reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances allowing for the public funding of abortion services. The District's success was short-lived, however. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1996, P.L. 104-134 (110 Stat. 1321-91), and subsequent District of Columbia appropriations acts, limited the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life was endangered or cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. ", "In FY2010, with the passage of P.L. 111-117, Congress lifted the prohibition on the use of District funds for abortion services, but maintained the restriction on the use of federal funds for such services except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the woman. The position was reversed with the passage of the appropriations acts for FY2011 (P.L. 112-10) and FY2012 (P.L. 112-74). Those acts included provisions restricting the use of both federal and District funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or the woman's life was endangered if the pregnancy was carried to term. ", "The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request included a provision that would have prohibited the use of federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term, but did not include language that would have restricted the use of District funds for abortion services. The Senate bill, S. 3301, supported the Administration position restricting the use of federal funds. The House bill, H.R. 6020, included language that would have restricted the use of both federal and District funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or the woman's life is endangered. P.L. 113-6 continues to allow the District to use its own funds to provide abortion services, but only in cases of rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant women was jeopardized. ", "During the 112 th Congress two bills advanced in the House that would have banned or restricted the provision of abortion services in the District of Columbia.

The measure included a provision, Section 309, that would have permanently prohibited the use of federal and District funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the woman. ", "On June 17, 2012, the House Judiciary Committee ordered reported H.R. 3803 , the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The bill would have permanently banned doctors and health facilities from performing abortions in the District after the 20 th week of pregnancy, except when the pregnancy will result in the woman suffering from a physical disorder, injury, or illness that endangers her life. It would have imposed fines and imprisonment on doctors who violated the act and would have allowed the pregnant woman, the father of the unborn child, or the maternal grandparents of the unborn child of a pregnant minor to bring a civil action against any person who performed an abortion after the 20 th week of pregnancy. The act would have required any physician that performs an abortion to report specific information to the relevant health agency in the District, including post-fertilization age of the fetus and the abortion method used. The District health agency would have been required to compile such information and issue an annual report to the public. The District's delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, though not allowed to testify before the committee, spoke out against the measures as infringements on home rule.

The program provides scholarships (also known as vouchers) to students in the District of Columbia to attend participating private elementary and secondary schools, including religiously affiliated private schools. P.L. 108-199 also provided funding for the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) for the improvement of public education and for the State Education Office for public charter schools. The provision of federal funds for DCPS, public charter schools, and vouchers is commonly referred to as the \"three-prong approach\" to supporting elementary and secondary education in the District of Columbia. ", "The Opportunity Scholarship program was subsequently reauthorized through the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act (division C of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011; P.L. 112-10). Appropriations for the program were authorized for FY2012 through FY2016 at $60 million each year. P.L. 112-10 requires that appropriations provided for the program be divided evenly among DCPS for the improvement of public education, public charter schools to improve and expand quality public charter schools, and the Opportunity Scholarship program, regardless of the actual amount appropriated. Thus, the reauthorized Opportunity Scholarship program continues to be included in a broader approach to supporting elementary and secondary education in the District of Columbia.", "The Obama Administration's proposed budget for FY2013 included funds only for DCPS and public charter schools. No funds were requested to support the Opportunity Scholarship program. S. 3301, as reported, would have provided a total of $53.5 million for a federal payment for school improvement. Rather than dividing these funds equally between the aforementioned three prongs, funds would have been provided as follows: $20 million for DCPS, $20 million for public charter schools, and $13.5 million for the Opportunity Scholarship program. H.R. 6020, as reported, would each of the three prongs. P.L. 113-6 appropriated $59.8 million to support elementary and secondary education in the District, divided evenly among the three initiatives: public schools, public charter schools, and school vouchers."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
