REITs are corporations that issue shares of stock, are largely invested in real property, and do not generally pay corporate tax. REITs distribute and deduct most income as dividends to shareholders. U.S. individual shareholders pay tax at ordinary individual income tax rates on those dividends (rather than the lower rates normally applied to dividends on corporate stock).", "REITs were initially introduced, in part, to allow taxpayers of more modest means to invest in real estate. The size and scope of REITs has been increasing in past years, due in part to legislative and regulatory changes. REITs today are estimated to own $1.8 trillion in real estate. Legislative changes have meant REITs are increasingly not only owning and renting property as a passive investment, but also managing it through taxable subsidiaries. U.S. corporations have been spinning off (transferring to a separate corporation organized as a REIT) buildings (and other assets defined as real estate) in a tax-free reorganization. The expanding scope and size of REIT activities has raised issues as to whether the intent of the preferred treatment is still appropriate.", "Another issue concerning REITs is that provisions in FIRPTA have been discouraging foreign investors from purchasing REIT shares by taxing investments that exceed 5% of the REIT's shares. Capital gains paid to foreign investors are generally exempt from U.S. tax. FIRPTA, however, imposes a capital gains tax on foreign investments for gains related to real estate, with an exception for a 5% or less ownership of a REIT. Investment in other types of securities is not subject to the U.S. capital gains tax.", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act makes several changes in response to these issues. The act", "disallows tax-free spin-offs of assets into a tax-exempt REIT by a regular corporation; increases from 5% to 10% the amount of ownership in a REIT by a foreign investor before the capital gains tax applies; and exempts foreign pension funds investing directly or indirectly in real estate from the FIRPTA capital gains tax.", "These provisions, taken together, result in federal tax revenue losses. There are also some smaller (in revenue effect) provisions affecting foreign investors that gain revenue.", "In addition to these rules, P.L. 114-13 includes some minor provisions, the most significant of these changes relating to the treatment of taxable REIT subsidiaries.", "The changes in the Consolidated Appropriations Act may lead to a period with no further REIT revisions. If tax reform is considered, however, additional REIT base broadening provisions might be considered. For example, former Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Dave Camp's proposed Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1, 113th Congress) contained more restrictive provisions relating to spin-offs as well as other provisions primarily focused on the definition of real estate. Changes in a tax reform, such as lowering the corporate rate or allowing a corporate dividend deduction, could also affect the relative tax benefit of REITs.", "This report describes REITs and FIRPTA, provides historical developments, presents an overview of REIT size and activity, explains the provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and discusses possible policy issues in the future."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T he Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-13 ) made several changes to the tax treatment of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA, enacted in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, P.L. 96-499 ) as it relates to REITs.

These requirements and restrictions are listed in Table 1 . Its primary business is ownership of real estate assets. Unlike ordinary corporations, REITS generally face little or no corporate level tax because distributions to shareholders are treated as deductible expenses. To qualify, a REIT must meet a number of tests, including having at least 75% of its assets and gross income in real estate and distributing at least 90% of profits to shareholders. Dividends paid to individual shareholders are taxed at ordinary individual income tax rates (rather than the lower rates that generally apply to dividends). Basically a REIT is taxed similarly to a partnership in many ways, which is subject to the individual income tax, and largely avoids the corporate-level tax.", "REITs have a number of restrictions that require concentration of their assets in passive investments, primarily real estate, and ensure broad ownership. The allowance for taxable REIT subsidiaries adopted in 1999, however, has expanded the scope for REITs to operate properties.", "Over time, the rules governing REITs have been relaxed, both by legislative and regulatory changes, to allow more involvement not just in holding real estate assets, but also in managing properties and services. REITs were originally designed to be passive real estate owners (if they did not simply own mortgages), with properties operated by others. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 allowed REITs to perform customary services and, thus, to operate their properties directly rather than to employ independent contractors. Legislation in the late 1990s, especially allowing taxable REIT subsidiaries, also expanded the scope of operations. Taxable REIT subsidiaries also introduced the possibility of reducing taxes by shifting profits into the REIT parent through higher than market rents, an effect for which some evidence was found (although such transactions are subject to a 100% penalty). These and other changes expanded the scope of assets organized as REITs.", "Prior to the 2015 legislation and following a regulatory change in 2001, corporations have been able to spin off their real estate assets into a separate REIT through a tax-free reorganization. The number of firms spinning off their properties or considering doing so has been growing. One of the changes in the Consolidated Appropriations Act was to restrict this practice. ", "REITs are organized as equity, mortgage, or hybrid REITs, depending on whether they hold real estate, mortgages, or a combination of both. Today, most REITs are equity REITs. REITs fall into three classes as far as regulation and trading: (1) public REITs traded on the stock exchange, (2) public REITs not traded on the stock exchange but subject to registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and (3) private REITs. ", "REITs are subject to a number of other restrictions and rules. REITs were intended to have passive investments in real estate assets and not to hold property for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business (as a developer would). Gain from these sales would be considered sale of inventory. Such income is not classified as qualified real estate income and there is a 100% prohibited transactions tax on such gain. This tax does not apply to property obtained through foreclosure and there are safe harbors from the tax including limits on the size of the sale and a holding period of two years.

The FIRPTA rules, adopted in 1980, considered investment in real property to be income effectively connected to business, which is generally subject to U.S. taxes.

Freeman , ruled that real estate trusts were not taxable entities for purposes of the tax. The issue subsequently came into question again. In 1935, the Supreme Court, in Morrisy v. Commission er , ruled that realty trusts were corporations subject to the corporate tax. (The Court also ruled that RICs were subject to the corporate tax as well, although these firms applied for relief from Congress and received it.) REITs, largely experiencing losses during the depression, and thus not affected by the tax, made no appeals to reverse the treatment through legislation, and most were eventually liquidated. Those that remained appealed to Congress in 1955, but in 1956 President Eisenhower vetoed the first real estate investment trust bill. His veto message contained two reasons for rejecting the legislation. First, he noted that REITs were different from regulated investment companies whose income was derived from the securities of corporations already subject to the tax and thus were not comparable to REITs, who would pay no corporate tax. Secondly, he expressed concern that the provision, although aimed at a small number of trusts, could expand to many other real estate corporations and erode the corporate base. A REIT proposal in 1958 was incorporated into legislation but dropped in conference. Eventually, legislation allowing for REITs that were exempt from the corporate-level tax on distributions was added to the Cigar Excise Tax Act of 1960. The reasons given by legislators were the need for real estate financing due to economic conditions at that time and the creation of a vehicle to allow taxpayers of more modest means to invest in real estate. In addition, the Treasury, which had initially objected to the legislation, withdrew those objections after the resignation of Dan Throop Smith, Under Secretary of Treasury for Tax Policy, who opposed the REIT legislation.

REITs were first listed on the stock exchange in 1965, were allowed to acquire and temporarily operate foreclosed property in 1974, and first allowed to organize as corporations in 1976. During the early years, REITs were largely mortgage REITs. By 1971, public equity REITs constituted 22% of total public REIT value (with the remainder about evenly divided between mortgage REITs and hybrids); today they constitute more than 90% of the total and hybrids have virtually disappeared. The growth in equity REITS was in part due to changes in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which allowed REITs to both own and manage property. Prior to that act, REITs could not provide services to tenants; the 1986 act allowed the provision of customary services, such as heat, light, and trash collection.", "The first UPREITs, in which a partnership (umbrella partnership) is formed with the REIT as a general partner, were offered in 1992; this structure avoided recognition of capital gains on conversion of debt to equity. In 1993, the five-or-fewer ownership rule was liberalized by counting pensions as multiple investors, reflecting pension beneficiaries. This change made it easier for pension plans to invest in REITs. In 1996, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance began expanding the type of services REITs could provide, beginning with cable television.

The REIT provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-34 ) expanded the types of services that REITs could offer without being disqualified and made changes that allowed timber REITs. The first timber REIT, Plum Creek, appeared in 1999. In addition, in 1999, taxable REIT subsidiaries were first allowed. These taxable subsidiaries allowed REITs to actively manage and operate properties and provide services beyond customary tenant services. The 1999 legislation also reduced the required distribution from 95% to 90%. In 2004, legislation allowed REITs that violated rules to address them and pay a penalty rather than lose REIT status. In 2008, health care REITs (e.g., REITs that hold assets such as nursing homes) were allowed taxable subsidiaries.", "In 2001, the IRS held in Revenue Ruling 2001-29 that rental activity was an active business (reflecting changes that expanded the scope of REIT activity), which allowed firms to spin off their real estate assets in a tax-free reorganization. Following this ruling, Georgia Pacific spun off a timber REIT subsidiary, which then merged with Plum Creek to create a Fortune 500 company. Through a series of private letter rulings, IRS also ruled that assets such as billboards, electrical distribution systems, security components, fire protection systems, telecommunications systems, and data storage are real property. Note, however, that related items that might be thought of as nontraditional had long been allowed as real property, including television towers (General Counsel Memorandum 32907, September 1, 1964), railroad property (Revenue Ruling 69-94, in 1969), and microwave towers (Revenue Ruling 75-424). These later rulings led to growth of conversions of parts of ordinary corporations into tax-exempt REIT conversions, spurring concerns about erosion of the corporate base that ultimately led to legislative proposals.", "Another change in this era that might have adversely affected REITs was the reduction of the tax rate on dividends from ordinary rates to a 15% rate (or zero rate in some cases) in 2003.

There was an exception for sale of REIT stock of publicly traded U.S. real estate corporations by owners with a 5% or less share. Its general rationale was to equalize the treatment of foreign and domestic investors, although it was also partly in response to concerns about purchases of U.S. farm land by foreign investors. In 1997, amid concerns about the doubling of the 15% withholding tax rate on dividends paid by REITs to foreign investors (the standard withholding rate in the absence of a treaty provision is 30%), the rate in the Model U.S. Tax Convention was set at 15% for investors with a 5% or less interest in a publicly traded REIT or a 10% or less interest in a diversified REIT. In 2003, a U.S.-UK treaty provided no dividend withholding taxes for UK pension funds (for REIT investments, so long as the pension plan owned 10% of less of the REIT), and this provision was later extended to other treaties.

From a tax perspective, tax-exempt investors have the largest benefit from REIT treatment compared with treatment as a regular corporation because they have a zero personal level tax and are not subject to the unrelated business income tax. Without REIT treatment, income would be subject to a 35% corporate tax rate. An individual investor with a high tax rate investor who receives all income in dividends would pay a tax of 50.47% with a regular corporate investment (a 35% corporate tax and a 23.8% individual level tax, including the 39.6% income tax and the additional 3.8% tax enacted in the Affordable Care Act, on the remaining profit of 65%). With REIT treatment, dividends would be taxed at 39.6% plus the 3.8% tax, which is a 7.17 percentage point difference. (For earnings received as capital gains the difference is greater.) For an investor in an ordinary corporate firm that pays little or no dividends and where gains are not realized, the tax rate for a REIT can be higher than for an ordinary corporation: 43.4% (39.6% plus 3.8%) versus 35%.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries: This provision reduces the permissible asset share for taxable REIT subsidiaries from 25% to 20% ($167 million). 2. Safe Harbor from Prohibited Transactions Tax: One of the rules for avoiding the prohibited transactions tax is to limit the affected sales to 10% of asset value. The revision increases the limit to 20%, but retains an average 10% limit over three years ($7 million). 3. Preferential Dividends: REITs are denied deductions for distributions that are not proportional across shareholders. This provision repeals that rule for publicly offered REITs and allows remedies other than loss of deduction for other REITs (-$4 million). 4. Designation of Distributions: A REIT may designate some distributions as capital gains subject to the lower rate capital gains rate (limited to net capital gains), and may also designate some dividends as qualified dividends subject to the lower rate based on dividend income or income subject to the corporate level tax. The IRS has allowed these amounts combined to exceed dividend distributions and has also required proportional designations. The provision limits the total to the amount of dividends designated by a REIT to current dividends paid and provides regulatory authority to the IRS to require proportional designations across shares ($4 million). 5. Asset Test: Debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs and interests in mortgages on interests in real property (such as a lease) are treated as real property (-$7 million). 6. Asset and Income Test: Interest on a mortgage in which personal property is leased along with real property will be considered real property as long as the personal property is less than 15% of the total, a rule that already applies to rents (-$8 million). 7. Hedging Transactions: Under current law, hedging indebtedness incurred to acquire real estate assets or manage the risk of currency fluctuations is disregarded as part of gross income for the income tests. This provision expands the definition of hedging income that is disregarded to positions that manage risk related to certain prior hedges (-$2 million). 8. Earnings and Profits: The earnings and profits measure determines the extent to which a dividend is a return of capital. Because of an anomaly in the way earnings and profits are measured for REITs, the amount of dividend that is a return on investment can be overstated when dealing with provisions with timing differences. This issue is corrected (-$4 million). 9. Services Provided by Taxable REIT Subsidiaries: Among the rules for safe harbor from the prohibited transactions tax under some circumstances is the requirement that development costs or management of foreclosed property be done by independent contractors. This provision allows this activity to be done by taxable REIT subsidiaries. The base for the current 100% tax on the difference between actual and arm's length rents between a REIT and its taxable subsidiary is expanded to include non-arms-length prices relating to services (-$65 million).

The major differences between that bill and the recently enacted provisions were a more restrictive limit on spin-offs (the revenue gain was estimated at $5.9 billion in the 2014 bill) by applying the spin-off rules to all transactions including existing REITs and imposing a tax on gain for conversions from regular corporate to REIT status. The 2014 bill also had provisions aimed at restricting nontraditional assets in qualifying for REIT status by disallowing any asset with a life of less than 27.5 years. Billboards, for example, have a life of 20 years and would have been no longer eligible to be treated as real estate qualifying for REIT status. This change was estimated, assuming the spin-off and gains provisions were adopted, to raise $0.6 billion. The bill also specifically disallowed timber REITs, with a delay in implementation. One provision that was included in an earlier version of the tax amendments to the appropriations bill and in the 2014 proposal, but not in the final act, was a cap on the amount of rent or interest based on a fixed percentage of income or sales that qualifies as rental income. ", "A major change in how corporations are taxed could also affect REITs indirectly or even lead to proposals for fundamental changes in REIT treatment. For example, a lowering of the corporate tax rate would reduce the relative tax benefit for REITs and even make taxes on REITs with respect to dividends higher than those on ordinary corporations. A reduction in individual tax rates would benefit REITs. The 2014 proposal reduced the top individual rate to 35% and the corporate rate to 25%. A tax-exempt investor would see the tax benefit of a REIT fall from 35% to 25%, and a high-income individual would see the benefit fall from 7.17 percentage points to 4.05 percentage points. ", "Proposals for fundamental changes in the tax law, perhaps as an element of tax reform, could also have consequences for REITs. For example, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch has indicated interest in a corporate tax integration proposal that might allow corporate dividend deductions (and presumably taxation at ordinary rates for dividends), a treatment that would move ordinary corporations closer to the treatment of REITs."], "subsections": []}]}}
