The act permanently extends some legal provisions governing the retransmission of distant network broadcast signals, while repealing others.

(STELA stands for the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act.) Congress had repeatedly reenacted several of these temporary provisions over several decades.", "Copyright Act Provisions", "Generally, copyright owners have exclusive legal rights to license their works. The Copyright Act limits these rights for owners of copyrights to programming carried by retransmitted broadcast television signals. The act provides for statutory licenses that allow cable, telco, and satellite operators to retransmit television broadcast station signals under certain circumstances, even if one or more owners of the copyrights to the programs carried by those signals do not agree. Section 119 of the Copyright Act, which was due to expire at the end of 2019, allows satellite operators to avoid negotiating with copyright holders of programming that they transmit from outside a subscriber's local area and instead pay a royalty fee to the U.S. Copyright Office. The Copyright Office in turn pays the rights holders. The Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 permanently extends Section 119 of the Copyright Act, but limits the types of \"unserved households\" eligible to receive the distant signals. It also requires DIRECTV, a satellite operator, to retransmit local broadcast signals in all 210 U.S. television markets in order to continue using the compulsory copyright license described in this section.", "Communications Act Provisions", "Generally, commercial broadcast television stations may either require cable, telco, and satellite operators to carry their signals within the stations' local markets for no fee or demand that the operators negotiate for the right to retransmit the stations' signals within those markets in exchange for a fee. The Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019 made permanent three provisions of the Communications Act. One of the newly permanent provisions permits a satellite operator to retransmit broadcast station signals outside of the stations' local markets without the consent of those stations, if the satellite operator is retransmitting the signals pursuant to Section 119 of the Copyright Act. A second prohibits broadcast stations from entering into exclusive contracts with cable, satellite, or telco operators.", "The third newly permanent provision of the Communications Act requires all parties to negotiate retransmission consent in \"good faith\" and assigns the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) a mediation role in the event any party accuses another of failing to negotiate in good faith. However, the act specifies that collective negotiation by smaller cable, telco, and/or satellite operators with large station group owners is not a violation of good faith. On the other hand, the Communications Act specifies that joint retransmission consent negotiations by separately owned (as defined by the FCC) broadcasters within the same market is a violation of good faith. In December 2019, the FCC reinstated rules related to the enforcement of its local ownership limits. If a television company that owns a station in a market sells advertising for another station in the same market under an agreement with that station's owner, the FCC attributes ownership of both stations to that company."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The retransmission of television signals to subscribers of cable, telephone company (telco), and satellite services has been governed in part by the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act of 2014 (STELA Reauthorization Act; P.L. 113-200 ).

Thus, station viewership plays a significant role in a station's ability to generate revenue. After hearings in the House of Representatives produced accusations that stations licensed to large cities were pressuring the rating services not to measure audiences of stations licensed to smaller cities, Nielsen began to assign each U.S. county to a unique geographic television market in which Nielsen could measure viewing habits. Nielsen's construct, known as Designated Market Areas (DMAs), has been widely used to define local television markets since the late 1960s. The definitions of DMAs are important in determining which television broadcast signals an MVPD subscriber may watch.", "Nielsen generally assigns each county to one of 210 DMAs based on the predominance of viewing of broadcast television stations in that county. In addition, Nielsen assigns each broadcast television station to a DMA. Nielsen bases each station's DMA on the home county of its FCC community of license.

However, the contracts that broadcast stations have with program suppliers, such as television networks, may limit the stations' ability to consent to the retransmission of their signals outside of their markets. Most television broadcast stations are part of a portfolio owned by broadcast station groups. Most cable systems are part of multiple-system operations owned by corporations. Negotiations over retransmission consent generally occur at the corporate level, rather than between an individual station and a local cable system.", "Greater competition among MVPDs has increased the negotiating advantage of broadcast television stations since 1993, when they first had the right to engage in retransmission consent negotiations. At that time, large MVPDs refused to pay broadcast stations directly for retransmission rights. Instead, several broadcast networks negotiated on behalf of their affiliates for alternative forms of compensation. The networks sought carriage of new cable networks owned by their parent companies, and split the proceeds they received from the cable networks with the affiliates.", "As satellite operators and telcos entered the market in competition with cable operators, broadcast stations could encourage the cable subscribers to switch, and vice versa.

Likewise, two non-top four stations may not jointly negotiate retransmission consent in the same market if common ownership would violate the FCC's eight voices test."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Ownership Rules", "paragraphs": ["The FCC, in measuring the national reach of a broadcast station owner, discounts the number of television households reached within a DMA by a station operating in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band by half. In some instances, a station group may reach 20% or fewer households nationally with the \"UHF discount,\" but more than 20% of U.S. households absent the discount. According to estimates from the research firm BIA Advisory Services, as of May 2019, the two companies falling in this category were NBC Universal and Gray Television. Thus, a qualified MVPD buying group could not negotiate with NBC Universal or Gray Television unless the FCC repeals the UHF discount.", "In some markets, a television company may effectively operate stations under joint sales agreements or shared services agreements without having them count toward the national ownership limit. Thus, depending on how the FCC interprets the good faith provisions, an MVPD with fewer than 500,000 subscribers nationwide might not be able to use a qualified buying group to negotiate for retransmission of stations operated by a company that reaches 20% or more of U.S. households nationwide. ", "It is far less common for a company to operate third-party stations in a market in which it does not own a station than in a market in which it does own a station. There are 93 DMAs in which a third party operates at least one station and owns at least one station. In contrast, there are five DMAs in which a third party operates at least one station but does not own any stations. Nonetheless, as Congress advises the FCC on the implementation of this good faith provision, the role of third-party owners in retransmission consent negotiations remains an issue that may be considered."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
