The legislation, commonly referred to as the naturalization law, also provided an expedited path to citizenship for approximately 200,000 individuals born in the Dominican Republic to parents without legal status. This process required them to register for a foreigners' birth certificate by February 2, 2015, obtain migratory permits, and then be residents for an additional two years before being eligible for naturalization.

Dominican officials also maintain that those who did not get through the naturalization program can still obtain temporary residency followed by a path to citizenship through the regularization plan that runs through June 16, 2015. However, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled in August 2014 that subjecting Dominicans of Haitian descent to submit to the type of regularization process described below would violate their rights to nationality and judicial protection. On that basis, the IACHR ruled that the September 2013 Tribunal decision should be invalidated.

From FY2010 to FY2014, funding provided through the Development Assistance (DA) account to the Dominican Republic declined by more than half, while funding for global health programs (GHP) administered by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) declined less dramatically. Bilateral law enforcement aid has also been phased out as regional funding for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), which is discussed below, has increased.

M\u00e9rida-funded projects in the Dominican Republic supported police professionalization programs, provided logistical support to interdiction units, and trained judicial authorities in implementing the criminal procedure code.", "In FY2010, rather than continuing to receive this assistance through the M\u00e9rida Initiative, the Dominican Republic began to receive assistance through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), a regional security initiative first announced at the April 2009 Summit of the Americas. CBSI is aimed at reducing illicit trafficking in the Caribbean, advancing public safety and security, and promoting social justice. From FY2010 to FY2014, Congress appropriated an estimated $327.0 million for CBSI programs. The Obama Administration asked Congress for $56.5 million in additional CBSI funding in its FY2015 budget request and $53.5 million for the program in FY2016.", "According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), CBSI aid to the Dominican Republic totaled roughly $5.4 million in FY2010, $15.2 million in FY2011, and $11.9 million in FY2012. Total CBSI appropriations to the Dominican Republic for FY2010-FY2012 amounted to some $32.5 million (16% of all CBSI aid appropriated and the second-highest amount allocated to an individual country).

The Dominican Republic has also been designated a jurisdiction of primary concern for money laundering. According to U.S. government estimates, the majority of the roughly 6% of U.S.- and Europe-bound cocaine that transits Hispaniola passes through the Dominican Republic, mostly using maritime routes to transship the drugs. High-profile arrests have laid bare ties between international traffickers and corrupt Dominican operatives and officials. ", "The Dominican Republic cooperates closely with the United States in counterdrug efforts through seizures, joint operations, and extraditions of drug-trafficking suspects (including 31 in 2012). In 2013, the Dominican government improved coordination between police and military units engaged in efforts to combat drug trafficking and money laundering; seizures remained high as a result of those efforts. Port security remains a problem, however, as only one of the country's 16 ports is operating in compliance with U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) standards. Bilateral cooperation is particularly strong with the Drug Enforcement Administration through the vetted Sensitive Intelligence Unit (SIU) and with the U.S. Southern Command, which has provided $1.5 million to build a small Dominican-manned naval base on an island in the southeast of the country for use in interdicting drugs and migrants. Efforts to improve coordination with the Haitian National Police and other Caribbean partners have continued, particularly through the Cooperating Nations Information Exchange System. CBSI funding is helping train Dominican police (1,000 of whom will be trained by Colombians each year) and prosecutors in how to investigate and prosecute cases, create a money-laundering agency, and improve port security. ", "Still, obstacles exist to greater U.S.-Dominican counterdrug and anticrime cooperation. As in previous reports, the State Department's narcotics control strategy report covering 2013 asserted that corruption and impunity continue to adversely affect counterdrug efforts. Despite initiatives to root out corrupt officials, Dominican police and military personnel continue to be arrested for drug-trafficking-related crimes. ", "For its part, the Dominican government has said that it, like many receiving countries in Latin America, is ill-prepared to absorb the volume of deportees with criminal records who are arriving from the United States. In January 2014, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) signed an agreement to expand a Criminal History Information Sharing (CHIS) program, which has been used to share information on certain criminal deportees with Mexican law enforcement officials, to the Dominican Republic and five other countries as well.

From the mid-1980s until 2000, the Dominican Republic benefitted from the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), a unilateral U.S. trade preference program. From 2000 to 2007, the Dominican Republic received expanded trade preferences through the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) of 2000. Both the CBI and CBTPA have been replaced by CAFTA-DR. The Dominican government, along with the governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, signed CAFTA-DR with the United States on August 5, 2004. President Bush signed implementing legislation for the agreement into law on August 2, 2005 ( P.L. 109-53 , 119 Stat. 462). The Dominican Congress ratified the agreement in September 2005 and implemented it on March 1, 2007. Under CAFTA-DR, 100% of U.S. industrial and consumer goods now enter the Dominican Republic duty free, and nearly all U.S. agricultural exports are to enter duty free by 2020.", "As a result of CAFTA-DR, the Dominican Republic has enacted a number of reforms to improve its tax structure, strengthen intellectual property rights, and facilitate trade flows through the country (customs reform). Perhaps partially as a result of these efforts, foreign investment to the Dominican Republic has steadily increased since 2009. The country is now a leader in manufacturing and Foreign Direct Investment, matched in the region only by Costa Rica. ", "The United States remains the Dominican Republic's main trading partner, with two-way trade totaling nearly $12.5 billion in 2014. Dominican imports from the United States are up 49% from 2006 (pre-CAFTA) levels. A significant percentage of that increase is due to increasing oil imports, but declining tariffs have also favored U.S. manufacturing and agricultural producers. Dominican exports to the United States are shifting, as apparel exports to the United States decline (from 55% of U.S.-Dominican trade in 2000 to 16.5% in 2014) and more technology-intensive exports and mining exports increase. High-tech exports to the United States include medical instruments and other electrical machinery goods. The Dominican Republic still exports agricultural goods, such as sugar and tobacco, but those exports as a percentage of overall trade are declining. Even though Dominican exports to the United States have diversified, they are valued at less than they were a decade ago, since other sectors have not yet made up for declines in Dominican apparel exports. ", "More recently, the Dominican Republic and other Central American and Caribbean countries have become increasingly concerned about the potential impact of the 12-country Trans Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) on their textile and apparel industries. All things considered, tariff preferences provided through CAFTA-DR appear to be important in keeping apparel producers in those countries competitive in the U.S. market. A TPP agreement, if one is reached, has the potential to upset this situation. If apparel produced in Asian TPP countries gains duty-free access to the U.S. market, it could displace apparel manufactured with U.S. fabric in the Dominican Republic and Central America, adversely affecting the textile and apparel industries in those countries and in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agriculture and Labor Issues", "paragraphs": ["In addition to influencing Dominican trade and economic policies, the labor chapter (Chapter 16) of CAFTA-DR seeks to ensure that there is increasing respect for internationally recognized labor standards in the Dominican Republic.

Pursuant to Section 403(a) of the CAFTA-DR implementing legislation ( P.L. 109-53 ), the Department of Labor (DOL) has produced two reports to Congress on progress in implementing the labor chapter of the agreement and the results of U.S.-funded labor capacity building efforts.

However, a September 2013 DOL report, issued pursuant to a CAFTA-DR complaint submitted in 2011 (discussed in greater detail below), raised significant concerns about the manner in which labor inspections are conducted, particularly in the sugar sector.\u00a0Sugar, baked goods, coffee, rice, and tomatoes have been included on the DOL's International Labor Affairs Bureau's 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child or Forced Labor.", "The labor chapter of CAFTA-DR also includes a process by which individuals or groups can submit complaints (\"submissions\") presenting evidence that a signatory country is not complying with the labor provisions of the agreement. In December 2011, DOL's Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA) received a submission alleging that the Dominican Republic had violated the labor chapter of CAFTA-DR by allowing labor abuses\u2014including forced and child labor\u2014to persist in the country's sugarcane plantations. A majority of the workers on the plantations are Haitians or Dominicans of Haitian descent, many of whom lack identity documents. The Dominican sugar industry and the Dominican government rejected those allegations, presented evidence to the contrary, and have since questioned the transparency and fairness by which DOL accepted the 2011 submission.

It includes concerns about whether the sugar sector is respecting Dominican labor law on freedom of association, the right to organize, and collective bargaining.\u00a0 The report also identifies shortcomings in the inspection process that may undermine the government's capacity to identify labor violations.\u00a0Those include inspectors interviewing no workers or only a small number of workers during inspections, communicating in Spanish with Creole-speaking workers, and questioning workers in front of their supervisors.\u00a0 ", "The report included 11 recommendations for the Dominican government. In a follow-up report issued in October 2014, DOL asserted that the Dominican government had \"not provided any specific or verifiable information that it has taken the measures discussed in March [2014] or any other measures that would address the concerns raised in the report.\" \u00a0 DOL is continuing to seek to engage with the Dominican government and the sugar industry as part of its efforts to encourage and support efforts to address the concerns identified in the report.\u00a0 If the Dominican Republic does not achieve acceptable progress in addressing these concerns, the United States may initiate formal dispute settlement procedures that could ultimately result in limited monetary penalties and, as a last recourse, suspension of FTA benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Rights", "paragraphs": ["According to the State Department, one of the most serious human rights problems prevalent in the Dominican Republic even before the September 2013 Tribunal ruling (addressed earlier) was \"discrimination against Haitian migrants and their descendants, including the retroactive application of immigration policy resulting in de jure and de facto statelessness for persons who have lived in the country for generations.\" Other human rights abuses cited by the State Department in recent human rights reports have included violence against women (domestic abuse, rape, and femicide); abuses by police and other justice sector authorities; and trafficking in persons (TIP). While progress has been made in some areas (creating model prisons and prosecuting human trafficking cases), setbacks have occurred in others, including the treatment of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent.

On December 18, 2013, a State Department spokesperson stated that the Obama Administration had \"deep concern\" about the ruling's impact on the status of people of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic. On March 7, 2014, senior Administration officials stated that \"the United States has engaged with the Dominican Republic [on the issue of the ruling and] \u2026 are hopeful that there will be a conclusion to this matter through legislation that will address those most affected.\" As previously mentioned, Vice President Biden praised President Medina for passing a naturalization law to help improve the condition of Haitians and their descendants born in the Dominican Republic but said that \"implementation [of that law] will be equally as important.\"", "Without proper identity documents, individuals living in the Dominican Republic can receive basic healthcare and education, but often encounter difficulty traveling; cannot register to vote; and have only limited access to formal sector jobs, property ownership, and secondary education. According to the State Department, police abuses are most often committed against \"undocumented Haitian migrants in poor urban areas as well as along the country's border with Haiti.\" As expressed in other U.S. government reports, undocumented Haitians are at a high risk of trafficking in persons and labor abuses as well.", "Violence against women is another major human rights problem identified by the State Department human rights report and international human rights organizations as pervasive in the Dominican Republic. Despite laws criminalizing rape and domestic violence, both abuses continue to commonly occur but were rarely reported or punished. From January through November 2013, Dominican authorities received some 60,000 gender-based violence complaints. According to the National Police, more than 1,117 Dominican women died as a result of gender-based violence between January 2008 and October 2013, few of whom had ever filed a complaint against an aggressor with Dominican authorities. In response, the Attorney General's office has set up satellite offices with special services for victims of domestic violence, the police have created a female-led unit to respond to emergency calls, and the government opened two shelters.", "The Dominican Republic is also a source, transit, and destination country for trafficking in persons. According to the U.N. Population Fund, tens of thousands of Dominican women have been trafficked around the world. Domestically, women have been trafficked into prostitution and the broader sex industry. Dominican children are also vulnerable to sex trafficking, particularly in tourist areas; forced begging; domestic servitude; and forced labor in agriculture. Labor trafficking has become evident in the construction, service, and agricultural sectors, with people of Haitian descent at a high risk of being victimized.", "In June 2014, the State Department issued its 13 th annual, congressionally mandated report on trafficking in persons (TIP). In addition to outlining major trends and ongoing challenges in combating TIP, the report categorizes countries into four \"tiers\" according to the government's efforts to combat trafficking. The report classified the Dominican Republic as a Tier 2 country. According to the report, the Dominican Republic maintained a Tier 2 ranking as a result of progress made in prosecuting sex and labor trafficking cases and in providing temporary immigration permits for foreign victims. A lack of assistance and shelters for victims, a failure to punish public officials complicit in trafficking, and difficulty identifying TIP victims are areas that the State Department identifies as needing further improvement.", "In recent years, reforms of police tactics and increased punishments of officers accused of misconduct have led to a general decline in extrajudicial killings carried out by security forces. Police reportedly killed 117 people from January to September 2013 (on track to be down from the 194 people killed in 2012 and 233 killed in 2011). It remains to be seen whether the Medina government's decision to deploy 4,000 military officers to support police-led public security efforts will lead to increased abuses.

Prison conditions in general range from \"fair to extremely harsh\"; the 17 newer correctional and rehabilitation centers (CRCs) that the government has opened in recent years are \"slightly better\" than the traditional prisons. The government continued to implement its new criminal procedures code, which only allows suspects to be held for 48 hours without being formally charged, but pretrial detentions averaging three to six months are common for suspects who have been charged with a crime.

If the Medina Administration is able to address the nationality issue while also addressing poverty, energy shortages, and corruption, then the PLD should have a good chance of securing another presidential term in May 2016. Medina is barred from seeking consecutive reelection but could decide to run again in 2020.
