Responsibility for overseeing the design, construction, and maintenance of such works was delegated to the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the GSA, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA).

For example, the Air Force Memorial was authorized by Congress for placement on land owned and administered by either NPS or GSA in the District of Columbia.
