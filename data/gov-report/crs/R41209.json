However, they could potentially form the basis for more substantive distinctions because the category of functions that are themselves nearly inherently governmental is arguably narrower than the category of functions associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions. For example, serving as an interpreter during an interrogation of an enemy prisoner of war could potentially constitute a function approaching inherently governmental. It is less clear that transcribing a recording of that interrogation approaches being inherently governmental. However, transcription could potentially be a function closely associated with the performance of an inherently governmental function.

The actual definitions contained in these sources arguably differ only slightly (e.g., the FAIR Act speaks of \"functions\" whose relationship to the public interest is such as to \"require performance by Federal Government employees,\" while OMB Circular A-76 speaks of \"activities\" whose relationship to the public interest is such as to \"mandate performance by government personnel\"). However, the explication accompanying these definitions diverges to a greater degree, with OMB Circular A-76 speaking of activities that involve the exercise of \"substantial discretion,\" while other sources speak only of the exercise of discretion. Additionally, one of the two tests for identifying inherently governmental functions in the proposed policy letter introduces a new term, \"sovereign,\" that does not appear in the FAIR Act's definition or discussion of inherently governmental functions. While the concept of sovereignty is arguably implicit in the FAIR Act's listing of the types of functions included within the definition of \"inherently governmental function\" and in the case law regarding inherently governmental functions, the FAIR Act's discussion of inherently governmental functions arguably focuses more upon the exercise of discretion, which is the focus of the second of the proposed policy letter's tests for identifying inherently governmental functions. ", "Additionally, the proposed policy letter does not explain how its requirements would relate to existing requirements under OMB Circular A-76. Assuming the proposed policy letter is implemented and OMB Circular A-76 is not amended, agency personnel would apparently be required to determine which agency functions are inherently governmental for purposes of two different processes. Under the policy letter, agency personnel would be required to ensure, on a contract-by-contract basis, that inherently governmental functions are not performed by contractors. That is, agency personnel would have to make a determination prior to issuing a solicitation for a particular procurement. Separately, and in accordance with Circular A-76, each agency would continue to compile, and submit to OMB by June 30 each year, a list of its inherently governmental functions. Potentially significant differences between the proposed policy letter and Circular A-76 involve, at a minimum, the level of detail (i.e., a solicitation or contract versus an agency function or work center) and the definition of \"inherently governmental,\" including related guidance. The existence of two related, yet somewhat disparate, procedures (and guidance) for identifying inherently governmental work raises several questions. Could the two processes result in different outcomes, or designations, for the same function?

Within the National Capital Region, FPS contracts with 54 private security guard companies to provide approximately 5,700 guards to protect 125 federal facilities. FPS issues task orders to contract security guard services that detail the terms and conditions under which the contract security guard services are to be provided. Some of these task orders include the identification of buildings requiring protection, specific guard post locations, and the hours and days of the week each post is to be staffed; whether security guards are to be armed; and the number of guards at each post. FPS currently employs approximately 15,000 contract security guards across the nation, and, according to the Department of Homeland Security inspector general, contract guard services \"represent the single largest item in the FPS operating budget, with an estimated FY2006 budget of $487 million.\" ", "Some Members of Congress have shown recent interest in the FPS's use of contract security guards, including a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on April 14, 2010, on the \"Federal Protective Service: Would Federalization of Guards Improve Security at Critical Facilities?\" Specifically, the Committee discussed the possibility of federalizing portions of the FPS's contract security guard force to ensure federal building security.

Generally, analysts, industry officials, and Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of State officials agree that the current draft of the policy letter probably would not substantially alter the DOD's use of private security contractors during contingency operations, including current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. ", "DOD has already performed an initial agency analysis to determine whether the use of PSCs in Iraq and Afghanistan should be considered inherently governmental, much as it would be required to do under the proposed policy letter. On January 10, 2006, DOD's Office of General Counsel issued an opinion permitting the use of contractors to protect U.S. personnel and property. The opinion does not directly address whether PSCs perform inherently governmental functions, but does state that \"when using contractors for security services, the purpose must be to provide such services other than uniquely military functions.\" The opinion goes on to state that it would be inappropriate to use armed security contractors in \"situations where the likelihood of direct participation in hostilities is high. For example, they should not be employed in quick-reaction force missions, local patrolling, or military convoy security operations where the likelihood of hostile contact is high.\" In a DOD instruction issued in July 2009, DOD addressed the issue more directly, stating that \"[c]ontractors performing private security functions are not authorized to perform inherently governmental functions. In this regard, they are limited to a defensive response to hostile acts or demonstrated hostile intent.\" ", "The post-award requirements under the proposed policy letter would include the responsibility of \"review[ing], on an ongoing basis, the functions being performed by \u2026 contractors, paying particular attention to the way in which contractors are performing, and agency personnel are managing, contracts involving functions that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions or contractors for professional and technical services.\" As discussed earlier in this report, the notice for the proposed policy letter requests public comment on a possible test that would require agencies to consider functions inherently governmental \"where serious risks could be created by the performance of these functions by those outside the government, because of the difficulty of ensuring sufficient control over such performance.\" Many analysts and government agencies\u2014including the Government Accountability Office, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, and the Commission on Wartime Contracting\u2014have raised questions about DOD and the Department of State's ability to manage armed security contractors effectively. Depending upon the final draft of the letter, some analysts could argue that the use of PSCs has undermined the U.S. mission in Iraq and Afghanistan and that the inability to effectively manage PSCs makes armed security an inherently governmental function. Other analysts could argue that both departments are in line with the draft policy letter; both departments have periodically reviewed their contractor management, have evaluated the performance of their contractors, and have taken steps to improve oversight. For example, the Department of State reportedly did not renew certain armed security contracts with Blackwater and ArmourGroup because of poor performance and the contractors' conduct. Further, on April 12, 2010, DOD issued an instruction that includes a detailed discussion of what is and is not an appropriate use of armed contractors in contingency operations. Analysts could also argue that not using PSCs in Iraq and Afghanistan would deprive DOD and the Department of State of the manpower necessary to successfully perform their mission in Iraq, thereby posing a much greater risk to the overall mission than the risk posed by imperfect contract management. ", "Congress has addressed the issue of what functions should not be performed by PSCs, stating that it is the sense of Congress that security should ordinarily be provided by the Armed Forces in high-threat environments where it could reasonably be expected that deadly force will be initiated by security personnel. In an area of combat operation, Section 832 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 vests sole discretion for determining the appropriateness of using armed contractors with the combatant commander.

This lack of capacity requires the workforce to make tradeoffs during the acquisition lifecycle that may reduce the chance of successful acquisition outcomes.", "Although efforts are under way to bolster the acquisition workforce, the extent of the problem suggests that it is not realistic to expect that the situation will be remedied easily, or in the short term.

For others, the standard by which to judge the government's appropriate degree of reliance on the private sector might be found in an excerpt from the Circular A-76 policy statement, which reads as follows: \"The longstanding policy of the federal government has been to rely on the private sector for needed commercial services.\" However, others might respond that this and similar policy statements are no longer valid, or useful, as the scope and complexity of government activities and procurement have grown. Additionally, they might note that other objectives, policies, or principles have become as important (if not more so) than reliance on contractors. Examples of this type of change may be found in OFPP's proposed policy letter. Yet another approach might be to consider why, or under what circumstances, it could be preferable to use contractors. For example, OFPP notes that \"[c]ontractors can provide expertise, innovation, and cost-effective support to federal agencies for a wide range of services.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}}
