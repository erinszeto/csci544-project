The review led to major changes in U.S. nuclear policy. It found that the Cold Warrelationship with Russia was \"very inappropriate\" and that this nation must be able to deal with newthreats. It planned to retain Cold War-era nuclear weapons, which would suffice for manycontingencies, though at reduced numbers. To complement these weapons so as to improve U.S.ability to deal with new, more dispersed threats in various countries, the Administration sought toexplore additional nuclear capabilities.", "Accordingly, the FY2004 request included four nuclear weapon initiatives: (1) rescinding the ban that Congress imposed in 1993 on R&D on low-yield nuclear weapons; (2) $6 million for theAdvanced Concepts Initiative (ACI) to begin certain studies of weapon-related science andtechnology; (3) $15 million to continue a study of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), inwhich an existing bomb would be converted into a weapon able to penetrate into the ground beforedetonating to improve its ability to destroy buried targets; and (4) $25 million to enable the UnitedStates to conduct a nuclear test within 18 months of a presidential order to test, and for relatedpurposes, as compared with the current 24-36 month time that was set shortly after the end of theCold War. Congress acted on these requests in the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act( P.L. 108-136 ), and acted on the latter three in the FY2004 Energy and Water DevelopmentAppropriations Act ( P.L. 108-137 ). For FY2005, the Administration requests $9.0 million for ACI,$27.6 million for RNEP, and $30.0 million for improving nuclear test readiness.", "These initiatives are controversial. Supporters claim that the first three initiatives would enhance deterrence, thereby reducing the risk of war, and that some weapons that might result fromthe initiatives could enable the United States to destroy key targets in nations that may pose a threat. Critics are concerned that these initiatives would lead to nuclear testing, increase the risk of nuclearproliferation, and make U.S. use of nuclear weapons more likely. Regarding enhanced test readiness,the Administration argues that nuclear testing might be needed, for example, to check fixes toweapon types with defects, and that 24 to 36 months is too long to wait; critics are concerned thatshortening the time to test could signal a U.S. intent to test, and that renewed testing could lead toa renewed interest in testing by other nations.", "This report provides the policy context for the four initiatives. For each, it then presents a description, history, FY2004 legislative actions, the FY2005 request (for all but low-yield R&D),and issues for Congress. It is designed for those who want a detailed introduction to the debate,those seeking arguments and counterarguments, and those looking for answers to specific questions. It will track congressional and executive actions on these initiatives through updates as developmentswarrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Broader Context for the Four Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["During the Cold War, the focus of U.S. nuclear policy was deterring or retaliating in responseto a Soviet nuclear attack. U.S. nuclear forces were designed and sized for that contingency. Othercontingencies in which the United States might have used nuclear weapons were much more remote,and would have required far fewer nuclear weapons, than responding to a Soviet attack. Defenseplanners dealt with them, but as \"lesser included cases\" not requiring new weapons.", "The end of the Cold War led to a reduction of the U.S. nuclear weapons development effort. The first Bush Administration halted nuclear testing except for safety and reliability of the nuclearstockpile, canceled weapons that were under development, and withdrew most U.S. battlefieldnuclear weapons. Numbers of personnel in the nuclear weapons complex -- the facilities managedby the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop, test, manufacture, and maintain nuclear weapons-- dropped sharply. At congressional direction, the United States began a moratorium on nucleartesting in October 1992 that is still in effect and worked to negotiate the Comprehensive Test BanTreaty (CTBT), a ban on all nuclear explosions. Before the moratorium, the United States conductednuclear tests on an ongoing basis; with the end of testing, the Clinton Administration changed thetest readiness posture to 24 to 36 months.", "The George W. Bush Administration came into office with a different stance on nuclear weapons policy, which the September 11 attacks stiffened. It delivered a Nuclear Posture Review(NPR) to Congress in December 2001. (3) Thisclassified study, mandated by legislation, (4) spelledoutthe Administration's views on the role of nuclear weapons. A strategic relationship with Russiabased on the threat of mutual annihilation had become \"very inappropriate,\" (5) according to J.D.Crouch, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, and the threat had becomemore diffuse. The NPR focused on nuclear capabilities deemed needed for various contingenciesrather than mainly to counter the Soviet nuclear threat. That is, the Administration perceived a widerrange of possible uses for nuclear weapons quite different than the U.S.-Soviet nuclear war scenariosthat dominated Cold War strategy. Crouch said, \"The capabilities-based approach argues that theremay be multiple contingencies and new threats that we have to deal with. We're focusing on howwe will fight ... not who or when.\" (6) To support thisapproach, the NPR envisioned a \"new triad\" --strike forces (nuclear and nonnuclear); defenses; and an infrastructure better able to respond tomilitary needs -- tied together by command and control, intelligence, and planning. The goal wasto \"assure allies and friends\" that the United States had \"credible non-nuclear and nuclear responseoptions,\" \"dissuade competitors\" through a \"diverse portfolio of capabilities [that] denies payofffrom competition,\" \"deter aggressors,\" and \"defeat enemies.\" (7)", "The NPR called for retaining the capability to deter or respond to a variety of contingencies, and for retaining Cold War-era nuclear weapons, at lower levels, to do so. With the demise of the SovietUnion and the September 11 attacks, a subset of targets -- terrorist-related facilities, some of whichhad existed for decades -- assumed greater prominence. One example is hardened and deeplyburied facilities. Rogue (and many other) states have built such facilities, which might house leadersand key communications facilities. Another example is facilities -- some deeply buried, others not-- for producing or storing weapons of mass destruction (WMD). ", "The end of the Cold War also led to changed constraints on use of nuclear weapons. In anuclear war with the Soviet Union, assuring the immediate destruction of thousands of targets of allsorts would have been critical to national survival. Reducing fallout and \"collateral damage,\" ordamage to people and things that were not the intended targets, was secondary in importance toachieving required probabilities of damage on targets. Warheads were typically designed to achievethat primary goal. Now, nuclear weapons to hold at risk specific, limited targets in rogue states ina credible manner are judged to need several characteristics:", "They would need to be able to counter threats that rogue states might pose, such as hard and deeply buried facilities or production facilities for WMD. Weapons to attack buriedfacilities would have different characteristics than weapons to defeat chemical and biologicalagents.", "They would be better able to minimize ( not eliminate) collateral damage consistent with military objectives. While this has long been a goal of U.S. nuclear policy, earthpenetration and increased accuracy sharply reduce the yield needed to destroy a target, making itmore feasible to attain that goal.", "They would need to be available readily, if not immediately, because thespecific threat might become known with little warning.", "They could be few in number. While an all-out nuclear attack on the Soviet Union would have struck thousands of targets, the option of an attack on a rogue state might involvea handful of targets.", "According to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), (8) \"The Administrationbelieves the broader range of capabilities of a nuclear stockpile with these weapons will serve as amore credible, and hence more effective, deterrent than the Cold War stockpile we have today. Thismore effective deterrent will make the use of nuclear weapons less likely.\" (9)", "Some critics believe that the only use for nuclear weapons should be to deter and, if necessary, respond to the use of nuclear weapons against the United States. (10) They oppose attempts to developnuclear weapons with lower yield and reduced collateral damage as blurring the distinction betweenconventional and nuclear weapons. Even U.S. use of a low-yield atomic bomb, they assert, wouldresult in a firestorm of protest and worldwide opprobrium.", "Further, they believe that the U.S. nuclear arsenal has long been sufficient against a range of threats. Hardened and deeply buried targets (HDBTs), for example, have existed for decades, yetthe first Bush Administration halted work on nuclear weapons then under development and haltednuclear testing except for safety and reliability, effectively bringing work on new weapon types toa close. Presumably that administration would not have taken these steps had it envisioned a needfor new weapon types.", "The United States needs the active support of the entire international community in the war against terrorism, many observers believe. Assistance may take many forms: providing informationto the CIA on suspicious individuals, safeguarding shipping containers, securing radioactivematerial, or closing bank accounts of suspected terrorists. Other nations will be more likely tocooperate on issues important to the United States, it is argued, if the United States cooperates withother nations on issues important to them. One such issue is nuclear nonproliferation. The UnitedStates pledged in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (Article VI) \"to pursue negotiations in goodfaith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and tonuclear disarmament.\" In addition, as an inducement in securing international support for extendingthe treaty indefinitely, the United States and other nuclear weapon states pledged in 1995 to supportthe CTBT. (11) They made a similar statement atthe 2000 NPT review conference. (12)", "Critics maintain that the Administration's nuclear initiatives are at odds with these pledges. They argue that developing new or modified weapons runs counter to the NPT pledge and that suchweapons will ultimately require nuclear testing to ensure that they work. Reducing the time toconduct a nuclear test supports a future decision to test and, to the critics, implies an intent to test. These positions may harm U.S. security by undermining efforts to make worldwide cooperation onnonproliferation of nuclear and other WMD more effective. Even if some steps might be innocuousby themselves, critics believe that many around the world will see the confluence of them as piecesof a single policy and will infer that the United States is now much more willing to consider usingnuclear weapons. As an example of international concern over the new U.S. policies, the foreignministers of the New Agenda Coalition (Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa,and Sweden) issued a statement that said in part,", "4. The Ministers stressed that each article of the NPT is binding on the respective States parties, at all times and in all circumstances...", "7. The Ministers reiterated their deep concern at emerging approaches to the broader role of nuclear weapons as part of security strategies, includingrationalizations for the use of, and the development of new types of nuclearweapons. (13)", "These positions may undermine U.S. security, critics fear, by spurring nations that might be targets of a U.S. nuclear attack to step up their efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Of the three\"Axis of Evil\" nations, Iraq, the first target of a U.S. attack, did not have nuclear weapons as far asis currently known. Having nuclear weapons to deter the United States may be a consideration forNorth Korea and Iran, both of which apparently have active programs to produce fissile material. North Korea has stated that it has several nuclear weapons; while Iran has declared that its nuclearprogram is for peaceful purposes, few in the United States believe that assertion.", "Even in military terms, critics argue, nuclear use would offer marginal to negative value. Deeply buried targets could be defeated (not necessarily destroyed) with conventional weapons,destruction of entrances and air shafts, or demolition by special forces. The effectiveness oflow-yield nuclear weapons for destroying biological or chemical agents is uncertain, as discussedbelow, and intelligence might be unable to locate targets in underground complexes, as recent effortsto find Iraqi WMD showed, rendering nuclear weapons of any yield of little use. Nations couldcounter earth penetrators by burying facilities more deeply. Even low-yield or earth penetratingweapons would throw a large amount of radioactive debris into the atmosphere. Substitutingradioactive materials for biological or chemical agents may offer little advantage to the localpopulation or U.S. troops."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "R&D on Low-Yield Nuclear Weapons", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Description", "paragraphs": ["A provision in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act barred R&D that could lead to production by the United States of a nuclear weapon of less than 5 kilotons (kt) (14) that had notentered production by November 1993. In its FY2004 legislative proposals, the Administrationasked Congress to rescind this provision on grounds that it undercut U.S. ability both to exploretechnical options that could deter or respond to emerging threats, and to revitalize the nuclearweapons enterprise. This provision is often referred to as the Spratt-Furse provision, after itslegislative authors, Representatives John Spratt, Jr., and Elizabeth Furse, or as the PLYWDprovision, for Precision Low-Yield Weapon Design. The Armed Services Committees consideredthe proposed rescission; the Appropriations Committees did not do so because it involved no money. The FY2004 NDAA, Section 3116, repealed the Spratt-Furse provision but (1) made clear that therepeal did not \"authoriz[e] the testing, acquisition, or deployment of a low-yield nuclear weapon\"and (2) barred the Secretary of Energy from beginning engineering development or subsequentphases of work on a low-yield weapon without specific congressional authorization. With theprovision lifted, there is no parallel request for FY2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Background", "paragraphs": ["Military Utility of 5-kt Weapons. The debate over the Spratt-Furse provision treated 5 kt as critical because that was the threshold in the law. Those who would lift the ban argued that the ban made it difficult to train weapon designers andimpossible to develop essential new weapons; their opponents were concerned that lifting the banwould signal U.S. interest in developing capabilities that would make the use of nuclear weaponsmore likely. Yet the threshold was of only slight relevance to the military or the weapons labsbecause very low yield nuclear weapons have uncertain military utility. Substantial advances wouldbe needed in the understanding of low-yield weapon effects to assess the military utility andcollateral damage of such weapons.", "Military utility derives from nuclear-weapon effects that are prompt and that can be measured with reasonable precision. Damage from the blast wave falls into this category; fallout andsecondary fires (e.g., fuel set afire) do not. For a 500-kt weapon, the blast effects are highlypredictable: almost anything on the Earth's surface over a large, known area will be destroyed. (Forcomparison, the Hiroshima bomb had a yield of 15 kt.) At the other end of the scale, the blast effectsof a 500-pound conventional bomb are strongly influenced by accuracy, height of burst, localfeatures, etc. For example, a hill or building can block or redirect the blast wave. Such factors alsoshape the effects of a low-yield nuclear weapon, and their influence increases as yield decreases. Modeling such factors is more complicated than for high-yield weapons, has been done to a muchlesser extent, and depends more on unknown details such as a building's construction. It may bethat detailed engineering studies and computer models of the prompt effects of existing low-yieldnuclear weapons could provide as much military value as designing new low-yield weapons.", "A 1979 report by the Office of Technology Assessment elaborated on the problem of uncertain weapon effects in discussing a 1-kt terrorist nuclear weapon detonated at ground level in a city:", "the highly built-up urban structure in which the weapon is placed will significantly modify the resulting nuclear environment. This occurs when the lethalrange of effects shrink to such an extent that they are comparable to the size of urban structures. Itis indeed reasonable to expect that the blast effects of a small weapon ... will be severely influencedby nearby structures having comparable dimensions. Preliminary calculations have confirmed this.... In summary, the ranges of nuclear effects from a low-yield explosion in the confined space of anurban environment will differ significantly from large yield effects, but in ways that are very difficultto estimate. (15)", "If the Warsaw Pact had invaded Western Europe during the Cold War, such uncertainties of low-yield weapons would have been immaterial for some missions (an atomic demolition munitioncould destroy a bridge, and an artillery-fired atomic projectile could destroy troop concentrations,more reliably than conventional munitions) and in some situations (as a last resort to keep front-linetroops from being overrun). Now, though, extreme accuracy may enable conventional weapons todestroy small targets, and massive conventional bombing can attack troop concentrations. At thesame time, this same accuracy may give low-yield nuclear weapons new military missions byenabling them to destroy targets that in the past would have required much larger weapons. On theother hand, low-yield weapons face uncertainties that render them of questionable value in goingafter key targets, such as buried facilities for which details of the structure and its overlying earth androck are poorly known. This uncertainty increases as yield drops. For reasons such as these, GeorgeMiller, formerly Associate Director for Defense and Nuclear Technologies at Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratory, observed, \"The vast majority of the 'low yield' concepts that would providesubstantial reductions in collateral damage have yields greater than 5 kt. Concepts in the less than5 kt regime are at an early R&D stage.\" (16)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History Through the FY2003 Budget Cycle", "paragraphs": ["The United States has had many low-yield weapons in the stockpile for decades. (17) In the wakeof the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.S. military became more interested in them for attackingunderground structures. One news report stated that \"[p]enetrating Saddam's hardened bunkersproved to be one of the most daunting tasks that faced the Air Force.\" (18) In late 1991, the Air Forcereportedly asked Los Alamos National Laboratory to study a very low yield warhead that coulddestroy underground bunkers. (19) A 1992 LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory journal stated,\"Several possibilities for new types of weapons are being evaluated for prototype development. These include ... low-yield earth-penetrating warheads for attacking underground command postswith minimum collateral damage...\" (20) DOE begana concept definition study for an AircraftDelivered Precision Low-Yield Weapon in FY1992, which it planned to continue in FY1993 andFY1994. (21)", "At the same time, many in Congress and elsewhere sought to restrain U.S. nuclear weapons development. Legislation mandated a U.S. nuclear testing moratorium, which started in October1992 and continues to the present, and directed the President to provide a plan for achieving amultilateral CTBT by September 30, 1996. (22) Preparations were underway in the U.N. in 1993 tobegin CTBT negotiations in 1994. The NPT review and extension conference, which would decidewhether to extend the treaty indefinitely, was planned for April 1995. Some saw testing, andweapons development that could lead to testing, as unhelpful to these efforts.", "In 1993, the House Armed Services Committee, concerned over efforts by DOE to study low-yield nuclear weapons, included a provision barring R&D on these weapons in its version of theFY1994 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 2401 . The committee's reportstated:", "The committee is aware of recent efforts by the department [of Energy] to perform concept and feasibility studies for designing very low yieldnuclear weapons. The committee opposes these efforts. Very low yield nuclear warheads threatento blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear conflict, and could thus increase the chancesof nuclear weapons use by another nation. In addition, the committee believes that the developmentof very low yield nuclear weapons undermines U.S. efforts to discourage nuclear weaponsdevelopment by other nations, and would undercut U.S. efforts to negotiate an extension of theNon-Proliferation Treaty or a Comprehensive Test Ban. Finally, the utility of very low yield nuclearweapons is questionable given the increasing effectiveness and availability of precision guidedconventional munitions.", "The committee therefore recommends a provision (sec. 3105 (e)) that would direct the Secretary of Energy to discontinue the ongoing concept design workwithin the department's nuclear weapons laboratories and to refrain from any future feasibility,engineering, development, or production work associated with very low yield nuclear weapons. Thecommittee further directs the Secretary to work with the President, and other interested agencies indiscouraging the development of similar weapons in othercountries. (23)", "The conference report summarized the House position, noted that the Senate bill had no similar provision, and stated:", "The Senate recedes with an amendment that would clarify that the prohibition applies to activities that could lead to production of new low-yieldweapons. While the conferees agree that the provision is intended to prohibit research anddevelopment geared toward the production of any low-yield nuclear weapons by the United States,the conferees recognize that there are instances where the Department of Energy may need toconduct research on these types of weapons for other purposes. This would include research, in theinterest of counter-proliferation, on the designs of low-yield weapons as a way to: (1) understandothers' activities, including potential terrorist threats; (2) provide information for export controlactivities; and (3) understand the potential damage that could be inflicted by the use of these typesof weapons. In addition, the conferees agree that nothing in this section would prohibit theDepartment of Energy from performing the research and development necessary for modificationsto existing weapons in order to address safety or reliabilityproblems.", "The conferees direct the Secretary to work with the President and interested agencies in discouraging the development of similar weapons in other countries.

", "(d) DEFINITION- In this section, the term `low-yield nuclear weapon' means a nuclear weapon that has a yield of less than five kilotons.", "Several years later, the Office of Defense Programs asked DOE's General Counsel about the legal meaning of this prohibition. In a memorandum of March 1999, she concluded as follows:", "Section 3136 would appear to prohibit the Department from taking or supporting any action that could result in producing a weapon with a yield of less than5 kilotons, unless one of the following four exemptions applies: (1) the activities are related to aweapon that entered production prior to December , 1993; (2) the activities are supporting designof a testing device; (3) the activities are directed to modifying an existing weapon to address safetyand reliability concerns; or (4) the activities are supporting counterproliferationwork.", "As you can see, the question of legality on any course of action involving low-yield nuclear weapons is highly factdependent.

The provision would expressly authorize the Department ofEnergy (DOE) to conduct any limited research and development that may be necessary to completesuch assessments.", "The committee notes that a recent legal interpretation of existing law raised questions regarding whether DOE could participate in or otherwise supportcertain Department of Defense (DOD) studies and options assessments for defeating hardened anddeeply buried targets. This provision removes any uncertainty and expressly allows DOE to assistthe DOD with a review of these targets and the options for defeating such targets. The committeebelieves that DOE should provide information and all other assistance required to help DOD makeinformed decisions on whether: (1) to proceed with a new method of defeating hardened and deeplyburied targets and; (2) to seek any necessary modifications to existinglaw.", "The committee is concerned that the ability to defeat hardened and deeply buried targets will continue to be a significant challenge for the foreseeablefuture. (26)", "Although the House bill did not include a similar provision, the conference bill, H.R. 4205 , did. Section 1044, \"Report on the defeat of hardened and deeply buriedtargets,\" required the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the Secretary of Energy, to conducta study on this topic, due by July 1, 2001.

(29) It stressed the problem that hardened and deeplyburied targets (HDBTs) posed to the United States:", "Our potential adversary's weapons of mass destruction (WMD), long-range missiles, modern air defenses, most sophisticated command and controlsystems, national leadership in wartime, and a variety of tactical arms are increasingly concealed andprotected by networks of hard and deeply buried facilities. If the United States does not have themeans to defeat these facilities and the threatening assets they protect, adversaries may perceive thatthey have a sanctuary from which to coerce or attack the United States, its allies, or its coalitionpartners with threats much more powerful than in past conflicts. (p.3)", "It discussed the potential problem posed by buried facilities containing chemical or biological weapons (CBW):", "Ordnance employing fragmentation and blast effects will not accomplish this objective [destroying agents within munitions or containers] and may furtherworsen the situation by releasing agents into the atmosphere and surrounding environment. In somesituations, there may be a need for multiple types of payloads to accomplish several objectives. Forexample, in the case of CBW located within a hardened facility, the goals might be in situ neutralization of the agents plus access-denial that prevents adversaries from recovering and usingagents or production equipment not destroyed. This class of problems is the most vexing challengeto defeat of HDBTs. (p. 14)", "While the DOD-DOE report focused on conventional weapons, special operations forces, intelligence, etc., for defeating HDBTs, it also discussed the potential value of nuclear weapons forthis mission, especially low-yield penetrators:", "DoD and DOE have completed initial studies on how existing nuclear weapons can be modified to defeat those HDBTs that cannot be held at risk withconventional high-explosive weapons or current nuclear weapons. (p.4)", "... we also must prepare for those unique and emerging strategic threats that are critical and well protected ... This will require additional investment inintelligence, special weapons, and counter-WMD capabilities, including nuclear weapons. (p. 6)", "Nuclear weapons have a unique ability to destroy bothagent containers and CBW agents. Lethality is optimized if the fireball is proximate to the target. This requires high accuracy; for buried targets, it also may require a penetrating weapon system. Given improved accuracy and the ability to penetrate the material layers overlying a facility, it ispossible to employ a much lower-yield weapon to achieve the needed neutralization. The ability touse a lower yield would reduce weapon-produced collateral effects. The current nuclear weaponsstockpile, while possessing some limited ground penetration capability and lower yield options (notyet certified), was not developed with this mission in mind. (p.19)", "Despite the above, the DOD-DOE report ended by noting, \"DoD has not defined a requirement for a nuclear weapon for WMD Agent Defeat missions.\" (p. 24)", "The FY2002 National Defense Authorization Act, and its predecessor versions in House and Senate, did not address the issue of low-yield nuclear weapons or nuclear earth penetrators.", "As noted, the Administration completed its congressionally-mandated Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) in December 2001. A text purported to consist of leaked excerpts of the NPR surfaced inMarch 2002 and was widely quoted in the press. (30) Among other things, this text stated that,compared to a surface-burst nuclear weapon of a given yield, a nuclear earth penetrator weaponcould destroy many buried facilities with much lower yield and thereby reduce fallout by a factor of10 to 20. (31)", "In action on the FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act, Representative Weldon initially offered an amendment on the House floor that, among other things, would have repealed theSpratt-Furse provision upon presidential certification that another nation conducted a nuclear testfor new or improved nuclear weapons, or that another nation was developing, in undergroundfacilities, WMD that could pose an imminent risk to the United States, or that the repeal \"is in thenational security interest of the United States.\" (32) Before the amendment was debated,Representatives Spratt and Weldon subsequently modified it. While the 1993 provision barred\"research and development which could lead to the production by the United States of a newlow-yield nuclear weapon,\" the modification barred such development but not research, and clarified\"development\" as follows: \"The term 'development' does not include concept definition studies,feasibility studies, or detailed engineering design work.\" (33) The amendment passed, 362-53. TheSenate bill did not have a similar provision and the House provision was dropped in conference.", "A description of the \"phases\" of weapon development is needed to understand the subsequent discussion of legislation on low-yield R&D and the other three nuclear initiatives. The developmentof new nuclear weapons proceeds through a series of defined \"phases.\" DOD and the AtomicEnergy Commission, a predecessor of DOE, entered an agreement on March 21, 1953, defining thesephases as follows: Phase 1, weapon conception; phase 2, program study; phase 2a, design definitionand cost study; phase 3, development engineering; phase 4, production engineering; phase 5, firstproduction; phase 6, quantity production and stockpile; and phase 7, retirement. (34) (Note that phase2 involves some prototype and subsystem testing as well as paper and computer studies.) The keydividing line is between phase 2a (design definition) and phase 3 (full-scale development). In phase2a, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, the two laboratories that design thenuclear explosive components of nuclear weapons, would generate one or more designs each for aparticular warhead; personnel from Sandia National Laboratories, which design nonnuclearcomponents of a warhead, would participate in the two design teams. At the end of phase 2a, oneoption and laboratory would be selected. (No new warhead has been designed since the 1980s.) Inphases 3 and 4, which now would occur concurrently, the phase 2a design would be turned into adetailed design for a producible weapon through computer simulation, nuclear and nonnucleartesting, etc. For alterations and modifications of existing weapons, those in phase 6, the phasestructure above is repeated as the \"X\" in \"phase 6.X,\" though with some different names: phase 6.1,concept assessment; phase 6.2, feasibility study and option down-select; phase 6.2a, design definitionand cost study; phase 3, development engineering; phase 4, production engineering; phase 6.5, firstproduction; and phase 6.6, full-scale production.

The Senate would have rescinded the low-yield R&D provision whilebarring \"engineering development\" or subsequent phases of a low-yield weapon withoutcongressional approval; the House would have retained the low-yield ban while modifying itsubstantially. The Senate bill, as amended, clearly drew the line separating permitted activity andactivity requiring explicit congressional authorization between phase 2a (or 6.2a) and phase 3 (or6.3). The House language appeared to do the same thing, but it was not completely clear that\"develop\" and \"detailed engineering design work\" referred to that same line. It was unclear whetherthere were a difference between the Senate's requirement for \"explicit authorization\" of engineeringdevelopment or beyond and the requirement in Section 3143 of P.L. 107-314 for DOE to include aline-item request for each new or modified nuclear weapon in phase 3 or 6.3 or beyond. A seniorNNSA staff member held that while committee or conference report language would typicallycomment on weapons in phase 3 or 6.3 or beyond, NNSA would view authorization andappropriations of funds for such weapons, typically hundreds of millions of dollars, as constitutingthe \"explicit authorization\" that the Senate's bill required, but that in any event it would be up toCongress to define what form of authorization sufficed.

At the same time, the requirement for an assessment of\"any changes in programs and activities\" needed to achieve U.S. nonproliferation objectives isunclear both in terms of what those objectives are and how broadly the phrase \"any changes\" is tobe interpreted.

Supporters of the ban argue that new weapons would make acquisitionand use of nuclear weapons more likely. Any new weapon would broaden the President's range ofoptions. A President might find options made available by current nuclear weapons to beunacceptable, but a new weapon might offer a tradeoff between costs and benefits that tilts in favorof nuclear use. Critics further believe that the Administration is seeking to lift the ban with theintention of building low-yield weapons. Senator Feinstein asked Secretary of Defense DonaldRumsfeld about it, \"and he said it's just a study .... They did the same thing with the nuclear posturereview: Oh, it's just an intellectual exercise. I don't believe either of those, not one whit, and I thinkthere's a very clear march on to develop these weapons.\" (55) Critics further argue that even researchon low-yield weapons would lead down a slippery slope to testing, production, deployment, and use. Senator Feinstein said, \"The repeal of Spratt-Furse opens the door for America to begin to developnuclear weapons again.\" (56) Senator Biden saidthat many supporters of the ban are concerned because\"we believe very much that if one of these weapons ... is developed, it will ultimately be fielded,\"and that low-yield weapons send a \"dangerous signal ... to other countries, whether intentional or not,that we intend to fight a nuclear war.\" (57) SenatorKennedy said, \"a mini-nuke is still a nuke. ... If webuild it, we will use it. ... it is a one-way street that can lead only to nuclear war.\" (58) Critics preferto stop the momentum in this direction at the earliest opportunity.", "Those who would lift the ban see \"lowering the nuclear threshold\" and a \"slippery slope to nuclear use\" as a misreading of U.S. policy and practice. Congress will decide if a weapon is tomove to phase 3/6.3 through the authorization and appropriations process; approval would be farfrom automatic. The provision repealing Spratt-Furse in the Senate Armed Services Committee'sbill ( S. 1050 , Sec. 3131) stated explicitly, \"Nothing in the repeal ... shall be construedas authorizing the testing, acquisition, or deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons.\" Senator Kylstated, \"this is not an authorization. All we are doing is removing a self-imposed restriction onthinking about this, on doing research.\" (59)", "Further, they note, use of nuclear weapons has always been a presidential decision, and one that Presidents treat as arguably the most weighty decision that they can make. Having more weapons,or low-yield weapons, does not mean that the United States will use them. As Senator Warnerobserved,", "the threshold for using nuclear weapons remains very high indeed. ... the United States had a large number of low-yield nuclear weapons in our inventoryduring the '50s, '60s, and '70s which have now been removed from the inventory. During each ofthese decades there were significant national security challenges to the United States. None of thosechallenges came close to reaching the nuclear threshold ... (60)", "Would low-yield weapons make nuclear proliferation more likely? Those who would retain the ban assert that resuming low-yield R&D couldspur nuclear proliferation. If the world's only superpower requires for its security new types ofnuclear weapons in addition to the ones it already has, then this implies that other nations neednuclear weapons for their security as well. Building weapons that might be used against rogue stateswill not deter these states from building nuclear weapons, it is argued, but will instead lead themto develop such weapons of their own to deter U.S. attack. They maintain that althoughnonproliferation efforts have not been 100 percent successful, they have served as an importantrestraint.", "Resuming low-yield R&D could lead to nuclear testing, critics argue, likely leading to resumed nuclear testing by others. The head of the nuclear directorate of Russia's defense ministry reportedlystated in January 2002, \"if any of the five countries officially possessing nuclear weapons startstesting nuclear munitions again, and we consider our nuclear stockpile to be in a critical state, wetoo will carry out nuclear tests.\" (61) Beyond that,the NPT is the cornerstone of the nuclearnonproliferation regime, which incorporates other agreements, treaties, groups, and arrangementsas well. (62) The NPT faced a key decision in 1995:states party had to decide whether or not to extendthe treaty indefinitely. They decided to do so, but this extension was linked to a set ofnonproliferation objectives, one of which was completing negotiations on a CTBT no later than1996. Accordingly, as Sidney Drell and others argue, \"A decision to resume [nuclear] testing tobuild low-yield nuclear weapons could deal the [nonproliferation] regime a fatal blow ...\" (63)", "Those opposed to the ban reject the argument that studying low-yield weapons would lead to nuclear proliferation. No other nation has such a prohibition, so lifting it would simply move theUnited States to a position of parity in that regard, they assert. Nations will act in their own interestson decisions involving their security or ambitions. The United States signed the CTBT in 1996, yetIndia and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998. These critics question the NPT's utility. NorthKorea and (apparently) Iran made substantial progress on their nuclear programs even while beingparty to that treaty. Nuclear programs in all four nations were underway decades ago, long beforethe U.S. ban on low-yield R&D. The ban's opponents argue that U.S. actions -- especially onsomething as remote as preliminary studies of possible weapons -- will not make other nations morelikely to develop WMD. To the contrary, they believe, U.S. ability to respond to WMD proliferationefforts by rogue states may dissuade them from undertaking such actions in the first place. AsSenator Domenici said, \"to permit [weapons scientists] to work in this area [low-yield weapons] ispart of the deterrent.\" (64)", "The ban's opponents reject the contention that R&D on new weapons will lead to nuclear testing. As C. Paul Robinson, Director of Sandia National Laboratories, said, \"I can categoricallystate that no one is proposing returning to nuclear testing.\" (65) The United States has decades ofexperience with low-yield nuclear weapons, including those with altered radiation outputs, such asthe neutron bomb of the 1970s. Use of existing, tested designs, perhaps with modifications notrequiring testing, would provide high confidence. A better understanding of the effects of low-yieldweapons is crucial for understanding their utility, yet key variables are how a blast wave wouldinteract with structures; computer models and engineering studies would arguably provide theneeded data.", "Would low-yield weapons offer military value? Some supporting the ban argue there is little meaningful use for low-yield weapons. They note astatement by Linton Brooks, at the time Acting Administrator of NNSA: \"we have no requirementto actually develop any new weapons at this time.\" (66) As the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars showed, itis often difficult to know what to target. Al Qaeda presents few if any targets that would be suitablefor nuclear weapons. Another lesson of these wars is that if targets can be located, they can oftenbe defeated with conventional weapons. Deep burial, large tunnel complexes with multiple barriers,deception, etc., might make targets in rogue states difficult to destroy with nuclear weapons even ifthey can be located. Many potential targets are in cities, but detonating a low-yield nuclear weaponin or even near a city could cause much collateral damage. By one estimate, a 5-kiloton weapondetonated near and upwind from Damascus, Syria, at a depth of 30 feet would cause 230,000fatalities and another 280,000 casualties within two years. (67) Use of a low-yield earth penetratoragainst the bunkers thought to house Saddam in Baghdad, a city of nearly 5 million people, couldhave caused casualties on a similar scale.", "The ban's opponents claim that low-yield weapons may offer important military capabilities, such as for destroying biological munitions (discussed under ACI, below) or attacking undergroundbunkers. There is military interest in low-yield weapons. Admiral James Ellis, Commander, U.S.Strategic Command, wrote that \"US Strategic Command is interested in conducting rigorous studiesof all new technologies, and examining the merits of precision, increased penetration, and reducedyields for our nuclear weapons.\" (68) At present,in the view of those who would lift the ban onlow-yield R&D, the ban makes it impossible to assess the value of the capabilities sub-5-kt weaponsmight bring to the stockpile, or how they might be designed for specific missions. The ban, theyassert, imposes broader constraints on nuclear weapons designers as they seek to stay well away fromany activities that could be construed as violating the Spratt-Furse provision. Senator Sessionsconcluded, \"it would be irrational to prohibit research that could inform future decisions as towhether such weapons would enhance the national security of our country.\" (69) Senator Domenicinoted that the ban increases the leadtime to develop a low-yield weapon should the need arise.

A key aspect of the debate over ACI -- and over low-yield weapons andRNEP as well -- is the relationship between deterrence and new weapons. George Miller ofLivermore states:", "Deterrence is a dynamic concept -- it has to continually evolve and be able to respond to changes that our adversaries will make in order to be relevant andeffective. That's what happened in the Cold War. The real question that is being debated is whethernuclear weapons will be allowed to develop in response to the changing world situation. If they areto evolve, modifications to the Cold War arsenal will be required if for no other reason than to limitcollateral damage. If they are not to evolve, the nuclear arsenal will become irrelevant and will dieaway. Standing still is not stable.

For this purpose,existing weapons are more than sufficient and their use is fully credible. In this view, there wouldbe no need for new weapons.", "With the threat of a U.S.-Russian nuclear war very low, the Administration is seeking something from nuclear weapons beyond deterrence. A goal set forth in the Quadrennial DefenseReview is that \"[w]ell targeted strategy and policy can ... dissuade other countries from initiatingfuture military competitions.\" (96) The NuclearPosture Review, amplifying on this point, stated thata \"[d]iverse portfolio of capabilities denies payoff from competition.\" (97) The Administration furtherargues that preemption may be needed to counter threats of WMD, and that the United States mayuse \"all of our options\" in responding to an attack using WMD. While these two statements do not state that the United States would use nuclear weapons preemptively, neither do they rule out suchuse.", "Another goal of the current Administration involves having potential adversaries take certain actions, such as having Iran open its nuclear facilities to inspection, having North Korea verifiablyhalt all work related to nuclear weapons, or (until recently) having Iraq cooperate fully withinspectors. Ideally, these goals would be achieved through diplomatic, economic, or similar means,but if those means do not suffice, preemptive force might be threatened or, as in Iraq, used. Coercion-- the threat to use force against states if they do not take certain actions -- goes beyond deterrence,which threatens to use force against states if they do take certain actions. Coercion works earlier inthe threat chain, with the intention of eliminating (through diplomacy, threat, or force) activities thatcould create threats rather than forestalling the use of existing capabilities, one argument being thatit is hard to know what is needed to deter a rogue state.", "A shift from deterrence to something more, whatever form that may take, could lead to a change in weapons desired to implement the new policy. Conventional or nuclear forces credible fordeterrence might not be credible under the new approach. Would any regime believe a U.S. threatto use nuclear weapons? New nuclear weapons -- especially lower-yield weapons tailored todestroy specific targets -- render such threats more credible, supporters argue.", "ACI's supporters believe that the ability to respond to potential threats, as ACI is intended to do, would promote U.S. security. John Gordon, former NNSA Administrator, said, \"a demonstratedability to design, develop, and produce new warheads, including small builds of special purposeweapons, could be an important element in our overall deterrent posture. Such capabilities couldact to convince an adversary that it could not expect to negate U.S. nuclear forces, for example, byseeking to house vital command and control functions in hard, deeply-buried installations.\" (98) U.S.nuclear weapons able to hold at risk such targets could be used not only for deterrence but also forcoercion and preemption.", "In the view of critics, deterrence and something more come from threat of regime change, and that threat comes from conventional, forces, not nuclear forces. New weapons, in this assessment,might not enhance deterrence even if tailored for specific missions, as ACI might do, because roguestates would see use of new weapons as no more credible than use of current weapons. Critics citea 1992 letter by the first Bush Administration setting forth a presidential decision \"to modify U.S.nuclear testing policy immediately, to impose limits on the number, purpose and yield of our tests. The purpose of all U.S. nuclear tests of our weapons will henceforth be for the safety and reliabilityof our deterrent forces.\" (99) Omitted from thisstatement was weapons development as a purpose fortesting. As developing new weapons typically required testing, critics interpret the statement asindicating that there was no need for new nuclear weapons. If existing weapons were sufficient forU.S. security in 1992, they assert, these same weapons should suffice now. At that time, U.S.nuclear weapons addressed as lesser included cases targets that are of current concern, such as deeplyburied targets and biological weapon storage sites. Additionally, critics oppose the Administration'spolicy of preemption and see concurrent requests for buttressing U.S. nuclear capabilities as adangerous part of it.", "Do ACI programs offer significant military value? There have been several suggestions for new types of nuclear weapons in addition to earth penetratorweapons (EPWs). General Richard Myers, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated, \"In terms ofanthrax, it's said that gamma rays can, you know, destroy the anthrax spores, which is something weneed to look at.\" (100) Kathleen Bailey, formerAssistant Director for Nonproliferation, Arms Controland Disarmament Agency and Robert Barker, former Assistant to the Secretary of Defense forAtomic Energy, suggest several new warheads: \"[w]arheads with suppressed electromagnetic pulsefor more effective missile defense; [r]educed residual radiation warheads for low collateral damage;and [r]obust warheads for longer shelf-life.\" (101) Another possibility would be warheads forintercepting missiles armed with chemical or biological agents. (102) If these ideas are of mutualinterest to DOE and DOD, projects of this sort would appear to fall within the purview of ACI.", "Critics question the value or feasibility of such weapons. Peter Zimmerman, a physicist, consultant to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and formerly science adviser for arms controlat the State Department, writes: \"Reduced residual radiation weapons would be similar to the'neutron' bombs, made in the 1970s, with very low fission yield. For classified reasons they cannotbe readily made today without compromise to higher priority programs. Suppressingelectromagnetic pulse is very difficult because that would require capturing the many high-energyelectrons liberated by a nuclear explosion. Ultra-robust warheads could have been developed andtested decades ago, but weren't, perhaps because the nuclear weapons community feared that thatcould have ended the need to test.\" (103) TheAdministration and Congress appear to have little if anyinterest in nuclear-armed interceptors, as noted earlier.", "In a 1989 report, DOE explained its low interest in more robust warheads. It stated that the nuclear weapon laboratories were studying the feasibility of such warheads, which would havereduced sensitivity to aging, to material properties that might change slightly during remanufacture,to tolerances of manufacture, etc. \"We cannot predict the success of this research program,\" DOEsaid, and noted that \"such warheads would be less operationally efficient than the optimizedwarheads in current use and have some size and weight penalties with attendant cost andperformance penalties to weapon delivery systems.\" (104) Now, though, such penalties are arguably lessimportant than they were during the Cold War -- and ultra-robust warheads accordingly moredesirable -- because the United States plans to reduce the number of warheads carried byoperationally deployed ballistic missiles, (105) and bombers can be loaded with fewer bombs andmissiles, making extra carrying capacity available on these systems.", "Is it technically feasible to use nuclear weapons to destroy stored bioweapon stockpiles? If so, is such use advisable? One concept that ACI mightexplore would be nuclear weapons for destroying chemical or biological warfare agents. ACIsupporters advance it as a main reason for studying new or modified weapons, yet there is much lessunderstanding of this topic than of RNEP. This section deals with attacks on biological warfare(BW) agents because some of them, such as anthrax spores, are more lethal than the most toxicchemical warfare agents on a weight-for-weight basis. It first addresses the technical feasibility ofsuch attacks, drawing heavily on the work of Hans Kruger (106) and Jonathan B. Tucker. (107) Kruger isa physicist and an authority on the effects of nuclear weapons on chemical and biological agents. He led Livermore's weapons effects group from around 1973 to 1999, when he retired, and iscurrently working at Livermore on these issues. Tucker is a Senior Researcher at the Center forNonproliferation Studies, Monterey Institute of International Studies. He has written extensively onBW and was a U.N. biological weapons inspector in Iraq. (108) After considering feasibility, thissection addresses the advisability of such attacks, taking into account political, intelligence, andcollateral-damage issues, and then offers several concluding observations.", "Feasibility. In calculating the effects of nuclear weapons on BW agent, Kruger makes several assumptions about the target. (109) The agent would bestacked in steel barrels or larger containers in various configurations, stored in the open or in atypical warehouse. It would be in the form of a water slurry, (110) for which he used water as asurrogate for the purpose of computer modeling. (111) He stated that \"[b]iological agent is typicallystored in barrels or larger storage containers.\" (112) He further stated that BW agent in a water slurryis a conservative assumption because less radiation would reach the bottom of a stack of barrelsfilled with water slurry than with, e.g., dry anthrax powder. (113)", "While there may be various ways to neutralize BW agent without the cooperation of the country possessing such agent, Kruger argues that using a nuclear weapon to neutralize BW agents requiresapplying a lethal dose of radiation to all parts of the storage site. Nuclear weapons produce variousforms of radiation. X-rays are stopped near the top of the material because they do not have enoughenergy to penetrate further. Gamma rays (electromagnetic radiation of higher energy than x-rays)penetrate more deeply. One study finds gamma rays of limited value: In two cases studied (attackingBW agent in an underground bunker, one case with a nuclear explosion inside the bunker and theother with the explosion in the ground but outside the bunker), \"the amount of bio-agents effectivelyirradiated by this process [gamma rays] will in all likelihood be a small fraction of the total.\" (114) Neutrons are the most effective mechanism. They are more penetrating than gammas. In addition,neutrons generate gamma rays when they strike the target material; gammas generated far down inthe stack of stored agent can penetrate to the bottom of the stack. The key to calculating the effectsof a nuclear weapon on BW agents, then, according to this argument, is the number of neutrons andtheir energy level; a dose of neutrons and gamma rays sufficient to kill BW agent at the bottom ofthe stack would expose the rest of the stack to a much greater dose.", "The fireball of a nuclear explosion would probably incinerate BW agents, but radiation is a more useful kill mechanism from a military point of view because it can be calculated much moreprecisely if one knows the conditions under which the agent is stored. Currently-deployed nuclearweapons, which use a combination of fission and fusion to produce an explosion, must be detonatedclose to the ground -- creating much fallout -- in order to kill BW agents; for a greater height ofburst, the number and energy level of neutrons produced would be insufficient for this task. (115) Nuclear weapons can be made, however, that generate more neutrons. Such a weapon is a reducedblast/enhanced radiation weapon, such as the \"neutron bomb\" of the 1970s. (Neutron bombs werecontroversial and are discussed further below.) For a given yield, these weapons produce an orderof magnitude more neutrons than do standard low-yield nuclear weapons, and the neutrons have ahigher energy level. Kruger calculates that a 10-kt weapon of this type burst at a height of 10 meterswould neutralize BW agents to a radius of about 50 meters, vs. 10 meters for a 10-kt fission weaponat the same height of burst. (116) (For comparison,the Hiroshima bomb had a yield of 15 kt.) He notesseveral consequences of the increased neutron flux:", "a fusion warhead [e.g., a neutron bomb] has a larger sterilization area than a fission warhead of equal yield. Another (to me: significant) consequenceis that I can detonate a fusion warhead at an altitude above the ground (higher than the \"optimum\"altitude) sufficiently high that the fireball does not touch the ground, and still produce a sterilizingdose at the very bottom of the barrel stack over a militarily significant area. Avoiding fireballcontact with the ground eliminates most of the local fallout. This is not feasible for a fissionwarhead. (117)", "If an adversary stored BW agent in an underground bunker, the surrounding earth, steel, and reinforced concrete would significantly attenuate the neutrons from a weapon that burst far enoughfrom the bunker (vertically or horizontally) that the fireball did not enter it. To destroy the agent,an earth penetrator weapon (EPW) would have to place the fireball inside the bunker. The chief killmechanism would be the heat of the fireball, the effectiveness of which would be increased becausethe fireball would (at first) be concentrated within the structure. The delayed radiation resulting fromthe fission debris would expose any remaining agent to a further radiation dose. (118)", "Critics question Kruger's postulated target as optimized for destruction by a nuclear weapon. The next few paragraphs focus on anthrax because it is one of the tougher BW agents to kill and isalso one of the most militarily useful agents.", "Would a nation make anthrax in aqueous form? It is easier to make anthrax as a water-based slurry than a fine powder. According to Tucker, \"It appears that at the time of the1991 Gulf War, Iraq only had the capability to produce wet anthrax. Iraqi BW scientists appear tohave worked during the 1990's to acquire the know-how to produce dry, powdered anthrax, usinga closely related bacterium (the biopesticide Bt) as a model system. If a country had the capabilityto produce dried, powdered anthrax, it would presumably store it in that form because of its muchlonger shelf-life and the fact that dry, powdered anthrax is much easier to disseminate as an aerosolfrom an aircraft sprayer system or a missile warhead.\" An Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)report of 1993 provides further information: \"when anthrax bacteria are incubated under particularconditions, they transform themselves into the rugged spore form, which has a long shelf-life ... Thisspore-forming ability makes anthrax particularly well suited for delivery by missiles or bombs. Thespores are stable when suspended in air, can survive explosive dissemination from a bomb or shell,and ... will live for several days if direct sunlight is avoided.\" (119)", "Would a nation need huge quantities of anthrax? The OTA report states that \"a gram of anthrax [in spore form] theoretically contains some 10 million lethal doses.\" (120) Theability of a single envelope with a small quantity of powdered anthrax to shut down the Capitolcomplex in October 2001 is a case in point. Tucker states, \"A bioterrorist attack in a confined space,such as a subway station, would require a few ounces of dry anthrax. Military applications orstrategic attacks against cities would require much more material, perhaps hundreds of pounds toattack a large city. As a rough rule of thumb, about a kilogram of dry, concentrated anthrax sporeswould be required to infect 50 percent of the people in a square kilometer, assuming efficient aerosoldissemination under optimal conditions. A kilo of dry anthrax is equivalent to a much larger volumeof wet slurry.\"", "Would a nation make and store anthrax long before it intended to use it? According to Tucker, \"A nation would probably not make anthrax far in advance of use unless it hadmastered the technology to produce dry powdered anthrax, which has a shelf life of several years.A wet slurry of anthrax will tend to coagulate after several months, rendering it unusable as aweapon. Thus, a country that possessed only wet-anthrax technology would probably produce theagent shortly before use.\"", "Would a nation store large quantities of anthrax aboveground? Attacking anthrax stored in shallow underground bunkers would require the use of EPWs to explode in thebunker; otherwise, the ground would shield the bunker from neutrons. An EPW would create muchfallout and could cause other problems, as detailed in the section on RNEP, below. Storing anthraxin a bunker at a depth considerably greater than that which EPWs could reach would preventneutrons, heat, and delayed radiation (from radioactive material left by the nuclear explosion) fromreaching the bunker. Tucker states that \"[s]ince anthrax spores are quite rugged and are in a stateof suspended animation, it's reasonable to assume that [ground] shock alone would be unlikely tokill them reliably.\" The statement from the OTA report that anthrax spores can survive explosivedissemination, cited above, supports this point. For further protection from neutrons, an adversarycould shield anthrax with material that reflects neutrons (e.g., beryllium) or that absorbs them (e.g.,polyethylene mixed with boron). Alternatively, dry powdered anthrax could be hidden anywhere insmall lots, in which case its destruction would depend mainly on locating the agent; once that isdone, various types of weapons and tactics might be used to neutralize it.", "Advisability. Critics point to a number of intelligence hurdles. A successful attack would require detailed knowledge of the target, such as storageconfiguration. Knowing the target's precise location would be crucial because of the very shortrange at which even an enhanced radiation weapon would sterilize BW agent. Yet as Tucker notes,\"During the 1991 Gulf War, many suspect BW production and storage facilities were targeted inerror, and several real facilities such as the al-Hakam factory -- which UNSCOM (121) later determinedwas Iraq's largest anthrax production facility -- were totally unknown to U.S. intelligence.\" Itwould be important to know the type of agent because, as Kruger states, \"the neutralizing dose [ofradiation] for different bio agents varies by a couple of factors of two.\" Compensating foruncertainty as to which agent was being attacked by using a weapon able to neutralize the mostradiation-resistant agent could result in using a weapon with a yield several times larger than needed.", "Critics also note political problems with nuclear weapon development and use. An attack that sought to minimize fallout would have to use reduced blast/enhanced radiation weapons. Neutronbombs, which the United States developed in the 1970s, received intense domestic and foreigncriticism as the \"capitalist bomb\" that spared property while killing people. Similar criticism woulddoubtless reemerge if the United States began a program to develop such weapons, especially if theintended targets were perceived to be rogue states in the Third World. The development programcould require nuclear testing, fueling further criticism.", "Critics assert that there are nonnuclear approaches to destroying BW agents. According to one report, the Defense Department is working on nonnuclear weapons for destroying chemical orbiological agents.", "Destroying the actual chemical or biological material [in Iraq] is a task that may fall to agent defeat weapons being developed by the U.S. Navy andLockheed Martin under a program originally dubbed Vulcan Fire and now spearheaded by thesecretive U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The HTI-J-1000, as it is called, would be the fillinside the penetrating warhead used on the massive 2,000-pound GBU-24 laser-guided bomb andBLU-109 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) used to attack undergroundbunkers. (122)", "That report states that the chemical reactions would generate intense heat that would destroy the biological and chemical agents, and would generate other chemicals that would neutralize theseagents. (123)", "Michael Levi, director of the Strategic Studies Project at the Federation of American Scientists, suggested another approach to defeating a hypothetical underground anthrax storage bunker in Iraq:", "U.S. planners may not want to directly attack the bunker. Instead, a watch could be placed on the facility using satellite imagery coupled with armedunmanned aerial vehicles. Anyone or anything attempting to enter or leave the bunker would bedestroyed, making the anthrax inside unusable. (124)", "Kruger rejects the idea of using conventional high explosives to neutralize BW agents for two reasons. First, he calculates that it would take a huge quantity of these explosives, perhaps hundredsof 500-pound bombs, to raise the temperature of the quantity of agent in a typical storage sitesufficiently, assuming the agent was in a water slurry. Similarly, if acid were used instead ofexplosives to kill BW agent, it would take a very large quantity of acid. Second, he argues thatattacking a BW storage site with conventional weapons would cause much more collateral damagethan would an attack with nuclear weapons, even standard low-yield weapons:", "Conventional weapons are likely to only kill a small fraction of the agent while dispersing a significant fraction of the remaining live agent. My pastdispersal calculations for a generic target in a country of current interest have shown collateraldamage areas from dispersed bio agent that were very many orders-of-magnitude larger than thefallout area for the ground burst of a low-yield fission warhead. (125)", "It might be possible to deploy reduced blast/enhanced radiation weapons without testing them, such as by adapting designs made and tested several decades ago. Optimizing these weapons fordefeating specific BW agents, however, could involve changes that would eventually lead totesting. (126)", "An attempt to seal off a facility encounters at least two problems. First, a U.S. attack on a rogue state with no warning would be unlikely. With warning, that state could easily move materials andequipment to other sites before the attack. Indeed, leaders who believed that their nation was at riskfrom a U.S. attack would probably make plans well in advance to do just that. Second, some nations,such as Afghanistan and North Korea, have extensive tunnel networks that might provide undetectedaccess, at a distance, to military facilities connected to such networks.", "Conclusion. It appears that, under certain specific circumstances, a nuclear blast is technically capable of sterilizing BW agents. One example wouldbe a large quantity of agent in aqueous solution stored at or near the Earth's surface, with the locationpinpointed within meters and with accurate intelligence as to the agent present and how it is stored. (The agent would have to be stored long enough that intelligence assets could locate it, but not solong that it would deteriorate significantly.) Another example would be a depot with a ton ofpowdered anthrax, in which case a relatively small amount (as compared with hundreds of barrels)of agent could do immense harm and it would be imperative to minimize the risk of anthraxescaping. Few would suggest, though, that nuclear weapons would automatically be the means offirst choice for attacking BW agent. Nuclear-weapon use entails clear political disadvantages, theeffectiveness of nuclear weapons in particular situations may be uncertain, and nonnuclear meansmay be available. Whatever the case, it appears likely that Congress would examine closely anyrequest to proceed to development engineering or production of nuclear weapons intended to destroyBW agents. Such examination might include the following questions:", "How probable is the military scenario put forth to justify development and acquisition of these weapons?", "How plausible is the scenario? What are its flaws? How broad or narrow are the circumstances under which the scenario exists?", "Would nuclear use be the only option in that scenario, or could nonnuclear means suffice? What is the state of progress on nonnuclear alternatives?", "What are the military and political pros and cons of developing and acquiring these weapons?", "Can ACI help in the fight against nuclear proliferation? According to the FY2003 report of the Foster Panel,", "A second requirement defined in the NPR is for advanced concept exploration. Work must proceed on future concepts and technologies to avoidtechnical surprises, to attract and train future stockpile stewards, and to assess intelligenceinformation on the continuing development and proliferation of WMD and their delivery methods. The Panel emphasizes that it is essential for Congress to be kept apprised of developments in foreignweapons programs and their potential implications for U.S.security. (127)", "ACI could improve U.S. understanding of potential terrorist nuclear weapons, which could improve U.S. ability to interpret fragments of intelligence, to detect evidence of nations or groupsworking to develop nuclear weapons, to detect the transport of such weapons and attempts to bringthem into the United States, and to disable such weapons. It could also help avoid technical surpriseby improving U.S. ability to understand foreign weapon developments. For example, creatingnuclear weapon designs consistent with the Chinese or North Korean weapons program may helpthe United States interpret intelligence clues to gain insight into the pace of the program, itstechnological successes and failures, and warhead characteristics.", "ACI's supporters reject the claim that the program will encourage nuclear proliferation. They argue that nations will decide to go nuclear for reasons far larger than ACI. Even if ACI encouragedproliferation, that would not necessarily mean that the United States should halt the program. It islikely, supporters claim, that North Korea and Iran are pursuing nuclear weapons out of fear of U.S.conventional forces. Does this mean, supporters ask, that the United States should halt militarymodernization and shrink its conventional forces to keep those nations from going nuclear? At thesame time, it is argued, India and Pakistan are pursuing nuclear weapons not because of U.S.conventional or nuclear forces but because of threats that each sees from the other, and that Indiasees from China; these dynamics have nothing to do with ACI.", "ACI's critics maintain that designing new nuclear weapons tailored for use against targets in nonnuclear weapon states would undercut U.S. nuclear nonproliferation efforts by in effect tellingthe world to do what we say, not what we do.", "These critics assert that the program is scarcely needed to improve U.S. ability to understand nuclear weapons developments made by rogue states or terrorists. U.S. nuclear weapons experienceaccumulated over the past six decades provides ample information for interpreting intelligence cluesconnected with the design and fabrication of such weapons. Nor is ACI needed to improve U.S.ability to understand Russian or Chinese nuclear weapons programs. The Stockpile StewardshipProgram has greatly increased U.S. weapons knowledge, arguably placing this nation in a betterposition now to interpret intelligence data on Russian and Chinese nuclear programs than it was adecade ago.", "Another argument is that rogue states want nuclear weapons to deter U.S. nuclear forces. A North Korean statement of August 2003 makes this point:", "The Bush administration openly disclosed its attempt to use nuclear weapons after listing the DPRK as part of 'an axis of evil' and a target of a'preemptive nuclear attack.'", "This prompted us to judge that the Bush administration is going to stifle our system by force and decide to build a strong deterrent force to cope with it. ... Our deterrent force ... is a means for self-defence to protect oursovereignty. (128)", "Thus, it is argued, nuclear weapons designed to threaten key targets in rogue states will only accelerate development of nuclear weapons by those states.", "Does ACI offer unique value for the nuclear weapons enterprise? ACI's proponents believe that the United States must retain weaponsdesign capability because new weapons might be needed in the future, such as to attack specifictargets or to replace current weapons that deteriorate beyond the point of repair. To that end, it isfurther argued, the United States should avoid a situation in which it needs a new weapon yet no oneat the labs has had the experience of designing one.", "Supporters see ACI as complementing the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Maintaining existing weapons involves predicting, detecting, and fixing problems with existing weapons. Designing newweapons, however, arguably involves different skills and thought processes, just as editing differsfrom writing. A designer might be given a target and required warhead characteristics (yield, weight,compatibility with a specific delivery vehicle, etc.) and be tasked to design a warhead that producesthe required military effectiveness while minimizing collateral damage. Experienced weapondesigners from all three labs have stated to NNSA headquarters that the current StockpileStewardship Program (maintenance of the enduring stockpile) is not sufficient to provide the rangeof opportunities necessary to train and mentor the next generation of designers. (129)", "ACI, it is argued, will provide such training. The purportedly leaked NPR stated that ACI \"will provide unique opportunities to train our next generation of weapon designers and engineers.\" (130) LosAlamos Director John Browne stated that ACI", "articulates a strategy for ... transferring nuclear warhead design knowledge, and exercising design skills. This initiative provides an outstanding opportunityfor the nuclear weapons complex to ensure that existing expertise is transferred to a future generationof stockpile stewards, and to extend the front-line weapons lifetimes beyond that of the designerswho designed and tested them. (131)", "ACI will also develop new links between the weapons community and DOD agencies. It is helpful, proponents believe, for some members of the weapons community to have personal contactswith members of the U.S. Strategic Command and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, amongothers, to gain an understanding of what weapons might be of value to DOD, and to give DOD asense of what weapons technologies may be available.", "The harshest critics of nuclear weapons believe that there is no need to keep alive the skills to design new weapons. Current weapons, they argue, are more than sufficient, and their designs havebeen proven. Until nuclear weapons are abolished, these critics would maintain the existingstockpile; in their view, the multibillion-dollar stockpile stewardship program is excessive for thispurpose. This school of thought would reject ACI completely.", "Some critics of ACI see a value in maintaining design skills so as to improve U.S. ability to understand warhead problems that may emerge, to understand how changes made duringrefurbishment may affect weapon performance, and to design replacement weapons should that benecessary. Such skills can be maintained, they would argue, by designing weapons similar to currentones rather than designing new types of weapons. That approach would not require ACI.", "Critics would question training as a justification for ACI. The number of people trained by ACIis very small, and there are already training programs for junior staff. In October 1998, Sandiastarted an Intern Program, a two-year course for new employees on the nuclear weapons programand Sandia's role in it. In October 1996, Los Alamos started the Theoretical Institute forThermonuclear and Nuclear Studies on nuclear weapons design for new personnel in that field. (132)", "Some question whether ACI, as proposed for FY2004, offers a useful plan for maintaining weapon design capabilities. For example, Raymond Jeanloz, Professor of Earth and PlanetaryScience at University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the University of CaliforniaPresident's Council, (133) argues that repackagingan existing bomb with no work on the nuclearexplosive component (RNEP), working on low-yield designs (an area extensively studied in the past,including with underground tests), or other ideas proposed for ACI amount more to reworking oldground than to significantly exercising design activity.

The ban applied onlyto weapons under 5 kt; RNEP, if it proceeds, would be a modification of the B61 bomb or the B83bomb, both of which are available in a number of yields, with the maximum said to be far above 5kt. Further, both have been in the stockpile for many years. Even if they had yields only below 5kt, the ban applied only to weapons that had not entered production by November 30, 1993.

Such structures may be used to protect leadership, biological agentproduction facilities, nuclear weapon storage sites, and other strategic targets. Reports referencesuch facilities in Iraq, North Korea, and Iran. (136) A DOD-DOE report indicates that thousands of suchstructures exist worldwide, many in nations that do not pose a threat to the United States. (137)", "While special operations forces or precision-guided conventional bombs might defeat deeply buried structures by attacking power supplies, ventilation systems, and exits, these structures wouldprobably have backup power supplies, escape tunnels, etc. Accordingly, destruction would be a surermeans of completely eliminating the threat they pose. Facilities at shallow depths, perhaps 10meters, are vulnerable to destruction by conventional munitions that penetrate the ground. Destruction of facilities buried at greater depths may require a nuclear weapon. During the ColdWar, the United States deployed the B53 nuclear bomb, a weapon said to have a yield of somemegatons (thousands of kilotons), for such missions. A weapon of such high yield would create blastand fallout that would destroy surface structures and kill inhabitants out to many miles; in the currentenvironment, a President would be unlikely to order its use against a target in a rogue state so as toavoid killing very large numbers of civilians. As C. Paul Robinson, President of Sandia NationalLaboratories, said, we would be self-deterred from using high-yield weapons. (138)", "At issue, insofar as the nuclear option is concerned, is how to destroy hardened and deeplyburied facilities with lower-yield weapons. Much of the energy of a ground-burst weapon isreflected back into the air. Scientists on both sides of the larger debate agree that a nuclear weaponthat penetrates even a short distance into the ground will transfer much more of its energy intoground shock, which can destroy buried targets. For example, Sandia reports that a 1-megaton(1,000-kiloton) weapon burst on the Earth's surface has about the same effect on buried targets asa 33-kiloton weapon detonated at 5 meters depth. Most of the payoff comes from burying theweapon several meters in the ground, especially for lower-yield weapons; burial beyond severalmeters produces diminishing returns. (139) Figure1 illustrates these points. Robert Nelson reportssimilar data. (140) Thus a lower-yield earthpenetrator weapon (EPW) can have the same effect onburied targets as a much higher-yield surface-burst weapon. This large reduction in yield, in turn,reduces fallout and blast damage. A common misconception is that detonating a weapon a fewmeters underground reduces fallout; in fact, a weapon of specified yield detonated at shallow depthin wet soil will create more fallout than if it were detonated on the surface. The reduction in falloutfrom lower yield, though, can offset the increase in fallout from a shallow subsurface burst. Continuing the example just noted, fallout with a specific intensity (150 rads in 24 hours for anunsheltered person) would, by one calculation, be generated over 2,700 square kilometers by a1-megaton surface-burst weapon, or over 150 square kilometers by a 33-kiloton weapon detonatedat a depth of 5 meters. (141) Figure 2 illustratesthese points (though it assumes individuals would besheltered).", "Lower-yield weapons, even EPWs, may not suffice to destroy all buried targets. StephenYounger, then Associate Laboratory Director for Nuclear Weapons, Los Alamos NationalLaboratory, wrote, \"Some very hard targets require high yield to destroy them. No application ofconventional explosives or even lower-yield nuclear explosives will destroy such targets, whichmight include hardened structures buried beneath hundreds of feet of earth or rock.\" Indeed,\"Superhard targets, such as those found under certain Russian mountains, may not be able to bedefeated reliably by even high-yield nuclear weapons.\" (142) Similarly, Robert Nelson wrote, \"Alow-yield nuclear EPW would still only be able to destroy facilities relatively close to the surface ...Very large yield (>~100 kt) weapons are still required to destroy facilities buried under theequivalent of 100 m of concrete.\" (143)", "Even low-yield EPWs would generate much fallout. For example, photographs of two nuclear tests show the fallout cloud generated by low-yield weapons buried hundreds of feet with theemplacement hole sealed. A test named \"Des Moines,\"a 2.9-kiloton test conducted June 13, 1962,at the Nevada Test Site, was buried in a mountain. Pictures show a huge cloud of radioactive dust,with cars and pickups of spectators rushing away from it. Another test, \"Baneberry,\" with a yieldof 10 kt, was conducted December 18, 1970, in a vertical shaft some 900 feet deep at the NevadaTest Site. (144) The fallout cloud rose about10,000 feet into the air, (145) and was tracked tothe Canadianborder. (146) According to DOE, \"FollowingBaneberry, new containment procedures were adopted toprevent a similar occurrence.\" (147) The minimumdepth of burial for even the smallest test is 600feet. (148) An EPW, in contrast, would be buriedperhaps a few tens of feet and the path by which itpenetrated the earth would not be sealed. Fallout from such weapons would not be contained at all,and standard-yield EPWs under consideration would produce more fallout than low-yield EPWs.", "Improvements in accuracy also permit a reduction in warhead yield for attacking buried targets. Four Los Alamos scientists calculate that a moderately hard structure buried at shallow depth couldbe destroyed by a 15-kiloton weapon with an accuracy of 100 meters, or by a 0.5-kiloton weaponwith an accuracy of 5 meters, with both weapons burst on the surface. Earth penetration furtherreduces the yield needed. The combination of improved accuracy and earth penetration, they argue,sharply reduces the yield required and the collateral damage. (149)", "While the foregoing discussion has focused on technical aspects of nuclear weapon effects, it must be kept in mind that even low-yield earth penetrator weapons could, depending on thecircumstances, kill large numbers of people. The calculation for such a weapon burst nearDamascus, cited above, illustrates this point."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History Through the FY2003 Budget Cycle", "paragraphs": ["Interest in destroying buried targets traces back to the early days of the Cold War when the Soviet Union first built underground command posts and missile silos. Current interest in EPWs foruse against HDBTs traces back to the Persian Gulf War, as is detailed in the earlier section onlow-yield R&D.", "This latter experience led to the development of the current EPW, the B61 mod 11, or B61-11. (B61 is the basic weapon, while the mod number indicates a modification, converting the bomb toa specific purpose, delivery by a particular aircraft, etc.) The modification involved a strong caseand some internal strengthening. Because it entailed only minimal changes to the nuclear explosivepackage, DOE did not conduct nuclear tests of the weapon. (150) DOE converted a small number ofolder B61-7 bombs to B61-11s in the mid- to late 1990s. The B61-11, however, has its limitations. The Nuclear Posture Review stated, according to purportedly leaked excerpts, that the weapon \"hasa very limited ground penetration capability\" and \"cannot survive penetration into many types ofterrain in which hardened underground facilities are located.\" (151)", "The growth in number of buried targets and the weaknesses of the B61-11 led DOD and DOE to study RNEP. According to a U.S. Strategic Command officer,", "Our current arsenal, developed in the Cold War, was not designed to address this growing worldwide threat [of buried targets]. There are facilities todaywhich we either cannot defeat, even with existing nuclear weapons, or must hold at risk using a largenumber of weapons. As a result, both the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy,through the Nuclear Weapons Council, have approved a study of how to effectively counter thisthreat. This study of a Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) will evaluate modifications toexisting nuclear weapons that do not require nuclear testing. (152)", "Linton Brooks, then Acting Administrator of NNSA, provided further details on the study: ", "this study will examine whether or not two existing warheads in the stockpile -- the B61 and the B83 -- can be sufficiently hardened through casemodifications and other work to allow the weapons to survive penetration into various geologiesbefore detonating. This would enhance the Nation's ability to hold hard and deeply buried targetsat risk. (153)", "Thus RNEP would not necessarily be a low-yield weapon. John Gordon, then Director of the National Nuclear Security Administration, stated in 2002 that the emphasis is on \"a more standardyield system called an enhanced penetrator ... There's no design work going on low-yield nuclearweapons.\" (154) The cited advantage of the higheryield is that while EPWs can destroy a number ofburied targets with less yield than a surface-burst weapon, increasing yield increases the radius ofdamage to buried targets, some of which may be too hard, or too deep, to destroy with a low-yieldweapon. In July 2003, NNSA provided further detail on this topic. The ongoing RNEP study willselect one of the two candidate bombs. The study aims to retain all existing capabilities. It is notpart of the study to create new, lower yields. (155)", "NNSA had planned to begin the RNEP study in FY2002 by redirecting $10 million from Directed Stockpile Work Research and Development, a program within stockpile stewardship. (156) As discussed below, however, FY2003 legislation had the effect of delaying this study into FY2003. For FY2003, the Administration requested funds to begin this RNEP study. The planned budget forthe study was $15.0 million a year for FY2003-FY2005, inclusive.

DOE has imposed additional project management requirements that add $2million. The rest of the increase comes from a better definition of the requirements of the study,refinement of cost estimates, and an increase in surety (safety, security, and use control) of theproposed weapon.

(191) As a result, the United States was alwaysprepared to test, although \"18 months was a minimal time to design and prepare most tests.\" (192) AllU.S. tests since 1963 have been held underground, almost all at the Nevada Test Site.", "In October 1992, the United States began a moratorium on nuclear testing that continues to the present. Ambassador Linton Brooks, NNSA Administrator, said in December 2003, \"The policy ofthe United States is that there is not now a need for testing.\" He further stated that he did not see areason to resume testing in the next two or three years. (193)", "During the era of testing, DOE and its predecessors conducted several types of nuclear tests, each with its own goals, schedules, and characteristics. Some are explained here; it is useful tounderstand the differences in order to place test readiness in context.", "Weapons modification and development. New-design warheads ( i.e. those with a new primary or secondary stage, typically required nuclear testing. Most U.S. nuclear testswere for weapons development. In addition, nuclear testing was occasionally used to understand aproblem in a stockpiled warhead, or to check a fix made to correct the problem, or for bothpurposes. (194) To conduct such tests, the labshad to design the test, fabricate a one-of-a-kind testdevice, fabricate the \"diagnostics\" (the elaborate set of instruments needed to gather the data), andemplace and seal the device and diagnostics in a shaft. These tests typically required 18 to 24months, (195) counting from when the test wasplaced on the test calendar until it was conducted. (196) Most tests used standard diagnostics; designing non-standard diagnostics added time. Developinga new warhead typically required several tests; some fixes required one test, others needed several. Most modification and development tests were conducted in vertical shafts in the ground; drillingthem typically took six to eight weeks. (197)", "Effects tests. Other tests examined how a nuclear explosion would affect military equipment, materials, electronics, nuclear warheads, etc., by exposing them to radiationfrom a nuclear explosion. These tests typically used a low-yield nuclear device designed to be areasonably predictable radiation source; in these cases, design and instrumentation of the deviceitself were not at issue. The experiments required elaborate preparation, such as creating a vacuumchamber to test how x-rays would affect satellites. Effects tests typically used horizontal tunnels andexperimental chambers bored into a mountain; excavation of the site for one such test, using threeshifts a day, might take a year. (198) Planning theexcavation, emplacing the experiments, and sealingthe tunnels took added time. Such tests were \"inherently a two to three year process.\" (199) A smallfraction of U.S. tests were of this type.", "Stockpile confidence tests. Beginning in the 1970s, DOE would pull a warhead from the field (e.g., a bomb deployed at a bomber base), modify it minimally as needed to makecertain that its yield would not exceed the 150-kt ceiling of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and tomake it compatible with testing procedures, and test it. The purpose was to assure that weaponsproduced in quantity and then deployed -- as distinct from one-of-a-kind devices built for weaponsdevelopment tests -- had the expected yield and met other basic performance criteria. These teststypically used diagnostics comparable to weapon development tests but less complex than for effectstests. They required less time for preparation than weapon development tests, typically about a year. They were conducted in vertical shafts, a little less than once a year. (200)", "Tests intended as political statements. When the Soviet Union terminated the 1958-1961 nuclear test moratorium in September 1961, the United States responded with a seriesof tests beginning two weeks later, (201) eventhough, by one analysis, \"The United States was notprepared to conduct major experiments!\" (202) All these tests had yields below 20 kt. (203) Suchtestsmight be done in the future to respond to a nuclear test by Russia or China. They would surely useexisting instruments and nuclear devices, and would probably involve experiments planned inadvance to maximize their technical value. NNSA finds that it may be feasible to conduct a test ofthis sort in as little as six months, though that posture would entail added costs compared to an18-month posture, would divert personnel from other tasks, and would require considerable advancepreparation. (204)", "At present, the only nuclear-related tests that NNSA is conducting are \"subcritical experiments\" (SCEs). CRS offers the following definition based on documents and on discussionswith DOE and laboratory staff: \"Subcritical experiments involve chemical high explosives and fissilematerials in configurations and quantities such that no self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reactioncan result. In these experiments, the chemical high explosives are used to generate high pressuresthat are applied to the fissile materials.\" Twenty SCEs were held between July 1997 and September2003. SCEs study the behavior of plutonium. (205) One common purpose is to determine if materialchanges induced by radioactive decay of aged plutonium would degrade weapon performance. Allhave been held in a tunnel complex about 1,000 feet underground at Nevada Test Site. The UnitedStates sees them as consistent with the moratorium because they produce no fission chain reaction. They are also of value for maintaining the test site and exercising test-related skills.", "NNSA plans to conduct three SCEs in FY2004 and two or more in FY2005. (206) One of theFY2004 experiments, named \"Armando,\" and two FY2005 tests, \"Unicorn\" and \"Krakatau,\" willbe more complex than many of the earlier experiments. Unicorn, for example, will be the firstconducted in a vertical shaft dug from the surface. According to NNSA, ", "Initial site preparation for this experiment is underway. This activity, and the means for emplacement of the experimental hardware into the vertical hole,will appear visually similar to those employed in underground nuclear tests conducted prior to the1992 moratorium. ... In addition to providing important information for stockpile stewardship, theUnicorn subcritical experiment will exercise key NTS capabilities not otherwise exercised inexperiments carried out at the U1a complex. (207)", "Some of the smaller, simpler SCEs held at the U1a complex may be replaced by the JointActinide Shock Physics Experimental Research Facility, a gas gun that accelerates a projectile tohigh speed and sends it into a mass of plutonium. (208) As a result, the schedule of subcriticalexperiments for FY2005 and beyond is uncertain. (209)", "In the future, the most probable type of nuclear test (as distinct from SCEs) would be to resolve a defect that emerged in a stockpiled weapon to remedy a safety or reliability problem. Such testswould probably be similar in form to weapon modification or development tests. Regardless ofpurpose, any future tests would be the first done in conjunction with the stockpile stewardshipprogram, which came into existence after the moratorium began. Preparation for testing wouldinvolve three parallel tracks:", "(1): Technical work involving the nuclear explosive. To fix a warhead problem, NNSA would \"assess the problem, develop and implement a solution, and plan and executea test that would provide the precise information needed to certify the 'fix.'\" (210) NNSA estimates thatit would take around 18 months to prepare this type of test. (211) As discussed below, some questionthis estimate. Technical preparation for other types of tests would take different lengths of time. Tests to make a political statement could be done in less than 18 months if the needed supportactivities were in place, and effects tests would take more than 18 months.", "(2): Support activities that can be done in advance to prepare for a generic test, such as conducting analyses of test safety, training personnel who can prepare the diagnosticequipment for a test, updating test-related agreements with federal and state agencies to ensurecompliance with federal regulations, and obtaining or locating heavy equipment needed to preparefor a test. (212)", "(3): Support activities for a specific test, such as designing and building instruments to acquire the needed data, and analyzing the safety of the particular test in itsemplacement site.", "Test readiness involves bringing the generic steps to the point where completing them and support activities for a specific test would take a specified length of time. An NNSA source indicatedthat the need to spend 18 months to complete the first track is what led NNSA to select 18 monthsas the test readiness goal.

The legislation creating the moratorium permitted it to end no sooner than July 1, 1993, but President Clintoncontinued it several times in the next several years. At the same time, he considered the possibilityof a return to testing. His decision in August 1995 to press for a true zero-yield CTBT (as opposedto a treaty permitting nuclear tests of very low yield) was conditioned on several \"safeguards,\"actions that the United States would take consistent with the treaty in order to protect U.S. interestsdespite the loss of testing. Safeguard F was:", "The understanding that if the President of the United States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy ... that a high level ofconfidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type which the two Secretaries considerto be critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation withCongress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard \"supreme nationalinterests\" clause in order to conduct whatever testing might berequired. (214)", "As a result, it was unclear how ready the nuclear weapons laboratories and the Nevada Test Site should be to conduct a nuclear test. Maintaining readiness to conduct a test promptly would increasecost at the test site and the labs, and require personnel to spend time on readiness rather than onongoing tasks. In a November 1993 Presidential Decision Directive, President Clinton decided tomaintain the ability to conduct a nuclear test in 24 to 36 months of a presidential order to test. Thisso-called test readiness posture was first established in FY1996. (215)", "Congress, the Administration, and others have expressed concern over the length of time needed to test. In January 1996, the Senate passed, 87-4, the resolution of ratification of the START IITreaty. The resolution included a number of declarations expressing the sense of the Senate. Declaration 12(E) included the following language: \"The United States is committed to maintainingthe Nevada Test Site at a level in which the United States will be able to resume testing within oneyear following a national decision to do so.\" (216) In its FY2001 report, the Foster panel argued thatthe current posture of 24 to 36 months was \"excessive\" and that the United States should not be ina position where increasing test readiness was viewed as indicating a major problem with the nucleararsenal. It noted some reluctance by NNSA and DOD to increasing test readiness because the testmoratorium seemed unlikely to end, so that funds spent on test readiness would not be available forother projects. It recommended a test readiness posture of 3-12 months, and having devices fornuclear testing available on short notice. (217) The purportedly leaked December 2001 Nuclear PostureReview asserted that \"the current 2-3 year test readiness posture will not be sustainable as more andmore experienced test personnel retire\" and \"the 2-3 year posture may be too long to address anyserious defect that might be discovered.\" (218)", "There was some uncertainty over the state of test readiness. In October 1999, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, in a statement before the Senate Armed Services Committee, maintained,\"We would be able to conduct a nuclear test within 18 months to two years of a decision to do so.\" (219) The next day, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson testified, \"The test site is up and running andready -- while we are capable of fielding a well instrumented test in 18 to 24 months, my scientiststell me we, if pressed, could conduct a simple test in less than one year.\" (220)", "DOD and NNSA conducted several studies between 1999 and 2003 to determine the time needed to conduct a nuclear test and what the optimum posture should be. Based on these studies,", "NNSA concluded that because of a loss of expertise and degradation of some specific capabilities, the U.S. would more likely require about 36 months to test,with less confidence in being able to achieve the 24-month end of the range. Furthermore, as timepasses without further action, the 36-month posture is viewed as increasingly atrisk. (221)", "While NNSA's Nevada Site Office, which manages the Nevada Test Site, received funds in 2001 and 2002 to buttress the 24- to 36-month test readiness posture, NNSA and DOD favoredenhancing test readiness. In 2002, they decided to plan to move to an 18-month posture. TheNuclear Weapons Council endorsed this transition in September 2002, and on March 13, 2003,NNSA provided Congress a notification of intent to make this transition.

As discussed earlier, tests to meet a political needcould be conducted rapidly, while some complex tests, such as effects tests, would probably takelonger than 18 months even with enhanced test readiness.

If it took a minimum of 18 months to prepare a test when the test program was in full swing, they ask, how can the nuclear test program expect toestablish that as a maximum after more than a decade without testing? In the intervening years, testexpertise has eroded through disuse, many people formerly in the test program have shifted to otherareas or have retired or died, fewer new staff have been trained with these skills than have left thetest program, construction crews would have to be found and trained, new diagnostic instrumentswould have to be designed to replace technology from 1992.

Supporters of the four initiatives argue that opponents are reading too much into the initiatives. They are, in thisview, unexceptional elements of a nuclear weapons program, each with its own justification. Supporters argue: lifting the ban on low-yield R&D simply permits scientists to study the full rangeof weapon issues, as is the case for scientists in all other nuclear weapon states; ACI is forearly-stage studies; and RNEP is just a study that at most could lead merely to adding a second typeof earth penetrator weapon to the U.S. inventory. A three-year test readiness posture is much toolong, and testing may be needed for other purposes, such as to check on a fix to a warhead type thatdeveloped a defect. As Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham said,", "We are not planning to resume testing; nor are we improving test readiness in order to develop new nuclear weapons. In fact, we are not planning todevelop any new nuclear weapons at all. Our goal is designed to explore the full range of weaponsconcepts that could offer a credible deterrence and response to new and emerging threats as well asallow us to continue to assess the reliability of our stockpile withouttesting.

They contend: lifting the low-yield ban will enable pursuitof more-usable weapons; and, ACI will present the military with new weapon options. In turn,military requirements for these new weapons will lead to testing, and enhanced test readiness willpermit expedited testing and deployment of these weapons. They view RNEP as redundant, sincethe United States has another nuclear penetrator (the B61-11), conventional penetrators, and othernonnuclear options, but believe RNEP will make nuclear use that much more likely by giving theUnited States yet another nuclear option. From this perspective, these initiatives are consistent withother policy decisions, such as the Administration's policy of preemption, its willingness to use \"allof our options,\" its disregard for negative security assurances, and its refusal to pursue the CTBT. Critics see this policy as extremely insensitive to world opinion at best, and potentially dangerous. ", "Nuclear preemption and use: ambiguities and uncertainties. The Administration's policy statements leave a crucial uncertainty. In September 2002, The National Security Strategy of the United States of America stated, \"Toforestall or prevent ... [attacks with WMD] by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary,act preemptively.\" (243) And in December 2002,the National Strategy to Combat Weapons of MassDestruction stated, \"The United States will continue to make clear that it reserves the right torespond with overwhelming force -- including through resort to all of our options -- to the use ofWMD against the United States, our forces abroad, and friends and allies.\" (244) These two statementsdo not specifically declare that the United States will use nuclear weapons preemptively againstpossible WMD attacks. Nonetheless, critics take them together as a sign that the Administration iscontemplating just such a course. Is the Administration willing to rule out preemptive use of nuclearweapons? It may prefer ambiguity on this issue, whether because it has not reached a decision oras a tactic to extend deterrence. But by removing ambiguity, declaring that it would not use nuclearweapons preemptively, the Administration could reduce fears worldwide about possible nuclear war. At issue for the Administration is deciding whether the benefits of resolving this ambiguity outweighthe costs.", "Will the new weapons deter? The Administration, expressing concern about the terrorist WMD threat, discusses a purpose of new ormodified nuclear weapons as being to counter WMD facilities. The Administration may wish toclarify how the nuclear initiatives -- or any military means, for that matter -- could deter or retaliateagainst a terrorist WMD threat. If the perpetrator is unknown, or is known but has no knownaddress, what targets would be attacked, and would new weapons offer any advantage for suchattacks? Are any assets of sufficient value to terrorists that holding them at risk might deter terroristattacks? If so, would current U.S. nuclear and conventional forces suffice for that purpose? Couldthe United States perhaps deter terrorist use of WMD by threatening to overthrow (usingconventional forces) regimes that support terrorism, or by threatening to destroy (using nuclear orother forces) facilities that these regimes see as critical?", "There is a more fundamental deterrence issue. Deterrence depends on holding at risk assets of great value to the leadership. But while the United States was able to calculate what assets neededto be held at risk to deter the Soviet Union (and vice versa), the United States cannot simply assumethat what deterred the Soviet Union would deter rogue states. The leaders of a nuclear-armed roguestate might calculate that the United States would not use nuclear weapons against them because ofthe risk of international opprobrium, or that U.S. nuclear weapons would not have a decisive effecton the regime because it could hide or bury its own WMD and the facilities of highest value to theleaders. They might be willing to accept the use of several nuclear weapons against their country,especially if they follow the U.S. debates and come to believe that the United States would only usea few low-yield weapons of limited effectiveness.", "Will research lead to testing, acquisition, and use? A key concern of opponents of nuclear testing is the prospect that ACI, RNEP, and low-yieldweapons development could lead to nuclear tests. One could imagine various ways in which theseprograms could lead to tests. Lifting the ban on low-yield R&D, for example, might lead to ACIdeveloping new types of low-yield warheads: earth penetrators, chemical and biological agentneutralizers, warheads with reduced neutron or enhanced gamma radiation output, and warheads withreduced electromagnetic pulse. Future military interest in these warheads would, in this view, leadinexorably to testing.", "Yet there are plausible arguments that testing would not be needed. The B61-11 penetrator was converted from a B61-7 bomb without testing, and the RNEP conversion anticipates converting anexisting B61 or B83 without testing. Those warheads are available in a number of yields; it may bethat a lower-yield option exists that would eliminate the need to develop a new-design EPW. TheAdministration has enough confidence in nonnuclear interceptors to withdraw from the ABM Treatyin order to deploy a system using them. Nuclear weapons tailored to destroy chemical and biologicalagents may not be needed. The ability to destroy these agents is arguably much more dependent onprecise intelligence than on weapon characteristics, some doubt the efficacy of nuclear weapons todestroy such targets, and some doubt that the advantages of avoiding contamination by chemical orbiological agents outweigh the disadvantages of contaminating an area with radiation. Beyond that,whether enhancing nuclear test readiness will lead to testing depends on policy rather than technicaljudgments on future weapons R&D.", "Some critics of the Administration's nuclear initiatives fear that studying nuclear weapon concepts or new weapons will lead to their use, but that result is far from inevitable, supporters reply. Nuclear weapons are an option available to the United States, but so are conventional forces,diplomacy, and economic leverage. The United States has had low-yield nuclear weaponscontinuously since the 1950s, and might have benefitted tactically from using them in the KoreanWar, Cuba, and the Vietnam War. Yet despite these military benefits and options, Presidentsrefrained from using these weapons. It appears, then, that nuclear weapons would only be used asa last resort. On the other hand, any new weapon would provide a President with a wider range ofoptions for nuclear use. A President might find options made available by current nuclear weaponsto be unacceptable, but a new weapon might tilt the tradeoff between costs and benefits in favor ofnuclear use.", "Any new weapon has limits to its military value. The claim that EPWs may be the only way to destroy certain hardened and deeply buried targets doesnot mean that any nuclear EPW will destroy any such target. Rather, nuclear EPWs would make adifference only against some specified range of targets. A bunker hardened to a given level andburied to depth X could be destroyed by a conventional EPW, and buried more deeply at depth Ycould not be destroyed by a nuclear EPW of 5 kilotons yield. Only if the facility is buried betweendepths X and Y would that EPW make a difference. The United States could increase the weapon'syield, permitting it to destroy the bunker at greater depth, but the target nation could counter byincreasing the hardness of the bunker, burying it deeper, or camouflaging its location. Further, theU.S. intelligence may not know details of the geology above the bunker or of the layout of a tunnelcomplex, both of which may greatly affect the weapon's effectiveness. Thus the weapon addsmilitary value over only a specific range of targets."], "subsections": []}]}}
