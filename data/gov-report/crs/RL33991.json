The series noted, among other things, concerns about the processes used to evaluate disability in injured military servicemembers. Both the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) conduct disability evaluations and assign disability ratings to servicemembers or veterans under their respective authorities. An individual's disability rating, from either department, affects the scope of pay and benefits for which he or she is eligible, and the cost to the respective department of providing such benefits.", "There are significant differences between the disability evaluations performed by DOD and VA, as well as civilian disability evaluations conducted by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and workers' compensation programs. Most notably, the DOD disability evaluation is focused on the effect of any disabling condition on the performance of the servicemember's duties in the military, whereas the other three systems evaluate the impact of a disability on gainful employment in the civilian economy.", "During the 110th Congress, legislation was enacted for the care of injured servicemembers.

WRAMC, a Department of Defense (DOD) facility in Washington, DC, is one of several Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) providing medical care to injured servicemembers returning from combat theaters in Afghanistan and Iraq in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).", "Intense media scrutiny followed the Washington Post series. News reports have, in general, observed that medical care provided to returning servicemembers is good or excellent, but noted evidence of problems with infrastructure and cleanliness in both DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. In addition, reported problems have included complex administrative systems, delays and errors in DOD's processing of retirement and other benefits for those servicemembers who separate from the armed forces, the transitioning of eligible servicemembers to veteran status, and VA's processing of veterans' benefits. Reports have also mentioned understaffing and inadequate training of case workers who assist servicemembers and veterans with benefits processing and other aspects of their return to civilian life. Some reports have, however, been problematic in their descriptions of the respective roles of DOD and VA in providing health care and other benefits to injured servicemembers, or in their descriptions of the health care and other benefits systems in the two departments.", "Reports have spotlighted problems faced by some returning injured OEF/OIF servicemembers. However, DOD and VA do not apply their disability evaluations differently to OEF/OIF servicemembers than to other servicemembers and veterans. Also, less than half of each department's disability evaluation caseloads involve OEF/OIF personnel. Nonetheless, the added number of OEF/OIF cases and, in particular, their complexity, do appear to have strained the capacity of the disability evaluation systems in the two departments.", "Some news reports and other sources have asserted that the DOD underrates disability. In both the DOD and VA systems, disability ratings range from zero (least severe) to 100% (most severe), in increments of 10%. Generally, if an injured servicemember has served in the military less than 20 years, a DOD disability rating of 20% or less entitles the servicemember to a single lump-sum severance payment and no additional military benefits, while a rating of 30% or greater may, subject to certain other conditions, make the individual eligible for certain lifelong military benefits such as retirement pay and health insurance for the servicemember and his or her family. Hence, in most cases, a disability rating of 30% or greater yields a more favorable benefits package for the servicemember, and a higher and longer-term cost for the department. For veterans under the VA system, in comparison, a service-connected disability rating of 10% or more provides a monthly disability compensation payment whereas a disability rating of 30% or more provides additional disability compensation for a spouse and dependents. (The amount of monthly disability compensation depends on the disability percentage rating.) In addition, unlike the DOD disability evaluation, VA disability ratings may, over time, be revised as a veteran files a claim (or claims) for changes in disability status related to prior military service.", "This report describes disability evaluation in general, including evaluations used by DOD and VA, as well as civilian evaluations used by the Social Security Administration and by workers' compensation programs.

A brief overview and comparison of the four systems is provided below. More detailed descriptions of the DOD and VA systems are presented later in this report.", "Some have proposed combining or linking different disability evaluation programs to improve outcomes or other problems with program performance. (For example, proposals to consolidate the DOD and VA disability systems, or to have the VA conduct disability evaluations of DOD personnel, are discussed in the \" DOD/VA Disability Evaluation System Pilot \" section of this report.) However, attempts to combine or link existing disability evaluation systems may be difficult and may not be desirable, given the different purposes of each system.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has designated as high-risk the federal disability programs at SSA and VA, which rate disability based on civilian employability.

Prior to release, DOD examines those service-connected physical impairments that rendered the soldier unfit, and provides a disability rating. For soldiers with multiple diagnosed physical impairments, each is potentially ratable, provided that DOD finds each physical impairment to be separately unfitting. DOD and VA use the same rating table, the Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities (often referred to as VASRD or SRD, described in the Text Box below) to determine the disability percentage. This disability percentage is one factor used to determine if the servicemember receives a lump-sum payment upon discharge (based on a rating of 20% or lower), or an annual pension and possibly other lifelong benefits (based on a rating of 30% or higher).", "Once the ratings determination is made and accepted by the servicemember, no further changes to the evaluation, percentage rating, lump-sum payment, or pension are made in the future.

The resulting disability percentage rating (based on the VASRD) determines the level of monthly disability compensation, eligibility for other benefits and also plays a role in determining the veteran's position in the priority system for VA medical care. To receive disability compensation, an individual must be rated at least 10% disabled. In contrast to the DOD system, the veteran can be reevaluated if new or newly recognized medical conditions or illnesses occur and are determined to have been caused or aggravated by military service. A veteran may, upon reevaluation, receive a different percentage ranking than he or she received initially.

State laws specify a percentage of the worker's usual wage (66\u2154%, in most cases) to be paid during periods of work-related total, but not necessarily permanent, disability. In addition, for all work injuries, the employer is responsible for full payment of all necessary medical treatment until the point of \"maximum medical improvement\" is reached. Various forms of cost control (e.g., utilization review) may be used, and disputes can be referred to an administrative proceeding conducted by the state labor department or equivalent agency.", "Medical evaluations for WC may be done by the employee's personal physician or one specified by the insurance carrier, with disputed results again appealable to a state agency. As noted, total disability is compensated by a percentage of lost wages for as long as the disability persists (though with some time limits or reductions in amount at retirement age in some states). The various jurisdictions evaluate partial disability in many different ways, which have been classified by some analysts into three basic models:", "Impairment rating: An assessment is made of the worker's proportionate loss of general physical and/or mental functioning compared to a hypothetical \"whole person.\" Loss of earning capacity: An estimate is made of the maximum level of earnings the worker can attain in his or her present condition compared to his or her previous earnings. This takes into account education, age, state of the local job market and other particulars of the case. Actual wage loss: Post-injury earnings are subtracted from the pre-injury rate of earnings. However, additional criteria are usually applied in order to assure that the loss of earnings is fully caused by the injury.", "Most jurisdictions also make distinctions among types of injury. For example, there may be benefit limitations applied to mental injury versus physical injury, or occupational disease versus traumatic injury. Most states also list specific types of injuries (called \"scheduled\" injuries)\u2014usually loss of body parts or functions such as vision or hearing\u2014and specify a standardized benefit. For example, loss of an arm could be compensated by six years of payment at two-thirds of one's normal wage.", "State governments, insurers and employers generally place a high priority on return to work , whether it is to the original job, a light duty assignment, or with a new employer. This strategy is usually the most cost-effective, and, arguably, preferred by most workers. Accordingly, vocational rehabilitation is included in all WC systems and, indeed, a worker may lose his or her WC payments if not participating in a prescribed rehabilitation program.", "In addition to WC, some employers offer private disability insurance to cover disabilities that may not be caused by work injuries.

If the servicemember needs more specialized care, he or she is evacuated from OEF/OIF conflict theaters and brought to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) in Germany for treatment. Most patients arrive at LRMC 12 to 48 hours after injury. In general, servicemembers remain in Germany for a period of about four to five days. Length of stay at in-theater medical facilities is determined by the stability of the patient and the availability of medical evacuation aircraft.", "After further stabilization at LRMC, seriously injured soldiers are evacuated to the United States.

The PEB's role is to determine whether a soldier can reasonably perform his or her military duties, and if not, to determine the severity of the soldier's physical or mental disability and rate it accordingly. The disability rating determines if the soldier is retained in the service, separated with or without separation pay, permanently retired, or placed on the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL).

However, a veteran making an initial claim for disability compensation some years after discharge, or making a claim for an additional disability some time after an initial disability rating, may encounter more problems in providing the required documentation. For example, a veteran filing a claim for a disability 15 years after service may need to contact, or have the VA contact, several physicians who have treated the veteran for the medical condition over the period (15 years) since the veteran was discharged from the military.

The compensation and pension examination is not a complete examination of all body systems and is not focused on diagnosis and treatment. The focus of the examination is the body system(s) covered by the veteran's claim for disability or pension and is designed to provide information specific to determining a disability rating. The information gathered during the examination is then reviewed by a ratings specialist using the Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD) to determine the disability rating for the veteran. The VA ratings are done in increments of 10%, with a scale of 0% to 100%. The finding is then reviewed by a different rating specialist as a means of confirming the rating. A letter is sent to the veteran explaining the rating and the basis for the rating. The veteran has the right to appeal a rating determination.", "The veteran's disability evaluation is based on the impact of the disability on civilian employability. The VASRD rating can be viewed as a measure of the average impact on civilian employment of the disability. However, the evaluation does not take into account a veteran's current earnings or potential future earnings in determining disability payments. The evaluation may take into account the individual unemployability of a veteran if the veteran claims that he or she cannot work as a result of the disability, or if the disability is of such a nature that there is a presumption of unemployability. The payment levels are established in law based on the disability percentage and whether the veteran has a spouse or dependents. An additional payment can be made, if needed, for aid and attendance.", "Problems have been noted with the veterans disability evaluation process. Because the evaluation is done at the local level, the VA Inspector General has noted that there are unwarranted geographic variations in disability ratings. Also, GAO has recommended that the department do more monitoring with respect to the process, particularly of the regional medical centers reports, to ensure consistency in disability determinations.", "The VA's claims process also has a large number of pending entitlement claims (at the end of 2008, there were 481,751 claims pending for compensation and pension benefits).
