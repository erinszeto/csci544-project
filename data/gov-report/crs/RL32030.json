Because many of the employees that firms sought to bringinto the United States were not intending to stay in the United States and were likely to be transferredabroad in a few years, Congress opted to create a nonimmigrant (i.e., temporary) category for alienswho performed in managerial/executive capacity or who had specialized knowledge. These alienshad to have been employed in that capacity by that firm for at least one year prior to seeking the Lvisa. (2) ", "As part of the Immigration Amendments of 1990, Congress made several changes to the Lvisa category, most notably clarifying that specialized knowledge meant specialized knowledge ofthe firm's product. Congress placed time limits on the L visas, allowing managers and executivesholding L visas to stay for up to seven years and those having specialized product knowledge to stayfor up to five years. Congress also amended the INA to permit aliens with L visas to petition tobecome LPRs, allowing for what is known as \"dual intent\" in immigration policy. (3) In the 1990 Act, Congressfurther added managers and executives to the priority worker (also known as first preference)category of employment-based LPR admissions, facilitating the adjustment of L nonimmigrants toLPR status. (4) ", "The 107th Congress enacted a change to the INA that reduced the length of time an L-1 wouldhave to work for certain multinational firms abroad from one year to six months prior to transferringto a U.S. location.
