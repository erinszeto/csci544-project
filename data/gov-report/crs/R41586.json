Congress delegates rulemaking authority to agencies for a variety of reasons, and in a variety of ways. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148 ) is a particularly noteworthy example of congressional delegation of rulemaking authority to federal agencies. PPACA is a comprehensive overhaul of the health care system that includes such provisions as the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, amendments to Medicare that are intended to reduce its growth, an individual mandate for the purchase of health insurance, and the establishment of insurance exchanges through which individuals and families can receive federal subsidies to help them purchase insurance. A previous CRS report identified more than 40 provisions in PPACA that require or permit the issuance of rules to implement the legislation. ", "The rules that agencies issue pursuant to PPACA are expected to have a major impact on how the legislation is implemented. For example, in an article entitled \"The War Isn't Over\" that was posted on the New England Journal of Medicine's Health Care Reform Center shortly after PPACA was signed into law, Henry J. Aaron and Robert D. Reischauer wrote:", "Making the legislation a success requires not only that it survive but also that it be effectively implemented. Although the bill runs to more than 2000 pages, much remains to be decided. The legislation tasks federal or state officials with writing regulations, making appointments, and giving precise meaning to many terms. Many of these actions will provoke controversy.... Far from having ended, the war to make health care reform an enduring success has just begun. Winning that war will require administrative determination and imagination and as much political resolve as was needed to pass the legislation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mandatory and Discretionary Rulemaking Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The manner in which Congress delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies determines the amount of discretion the agencies have in crafting the rules and, conversely, the amount of control that Congress retains for itself. Some of the more than 40 rulemaking provisions in PPACA are quite specific, stipulating the substance of the rules, whether certain consultative or rulemaking procedures should be used, and deadlines for their issuance or implementation. Other provisions in PPACA permit, but do not require, the agencies to issue certain rules (e.g., stating that the head of an agency \"may issue regulations\" defining certain terms, or \"may by regulation\" establish guidance or requirements for carrying out the legislation). As a result, the agency head has the discretion to decide whether to issue any regulations at all, and if so, what those rules will contain. Still other provisions in PPACA require agencies to establish programs or procedures, but do not specifically mention regulations.", "By December 2010, federal agencies had already issued at least 18 final rules implementing sections of PPACA. Although the legislation specifically required or permitted some of the rules to be published, other rules implemented PPACA provisions that did not specifically mention rulemaking. The use of rulemaking in these cases does not appear to be either improper or unusual; if the requirements in those rules were intended to be binding on the public, rulemaking may have been the agencies' only viable option to implement the related statutory provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Oversight and the Unified Agenda", "paragraphs": ["In his book Building a Legislative-Centered Public Administration , David H. Rosenbloom noted that rulemaking and lawmaking are functionally equivalent (the results of both processes have the force of law), and that when agencies issue rules they, in effect, legislate.

", "In order for Congress to oversee the regulations being issued to implement PPACA, it would help to have an early sense of what rules the agencies are going to issue, and when. The previously mentioned CRS report identifying the provisions in the act that require or permit rulemaking can be useful in this regard. However, the legislation did not indicate when some of the mandatory rules should be issued, some of the rules that the agencies are permitted (but not required) to issue may never be developed, and many of the rules that the agencies have already issued to implement PPACA were not specifically mentioned in the act.

Therefore, it is appropriate for Congress to oversee the rules that agencies issue to ensure that they are consistent with congressional intent and the rulemaking requirements established in various statutes and executive orders. In order for Congress to oversee the rules being issued pursuant to PPACA, it must first know that they are being issued\u2014ideally as early as possible. The Unified Agenda is perhaps the best vehicle to provide that early information, describing not only what rules are expected to be issued, but also providing information regarding their significance and timing. ", "Congress has a range of tools available to oversee the rules that federal agencies are expected to issue to implement PPACA, including oversight hearings and confirmation hearings for the heads of regulatory agencies. Individual members of Congress may also participate in the rulemaking process by, among other things, meeting with agency officials and filing public comments. Congress, committees, and individual members can also request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluate the agencies' rulemaking activities. ", "Another option is the Congressional Review Act (CRA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7801-808), which was enacted in 1996 to establish procedures detailing congressional authority over rulemaking \"without at the same time requiring Congress to become a super regulatory agency.\" The act generally requires federal agencies to submit all of their covered final rules to both houses of Congress and GAO before they can take effect. It also established expedited legislative procedures (primarily in the Senate) by which Congress may disapprove agencies' final rules by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. The definition of a covered rule in the CRA is quite broad, arguably including any type of document (e.g., legislative rules, policy statements, guidance, manuals, and memoranda) that the agency wishes to make binding on the affected public. After these rules are submitted, Congress can use the expedited procedures specified in the CRA to disapprove any of the rules. CRA resolutions of disapproval must be presented to the President for signature or veto.", "For a variety of reasons, however, the CRA has been used to disapprove only one rule in the 14 years since it was enacted. Perhaps most notably, it is likely that a President would veto a resolution of disapproval to protect rules developed under his own administration, and it may be difficult for Congress to muster the two-thirds vote in both houses needed to overturn the veto. Congress can also use regular (i.e., non-CRA) legislative procedures to disapprove agencies' rules, but such legislation may prove even more difficult to enact than a CRA resolution of disapproval (primarily because of the lack of expedited procedures in the Senate), and if enacted may also be vetoed by the President.", "Although the CRA has been used only once to overturn an agency rule, Congress has regularly included provisions in the text of agencies' appropriations bills directing or preventing the development of particular regulations. Such provisions include prohibitions on the finalization of particular proposed rules, restrictions on certain types of regulatory activity, and restrictions on implementation or enforcement of certain provisions. Appropriations provisions can also be used to prompt agencies to issue certain regulations, or to require that certain procedures be followed before or after their issuance. The inclusion of regulatory provisions in appropriations legislation as a matter of legislative strategy appears to arise from two factors: (1) Congress's ability via its \"power of the purse\" to control agency action, and (2) the fact that appropriations bills are considered \"must pass\" legislation. Congress's use of regulatory appropriations restrictions has fluctuated somewhat over time, and previous experience suggests that they may be somewhat less frequent when Congress and the President are of the same party."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
