The House considers and amends legislation in a more structured manner (e.g., by section or title) than the Senate.

Legislation passed by the other body usually receives floor consideration without reference to a committee if there already is a companion bill on a calendar (see discussion of \" Calendars \" in next section).", "The House changed its referral rule (Rule XII, clause 2) at the beginning of the 104 th Congress. This change was aimed at reducing the number of measures referred to more than one committee, commonly called \"multiple referrals.\" The rules change eliminated joint referrals, a type of multiple referral where a measure is simultaneously referred to two or more committees. Under the new rule, the Speaker designates \"a committee of primary jurisdiction\" (based on the committee jurisdictions itemized in Rule X) when referring measures to more than one committee. In practice, two types of multiple referrals can take place if the Speaker first selects a primary committee: a sequential referral (the measure is referred to one committee, then to another, and so on; the Speaker can establish time limits for each committee's consideration); and a split referral (specifically designated portions of a measure are referred to one or more committees). In the 108 th Congress, House rules were changed to allow the Speaker to not designate a primary committee \"under exceptional circumstances.\"", "House committees often develop \"memorandums of understanding\" (sometimes referred to as \"letters of agreement\") which explain an agreement between committees about how to divide jurisdiction over specific policy issues.

Senate Rule XXV lists the subjects for which the standing committees are responsible. Senate Rule XIV requires that measures be read twice on different legislative days (see \" Adjournment and Legislative Days \" section) before being referred to a committee. Most bills and joint resolutions, however, are considered as having been read twice and are referred to committee upon introduction. Under Rule XIV, when a Senator demands two readings and there is objection to the measure's second reading, the measure is placed directly on the Calendar of Business (see next section) without reference to committee.", "Three types of multiple referrals\u2014 joint , sequential and split \u2014are allowed in the Senate. In practice, measures are referred to multiple committees by unanimous consent. Under the Senate's standing rules (Rule XVII, paragraph 3), the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders can make a joint leadership motion to jointly or sequentially refer legislation to multiple committees.
