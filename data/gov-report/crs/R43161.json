{"id": "R43161", "title": "Agricultural Guest Workers: Legislative Activity in the 113th Congress", "released_date": "2013-07-23T00:00:00", "summary": ["Foreign temporary workers, also known as guest workers, have long performed legal agricultural labor in the United States through different temporary worker programs. Today, agricultural guest workers may perform farm work of a temporary or seasonal nature through the H-2A visa program.", "Bringing in H-2A workers is a multi-agency process involving the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the U.S. Department of State (DOS). As a first step, interested employers must apply to DOL for a certification that (1) there are not sufficient U.S. workers who are qualified and available to perform the work; and (2) the employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. Among the H-2A labor certification requirements, employers must pay the highest of several wage rates and must provide workers with housing, transportation, and other benefits. The H-2A program is not subject to a numerical limit. Over the years, both growers and labor advocates have criticized the program. Growers complain that it is administratively cumbersome, expensive, and ineffective in meeting their labor needs. Labor advocates argue that the H-2A program provides too few protections for workers.", "The House Judiciary Committee and the Senate have acted on separate bills that would establish new temporary agricultural worker visas to replace the H-2A visa. The House Judiciary Committee ordered reported the Agricultural Guest Worker Act (H.R. 1773) and the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744). While the new visa programs proposed in these bills are different, they share some similarities that distinguish them from the H-2A program. For example, unlike the H-2A visa, the new visas would not be limited to temporary or seasonal work, would not require prospective employers to apply to DOL for labor certification or to meet all existing certification requirements, and would provide for at-will employment by agricultural workers.", "H.R. 1773 would establish an H-2C agricultural worker visa. After undertaking to recruit U.S. workers, a prospective H-2C employer would file a petition with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) containing attestations concerning U.S. worker recruitment, worker benefits and wages, and other issues. With respect to wages, an employer petitioning for H-2C workers would have to pay the greater of the prevailing wage rate or the applicable minimum wage. The H-2C program would have a numerical cap of 500,000, subject to adjustment by USDA.", "S. 744, a comprehensive immigration reform bill that addresses a wide range of immigration issues, would create a W-3 visa for contract agricultural workers and a W-4 visa for at-will agricultural workers. A prospective W-3 or W-4 employer would have to engage in U.S. worker recruitment. To import a W-3 or W-4 worker, an employer would submit a petition to DHS containing specified attestations, including attestations about contracts, U.S. worker recruitment, and compliance with other employer requirements. Required wages would be defined based on six standard agricultural occupational classifications, with certain wages specified and others to be determined by USDA, in consultation with DOL. W-3 and W-4 visas would be capped initially at 112,333 total visas per year, with provisions for USDA, in consultation with DOL, to adjust these caps and to set visa limits for later years.", "In addition to establishing new agricultural worker visas, both the House and the Senate proposals would enable certain unauthorized aliens to obtain legal temporary or permanent immigration status in the United States."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Foreign temporary workers, also known as guest workers, have a long history of performing agricultural labor in the United States. In the past, agricultural guest worker programs were established in the United States during times of war. During World War I, for example, tens of thousands of Mexican workers performed mainly agricultural labor as part of a temporary worker program. The controversial Bracero program, which began during World War II and lasted until 1964, brought several million Mexican agricultural workers into the United States. Today, the United States imports agricultural guest workers in much smaller numbers as part of a temporary worker program known as the H-2A visa program. ", "The H-2A program, and agricultural guest worker programs more generally, are controversial. Some view them as a necessary source of legal workers and call for their reform and expansion. Others view the H-2A program, in its current form, as exploitative and argue that it must be thoroughly overhauled if it is to be allowed to continue operating. These differing views are reflected in tensions in agricultural and other guest worker programs between providing protections to U.S. and foreign workers on the one hand and making the programs responsive to legitimate employer needs on the other.", "Over the past 15 years, a variety of legislative proposals have been put forward concerning agricultural guest workers. Some proposals would have reformed the H-2A program, while others would have established new guest worker programs for agricultural workers. Some of these proposals have been introduced in Congress as stand-alone bills, while others have been part of larger comprehensive immigration reform measures. In the 113 th Congress, bills that would create new agricultural guest worker programs have been acted on in the House and the Senate.

Nonimmigrant visa categories are identified by letters and numbers, based on the sections of the INA that authorize them. Among the major nonimmigrant visa categories is the \"H\" category for temporary workers. Included in this category is the H-2A visa for temporary agricultural workers. The H-2A visa program is administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DOL's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) also has certain concurrent enforcement responsibilities. The H-2A program currently operates under regulations issued by DHS in 2008 and by DOL in 2010, in addition to the INA provisions.", "The H-2A program allows for the temporary admission of foreign workers to the United States to perform agricultural labor or services of a seasonal or temporary nature, provided that U.S. workers are not available. Under current regulations, participation in the H-2A program is limited to designated countries. In general, for purposes of the H-2A program, work is of a temporary nature where the employer's need for the worker will last no longer than one year. Thus, an approved H-2A visa petition is generally valid for an initial period of up to one year. An employer can apply to extend an H-2A worker's stay in increments of up to one year, but an alien's total period of stay as an H-2A worker may not exceed three consecutive years. An alien who has spent three years in the United States in H-2A status may not seek an extension of stay or be readmitted to the United States as an H-2A worker until he or she has been outside the country for three\u00a0months.", "Bringing workers into the United States under the H-2A program is a multi-agency process involving DOL, DHS, and the Department of State (DOS). An interested employer must first apply to DOL for a certification that (1) there are not sufficient U.S. workers who are qualified and available to perform the work; and (2) the employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers who are similarly employed. Before filing a labor certification application, prospective H-2A employers must attempt to recruit U.S. workers and must cooperate with DOL-funded state employment service agencies (also known as state workforce agencies, or SWAs) in local, intrastate, and interstate recruitment efforts. Under the H-2A program's \"fifty percent rule,\" employers are required to hire any qualified U.S. worker who applies for a position during the first half of the work contract under which the H-2A workers who are in the job are employed.", "As part of the labor certification process, H-2A employers must offer and provide required wages and benefits to H-2A workers and workers in \"corresponding employment,\" which is defined in current regulations as employment of non-H-2A workers by an employer who has an approved H-2A labor certification in any work included in the job order or in any agricultural work performed by the H-2A workers. H-2A employers must pay their workers the highest of several wage rates: the federal or applicable state minimum wage, the prevailing wage rate, the adverse effect wage rate (AEWR), or the agreed-upon collective bargaining wage. They must provide a \"three-fourths guarantee\"; that is, they must guarantee to offer workers employment for at least three-fourths of the contract period. H-2A employers also must provide non-commuting workers with housing at no cost, must provide or pay for certain worker transportation, and must provide other specified benefits, including workers' compensation insurance. The INA does not require H-2A employers to provide health insurance coverage. DOL is authorized under the INA to take such actions as necessary to ensure employer compliance with the terms and conditions of H-2A employment.", "After receiving labor certification, a prospective H-2A employer can submit an application, known as a petition, to DHS to bring in foreign workers. If the petition is approved, foreign workers who are abroad can then go to a U.S. embassy or consulate to apply for an H-2A nonimmigrant visa from the Department of State. If the visa application is approved, the worker is issued a visa that he or she can use to apply for admission to the United States at a port of entry. H-2A workers can be accompanied by eligible spouses and children, who are issued H-4 visas.", "The H-2A program is not subject to a statutory numerical limit and has grown significantly over the last 20 years, although it remains quite small relative to total hired farm employment. One way to measure the H-2A program's growth is to consider changes in the number of H-2A visas issued annually by DOS. In FY1992, DOS issued 6,445 visas. In FY2012, according to preliminary DOS data, 65,345 H-2A visas were issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Activity in the 113th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, both growers and labor advocates have criticized the H-2A program.

", "In the late 1990s, representatives of growers and workers reached agreement on legislation to address the foreign agricultural worker issue. The legislation became known as the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act, or AgJOBS. It combined provisions to reform the H-2A program with provisions to grant lawful permanent resident (LPR) status to eligible farm workers though a two-stage process. AgJOBS legislation became the basis of a bipartisan compromise on foreign agricultural workers in the 106 th Congress, but that compromise fell apart at the end of that Congress after the 2000 election of President George W. Bush. More recently, AgJOBS titles were included in comprehensive immigration reform bills considered in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses.
