The provisions in S. 820 and H.R. 1731 reflect the 2011 agreement between UEP and HSUS to establish uniform, national cage size requirements for table egg-laying hens. The bills would codify national standards for laying-hen housing over a 15- to 16-year phase-in period, including labeling requirements to disclose how eggs are produced, and set air quality, molting, and euthanasia standards for laying hens.", "Compared with the bills from the 112th Congress, S. 820 and H.R. 1731 add provisions specific to California that establish deadlines based on whether or not cages are new or existing, and add a four-step phase-in period for California producers. The legislation also requires that any eggs bought or sold in California meet the California requirements in the legislation, no matter where the eggs are produced.", "The agreement and legislation were a marked shift in direction for both UEP and HSUS. UEP views the legislation as being in the long-term survival interest of American egg farmers. It says that egg producers would benefit from national egg standards that halt costly state-by-state battles over caged eggs that result in a variety of laws across the country. For HSUS, which has actively campaigned for cage-free egg production, accepting enriched cages was a compromise, but one that could result in significant federal farm animal welfare legislation. Egg legislation has been endorsed by a wide range of agricultural, veterinary, consumer, and animal protection groups.", "Farm group opponents have criticized egg legislation for several reasons. First, they are concerned that the bills federally mandate management practices for farm animals, something that has not been done in the past. These groups argue that the bills could set a precedent, paving the way for future legislation on animal welfare for other livestock and poultry industries. Opponents hold the view that the cage requirements are not science-based, and undermine long-standing views that animal husbandry practices should be based on the best available science. They also argue that codifying cage standards today ignores innovations that could appear in the future. Additionally, opponents are concerned that the capital cost of transitioning to enriched cages would be high, and could be prohibitive for small producers.", "UEP and HSUS and other supporters favor moving egg legislation forward through the farm bill process, but other livestock groups strongly oppose this legislative route. Reportedly, S. 820 was considered for inclusion in the Senate Agriculture Committee 2013 farm bill draft, but it was not included. Senator Feinstein's submitted egg bill amendment (S.Amdt. 1057) was not considered during the Senate farm bill (S. 954) floor debate.

This could be a comparative advantage for house expansion in the South as compared to the colder Midwest.

The member estimated that converting his 300,000 laying-hen flock would cost about $8 million-$9 million. In addition, conventional cages have a useful life of 25-30 years, which means that some farms could have to convert when their conventional cages were still useful. Obtaining bank loans when credit is tight could be difficult, especially if there was still a useful life for a farmer's conventional cages.", "The shift to enriched cages could also lead to an acceleration of consolidation in the egg industry as the largest egg farms continue to expand, and capital costs squeeze small egg producers.

One study indicated that eggs produced in cage-free systems would cost 25% more than those produced in conventional cages. However, enriched cage production would not be exactly comparable to cage-free production. In a limited sample, JS West and Companies, a commercial egg producer in California, built an enriched cage house in 2010 and in January 2012 released results comparing production in its enriched cage (116 square inches) and conventional cage (67 square inches) systems.

The use of conventional battery cages accompanied the increasing concentration of the egg production sector. Producers found that the cages reduced their production costs (e.g., feed costs). There is little controversy over the idea that conventional battery cages cause many hen welfare problems. Battery cages are cramped structures that prevent hens from engaging in their most basic natural behaviors, such as fully turning their heads, stretching their wings, roosting, nesting, and standing upright. Battery cages typically have slanted wire mesh flooring and may be stacked several tiers high. Thousands of hens may be housed in a single laying house. Other housing systems, however, may create other types of hen welfare concerns.", "Hen welfare is determined by, among other factors, genetics, disease, pest and parasite loads, stress, nutrition, and the birds' natural behaviors. Research on the influence of these factors on hen welfare is still in the early stages. Different housing systems have different effects on hen welfare. One housing system can improve hen welfare in some respects, while exacerbating other welfare issues. To better understand the relationship of housing and hen welfare, the Poultry Science Association convened an international symposium on the Social Sustainability of Egg Production in 2010. At this symposium, 11 animal scientists from U.S. and European universities and research laboratories presented a review of 202 research articles on hen behavior and housing systems published over the past three decades. This review outlined the welfare impacts attendant on four different housing systems: (1) conventional cages, (2) enriched cages, (3) cage-free systems, and (4) free-range outdoor systems. Two central findings from the review of the research on housing and hen welfare are that \"assessing hen health and welfare is difficult and multifactorial\" and that \"no single housing system is ideal from a hen welfare perspective.\" Characteristics of the various housing systems and their potential effects on hen behavior and welfare examined in the review are discussed briefly below.", "Conventional cages inherently restrict hens from expressing \"highly motivated behaviors\" for their entire laying lives. Behaviors associated with body maintenance (e.g., wing flapping, tail wagging, stretching), locomotion, and regulating body temperature are significantly curtailed in conventional cages. At high densities, hens suffer plumage damage from rubbing against the cages and lose capacity to regulate body temperature. High densities and little space limit access to food and water as other hens block the path to food and more aggressive breeds defend the feeder from other hens. Higher densities can increase the incidence of feather pecking, cannibalism, and smothering, although these risks can be reduced by beak trimming and group selection. Nesting behavior is a behavioral priority, and conventional cages lack materials for nest building. The absence of nest building material is thought to reduce hen welfare given that hens seem to prefer depositing eggs in molded nests rather than slanted wire floors. ", "Enriched cages (furnished cages or enriched colonies) were developed in response to the criticisms about conventional cages. Enriched cages typically have a nesting box, perches, and a dustbathing area. The review noted that these features permit hens more behavioral freedom than found with conventional cages. However, enriched cages have limited space per hen thus limiting their ability to run or flap their wings. Exercise is significantly restricted. Nesting and perching may also be restricted. Litter inside the cages may be quickly depleted and cause stress to the hens who are excluded from dustbathing by more dominant hens. While some regard enriched cages as an improvement over conventional battery cages, others see little improvement in this housing system.", "Cage-free systems provide \"sufficient space for performance of a full repertoire of locomotory and body-maintenance behaviors.\" With larger flock sizes (>1,000), the review noted that cannibalism and feather pecking can increase, although beak trimming can lessen these behaviors, as can reducing flock size. Stocking densities in cage-free systems can have a bearing on hen behavior, with low densities possibly triggering aggressive defense behavior around certain resources in the cage-free housing. Cage-free systems may have all slatted floors or all litter floors, or a combination of the two. The opportunity to forage in litter is important for hen welfare. Foraging in litter can reduce the incidence of cannibalism and feather pecking. Accessibility to litter, quality of the litter, and experience with litter during rearing appear to be critical variables affecting behavior in cage-free systems. The research review also noted that perches appear to reduce aggression in hens, although in the United States, cage-free systems generally do not provide adequate perch space for all hens to perch at night. Some cage-free systems do not provide perches.", "Free-range (outdoor) systems permit hens to spread out when foraging and, in general, increase the hens' behavioral options. Outdoor systems permit the hens to eat preferred foods such as grass seeds, earthworms, and flying insects. They also can sun themselves and dust bathe. Cannibalism, feather pecking, and piling, however, can increase in larger free-range flocks. While the greater environmental complexity of free-range systems increases behavioral opportunity for hens, according to the research review, this complexity can also introduce difficulties in managing disease and parasites. Indoor barn systems, while not permitting access to the outdoors, may offer some compromise between cage and non-cage systems.", "As this research review of egg production systems shows, very little research on hen housing and welfare is available that compares all factors affecting welfare under different housing systems. Mortality is greater in conventional cages than in enriched cage systems. In non-cage systems, mortality can be significant. Free-range housing may increase behavioral options for hens, but disease and parasite management can be more difficult, and welfare problems from cannibalism and predation can increase. The authors of the survey also noted that the overall management of each housing system is a critical component of hen welfare. Housing systems that may be superior along certain dimensions of hen welfare can be compromised by poor management. The authors conclude that the \"right combination of housing design, breed, rearing conditions, and management is essential to optimize hen welfare and productivity.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Animal Welfare Legislation", "paragraphs": ["The Animal Welfare Act (AWA, P.L. 91-579, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72131-2159) is the primary United States statute governing the treatment of animals, including marine mammals, and animals used in research.

Indeed, EU egg prices peaked in March, remained relatively high in April, but moved lower throughout the rest of the year. Although 2012 EU egg prices were higher than a year earlier because of high input costs, the November 2012 price was 16% lower than the March peak. ", "On February 15, 2012, the European Commission issued its general strategy for the protection and welfare of animals. The EU already had directives on various aspects of animal welfare including transportation; slaughtering; and specific requirements for housing calves, pigs, laying hens, and broilers. EU rules on organic production also include high animal welfare standards for cattle, pig, and poultry production. The new EU strategy will consider introducing a simplified legislative framework with animal welfare principles for all animals. This framework would use science-based animal welfare indicators to simplify the legal framework, provide more information to consumers on animal welfare, create a common set of requirements for personnel handling animals, and establish a EU network of animal welfare centers."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
