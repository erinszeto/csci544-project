However, when importers determine that the NAFTA rate (plus additional transaction costs) is more favorable, they choose to import goods under NAFTA. Importers may, in some cases, decide not to enter goods under an FTA, but the availability of such preferences gives them greater flexibility to purchase and import products in the most cost-effective manner available.

Thus, more restrictive ROO can be used to provide \"protection\" to these regional suppliers and maintain existing protection against outsiders, to the extent that they provide sufficient incentive for FTA producers to buy more inputs inside the region.

Congress could, through legislation or other means, encourage the Administration to exercise leadership in this area with a view toward reaching a resolution to these negotiations. In fact, one of the principal negotiating objectives set forth in the Trade Act of 2002 was the conclusion of an agreement on rules of origin.", "Some observers assert that preferential ROO are inefficient and lack transparency. However, negotiators sometimes make incremental changes. For example, since October 2009, NAFTA partners have implemented four sets of changes to the NAFTA rules of origin. The fourth set of changes, agreed in January 2011, covered products whose annual trilateral trade exceeds $90 million. Therefore, it is possible for preferential ROO to be simplified through mutual agreement of the parties even after an FTA is implemented. If Congress desires to provide greater preferential access to the U.S. market (and gain reciprocal access to the markets of trading partners), it could urge U.S. negotiators to liberalize ROO, and to examine the costs and benefits of applying a uniform set of preferential ROO with respect to future FTA negotiations.", "Since the processes of globalization are likely to continue making origin determinations more complex, Congress might also consider providing CBP with additional legislative guidance, especially in the area of non-preferential rules. However, such efforts may adversely affect importers and manufactures that benefit from the current system. In addition, even though the determination process may be complex and lengthy, CBP has the flexibility to examine the complete manufacturing process, including design, sources of intermediate components, labor costs, and assembly processes in order to make its country of origin determination.", "Some trade policy analysts have called for the liberalization or revision of industry-specific preferential rules of origin. Others advocate the abolition of rules of origin entirely, because they inject a large amount of inefficiency in the world trading system, and because they can effectively serve as a form of protection for import-competing industries. Some trade policy analysts argue for the multilateral elimination of tariffs, which, they say, would eliminate the need for ROO entirely. However, the end of tariffs would automatically lead to the end of all preference programs for developing countries, as well as the tariff preference benefits of FTAs. In addition, eliminating ROO entirely could pose issues for other trade policy objectives such as collecting trade statistics, country of origin labeling, implementing trade sanctions, enforcing trade remedies, and other trade policy objectives."], "subsections": []}]}}
