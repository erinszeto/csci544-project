In reporting legislation to fund the CJS entities for FY1995, the Senate Committee on Appropriations \"strongly\" recommended that the bureau use \"more cost-effective means of conducting the next census.\" The committee observed that \"Clearly, the budgetary caps and strict employment ceilings adopted by the President and Congress will not accommodate a repeat of the process used in 1990.\" A conference report on FY1996 CJS appropriations legislation expressed \"the conferees' continuing concerns with the inability of the Census Bureau to recognize budgetary realities.\" The report further noted that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees had \"for several years cautioned the Bureau that the cost of the Year 2000 Census had to be kept in check, and that only through early planning and decision making could costs be controlled.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee's report on FY2012 CJS appropriations legislation directed the bureau to examine \"seriously\" the lessons learned from the 2010 census \"to create more cost-effective operations.\" The committee then directed the bureau \"to consider budgeting for the 2020 decennial census at a level less than the 2010 Census and to further consider spending less than the 2000 Census, not adjusting for inflation.\" The committee's reports on the FY2013, FY2014, FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017 CJS appropriations bills reiterated the substance of this directive.

We built an address list and mailed questionnaires to each housing unit on the list. We asked respondents to complete and return the questionnaires through the mail. We developed automated processes to capture the information on the returns.

For each census since 1970, this paper-based process has been the standard, and it has been increasingly challenged by the growing diversity and complexity of our nation.

Many households consist of racial and ethnic minorities; multiple families; low-income people; inner-city residents; those whose living circumstances are atypical; international migrants to the United States who may lack English language proficiency, lack legal status in this country, or distrust governmental activities; or various combinations of these attributes. Any of them can make enumeration difficult, and some of them contribute markedly to recurrent undercounts of racial and ethnic minorities. Overcounts of some population groups, on the other hand, can occur to the extent that the Bureau receives multiple census forms from the same people or households, then does not capture and eliminate the duplications. A husband and wife, for example, might own a vacation home and fill out a questionnaire at that address as well as at their usual residence.

Moreover, poll data presented by the Pew Research Center show a pronounced shift in attitudes toward the federal government since 1970, when 54.0% of respondents said that they trusted it \"just about always\" or \"most of the time.\" By 2015, only 19.0% of those polled gave this response. The erosion of public trust in the lead-up to 2020 is of concern because the Census Bureau is a federal agency; it conducts the decennial census under constitutional authority and federal law.

By October 2016, according to GAO, only 3 of the 50 systems for the test had been delivered; the remaining 47 systems were in various stages of development. Moreover, the bureau had not \"identified the entire infrastructure (i.e., cloud solutions and/or data centers)\" for the end-to-end test or 2020 operations, and \"did not yet have a time frame for the implementation of the infrastructure.\"", "GAO further questioned whether the bureau was \"effectively managing its significant contractor support,\" such as for \"the technical integration\" of all \"key systems and infrastructure, and the development of many of the data collection systems\"; \"development of the IT platform\" that will be used for most data collection; \"procurement of the mobile devices and cellular service\" for nonresponse follow-up; and \"development of the IT infrastructure in the field offices.\" Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that, as GAO noted, the 2020 census will be the first time the bureau relies on \"contractor support\" for this kind of technical integration, collects data nationwide online, and employs mobile devices for NRFU.", "The bureau's \"past efforts to acquire and implement new approaches and systems have not always gone as planned,\" GAO cautioned, citing the 2010 census to illustrate the point.

It switched from trying to develop the devices in-house to contracting for them, then encountered \"significant problems\" when it tested the devices. \"Cost overruns and schedule slippages\" were additional problems noted by GAO. The bureau thus abandoned its plan to use the handhelds for NRFU and \"reverted to paper-based processing, which increased the cost of the 2010 Census by up to $3 billion\" and greatly heightened \"the risk of not completing the Census on time.\" GAO accordingly \"designated the 2010 Census a high-risk area in March 2008.\"", "Because of government-wide IT challenges, GAO cited \"improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations as a key area\" in its 2015 high-risk report and similarly named CEDCaP as \"one of nine programs across the federal government in need of the most attention.\"", "GAO's February 2017 update to the high-risk list included the 2020 census, largely due to the bureau's complex innovations for 2020; the need for improved \"ability to manage, develop, and secure its IT systems\"; and, related to both of these factors, the need for \"better oversight and control over its cost estimation process.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Security Concerns", "paragraphs": ["The crucial role assigned to technology for the 2020 census, with the associated emphasis on web responses, heightens the need for information security in many interrelated areas.

Bureau officials, GAO reported, were \"not certain\" what accounted for so many non-interviews and were \"researching potential causes.\" One possible cause cited by GAO was enumerators' apparent lack of uniform understanding that proxy interviews are important in NRFU and their inconsistent adherence to \"procedures for completing interviews with proxy respondents.\" GAO noted that a proxy is a \"non-household member, at least 15 years old, and knowledgeable about the NRFU address.\" Proxy data, as GAO pointed out, can make the difference between completed interviews and non-interviews, and thus are \"important to the success of the census.\" The bureau informed GAO that it will \"continue to refine procedures\" for collecting proxy data in 2020.", "The 2016 test showed as well, according to GAO, a certain lack of flexibility in the automated case management system for fieldwork during nonresponse follow-up and inadequate training for enumerators in using the system.
