Moscow extended citizenship and passports to most ethnic Ossetians. Simmering long-time tensions escalated on the evening of August 7, 2008, when South Ossetia and Georgia accused each other of launching intense artillery barrages against each other. Georgia claims that South Ossetian forces did not respond to a ceasefire appeal but intensified their shelling, \"forcing\" Georgia to send in troops. On August 8, Russia launched air attacks throughout Georgia and Russian troops engaged Georgian forces in South Ossetia. By the morning of August 10, Russian troops had occupied the bulk of South Ossetia, reached its border with the rest of Georgia, and were shelling areas across the border. Russian troops occupied several Georgian cities. Russian warships landed troops in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region and took up positions off Georgia's Black Sea coast.", "French President Nicolas Sarkozy, serving as the president of the European Union (EU), was instrumental in getting Georgia and Russia to agree to a peace plan on August 15-16. The plan called for both sides to cease hostilities and pull troops back to positions they held before the conflict began. It called for humanitarian aid and the return of displaced persons. It called for Russian troops to pull back to pre-conflict areas of deployment, but permitted temporary patrols in a security zone outside South Ossetia. The plan also provided for a greater international role in peace talks and peacekeeping, both of seminal Georgian interest. On August 25, President Medvedev declared that \"humanitarian reasons\" led him to recognize the independence of the regions. This recognition was widely condemned by the United States and the international community. President Sarkozy negotiated a follow-on agreement with Russia on September 8, 2008, that led to at least 200 EU observers to be deployed to the conflict zone and almost all Russian forces to withdraw from areas adjacent to the borders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by midnight on October 10.", "On August 13, former President Bush announced that then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would travel to France and Georgia to assist with the peace plan and that Defense Secretary Robert Gates would direct U.S. humanitarian aid shipments to Georgia. Secretary Rice proposed a multi-year $1 billion aid plan for Georgia. Several Members of Congress visited Georgia in the wake of the conflict and legislation has been passed in support of Georgia's territorial integrity and independence. P.L. 110-329, signed into law on September 30, 2008, provides $365 million in added humanitarian and rebuilding assistance for Georgia for FY2009.The August 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict is likely to have long-term effects on security dynamics in the region and beyond. Russia has augmented its long-time military presence in Armenia by establishing bases in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions. Georgia's military capabilities were at least temporarily degraded by the conflict, and Georgia will need substantial U.S. and NATO military assistance to rebuild its forces. The conflict temporarily disrupted railway transport of Azerbaijani oil to Black Sea ports and some oil and gas pipeline shipments, although no pipelines were reported damaged by the fighting. Although there have been some concerns that the South Caucasus has become less stable as a source and transit area for oil and gas, Kazakhstan has begun to barge oil across the Caspian to fill the oil pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan, Turkey (the BTC pipeline) and the European Union still plans to begin construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline from Azerbaijan to Austria in 2010."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["At the Munich Security Conference on February 7, 2009, Vice President Joe Biden stated that \"the United States will not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states.

PACE reaffirmed its commitment to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and again called on Russia to withdraw its recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It called for full access by international monitors and humanitarian aid workers to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as well as the establishment of international peacekeeping forces in the regions. It condemned Russia for building military bases in the regions, and censured Russia and the de facto authorities of South Ossetia for failing to halt ethnic cleansing. It condemned cross-border shootings and other violence emanating from the regions. PACE demanded immediate Council of Europe access to the regions in order to protect human rights. It requested that Russian troops withdraw from areas of Georgia that were controlled by Georgia before the August 2008 conflict, such as the Kodori Gorge in Abkhazia, the Georgian enclave around Tskhinvali and the Perevi village, and the Akhalgori district in South Ossetia. Reportedly, the vast majority of Akhalgori's 7,700 mostly ethnic Georgian residents had fled. The Assembly called for both Russia and Georgia to sign the U.N. Convention banning Cluster Munitions.", "Although gas shipments through a pipeline from Russia to South Ossetia were renewed in January 2009, the region remains cut off from Russia due to winter weather and faces an economic and humanitarian crisis, according to some observers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Tensions in Georgia date back at least to the 1920s, when South Ossetia made abortive attempts to declare its independence but ended up as an autonomous region within Soviet Georgia after the Red Army conquered Georgia. In 1989, South Ossetia lobbied for joining its territory with North Ossetia in Russia or for independence. Georgia's own declaration of independence from the former Soviet Union and subsequent repressive efforts by former Georgian President Gamsakhurdia triggered conflict in 1990. In January 1991, hostilities broke out between Georgia and South Ossetia, reportedly contributing to an estimated 2,000-4,000 deaths and the displacement of tens of thousands of people.", "In June 1992, Russia brokered a cease-fire, and Russian, Georgian, and Ossetian \"peacekeeping\" units set up base camps in a security zone around Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia. The units usually totalled around 1,100 troops, including about 530 Russians, a 300-member North Ossetian brigade (which was actually composed of South Ossetians and headed by a North Ossetian), and about 300 Georgians. Monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did most of the patrolling. A Joint Control Commission (JCC) composed of Russian, Georgian, and North and South Ossetian emissaries ostensibly promoted a settlement of the conflict, with the OSCE as facilitator. According to some estimates, some 20,000 ethnic Georgians resided in one-third to one-half of the region and 25,000 ethnic Ossetians in the other portion. Many fled during the fighting in the early 1990s or migrated.", "Some observers warned that Russia's increasing influence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia over the years transformed the separatist conflicts into essentially Russia-Georgia disputes. Most residents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia reportedly were granted Russian citizenship and passports and most appeared to want their regions to be part of Russia.", "In late 2003, Mikheil Saakashvili came to power during the so-called \"rose revolution\" (he was elected president in January 2004). He pledged to institute democratic and economic reforms, and to re-gain central government authority over the separatist regions. In 2004, he began to increase pressure on South Ossetia by tightening border controls and breaking up a large-scale smuggling operation in the region that allegedly involved Russian organized crime and corrupt Georgian officials. He also reportedly sent several hundred police, military, and intelligence personnel into South Ossetia. Georgia maintained that it was only bolstering its peacekeeping contingent up to the limit of 500 troops, as permitted by the cease-fire agreement. Georgian guerrilla forces also reportedly entered the region. Allegedly, Russian officials likewise assisted several hundred paramilitary elements from Abkhazia, Transnistria, and Russia to enter. Following inconclusive clashes, both sides by late 2004 ostensibly had pulled back most of the guerrillas and paramilitary forces.", "In July 2005, President Saakashvili announced a new peace plan for South Ossetia that offered substantial autonomy and a three-stage settlement, consisting of demilitarization, economic rehabilitation, and a political settlement. South Ossetian \"president\" Eduard Kokoiti rejected the plan, asserting in October 2005 that \"we [South Ossetians] are citizens of Russia.\" The Georgian peace plan received backing by the OSCE Ministerial Council in early December 2005. Perhaps faced with this international support, in mid-December 2005, Kokoiti proffered a South Ossetian peace proposal that also envisaged benchmarks, but presumed that South Ossetia would be independent.", "In November 2006, a popular referendum was held in South Ossetia to reaffirm its \"independence\" from Georgia. The separatists reported that 95% of 55,000 registered voters turned out and that 99% approved the referendum. In a separate vote, 96% reelected Kokoiti. The OSCE and U.S. State Department declined to recognize these votes. In \"alternative\" voting among ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia (and those displaced from South Ossetia) and other South Ossetians, the pro-Georgian Dmitriy Sanakoyev was elected governor of South Ossetia, and a referendum was approved supporting Georgia's territorial integrity.", "In March 2007, President Saakashvili proposed another peace plan for South Ossetia that involved creating \"transitional\" administrative districts throughout the region\u2014ostensibly under Sanakoyev's authority\u2014which would be represented by an emissary at JCC or alternative peace talks. In July 2007, President Saakashvili decreed the establishment of a commission to work out South Ossetia's \"status\" as a part of Georgia. The JCC finally held a meeting (with Georgia's emissaries in attendance) in Tbilisi, Georgia, in October 2007, but the Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that the Georgian emissaries made unacceptable demands in order to deliberately sabotage the results of the meeting. No further meetings were held.", "During the latter half of July 2008, Russia conducted a military exercise that proved to be a rehearsal for Russian actions in Georgia a few weeks later. Code-named Caucasus 2008, the exercise involved more than 8,000 troops and was conducted near Russia's border with Georgia. One scenario was a hypothetical attack by unnamed (but undoubtedly Georgian) forces on Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russian forces practiced a counterattack by land, sea, and air to buttress Russia's \"peacekeepers\" stationed in the regions, protect \"Russian citizens,\" and offer humanitarian aid. The Georgian Foreign Ministry protested that the scenario constituted a threat of invasion. Simultaneously with the Russian military exercise, about 1,000 U.S. troops, 600 Georgian troops, and token forces from Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine conducted an exercise in Georgia, code-named Immediate Response 2008, aimed at increasing troop interoperability for NATO operations and coalition actions in Iraq.

That night, both the Georgians and South Ossetians launched artillery attacks on each other's villages and checkpoints, reportedly resulting in about a dozen killed or wounded. The European Union (EU), the OSCE, and the Council of Europe (COE) issued urgent calls for both sides to show restraint and to resume peace talks.", "On July 8, 2008, four Russian military planes flew over South Ossetian airspace. The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that the incursion had helped discourage Georgia from launching an imminent attack on South Ossetia. The Georgian government denounced the incursion as violating its territorial integrity, and on July 11 recalled its ambassador to Russia for \"consultations.\" The U.N. Security Council discussed the overflights at a closed meeting on July 21, 2008. Although no decision was reached, Georgian diplomats reportedly stated that the session was successful, while Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin denounced the \"pro-Georgian bias\" of some Security Council members.", "The day after the Russian aerial incursion, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in Georgia for two days of discussions on ways to defuse the rising tensions between Georgia and Russia.

On July 30, both sides again exchanged artillery fire, with the South Ossetians allegedly shelling a Georgian-built road on a hill outside Tskhinvali, and the Georgians allegedly shelling two Ossetian villages. Two days later, five Georgian police were injured on this road by a bomb blast. This incident appeared to trigger serious fighting on August 2-4, which resulted in over two dozen killed and wounded. Kokoity threatened to attack Georgian cities and to call for paramilitary volunteers from the North Caucasus, and announced that women and children would be evacuated to North Ossetia. Georgia claimed that these paramilitary volunteers were already arriving in South Ossetia.", "On the evening of August 7, 2008, South Ossetia accused Georgia of launching a \"massive\" artillery barrage against Tskhinvali, while Georgia reported intense bombing of some Georgian villages in the conflict zone. Saakashvili that evening announced a unilateral ceasefire and called for South Ossetia to follow suit. He also called for reopening peace talks and reiterated that Georgia would provide the region with maximum autonomy within Georgia as part of a peace settlement. Georgia claims that South Ossetian forces did not end their shelling of Georgian villages but intensified their actions, \"forcing\" Georgia to declare an end to its ceasefire and begin sending ground forces into South Ossetia (for more on this view of events, see below, \" International Response \"). Georgian troops reportedly soon controlled much of South Ossetia, including Tskhinvali.", "Russian President Medvedev addressed an emergency session of the Russian Security Council on August 8.

Those who are responsible for that will be duly punished.\" He appeared to assert perpetual Russian control in stating that \"historically Russia has been, and will continue to be, a guarantor of security for peoples of the Caucasus.\" On August 11, he reiterated this principle that Russia is the permanent guarantor of Caucasian security and that \"we have never been just passive observers in this region and never will be.\"", "In response to the Georgian incursion into South Ossetia, Russia launched large-scale air attacks in the region and elsewhere in Georgia. Russia quickly dispatched seasoned professional (serving under contract) troops to South Ossetia that engaged Georgian forces in Tskhinvali on August 8. That same day, Russian warplanes destroyed Georgian airfields, including the Vaziana and Marneuli airbases near the Georgian capital Tbilisi. Saakashvili responded by ordering that reservists be mobilized and declaring a 15-day \"state of war.\"", "Reportedly, thousands of Russian troops had retaken Tskhinvali, occupied the bulk of South Ossetia, reached its border with the rest of Georgia, and were shelling areas across the border by early in the morning on August 10 (Sunday).

They also had observed \"the movement by the Abkhaz side of substantial numbers of heavy weapons and military personnel towards the Kodori Valley.\" Mulet also warned that Abkhaz separatist leader Sergey Bagapsh had threatened to push the Georgian armed forces out of the Upper Kodori Valley. In violation of their mandate, the Russian \"peacekeepers\" \"did not attempt to stop such deployments\" of Abkhaz rebel weaponry, Mulet reported.

The plan also calls for \"the opening of international discussions on the modalities of security and stability of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\" This seems to provide for possibly greater international roles in peace talks and peacekeeping, both of seminal Georgian interest. However, it does not specifically state that international peacekeepers will be deployed within South Ossetia. Supposedly, the Russian \"peacekeepers\" will cease patrolling the area outside South Ossetia after the modalities of international peacekeeping are worked out and monitors are deployed within this area, a process that could take some time.", "An emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers on August 13 endorsed the peace plan and the possible participation of EU monitors.

In the case of Russia, its seemingly disproportionate military campaign and its unilateral declaration of recognition appeared to harm its image as a reliable and peaceable member of the international community. Russia also reported that its military operations and pledges to rebuild South Ossetia were costing hundreds of millions of dollars.", "According to a report prepared by the World Bank and other international financial institutions, the conflict \"resulted in shocks to economic growth and stability in Georgia [including] a weakening of investor, lender and consumer confidence, a contraction of liquidity in the banking system, stress on public finances, damage to physical infrastructure,... and increased numbers of internally displaced persons.\" The conflict caused an estimated $394.5 million in damages that needed to be soon repaired and reduced projected economic growth for 2008 from 9% to 3.5%, according to the World Bank. Lessened economic growth rates may persist for several years. Commissioner of Human Rights of the COE, Thomas Hammerberg, reportedly found widespread destruction of ethnic Georgian villages and homes during a visit to South Ossetia, apparently caused by Ossetian and North Caucasian militias as part of \"ethnic cleansing\" efforts.", "Although Georgian opposition politicians and other citizens initially muted their criticism of Saakashvili after the ceasefire, there were signs later in 2008 of a growing debate about the causes and conduct of the conflict. Former legislative speaker Nino Burjanadze formed a new opposition party called Democratic Movement-United Georgia in October. Former Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli announced in late 2008 that he would form an opposition party, and two prominent opposition parties\u2014the New Right and Republican Parties\u2014formed an alliance. In February 2009, Irakli Alasania, Georgia's former ambassador to the UN, joined this alliance. The opposition parties have called for Saakashvili to resign and to schedule early presidential elections.", "President Medvedev's vow on August 8 to \"punish\" Georgia denoted Russian intentions beyond restoring control over South Ossetia. When he announced on August 12 that Russian troops were ending their offensive against Georgia, he stated that Russia's aims had been accomplished and the aggressor punished. Various observers have suggested several possible Russian reasons for the \"punishment\" beyond inflicting casualties and damage. These include coercing Georgia to accept Russian conditions on the status of the separatist regions, to relinquish its aspirations to join NATO, and to depose Saakashvili as the president. In addition, Russia may have wanted to \"punish\" the West for recognizing Kosovo's independence, for seeking to integrate Soviet successor states (which are viewed by Russia as part of its sphere of influence) into Western institutions such as the EU and NATO, and for developing oil and gas pipeline routes that bypass Russia.", "The prospects of improved Russia-Georgia relations appeared dimmed by Russia's refusal to directly negotiate with Saakashvili, Georgia's decision on August 29 to sever diplomatic relations with Russia, and Russia's retaliatory severing of diplomatic ties with Georgia. Ruptured bilateral trade and transport ties\u2014which have wider regional economic and humanitarian repercussions\u2014are likely to persist for some time, according to many observers.", "The Russia-Georgia conflict seemed to show Putin as the dominant figure in the Russian government. Putin left the Beijing Olympics early and flew to Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia. State-controlled media showed Putin meeting with military officers and seemingly in charge of military operations. Later government-issued reports and telecasts of meetings between Medvedev and Putin during the crisis appeared to show Putin \"suggesting\" courses of action to Medvedev. Following international criticism of Russia's incomplete withdrawal of military troops from Georgia and its recognition of the regions as independent, both Putin and Medvedev escalated their anti-Western rhetoric, according to many observers. One Russian commentator raised concerns that the hard line followed by the Putin-Medvedev tandem strengthened the influence of the so-called siloviki \u2014the representatives and veterans of the military, security, and police agencies\u2014over foreign and defense policy.", "Many observers initially warned Russia that it risked international isolation by engaging in behavior widely condemned by the world of nations. Prime Minister Putin downplayed the significance of various sanctions considered by the West, including the value of Russia joining the World Trade Organization or retaining membership in the G-8, and appeared to implement pre-emptive trade restrictions on U.S. food exports. At the same time, the EU, the COE, and NATO appeared to retreat from considering extended sanctions against Russia (see below).", "South Ossetia's \"president\" Kokoiti has stated that his region seeks unification with Russia, although according to one Russian media report, Russian officials urged him to soft-pedal this intention for the time being and to instead state that South Ossetia wanted to remain independent. Abkhazia's \"president\" Bagapsh stated that the region wants to remain independent, but to have ties with Russia that appear virtually confederal in nature. In 5-10 years, he stated, a decision could be made on unification with Russia.", "On September 17, 2008, Russia signed Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance agreements with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. According to some Russian authorities, these agreements provide for the regions to \"decide\" on the number of Russian troops they host, so render inoperable arguments by the EU and the OSCE that Russian troop levels in the regions should accord with pre-conflict numbers.", "The friendship agreements effectively make the regions dependencies of Russia, according to some observers. They permit Russia to establish military bases in the regions and to deploy Russian border troops to help defend the regional borders. Residents of the regions are permitted to freely enter Russia and Russian embassies protect the interests of the residents of the regions when they travel abroad. Perhaps merely codifying the existing trend before the Russia-Georgia conflict, the regions pledge to \"unify\" their civil, tax, welfare, and pension laws and their banking, energy, transportation, and telecommunications systems with those of Russia.", "The Commonwealth of Independent States dissolved the CIS \"peacekeeping\" mandate in the regions in mid-October 2008, but Russian troops were invited by the regions to establish bases in line with the friendship agreements. In February 2009, the Russian general staff announced that it was constructing or revamping facilities at Java and Tskhinvali in South Ossetia and Gudauta in Abkhazia for the 3,700 troops being sent to each region. It was also announced that some ships from the Black Sea Fleet would be deployed to Abkhazia's port town Ochamchire. NATO and the EU criticized the basing arrangements as destabilizing.", "According to some observers, Russia's recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia conferred legitimacy on the existing ruling groups in the regions\u2014which include corrupt \"elected\" officials and organized crime leaders\u2014and gave permanence to smuggling networks allegedly run by Russian \"peacekeepers\" and security personnel. These observers warn that this enhanced Russian backing increased the threats posed by smuggling and other criminal activities to Georgia's stability.

This commission heard lengthy testimony from nearly two dozen government witnesses, including President Saakashvili. In its December 2008 report, the commission concluded that Georgia's military action in South Ossetia on August 7-8 was a response to a plan set in motion by Russia over a period of months that culminated in an invasion by more than 40,000 Russian troops.

In December 2008, an official in the Russian Prosecutor's Office stated that 162 civilians had been killed in South Ossetia, and in February 2009, a Russian deputy defense minister stated that 64 military personnel had been killed and 283 wounded in the region during the conflict.

Over 68,000 displaced persons (in Georgia and the regions) had returned to their homes, according to the World Bank, but about 34,000 persons needed temporary shelter until they could return to their houses in the spring, and about 30,000 persons needed long-term housing because they could not return or their homes had been destroyed. The returnees were in need of assistance to restore their livelihoods and repair damage to their property. In addition, 100,000 people that were affected directly or indirectly by the conflict might need assistance. Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry reported in mid-September that almost all of the 35,000 South Ossetians whom had fled to North Ossetia during the fighting had returned to their homes and that all the temporary accommodation facilities opened in North Ossetia had been closed. Some 2,000 South Ossetians remained in the north, mainly those whose houses had been heavily damaged.", "The Georgian government moved quickly to provide housing for the displaced persons. Many people were housed temporarily in schools or other public buildings or lived with relatives. The government rehabilitated thousands of damaged houses or apartments and constructed nearly 4,000 houses in several new communities for people likely to be displaced for some time. Some of these houses were provided with plumbing and heating and were designed for indefinite use while others were more rudimentary and designed for temporary use. Some observers have raised concerns that these new communities are not fully provided with social services and are not near places of work. Concerns also have been raised that some displaced persons have been forced to return to conflict areas even though their housing remains damaged or they fear ongoing cross-border violence.", "On August 12, 2008, Georgia filled a case against Russia at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for alleged crimes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia between 1990 and 2008. President Medvedev also had threatened to file a case with the Court about Georgia's \"genocide\" in South Ossetia. The Court held an urgent hearing on the case on September 8-10, 2008. Besides an examination of Russia's support for ethnic cleansing, Georgia requested that the Court declare as unlawful Russia's moves to recognize the separatist regions and Russia's denial of the right of return of internally displaced ethnic Georgians.

HRW has alleged that both Russia and Georgia used cluster bombs against civilians, and has rejected claims by Russia that Georgia was carrying out \"genocide\" in South Ossetia. HRW announced on September 1 that it had received a letter from the Georgian Defense Ministry admitting that it had used cluster bombs near the Roki tunnel.

On August 10, then-Deputy National Security Adviser James Jeffrey warned Russia of a \"significant long-term impact\" on US-Russian relations if Moscow continued \"disproportionate actions\" in Georgia and urged Russia to respond favorably to Georgia's withdrawal of forces from South Ossetia.

Khalilzad revealed that Lavrov had told Rice that Saakashvili \"must go\" as a condition for a ceasefire.", "Former Vice President Cheney issued a statement on August 10 after a phone conversation with Saakashvili that \"Russian aggression must not go unanswered,\" and that the continuation of aggression \"would have serious consequences for [Russia's] relations with the United States, as well as the broader international community.\" Also appearing to take a stronger stance, former President Bush on August 11 referred to his conversation with Putin on August 8, stating that he had told Putin that \"this violence [in Georgia] is unacceptable,\" and that he had \"expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia.\" On August 12, then-Secretary Rice stated that she was encouraged by reports from French Foreign Minister Koucher in Moscow that there was progress in talks with President Medvedev about the EU peace plan, and reiterated that the United States supports Georgia's territorial integrity and \"its democratically elected government.\"", "On August 10, the U.S. military began flying 2,000 Georgian troops home from Iraq after Georgia recalled them. A U.S. military spokesman stated that \"we want to thank them for the great support they have given the coalition and we wish them well.\" Another military spokesman stated that \"we are supporting the Georgian military units that are in Iraq in their redeployment to Georgia so that they can support requirements there during the current security situation. On August 11, Putin criticized these U.S. flights as aiding Georgia in the conflict.", "In a strong statement on August 13, former President Bush called for Russia \"to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the United States, Europe, and other nations, and to begin restoring its place in the world [by meeting] its commitment to cease all military activities in Georgia [and withdrawing] all Russian forces that entered Georgia in recent days.\" He raised concerns that some Russian troops remained in the vicinity of Gori and Poti. He announced that he was sending then-Secretary Rice to France to \"confer with President Sarkozy\" on the EU peace plan and to Georgia, \"where she will personally convey America's unwavering support for Georgia's democratic government [and] continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free Georgia.\" He also announced that Defense Secretary Robert Gates would direct a humanitarian aid mission, which already had begun with an airlift of medical supplies to Tbilisi.", "Bush Administration officials stated that they hoped to maintain cooperation with Russia on anti-terrorism (including assistance in operations in Afghanistan), non-proliferation, and sanctions against Iran and North Korea. On August 14, however, Secretary Gates stated that the Russia-Georgia conflict had forced the Administration to reconsider efforts to carry on \"a long-term strategic dialogue with Russia,\" and that \"Russia's behavior ... has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward, both bilaterally and with NATO.\"", "In seemingly harsh language on August 19, then-Secretary Rice asserted that Russia is \"becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict,\" and that by \"invading smaller neighbors, bombing civilian infrastructure, going into villages and wreaking havoc and wanton destruction of this infrastructure,\" Russia is isolating itself from the \"community of nations.\"", "Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza presented the most detailed Administration position on the events in Georgia in a briefing on August 19 and in testimony on September 10. He appeared to argue that the outbreak of fighting in Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia region on the night of August 7-8 was preplanned and provoked by Russia. He pointed out that \"South Ossetia's government and its security structures are run by Russian officials [who were] commanding these South Ossetian forces that were shooting at ... Georgian peacekeepers or troops and villages.\" He also asserted that \"there was an offensive under way from Russia, through the Roki Tunnel, toward Tskhinvali and Kurta and other ethnically Georgian villages. And at that point, the Georgian leadership told some of us: We have no choice but to defend our villages and our people\" and lift a cease-fire that Georgia had declared earlier.", "Despite this evidence, Bryza maintained, \"whoever shot whom first is now no longer the issue at all. It is that Russia has escalated so dramatically and brutally.... Russia has moved well beyond South Ossetia.... It used strategic bombers to target civilian[s],\" blocked the port of Poti, and destroyed east-west rail lines. Moreover, he stressed, Russian forces also invaded Georgia from its breakaway Abkhazia region, which \"has nothing to do with South Ossetia at all.... In the case of Abkhazia, it was the Abkhaz who attacked the Georgians.\" Bryza stated that the Administration in early August had \"strongly recommended\" to Georgia that it \"not engage in a direct military conflict with Russia.\"", "Indicative of heightened tensions in U.S.-Russia relations, Prime Minister Putin alleged on August 28, 2008, that the United States may have orchestrated the conflict in Georgia to disguise its economic and foreign policy problems and boost the prospects of a presidential candidate. He also alleged that the United States not only failed to dissuade Georgia from operations in South Ossetia on August 7-8, but armed the Georgians and directed them to attack. Then-White House press secretary Dana Perino responded that the allegations were \"patently false\" and \"not rational,\" and that \"it is a time for the countries who believe in sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity to band together to fight against\" Russia's violation of such principles.

[Saakashvili] and his democratically elected government can count on the continued support and assistance of the United States.\" He also stated that the United States was coming to the aid of Georgia, as it had aided Georgia after the 2003 \"rose revolution\" that had brought Saakashvili to power, to help Georgia \"to overcome an invasion of your sovereign territory, and an illegitimate, unilateral attempt to change your country's borders by force.... We will help your people to heal this nation's wounds, to rebuild this economy, and to ensure Georgia's democracy, independence and further integration with the West.\" He visited Ukraine on September 5 to similarly reassure the country of U.S. support for its sovereignty and independence in the wake of Russia's invasion of Georgia and Medvedev's assertions of a Russian sphere of influence in Soviet successor states and special interests in the fate of Russian \"citizens\" abroad.", "In a speech in Italy on September 6, 2008, that appeared to mark deepened U.S.-Russian tensions, former Vice President Cheney stated that \"Russia has violated the sovereignty of [democratic Georgia]; made and then breached a solemn agreement, in a direct affront to the EU; severely damaged its credibility and global standing; and undermined its own relations with the United States and other countries.\" Then-Secretary Rice delivered a speech on September 18 that similarly strongly excoriated Russia for its aggressive foreign policy behavior, including the invasion of Georgia. She stated that \"Russia's leaders had laid the groundwork\" for \"what by all appearances was a premeditated invasion\" of Georgia \"months ago, distributing Russian passports to Georgian separatists, training and arming their militias, and then justifying the campaign across Georgia's border as an act of self-defense.\" However, she did not call for U.S. or international sanctions on Russia, and stated that \"the Sochi declaration signed earlier this year provided a strategic framework for the United States and Russia to advance our many shared interests. We will continue by necessity to pursue our areas of common concern with Russia.\" In a retort on September 22 to then-Secretary Rice's speech, the Russian Foreign Ministry asserted that Russia's military response to Georgia's \"attack on Russia\" had been proportionate.", "The major Bush Administration action was the September 8 withdrawal of consideration by Congress of the U.S.-Russia Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation, submitted to Congress in May 2008. In his letter of withdrawal, former President Bush stated that his decision was in response to \"recent actions by the Government of the Russian Federation incompatible with peaceful relations with its sovereign and democratic neighbor Georgia.\" He added that \"if circumstances should permit future reconsideration of the proposed Agreement ... the proposed Agreement will be submitted for congressional review.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Reaction to Russia's Recognition Declaration", "paragraphs": ["On August 26, former President Bush condemned Medvedev's decision to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia as \"inconsistent with numerous U.N.
