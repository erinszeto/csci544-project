Enhancing or Continuing the Operation of Tribal Courts: These grants are awarded to any tribe, regardless of size, so that the tribe can enhance or continue the operation of an existing tribal court.

DOJ OIG lists grant management as a management challenge because (1) OIG reviews continue to find that many grantees do not submit financial and progress reports; (2) numerous deficiencies continue to be found in the COPS Office's monitoring of grantee activities; (3) audits found that grants were not regularly awarded in a timely manner and grantees were slow to spend funds; and (4) more than 375 audits of COPS grants have resulted in significant dollar-related findings.
