While a number of international, national and localinitiatives seek to abolish the practice, there continues to be a debate on what constitutes child labor. Some consider any work undertaken by children to be child labor, while others may use the term torefer to work under abusive conditions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) defines childlabor as a form of work that is inherently hazardous, employs children below the internationallyrecognized minimum age, or is exploitative. Child labor is used in this report as defined by the ILO. According to the ILO about 246 million children were engaged in child labor in 2000. Some 186million child laborers were below the age of 15, and approximately 110 million were below the ageof 12.", "While awareness of the issue has increased, the ability to address the complex problem has been complicated by a number of related issues including, rising poverty, surging HIV/AIDS infectionrates, and a lack of relevant education. News stories have featured children working in exportindustries (such as textiles, clothing, carpets and footwear) and caused international uproar. Whilethe news stories have contributed to a heightened awareness about the problem of international childlabor, the ILO has found that child workers in export industries are relatively few compared to thoseemployed in activities geared to domestic consumption.", "Congressional support for the abolition of international child labor, particularly the worst formsof child labor, is very strong. Congress has funded programs to combat international child labor,initiated bills that expand the United States' role in the global fight against child labor, and includedclauses that require action on eliminating child labor in international trade agreements. AlthoughCongress has consistently boosted American efforts to eliminate child labor world-wide, there area number of issues that continue to impede these efforts, including: ineffective enforcementmechanisms; sparse monitoring systems; and insufficient funding for programs that alleviatepoverty, decrease incidences of HIV/AIDS, and increase access to relevant education. This reportwill discuss the ILO definition of child labor, outline the scope of the problem, explain thedifficulties in eliminating it, describe U.S. and international efforts to counter exploitative childlabor, and present some issues Congress may consider.

Historically, poverty and child labor are inextricably linked. Families in many countriesrely on the income from children to cover basic needs. A World Bank report found that countrieswith per capita income of $500 or less (at 1987 prices) have labor force participation rates of30%-60% for children aged 10-14 years. In contrast, wealthier developing countries, with incomesbetween $500 and $1,000, have lower child labor participation rates at 10%-30% for the same agegroup. (15)", "As children work to contribute to their families' short-term needs the cycle of poverty continues. Child labor hinders economic development and perpetuates poverty by keeping the children of thepoor out of school, limiting their prospects for upward social mobility, and preventing them fromgaining the education and skills that would enable them as adults to increase their contributions toeconomic growth and prosperity. (16) Some havesuggested that child labor suppresses wages, becauseit increases the total labor supply. A recent article from the Journal of International Affairs arguesthat if child labor is left to proliferate, adult labor could be threatened. \"[I]n the same measure asfemales replaced men as factory workers, so child labor, if not restricted, will crowd a proportionatenumber of adults out of employment.\" (17)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Child Labor in the Shadows", "paragraphs": ["Children working in export industries (such as textiles, clothing, carpets and footwear) have been featured on news stories causing international uproar.

It reported that these children lived and worked in factories whose internal temperature oftenexceeded 100 degrees, and which remained locked with armed guards barring entrance or exit. Manyof the factories were in back alleys, accessible only to those that worked in them. Hidden camerasshowed children picking silk out of boiling pots with their bare hands, standing at machinespurposely built for them, and cowering as abusive employers liberally hit or threatened them. Research has indicated that children more often work in small subcontracting shops, like these, orhomework situations rather than in large-scale, formal factories. (18)", "An important part of the story was a segment that showed the difficulty in monitoring and tracking goods produced with child labor. An undercover news reporter held an extensive interviewwith a silk exporter who admitted that her company routinely sends its silk to Italy to receive anItalian label, minimizing the likelihood that her company would be scrutinized for child laborpractices, and guaranteeing a higher price for the goods. (19) This practice reveals the difficulty in abolishing child labor as companies continue to discover ways to circumvent monitoring systems.

However, the ILO has found that child workers in export industries are relatively few compared to those employed inactivities geared to domestic consumption. It is estimated that fewer than 5% of child laborers areemployed in the export manufacturing or mining sectors, and only 1-2% are employed inexport-oriented agriculture. (20) This reinforces theargument that child labor needs to be addressed atthe national and local levels. ", "Surveys have revealed that the majority of children who work (70%) are engaged in agriculture, with less than 9% involved in manufacturing, trade and restaurant work. Only 6.5% were found tobe engaged in social and personal services, including domestic work. Some 4% worked in transport,storage and communications, and 3% were found to be involved in construction, mining andquarrying. (21) Not only were most children foundto be engaged in agricultural work, but most childrenwere also found in the informal sector. This means that children will be less likely found in highlyorganized commercial plantations. Nonetheless, children are still a significant portion of thecommercial agricultural workforce, because the large plantations often subcontract to small-scalefamily farms that may use child labor. Studies in Brazil, Kenya and Mexico have shown thatchildren under 15 make up between 25% and 30% of the total labor force in production of variouscommodities. (22) The common practice ofsubcontracting is mirrored in manufacturing and a host ofother industries, underscoring the importance of developing national programs that address poverty,access to basic education, and include child labor initiatives in national labor legislation.

HIV/AIDS increases the number of child orphans and street children, inhibits children's ability toregularly attend school, makes children more vulnerable to sexual abuse and prostitution, andultimately elevates the demand for child labor. ", "HIV/AIDS has already increased the number of child orphans. Before HIV/AIDS, about 2% of children in the developing world were orphans; by the end of the 1990s about 10% of children wereorphans in some countries. An estimated 13 million children have lost their mothers or both parentsto HIV/AIDS; and 27 million children are expected to be affected by HIV/AIDS by 2010. If childrenup to 18 years are considered (children up to 15 years old are traditionally considered orphans), 50million children will be affected by HIV/AIDS by 2010. Globally, at least 90% of those orphanedthrough HIV/AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa. (23)", "Children orphaned by HIV/AIDS often have less access to education. Research has shown that children orphaned by HIV/AIDS are more likely to be out of school than those orphaned for otherreasons. (24) Once a parent becomes infected withHIV the child is often withdrawn from school eitherto care for the ill parent(s) and siblings, or to find work to substitute for the income of the sick ordeceased parent. Even if they remain in school, children raised in households with a parent livingwith HIV/AIDS usually only attend school sporadically.", "Once the parent(s) die(s) the child may find refuge in the streets or with an extended family member. The extended family network has traditionally been very strong in many developingcountries. However, HIV/AIDS is undermining it. Older family members, already struggling tomake a living, rarely have enough money to sufficiently care for additional children. These childrenare less likely to receive an education, are more likely to be malnourished, and are more easilyexploited. Extended families are turning away children at rising rates, resulting in a significantincrease in \"street children\" and working children. Children on the street in need of money, food,shelter and guidance are more likely to be drawn into causal sexual relationships or to be exploitedfor commercial sexual practices. Consequently, these children become more likely to contractHIV/AIDS themselves. The United Nations estimates that up to 48% of street children have beensexually abused in return for food and shelter. (25)", "As working adults continue to die at rapid rates, the demand for child labor increases. In areas severely affected by HIV/AIDS, employers have begun to seek out children to fill in the labor gaps. In Zimbabwe, the HIV induced loss of adult labor on commercial agricultural estates has increasedthe demand for child labor both in fields and in households. In South Africa, children are expectedto work on the estate if they live with their parents on the compound.

(27) Some do not have access to educationbecause the school fees, uniforms and other relatedexpenses are out of reach. Others either do not have access to a school or do not find the educationoffered to be relevant to their needs.

Advocates of this practice argue that countries that use child labor create unemployment indeveloped countries as multinational companies move their plants to countries with lower laborcosts. This, they argue, constitutes \"social dumping\", a term that implies that developing countrieswithout adequate labor standards distort trade and investment flows and participate in unfaircompetition.

First, they argue that the United States unjustly requires states to ratify or comply with international child laborconventions, which it has not ratified. (71) Second,opponents argue that heightened trade barriers willworsen the plight of workers and more than likely increase reliance on child labor, as growth ishalted and families struggle to contend with increased poverty. Finally, since most child labor occurson family farms and in the informal sector, trade initiatives will have only minimal impact on childlaborers, opponents argue. If the United States would reduce its trade barriers (such as tariffs onforeign textiles and agriculture), some argue, developing countries would be able to grow, fightpoverty, and minimize their reliance on child laborers. (72) This issue has spurred debates on a numberof issues, including whether the United States should continue to use international trade forums tocontribute to the abolition of international child labor. Another issue some have raised is whetherU.S. tariffs and subsidies indirectly contribute to international child labor. Opponents of the use ofU.S. tariffs and subsidies have argued that the United States might be able to offer trade-friendlyoptions to eliminate child labor, such as halting direct foreign aid payments to governments that usechild labor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Global Monitoring Systems", "paragraphs": ["Both the ILO and the United States train labor monitors in foreign countries.
