However, recent increases in trade with China have made it a close second to the United States. In 2006, the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with India totaled $13 billion. In 2006, India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 9.2%, a growth rate second only to China among Asian nations. India's economic growth has also brought about the emergence of a sizeable \"middle class\" and the largest number of billionaires in Asia, but the country's mostly rural population remains comparatively poor and largely isolated from the benefits of growth. In addition, there is growing concern that the economy is \"overheated,\" as evidenced by rising rates of inflation. Moreover, despite several years of strong growth, investment in infrastructure is lagging, creating a potential bottleneck for long-term economic expansion. Finally, attempts at additional economic reforms aimed at resolving these and other economic problems are constrained by India's political dynamics.", "Despite the significant liberalization of India's trade and foreign investment policies, there remain a number of bilateral and multilateral trade issues between the United States and India. The United States seeks greater market access to India's agricultural market and key service sectors for its exports and for foreign direct investment.

With a robust and working democratic system, India is a federal republic where the bulk of executive power rests with the prime minister and his or her cabinet (the Indian president is a ceremonial chief of state with limited executive powers). As a nation-state, India presents a vast mosaic of hundreds of different ethnic groups, religious sects, and social castes. Most of India's prime ministers have come from the country's Hindi-speaking northern regions and all but two have been upper-caste Hindus.", "Larger than Alaska, Texas, and California combined, India is a land of great demographic, geographic, and climatological variety. From stark deserts in the west to thick jungles in the northeast, the towering Himalaya mountains of the north to the vast tableland of the Deccan Plateau of the south, and with the fertile Indo-Gangetic plain between, India dominates the Asian Subcontinent and shares long borders with its six other continental states. About one-third of the population lives in urban areas; an overwhelming majority of the remainder is engaged in the agricultural sector. Most of India's people inhabit either the alluvial soil of the Indo-Gangetic plain across the north, or the eastern and western coasts of the southern Deccan Peninsula. About 290 million Indians live in the densely-populated northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar; another 100 million live in the western state of Maharashtra. These three states account for more than one-third of the country's total population.", "The 543-seat Lok Sabha (People's House) is the locus of national political power, with directly elected representatives from each of the country's 28 states and 7 union territories. A smaller upper house, the Rajya Sabha (Council of States), may review, but not veto, most legislation, and has no power over the prime minister or the cabinet. Although India's political stage is crowded with numerous regional and caste-based parties, recent years have seen an increasingly dyadic battle between two major parties that vie for smaller allies in a system that now requires coalitional politics. No party has won a national election outright since 1984.", "India has one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world. India's real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 9.2% in 2006\u2014a growth rate second only to China among Asian nations. The strong GDP performance in 2006 capped five years of rapid economic expansion, transforming India into the third largest economy in Asia (after Japan and China). Its recent economic success is generally attributed to a combination of internal and external factors. Internally, a series of economic reforms (begun when the current prime minister was finance minister) have stimulated solid growth of India's manufacturing and service sectors. Externally, a relatively strong global economy, combined with India's trade and investment liberalization policies, have stimulated increased trade and investment flows to and from India.", "Despite the recent growth, India's economy confronts several challenges to its future prosperity. First, although the nation's manufacturing and services sectors have grown rapidly, there has been relatively little job creation. Second, its agricultural sector has experienced relatively slow growth for many years. With more than half of Indian households still reliant on agriculture for their income, the standard of living for much of the country's population remains relatively low. There are indications that most of the Indian populace remains untouched by and thus unimpressed with the country's widely touted economic boom.", "Third, the standard of living of India's rural and urban poor is being threatened by an emerging economic challenge\u2014inflationary pressures. After seven years of modest inflation at or below 4% per year, inflation in 2006 was nearly 7% and has risen to about 8% in the first part of 2007.

India's economy is already hindered by its inadequate transportation system and electricity shortage. Similarly, India's complex and entrenched bureaucracy frequently creates a barrier to implementing new economic policies and programs. At the same time, its large population and recent rise in industrial output are putting more and more pressure on India's environment, exacerbating existing problems in providing its people with clean, potable water, as well as clean air.", "Even with the continued strength of the economy and the Singh government's attempt to balance its economic policies, many analysts see India facing a number of economic challenges and believe there are still several important economic reforms that India should make to increase the benefits generated by its restructured economy. In particular, critics of the current economic policies point to the unequal distribution of the benefits of the economic reforms, noting that the rapid economic growth has not brought a corresponding reduction in poverty in India, particularly in rural areas. For some, the solution is to press forward more aggressively with the economic reforms by greater liberalization of India's domestic economic and international trade policies. For others, the solution is reverse elements of the reform and refocus agriculture and India's rural population.", "In March 2007, Prime Minister Singh addressed a roundtable hosted by the Economist magazine. In his remarks, Prime Minister Singh provided a fairly comprehensive overview of his administration's view of the current status of the Indian economy, arguing that India's economy will probably continue its rapid growth for another decade or more. However, Singh also pointed out India's need for additional reforms, including changes to its banking and financial system, its labor markets, and its \"public service delivery mechanisms.\" In light of India's past and planned reforms, he stated, \"I find it surprising when I continue to hear complaints about our economy still being a relatively inward-looking economy.\"", "The Bush Administration seems to hold a different view of India's economic conditions, maintaining that the Singh government ought to push forward more actively with its economic reforms. In September 2006, U.S. Ambassador to India, David Mulford, said to an audience in New Delhi:", "Today's business environment in India is more favorable to trade and investment. But there are signs of a pause in the reform process in recent months. Privatizations have stopped, and political reality suggests that reform of other key sectors and policies of central interest to investors will take longer than envisioned. It is important to bear in mind there are serious economic costs to any loss of momentum on the reform front.... The solution to attracting much greater private sector investment in energy and infrastructure development is a blend of policies that includes better governance, market sensitive regulatory regimes, continued liberalization of the financial sector that enables foreign and domestic private capital to finance major projects, and the timely resolution of investor-state disputes.", "One U.S. trade official opined that it is only through meaningful reforms in India's vast and poorly performing agricultural sector that the country's true economic potential can be realized.

Monopolies were granted to state enterprises in a number of industries considered of economic or strategic importance. Private companies in other industries were often subject to licensing requirements and legally constrained in their size of operation. The agricultural sector was a key focus of the First Five Year Plan, with the implementation of various subsidy programs, food price controls, and restrictions on the transport of agricultural crops. Labor laws provided workers with protection from managerial misconduct, but also significantly reduced labor mobility. Both exports and imports were controlled by licenses and tariffs. Foreign direct investment was also severely restricted both by industry and size.", "Successive Indian governments, still headed by Prime Minister Nehru, remained relatively true to these policies for both its First and Second Five Year Plans (1951-56 and 1956-61) with moderately successful results. Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.6% for the First Five Year Plan, and 2.5% for the Second Five Year Plan. Agricultural production rose 44% and manufacturing output increased 144%. However, the economic policies were also leading to growing merchandise trade and current account deficits that were depleting India's foreign reserves.", "For the Third Five Year Plan (1961-66), Prime Minister Nehru and the INC made an adjustment in its economic policies, shifting focus away from \"rapid industrialization\" over to a program of \"self sustained growth.\" At the same time, India's trade policy shifted from \"import substitution\" to \"efficient substitution of imports,\" which in effect opened up new trade opportunities for goods considered crucial to economic growth and development. This adjusted economic policy remained in effect until the end of the Seventh Five Year Plan in 1990.", "In 1990 and 1991, India was struck by a number of political and economic shocks. On the political side, the INC refused to form a coalition government following a poor showing in the elections of 1989. The next largest party, the Janata Dal, was able to form a coalition government, headed by Prime Minister V.P. Singh, but it proved unstable and collapsed in December 1990. During the election campaign of 1991, ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated, and P.V. Narasimha Rao was selected as the new leader for the INC. Following the INC's success in the 1991 elections, Rao became prime minister.", "During the political tumult of 1990 and 1991, the combined effects of rise in oil prices (precipitated by Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf) and the demise of the Soviet Union, a major trading partner and a key source of foreign aid, led to a rapid devaluation of the rupee, a depletion of India's international reserves, and fears of an impending severe recession. In response, Prime Minister Rao made a major and controversial change in economic policies designed to restore faith in the rupee, replenish the nation's international reserves, and stimulate economic growth. These reforms were overseen by his finance minister, Manmohan Singh.", "The initial round of reforms included several elements. First, efforts were made to reduce India's perpetual fiscal deficits at both the federal and state levels. Second, the number of sectors reserved solely for the public sector were reduced from 18 industries to just three\u2014military aircraft and warships, nuclear energy generation, and railway transport. Third, India liberalized international trade by reducing import tariffs, eliminating import restrictions, and opening up India to foreign direct investment. Fourth, India liberalized its financial markets, by dismantling its interest rate controls, reducing government regulations and permitting greater competition.", "Following the initial round of economic reforms, India's real GDP growth rate accelerated from around 3-4% per year in the 1980s to 5-7% during the early 1990s. However, toward the end of the decade, India's economic growth began to slow. Some analysts attributed the economic slowdown to a failure of the federal government to continue and to complete the economic reforms initiated at the beginning of the decade. Other analysts argued that economic problems generated by the reforms were creating structural barriers to continued growth.", "The ensuing debate over the merits of the 1991 reforms contributed to a second period of gradual economic reform in the second half of the 1990s and into the current decade.

Some suggest that even segments of the private sector oppose reform efforts.
