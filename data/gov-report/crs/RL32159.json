Federal agencies and large foundations may have formal application packets, strict guidelines, and fixed deadlines with which applicants must comply, while smaller foundations may operate more informally and even provide assistance to inexperienced grantseekers. However, the steps outlined in this report generally apply to any grant-seeking effort.", "Individuals without prior grant proposal writing experience may find it useful to attend a grantsmanship class or workshop.

To develop a convincing proposal for project funding, the project must fit into the philosophy and mission of the grant-seeking organization or agency; and the need that the proposal is addressing must be well documented and well articulated. Typically, funding agencies or foundations will want to know that a proposed activity or project reinforces the overall mission of an organization or grant seeker, and that the project is necessary. To make a compelling case, the following should be included in the proposal:", "nature of the project, its goals, needs, and anticipated outcomes; how the project will be conducted; timetable for completion; how best to evaluate the results (performance measures); staffing needs, including use of existing staff and new hires or volunteers; and preliminary budget, covering expenses and financial requirements, to determine what funding levels to seek.", "When developing an idea for a proposal, it is also important to determine if the idea has already been considered in the applicant's locality or state. A thorough check should be made with state legislators, local government, and related public and private agencies which may currently have grant awards or contracts to do similar work. If a similar program already exists, the applicant may need to reconsider submitting the proposed project, particularly if duplication of effort is perceived. However, if significant differences or improvements in the proposed project's goals can be clearly established, it may be worthwhile to pursue federal or private foundation assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community Support", "paragraphs": ["For many proposals, community support is essential. Once a proposal summary is developed, an applicant may look for individuals or groups representing academic, political, professional, and lay organizations which may be willing to support the proposal in writing. The type and caliber of community support is critical in the initial and subsequent review phases. Numerous letters of support can influence the administering agency or foundation. An applicant may elicit support from local government agencies and public officials. Letters of endorsement detailing exact areas of project sanction and financial or in-kind commitment are often requested as part of a proposal to a federal agency. Several months may be required to develop letters of endorsement, since something of value (e.g., buildings, staff, services) is sometimes negotiated between the parties involved. Note that letters from Members of Congress may be requested once a proposal has been fully developed and is ready for submission.", "While money is the primary concern of most grantseekers, thought should be given to the kinds of nonmonetary contributions that may be available. In many instances, academic institutions, corporations, and other nonprofit groups in the community may be willing to contribute technical and professional assistance, equipment, or space to a worthy project. Not only can such contributions reduce the amount of money being sought, but evidence of such local support is often viewed favorably by most grant-making agencies or foundations.", "Many agencies require, in writing, affiliation agreements (a mutual agreement to share services between agencies) and building space commitments prior to either grant approval or award. Two useful methods of generating community support may be to form a citizen advisory committee or to hold meetings with community leaders who would be concerned with the subject matter of the proposal. The forum may include the following:", "discussion of the merits of the proposal; development of a strategy to create proposal support from a large number of community groups, institutions, and organizations; and generation of data in support of the proposal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying Funding Resources", "paragraphs": ["Once the project has been specifically defined, the grant seeker needs to research appropriate funding sources. Both the applicant and the grantor agency or foundation should have the same interests, intentions, and needs if a proposal is to be considered an acceptable candidate for funding. It is generally not productive to send out proposals indiscriminately in the hope of attracting funding. Grant-making agencies and foundations whose interest and intentions are consistent with those of the applicant are the most likely to provide support. An applicant may cast a wide, but targeted, net. Many projects may only be accomplished with funds coming from a combination of sources, among them federal, state, or local programs and grants from private or corporate foundations.", "The best funding resources are now largely on the internet. Key sources for funding information include the federal government's Assistance Listings at https://beta.sam.gov , and the Foundation Center, http://www.foundationcenter.org , the clearinghouse of private and corporate foundation funding.

When reviewing individual beta.SAM.gov Assistance Listing program descriptions, applicants may also target the related programs as potential resources. Also, the kinds of projects the agency or foundation funded in the past may be helpful in fashioning a grant proposal. Program listings at beta.SAM.gov Assistance Listings or foundation information will often include examples of past funded projects.", "Many federal grants do not go directly to the final beneficiary, but are awarded through \"block\" or \"formula\" grants to state or local agencies which, in turn, distribute the funds (called \"pass-through\"). States may post funding opportunities and subaward grants originating in federal formula or block grant allocations. Grantseekers should look on state government sites for these funding opportunities\u2014each state handles subawarding differently.

Corporations, for example, tend to support projects in areas where they have offices or plants. Most foundations only provide grants to nonprofit organizations (those registered by the Internal Revenue Service as having 501(c) tax-exempt status), though the Foundation Center publishes information about foundation grants to individuals.", "Once a potential grantor agency or foundation is identified, an applicant may contact it and ask for a grant application kit or information. Federal agencies may refer applicants to the website Grants.gov ( http://www.grants.gov ). Later, the grant seeker may ask some of the grantor agency or foundation personnel for suggestions, criticisms, and advice about the proposed project. In many cases, the more agency or foundation personnel know about the proposal, the better the chance of support and of an eventual favorable decision.", "Federal agencies are required to report funding information as funds are approved, increased, or decreased among projects within a given state depending on the type of required reporting. Also, grant seekers may consider reviewing the federal budget for the current and future fiscal years to determine proposed dollar amounts for particular budget functions.", "The grant seeker should carefully study the eligibility requirements for each government or foundation program under consideration (see, for example, the Criteria for Applying and Compliance Requirements sections of the beta.SAM.gov Assistance Listing program description). Federal department and agency websites generally include additional information about their programs. Beta.SAM.gov Assistance Listing program descriptions and websites include information contacts. Applicants should direct questions and seek clarification about requirements and deadlines from the contacts. The applicant may learn that he or she is required to provide services otherwise unintended such as a service to particular client groups, or involvement of specific institutions. It may necessitate the modification of the original concept in order for the project to be eligible for funding. Questions about eligibility should be discussed with the appropriate program officer.", "For federal grants, funding opportunities notices appear on websites such as Grants.gov at http://www.grants.gov or FedConnect at https://www.fedconnect.net . Applicants can search and sign up for email notification of funding opportunities, and download applications packages. To submit applications, registration is required. The grantseeker must also obtain Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) and register with System for Award Management (SAM): Grants.gov provides instructions and links. Deadlines for submitting applications are often not negotiable, though some federal programs do have open application dates (refer to the beta.SAM.gov program description). For private foundation funding opportunities, grant seekers should contact foundations or check the Foundation Center's website for daily postings of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) at http://foundationcenter.org/findfunders/fundingsources/rfp.html .

The concept paper should give a brief description of the needs to be addressed, who is to carry out the project, what is to be accomplished, by what means, how long it will take, how the accomplishments will be measured, plans for the future, how much it will cost, and the ways this proposal relates to the mission of the funding source.", "Developing a concept paper is excellent preparation for writing the final proposal. The grant seeker should try to see the project or activity from the viewpoint of the grant-making agency or foundation. Like the proposal, the concept paper should be brief, clear, and informative. It is important to understand that from the funder's vantage point, the grant is not seen as the end of the process, but only as the midpoint. The funder will want to know what will happen to the project once the grant ends. For example, will it be self-supporting or will it be used as a demonstration to apply for further funding? Will it need ongoing support, for how long, and what are the anticipated outcomes?", "If the funding source expresses interest in the concept paper, the grant seeker can ask for suggestions, criticism, and guidance, before writing the final proposal.", "Feedback and dialogue are essential elements to a successful funding proposal.", "Throughout the proposal writing stage, an applicant may want to keep notes on ideas and related materials for review.

The proposal should be a cohesive whole, building logically, with one section leading to another; this is an especially important consideration when several people have been involved in its preparation. Language should be clear and concise, devoid of jargon; explanations should be offered for acronyms and terms which may be unfamiliar to someone outside the field. Each of the parts of the proposal should provide as brief but informative a narrative as possible, with supporting data relegated to an appendix.", "At various stages in the proposal writing process, the proposal should be reviewed by a number of interested and disinterested parties. Each time it has been critiqued, it may be necessary to rethink the project and its presentation.

Sometimes a pilot study is needed to begin the identification of facts and relationships. Often a thorough literature search may be sufficient.", "Evaluation requires both coordination and agreement among program decisionmakers. Above all, the federal grantor agency's or foundation's requirements should be highlighted in the evaluation design. Grantor agencies also may require specific evaluation techniques such as designated data formats (an existing information collection system) or they may offer financial inducements for voluntary participation in a national evaluation study.

However, it is safer never to anticipate that the income from the grant will be the sole support for larger projects.
