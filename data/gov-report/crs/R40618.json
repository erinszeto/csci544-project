They contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence, gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure, and also provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. Given that about 50% of high school students have experienced sexual intercourse, advocates argue that abstinence-only messages provide no protection against the risks of pregnancy and disease for these youth. They further point out that according to one study, teens who break their virginity pledges were less likely to use contraception the first time than teens who had never made such a promise. In addition, the high number of females under age 25 with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has re-energized efforts to persuade girls and young women to abstain from sexual activity or to use condoms (along with other forms of contraceptives) to prevent or reduce pregnancy as well as reduce their risk of getting STDs.", "Comprehensive sexuality education programs generally include one or more of the following components: (1) information about the benefits of abstinence, (2) information on the use of condoms and other contraceptive devices or methods for those who are sexually active, (3) information on the importance of early identification and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, (4) information on how to resist negative peer pressure, and (5) information on how to improve communication skills (e.g., how to say no).", "Until recent legislation ( P.L. 111-117 and P.L. 111-148 ), there were no federal funding streams that were exclusively for comprehensive sex education in schools. In other words, there was no federal appropriation specifically for comprehensive sex education. Although there was not a federal comprehensive sex education program per se, there were many federal programs that provided information about contraceptives, provided contraceptive services to teens, and provided referral and counseling services related to reproductive health. These programs still provide such services, they include Medicaid Family Planning, Title X Family Planning, and Adolescent Family Life \"care\" demonstration grants . Also, funds from the Maternal and Child Health block grant, the Title XX Social Services block grant, the TANF block grant, and several other Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) programs can be used to provide contraceptive services to teens.", "The following two programs, established in the 111 th Congress, provide exclusive funding for comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention initiatives: (1) the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program (funded at $110 million in FY2010) and (2) the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP; funded at $75 million in FY2010).", "P.L. 111-117 , the Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010, included a new discretionary TPP program that provides grants and contracts, on a competitive basis, to public and private entities to fund \"medically accurate and age appropriate\" programs that reduce teen pregnancy.

The TPP program is administered by the new Office of Adolescent Health within HHS. P.L. 111-117 also provides a separate $4.5 million (within the Public Health Service Act program evaluation funding) to carry out evaluations of teenage pregnancy prevention approaches.

It also provides youth with information on several adulthood preparation subjects (e.g., healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, parent-child communication, educational and career success, and healthy life skills).

They argue that supporting both abstinence and birth control is hypocritical and undermines the strength of an abstinence-only message.

The Title V Abstinence Education program is considered a mandatory program and is funded by mandatory spending. It is a formula grant program. State funding is based on the proportion of low-income children in the state compared to the national total. Funds must be requested by states when they solicit Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) block grant funds and must be used exclusively for teaching abstinence. To receive federal funds, a state must match every $4 in federal funds with $3 in state funds. This means that full funding (from states and the federal government) for abstinence education must total at least $87.5 million annually. The Title V Abstinence Education program was continued through a series of funding extensions.

Overall, the programs improved identification of STDs but had no overall impact on knowledge of unprotected sex risks and the consequences of STDs. Both program and control group youth had a good understanding of the risks of pregnancy but a less clear understanding of STDs and their health consequences.", "In response to the report, HHS (under the Bush Administration) stated that the Mathematica study showcased programs that were among the first funded by the 1996 welfare reform law. It stated that its recent directives to states encouraged states to focus abstinence-only education programs on youth most likely to bear children outside of marriage (i.e., high school students) rather than elementary or middle-school students.

While some child advocates continue to support an abstinence-only program intervention (with some modifications), others argue that an abstinence message integrated into a comprehensive sex education program that includes information on the use of contraceptives and that enhances decision-making skills is a more effective method to prevent teen pregnancy.
