Reports in 2007 by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provided scientific underpinnings for these concerns, and the number of proposals and international meetings devoted to these issues has grown, as discussed in this report. In December 2007, the meeting of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) convened in Bali, Indonesia, and agreed on the \"Bali Action Plan\" to guide negotiations over the next two years, with the goal of formulating by 2009 a decision that would identify the next round of commitments by the nations of the world to address climate change. Several \"Working Group\" meetings are scheduled to work on these issues during 2008, beginning with a meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, in April that formulated a work plan for negotiations.", "The first treaty to address climate change, the UNFCCC was completed and opened for signature in 1992. It includes voluntary commitments to establish national action plans for measures that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The United States was one of the first nations to sign and ratify this treaty, and it entered into force in 1994. However, it was soon concluded by parties to the treaty that mandatory reductions in emissions of the six major greenhouse gases (of which carbon dioxide, mainly from burning of fossil fuels, is the most prevalent) would be required. The resulting Kyoto Protocol, which was completed in 1997 and entered into force in February 2005, committed industrialized nations that ratify it to specified, legally binding reductions in emissions of the six major greenhouse gases. The United States has not ratified the Protocol, and thus is not bound by its provisions. In March 2001, the Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol, and subsequently announced a U.S. policy for climate change that relies on voluntary actions to reduce the \"greenhouse gas intensity\" (ratio of emissions to economic output) of the U.S. economy by 18% over the next 10 years.", "Under the Kyoto Protocol, the collective commitments of the industrialized nations are to reduce the Parties' emissions by at least 5% below their 1990 levels, averaged over the \"commitment period\" 2008 to 2012. Over the past year, several high-level meetings have focused on the need to deal with climate change, including the G-8 meeting in June 2007 and meetings at the United Nations. President Bush announced on May 31, 2007, that the United States would convene a meeting of major economies to begin a series of meetings in Washington, D.C. through 2008 to find a voluntary framework for dealing with energy security and climate change.", "As of November 2007, the UNFCCC Secretariat listed 174 nations and the European Union as parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Australia announced its ratification at the December meeting in Bali. Annual meetings of the parties are to continue, using the Bali \"roadmap\" agreed on in December 2007. Major challenges involve finding agreement on the nature of legally binding commitments, if any, that would prove acceptable to all major players: current parties, developing countries that are major emitters, and the United States."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction and Overview1", "paragraphs": ["Responding to concerns that human activities are increasing concentrations of \"greenhouse gases\" (such as carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere and causing potentially damaging climate change and global warming, nearly all nations of the world joined together in 1992 to sign the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The United States was one of the first nations to ratify this treaty. It included a legally non-binding, voluntary pledge that the major industrialized/developed nations would establish national action plans aiming to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, and that all nations would undertake voluntary actions to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions to the UNFCCC Secretariat.", "The parties to the UNFCCC hold annual meetings called Conferences of the Parties (COPs), at which unresolved issues are negotiated, rules of procedure are established or amended, and reviews of progress are considered. As scientific consensus grew that human activities are having a discernible impact on global climate systems, contributing to a warming of the Earth that could result in major impacts such as sea level rise, changes in weather patterns, and health effects\u2014and as it became apparent that many major nations such as the United States and Japan would not be able to reduce their emissions to 1990 levels by 2000\u2014parties to the treaty decided in 1995 that it would be necessary to move beyond voluntary measures and to enter into legally binding commitments. Negotiations began on a protocol to establish legally binding limitations or reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It was decided by the parties that this round of negotiations would, in keeping with principles established in the UNFCCC, establish limitations only for the developed countries\u2014the 38 nations listed in Annex I to the UNFCCC, including the former Communist countries, plus the European Union, and referred to as \"Annex I countries.\" Developing countries are referred to as \"non-Annex I countries.\"", "A basic principle established in the UNFCCC and continuing in negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol is that parties have \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" in dealing with climate change issues, and that first steps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions should be taken by the Annex I countries. Because developed countries have emitted the largest share of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere (carbon dioxide releases remain in the atmosphere for many decades), and because they are wealthier and more able to incur costs of any necessary changes in their economies, it was agreed by negotiators of the UNFCCC, and subsequently the Kyoto Protocol, that this principle would be a basic tenet of climate negotiations.", "The Kyoto Protocol negotiations were completed in late 1997. The protocol establishes legally binding, mandatory emissions reductions for the six major greenhouse gases . It requires that Annex I countries (listed again in Annex B of the Protocol) reduce their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 5% below 1990 levels (1990 is the baseline for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; 1995 is the baseline year for the other 3 gases), averaged over the \"commitment period\" of 2008 to 2012. Each country was assigned individually negotiated targets which differed according to their situations.", "The United States signed the Protocol in 1998. However, no country is subject to the provisions of a treaty until it has been ratified, which in the United States requires the consent of the U.S. Senate. Because the Senate was on record in mid-1997 in S.Res. 98 , objecting to a treaty that had no mandatory obligations for developing countries, President Clinton did not submit the Protocol to the Senate for advice and consent; therefore the United States did not ratify the Protocol during his Administration. Then in March 2001, soon after President George W. Bush took office, he rejected the Kyoto Protocol, and the United States declined further participation in Kyoto Protocol negotiations. After several years, the required number of Annex I countries had ratified, and the Protocol entered into force in February 2005. As of December 2007, following the announcement that Australia had ratified the Protocol, 175 nations plus the European Union had ratified it, representing over 62% of Annex I countries' 1990 greenhouse gas emissions. Since the United States has not ratified the Protocol, it is not subject to its terms.", "Negotiations continued after the 1997 treaty was finalized in order to put in place the detailed rules for how the Kyoto Protocol would operate and to establish procedures for how its provisions would be carried out. These negotiations were continued through two subsidiary bodies that address technical issues, and then decisions were made at the annual conferences of the parties (COPs) to the UNFCCC until February 2005 when the Kyoto Protocol had achieved the necessary ratifications to enter into force; the annual meeting is now a UNFCCC COP, combined with a \"meeting of the parties (MOP)\" to the Protocol. Thus the annual meetings are now referred to as COP/MOP meetings. The United States continues to participate in the discussions and negotiations of the COPs, but as it is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, it does not participate in Kyoto-related (MOP) negotiations, attending those as an observer.", "In December 2007, COP-13/MOP-3 convened in Bali, Indonesia, and began the process of formulating an agreement that would succeed the Kyoto Protocol when its commitment period ends in 2012. As summarized below in the section on the Bali Action Plan, the negotiations at this meeting were closely watched for signs that the process agreed on would produce an outcome that would be sufficient to the challenge of mitigating and adapting to climate change. Final decisions on what the commitments of developing and developed countries would be were not expected at Bali, but the considerations to be included in negotiations toward these decisions are outlined in the \"Bali Action Plan.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Existing Kyoto Protocol Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The major commitments in the treaty on the key issues are as follows:"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Obligations of All Parties", "paragraphs": ["The Kyoto Protocol calls on all Parties\u2014developed and developing\u2014to take a number of steps outlined in Article 10 to contribute to scientific research and monitoring of the climate system and greenhouse gases in their countries. They are also committed to formulate national and regional programs to improve local emission factors; carry out steps to promote and transfer environmentally sound technologies; strengthen national capacity building activities; and conduct national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks that remove these gases from the atmosphere.", "In keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol recognize the relatively low per capita greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries, and the need to take into account the development activities of these countries that will require increased energy use. The Protocol does not impose any binding requirements on developing countries; the commitments in Article 10 are regarded as essentially voluntary.", "Obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by Annex I countries are the focus of most of the Kyoto Protocol, which outlines the legally binding emissions reductions that the Parties to the treaty are to undertake, and provides for development of procedures and rules that apply to Parties as they move toward meeting these binding obligations. These are briefly summarized below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emissions Reductions", "paragraphs": ["The Kyoto Protocol states that Annex I Parties are committed\u2014individually or jointly\u2014to ensuring that their aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of greenhouse gases do not exceed amounts assigned to each country in Annex B, \"with a view to reducing their overall emissions of such gases by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012.\" Negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol included a nation-by-nation allocation of the percentage each Annex I country would be obligated to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in order to collectively reach the overall 5% reduction agreed to in the Protocol.", "Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol lists 39 nations, including the United States, the European Union plus the individual EU nations, Japan, and many of the former Communist nations (the same countries as Annex I to the UNFCCC). The amounts for each country are listed in this annex as percentages of the base year, 1990 (except for some former Communist countries, which use a more recent year), and range from 92% (a reduction of 8%) for most European countries\u2014to 110% (an increase of 10%) for Iceland. In negotiations on the Protocol, the United States agreed to a commitment on this list to 93%, or a reduction of 7% below 1990 levels. These commitments refer to averages that would be below each Party's 1990 levels for three major greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, (and below 1995 levels for the three other, man-made gases), averaged over the \"commitment period\" 2008 to 2012. (As noted above, only nations that ratify the Protocol are subject to its terms; the United States later rejected participation, and thus is not bound by it.)", "However, two of the most difficult issues unresolved in 1997 at Kyoto and still under discussion are related to counting emissions of a nation, specifically how to take into account: (1) emissions trading\u2014specifically, how much of a country's obligation to reduce emissions can be met through purchasing credits from outside, vs. taking domestic action; and (2) the extent to which carbon sequestration by forests, soils and agricultural practices can be counted toward a country's emission reductions. These are discussed below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation: \"Flexibility\" Mechanisms", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Emissions Trading", "paragraphs": ["Emissions trading is one of three \"flexibility\" mechanisms contained in the Kyoto Protocol (article 17). Under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries are given greenhouse gas emissions \"budgets\" (or emissions \"caps\") for the compliance period 2008-2012 based on a percentage of their 1990 or 1995 emissions levels (depending on the particular greenhouse gas). If a country determined that it would exceed its emissions limit during the compliance period, emissions trading would permit it to purchase emissions reductions \"credits\" from another country that determined it would achieve more emissions reductions than necessary to comply. With emissions trading, countries that can make relatively inexpensive emissions reductions have an incentive to reduce emissions below the level required by the Kyoto Protocol, and sell the extra credits to other countries whose emissions control costs are more expensive. Thus, both the seller and the buyer would have lower costs by virtue of the seller's profit and the buyer's savings. This type of implementation scheme is commonly called a \"cap-and-trade\" program.", "This mechanism, however, comes with significant restrictions under the Kyoto Protocol. First, emissions trading is restricted to countries that have legally binding greenhouse gas emission limitations\u2014the Annex 1 parties, which as noted above includes only developed, industrialized countries that have ratified the Protocol. Another requirement is that emissions credits must \"be supplemental to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitations and reduction commitments....\" However, the Protocol is vague as to what \"supplemental\" means, and the term is subject to continuing interpretation.", "Currently, the largest emissions trading scheme in use under the Kyoto Protocol is the European Union's Emissions Trading system (ETS). The EU-ETS is a cornerstone of the EU's efforts to meet its obligation under the Kyoto Protocol, and it currently covers more than 11,500 energy-intensive facilities across the now 27 EU Member countries, including oil refineries, powerplants over 20 megawatts in capacity, coke ovens, and iron and steel plants, along with cement, glass, lime, brick, ceramics, and pulp and paper installations. Covered entities emit about 45% of the EU's carbon dioxide emissions. The trading program does not cover emissions of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases, which account for about 20% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. The first trading period began January 1, 2005. A second trading period is scheduled to begin in 2008, covering the period of the Kyoto Protocol, with a third period planned for 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)", "paragraphs": ["The Kyoto Protocol supplements the cap-and-trade implementation scheme discussed above with two project-based schemes that permit Annex 1 countries to obtain additional credits that they can use to meet their emission caps. The first is CDM\u2014the only mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol that involves non-Annex 1 countries. Under its provisions, industrialized countries can receive Certified Emissions Reduction credits (CERs) for reductions achieved from a greenhouse gas reduction project in a \"host\" non-Annex 1 country. CERs can then be used by the industrialized country to meet its compliance requirements. The process is overseen by a CDM Executive Board that registers and validates projects, issues CERs, and manages a series of panels and working groups. A critical component of the process is the requirement that CERs issued under the CDM represent only reductions in excess of those that would have occurred in the absence of the project. CERs can be issued from appropriate projects initiated after 2000. In 2005, China, India, and Brazil were estimated by Point Carbon to be responsible for about 63% of the total volume of all projects at the Project Design Document (PDD) stage of development. In the case of China, large volumes of CDM contracts are primarily the result of a few large HFC-23 reduction projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Implementation (JI)", "paragraphs": ["In contrast, JI is a program in which industrialized countries can receive Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) from greenhouse gas reduction projects conducted jointly between two Annex 1 countries. Like CERs, ERUs can be used by the participating countries for compliance purposes. There are two tracks under JI (called Track 1 and Track 2). Track 2 mirrors the process used by the CDM but involves different institutions. Track 1 is a simplified process that puts more of the responsibility on the host country. Like the CDM, ERUs issued under JI must represent reductions achieved in addition to those that would have occurred in the absence of the project. Unlike CDM projects, ERUs can only be transferred beginning in 2008. Romania has been the most active host JI country. However, it should be noted that in 2005, the volumes involved in the project markets were overwhelmingly the result of CDM projects, which accounted for 93% of tonnage transacted (397 million metric tons (MMt) compared with 28 MMt for JI)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Carbon \"Sinks\"", "paragraphs": ["One of the most contentious issues in the negotiations over Kyoto Protocol rules has been how to give nations credit for carbon \"sinks\": forests and land uses that absorb (sequester) carbon from the atmosphere and have the effect of reducing the net additions a country makes to atmospheric CO 2 levels. This has been negotiated under the term \"Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry\" (LULUCF). Issues include how to allocate credit for existing forest cover (of which some nations, like the United States, have a great deal and others have very little) and what actions in relation to LULUCF would constitute legitimate carbon reductions. Only increased sequestration above 1990 levels, achieved by specific sequestration activities, would be counted.", "The final decisions were that only certain activities would be eligible for use as offsets against Protocol obligations: afforestation (planting forest cover where there had been none); reforestation (re-planting tree cover where it had been removed); deforestation prevention; forest management; cropland management; grazing land management; and revegetation. The rules of the Protocol do not put an overall cap on sinks for countries, but instead incorporated country-specific limits on each of the categories of sinks activities, listed in an Appendix Z. Exactly how carbon absorbed in sinks will count toward a nation's obligations is still the subject of on-going discussion and refinement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance Mechanism", "paragraphs": ["Achieving agreement among Kyoto Protocol negotiators on compliance\u2014in particular, penalties for non-compliance by Annex B Protocol parties\u2014was difficult, and took several years after the Protocol was finalized in 1997. This was one of several controversial issues that was resolved as part of the Marrakech accords at the COP-7 meeting in 2001. In the final rules on compliance, parties agreed that if a Party falls short of its emissions target during the first commitment period (2008 to 2012), it must make up the difference in the second commitment period plus a penalty of 30%. Such a party will lose its eligibility for emissions trading, and must develop a \"compliance action plan.\"", "This decision included establishment of a Compliance Committee, composed of a plenary, an operational bureau, and two branches: the Facilitative Branch and the Enforcement Branch. The Facilitative Branch is intended to provide advice and assistance to Parties, and to provide an \"early warning\" to Parties that may be in danger of not complying; the Enforcement Branch would have the responsibility of applying consequences for Parties that do not meet their commitments. A Protocol rulebook provides procedures for considering cases of non-compliance or possible non-compliance, and a procedure for reviewing the cases regarding eligibility to participate in the Protocol's financial and other mechanisms.", "Compliance involves not only meeting emissions reductions commitments, but also preparation of adequate GHG inventories and several other procedural requirements; there are no penalties for failures of compliance in these areas. However, the mechanism's penalties for failure to meet emissions reductions targets would come into play only when the commitment period is well underway; there remain a number of uncertainties as to how it will function.

The Kyoto Protocol parties were also reluctant to discuss new commitments in the post-Kyoto period if they did not include all the major emitters\u2014including the United States, China, and India.

A non-binding, two-year \"dialogue on long-term cooperation\" was launched under the auspices of the UNFCCC that includes the United States and all parties to the UNFCCC (virtually all of the world's countries). The decision on establishing the dialogue specifically ruled out including any negotiations leading to new commitments. Its goals are to support implementation of existing commitments under the Convention, support voluntary actions by developing countries, and to support development of national and international responses to climate change. The areas of focus for these discussions are: sustainable development, adaptation, technology development and transfer, and market-based opportunities.", "Both of these processes involve workshops and meetings with reports to the COP/MOP meetings in 2006 and 2007.

The Nairobi meeting also included the beginning of a review of the Protocol's effectiveness\u2014a somewhat controversial issue because of the implications the review process is thought to have for future commitments. Little progress was made at this COP/MOP, however, and decisions on the scope and content of the review were put off until the COP-14/MOP-4 to be held in 2008.

As the language was debated in the final plenary session, some of the developing countries reassured participants that they had made a commitment to consider mitigation actions in the negotiations that would follow. However, the United States was concerned that \"measurable, reportable and verifiable\" in the adopted language appears to apply mainly or only to the financing, technology and related actions, and its applicability to mitigation actions by developing countries is unclear. The language as adopted does appear ambiguous on this point.

After a rocky start resulting primarily from data shortcomings, several positives have emerged from the \"learning by doing\" exercise that may assist the ETS in making the Kyoto compliance phase run more smoothly, including (1) greatly improving emissions data, (2) encouraging development of the Kyoto Protocol's project-based mechanisms\u2014Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI), and (3) influencing corporate behavior to begin pricing in the value of allowances in decision-making, particularly in the electric utility sector. However, several issues that arose during the trial phase remain contentious as the ETS moves into its Kyoto phase, including allocation schemes, shutdown credits and new entrant reserves, and others. In addition, the expansion of the EU and the implementation of the directives linking the ETS to the Kyoto Protocol project-based mechanisms created new issues to which the EC has had to respond.", "The EU has consistently stated that it will meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and is currently developing targets for the post-2012 period. In 2006, the European Environmental Agency (EEA)projected the 15 EU Members that had jointly agreed to reduce GHGs by 8% below 1990 levels during the Kyoto compliance period would meet their obligation as a whole, although seven of those countries would not meet their individual obligations. The status of EU countries as estimated by the EEA is shown in Table 1 . As shown, the EEA estimated that all 10 of the new Member countries with obligations under the treaty would meet them. The EEA also estimated that non-EU countries Iceland and Switzerland would meet their obligations, while Liechtenstein and Norway would not. Interestingly, in October 2007, the EC announced agreement on linking the ETS with emission trading systems in Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. The other major European signatory, the Russian Federation, is anticipated to meet its obligations under the treaty.", "Outside Europe, the primary Kyoto signatories are New Zealand, Canada, and Japan. In September 2007, the New Zealand government decided to phase in an emission trading scheme beginning in 2008 (last stage beginning in 2013) to assist New Zealand in complying with its Kyoto obligations. However, the Government's most recent analysis estimates the country will not comply with its Kyoto obligations, although that projection only reflects policies adopted as of April 2007. In contrast, Canada has simply stated that it cannot meet its Kyoto obligations and the government has adopted alternative goals. Finally, Japan is anticipated to have difficulties meeting its Kyoto obligations, and has been developing strategies to acquire substantial credits from the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms (JI and CDM) in an attempt to bridge the expected gap between Japanese emissions and Japan's Kyoto target.", "Because of the flexibility mechanisms discussed above, potential compliance with Kyoto is not necessarily threatened by emissions growth in some countries, since such nations can purchase emissions credits to offset some of their emissions increases. Indeed, current analyses of credits available from economies in transition (mostly eastern European countries) indicate that sufficient surplus credits will exist in such countries to cover the deficit created by emissions growth in other countries. Specifically, as indicated by Figure 1 , surplus credits are anticipated in Russia, Ukraine, and other eastern European countries\u2014sufficient surplus credits for other countries anticipated to have deficits (such as parts of the EU, Japan, and New Zealand) to purchase them in order to cover their compliance requirements.", "This long position with respect to credits does not include anticipated CERs and ERUs from CDM and JI projects. As indicated by Figure 2 , the potential for additional credits from these sources is substantial, particularly from China. Of course, there is a range of risk with respect to these sources (including the possibility that any given project may not be built or may not be certified as valid for issuing CERs or ERUs), but indications are that additional credits will be available from these sources.", "There are some potential potholes on the road to compliance. Perhaps the most important is the requirement that credits gained through emissions trading and joint implementation be \"supplemental to domestic actions.\" This requirement under Article 17 has been subject to extensive discussion and interpretation. Resisting efforts by the EU to place a quantitative limit on the procurement of credit via these mechanisms, the Conference of Parties decided to put no quantitative limit on such mechanisms, but that \"the use of the mechanism shall be supplemental to domestic action and domestic action shall thus constitute a significant element of the effort made by each party.\" No means of determining the significance of domestic actions has been finalized. As noted, some countries, such as Japan, are anticipated to use the mechanisms substantially in meeting their requirements.", "Another major issue to be resolved is the volatility of the credit markets at the current time. Credit prices for the ETS during its \"learning by doing\" phase have ranged from less than 1 euro a ton to about 30 euro a ton\u2014currently the price is less than 1 euro. Such volatility makes planning, implementation, and participation in emissions reduction programs difficult."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Positions", "paragraphs": ["The United States took an active role in the negotiations that shaped the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

GHG intensity has been declining in the United States, and the 18% reduction goal compares to a projected \"business as usual\" decline in intensity of 14% for the 10-year period. According to some, the 18% goal would not achieve reductions of greenhouse gases significantly more than the existing trend.", "The Administration stated that the goal, to be met through voluntary action, is to achieve efficiency improvements that would reduce the 183 metric tons of emissions per million dollars of gross domestic product (GDP) expected under \"business as usual\" to 151 metric tons in 2012.
