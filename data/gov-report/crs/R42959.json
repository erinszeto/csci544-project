The exemption applies to total bequests and gifts (separate from the annual inter-vivos gift exemption of $15,000 per donee for 2018). Transfers between spouses are exempted, and any unused exemption can be inherited by a surviving spouse. Other elements of the tax remain, including deductions for charitable bequests and a number of special provisions for farms and small businesses.", "The permanent tax treatment of estates and gifts had been uncertain for some time. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16), among other tax cuts, provided for a gradual reduction and elimination of the estate tax. Under EGTRRA, the estate tax exemption rose from $675,000 in 2001 to $3.5 million in 2009, and the rate fell from 55% to 45%. In 2010, the estate tax was eliminated. There was general agreement that some sort of estate tax would be retained. A proposal to make the 2009 rules ($3.5 million exemption and 45% rate) permanent was included in President Obama's 2010 and 2011 budget outlines and was passed by the House in December 2009. In addition, in 2009, Senate Democratic leaders supported the plan to enact the 2009 rules permanently. The Senate Republican leadership proposed a $5 million exemption and 35% rate. This latter provision was eventually adopted for a two-year period, through 2012. For estates of decedents in 2010, either the 2010 or 2011 rules could have been elected. Spouses can inherit unused exemptions. The permanent provisions retain most of the rules adopted for 2011 and 2012, but with a higher rate.", "Compared with the $1 million exemption and 55% rate under pre-EGTRRA law, the 2013 permanent rules were estimated to lose an average of about $37 billion over the next 10 years, a two-thirds reduction in estate tax revenues. The increase in the exemption level costs around $10 billion per year, a further reduction of about 40% of projected revenues.", "Regardless of the exemption levels considered, few estates are affected by the tax. The estate tax is a highly progressive tax, with about three-fourths collected from estates in which decedents are in the top 1% of the income distribution. At a $5 million exemption, less than 0.2% of estates will be subject to the tax. Although concerns have been raised about the effects of the tax on small businesses and farmers, estimates indicate that only a small share of these decedents are affected.", "Budget proposals during the Obama Administration proposed a return to the 2009 rates and exemptions. They also proposed a variety of structural reforms, including restricting Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs), providing consistent valuation for estate tax and basis for capital gains, limiting the duration of generation-skipping trusts, and providing consistent treatment of grantor trusts along with some other minor changes. Prior provisions would have disallowed minority discounts (for estates left to a family partnership) and addressed other aspects of GRATs.

Transfers to spouses remain exempt, but spouses can inherit any unused portion of the exemption from each other, so that the combined exemption for a couple was $10 million in 2011. Other estate tax deductions, such as those for charitable contributions, are retained. A number of special rules for farms and small businesses are retained.

These provisions include the ability of family businesses to pay any estate tax due in installments with only the interest payments during part of the installment period, special use valuations, and conservation easements. Minority discounts, although granted by courts rather than specifically in the law, may also benefit small businesses. Minority discounts are allowed when assets are left to a family partnership in which no individual has a controlling share and are thus deemed to lose value for that reason.", "Although the estate tax return is due within nine months of the death, small businesses are allowed to defer payment (except for interest) for the next five years, and pay the remaining installment payments over 10 years.

To illustrate, consider a 50% tax rate. Assuming the exemption is already used, to provide a gift of $1 million costs $1.5 million: the tax rate of 50% is applied to the gift of $1 million for a $0.5 million tax. To provide a net amount of $1 million for a bequest, $2 million is required: a tax of $1 million (50% of $2 million) and a net to the heir of $1 million.

The exemption would have reverted to $1 million (a value that had already been scheduled for pre-EGTRRA law) and the rate to 55% (with some graduated rates). The carryover basis provision effective in 2010 would be eliminated (so that heirs would not be taxed on gain accumulated during the decedent's life when they inherit assets).", "During debate on the estate tax, most agreed that the 2010 provisions would not be continued and, indeed, could be repealed retroactively. President Obama proposed a permanent extension of the 2009 rules (a $3.5 million exemption and a 45% tax rate), and the House provided for that permanent extension on December 3, 2009 ( H.R. 4154 ). The Senate Democratic leadership indicated a plan to retroactively reinstate the 2009 rules for 2010 and beyond. Senate Minority Leader McConnell proposed an alternative of a 35% tax rate and a $5 million exemption. A similar proposal for a $5 million exemption and a 35% rate, which also included the ability of the surviving spouse to inherit any unused exemption of the decedent, is often referred to as Lincoln-Kyl (named after the two Senators who supported it). Proposals were also made to begin with the $3.5 million exemption and 45% rate and phase in the $5 million exemption and 55% rate. Others had argued for permanent estate tax repeal. At the end of 2010, a temporary two-year extension, with a $5 million exemption, a 35% rate, and inheritance of unused spousal exemptions was enacted in P.L. 111-312 .

The doubling of the exemption would reduce that share to 0.05%. The estate tax is concentrated among high-income taxpayers: 91% is paid by the top quintile, 60.4% by the top 1%, and 26% by the top 0.1%. The concentration in upper income categories would be increased with the higher temporary exemption levels. About 0.2% of estates with half or more of their assets in businesses will be subject to the estate tax under the permanent rules, and less with the higher exemption levels. About 100 farm estates (or approximately two per state) are projected to be subject to the estate tax, and constitute 1.8% of taxable estates according to a projection from a CBO study. If the number of farm estates fall in proportion to the number of estates in general, around 25 farm estates (one estate every two years per state) would be taxable with the higher exemption level enacted in 2017. Less than a quarter of taxable farm estates (0.4% of all farm estates) are projected to have inadequate liquidity to pay estate taxes. The Department of Agriculture, using a somewhat different measure of what constitutes a farm, projects less than 1% (0.4%) of farm operator estates is projected to pay the tax, totaling 153 estates.
