Discretionary spending is controlled through the appropriations process. Appropriations legislation is considered each fiscal year and provides funding for numerous programs such as national defense, education, and homeland security. Direct spending, alternately, is provided for in legislation outside of appropriations acts. Direct spending programs are typically established in permanent law and continue in effect until such time as revised or terminated by another law.", "The budget resolution establishes congressional priorities by dividing spending among the 20 major functional categories of the federal budget. These 20 categories do not correspond to the committee system by which Congress operates, and as a result these spending levels must be \"crosswalked\" to the House and Senate committees having jurisdiction over both discretionary and direct spending. These amounts are known as 302(a) allocations and hold committees accountable for staying within the spending limits established by the budget resolution.", "Each Appropriations Committee is responsible for subdividing its 302(a) allocation among its 12 subcommittees. These allocations, referred to as 302(b) subdivisions, establish the maximum amount that each of the 12 appropriations bills can spend.", "It is inevitable that Members will consider the impact on particular programs or agencies when they consider a budget resolution.

Direct spending programs are typically established in permanent law that continue in effect until such time as they are revised or terminated by another law. The actual annual cost of direct spending is not determined by Congress. It is instead dictated by formulas within the legislation providing for the program. The overall cost of a program depends on the eligibility requirements and benefits set forth in the legislation. These criteria determine who will be eligible to receive benefits and how much benefit they will receive.

The funding level is $738 million above the President's request and would accommodate significant increases for programs such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and biorefinery R&D, hydrogen, and vehicle/building technologies. This funding level would also provide $450 million for the Weatherization Assistance Program, a program which was zeroed out in the President's budget.", "Report language, however, is not binding on the committees with jurisdiction over spending and revenue.

Budget resolutions frequently include \"Sense of the Congress\" language expressing the assumptions or desires of one or both chambers for certain programs to receive priority in funding.

This resolution includes funding for a new interagency initiative to address such regional ecosystems. It also includes funding to work with Great Lakes States, tribes, local communities, and organizations to more effectively address issues prioritized in the Great Lakes Regional Collaborative.

Each of these subcommittees is responsible for reporting one regular appropriations bill. Sometimes these bills are packaged together in what is referred to as an omnibus appropriations act.", "Once an Appropriations Committee has received its 302(a) allocation, it then subdivides the committee allocation among its subcommittees as soon as practicable after the budget resolution has been adopted. These suballocations are known as 302(b) subdivisions. The appropriations committees may make allocations among subcommittees, even if they do not correspond with the levels set forth in the functional categories of the budget resolution. Section 302(c) of the Budget Act provides a point of order against the consideration of any appropriations measures before the Appropriations Committee reports its subdivisions.", "The appropriations committees are then required to report these subdivisions to their respective chambers.

Since appropriations subcommittees usually report their bills at the maximum level of spending, amendments offered to the appropriations bill on the floor are often vulnerable to being ruled out of order since they would cause the spending to exceed the 302(b). ", "This rule, combined with other rules and practices, makes it difficult to rearrange spending priorities within an appropriations bill through amendments on the floor.

Reconciliation instructions are in the form of a directive to a specific committee to recommend legislative changes. These instructions are specific and include (1) the committee responsible for making the change, (2) the dollar amount of the change, and (3) the period over which this change should be measured. Reconciliation instructions also include a deadline for the committee to submit such recommendations. For example, the budget resolution for FY2006 included the following reconciliation instruction:", "(a) SUBMISSIONS TO SLOW THE GROWTH IN MANDATORY SPENDING- (1) Not later than September 16, 2005, the House committees named in paragraph (2) shall submit their recommendations to the House Committee on the Budget.

For example, the instructions in the above example resulted in Title I of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 ), a reconciliation act. Other titles of that measure included language to make changes in Medicare (Title V), Medicaid and SCHIP (Title VI), and LIHEAP (Title IX). Similarly, reconciliation acts in other years have included titles making changes in diverse direct spending programs as well.", "The reconciliation process begins when Congress includes reconciliation instructions in a budget resolution directing one or more committees to recommend changes in current law to achieve the levels of direct spending, revenues, or the debt limit agreed to in the budget resolution. Committees respond to these instructions by drafting legislative language to meet their specified targets. The legislative language recommended by committees is packaged \"without any substantive revision\" into one or more reconciliation bills by the House and Senate Budget Committees. If only a single committee is instructed to recommend reconciliation changes then those changes are reported directly to its respective chamber. Once reported, reconciliation legislation is considered under special procedures on the House and Senate floor."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reserve Funds", "paragraphs": ["Spending allocations may be revised subsequent to the adoption of the budget resolution if provided for in the budget resolution.

Typically these conditions consist of legislation dealing with a particular policy being reported by the appropriate committee or an amendment dealing with that policy being offered on the floor. Once this action has taken place, the Budget Committee chairman submits the adjustment to his respective chamber.", "Reserve funds frequently require that the net budgetary impact of the specified legislation be deficit neutral. Deficit-neutral reserve funds provide that a committee may report legislation with spending in excess of its allocations, but require the excess amounts be \"offset\" by equivalent amounts. The Budget Committee chairman may then increase the committee spending allocations by the appropriate amounts to prevent a point of order under Section 302 of the Budget Act. For example, the budget resolution for FY2009 included the following language providing for a deficit-neutral reserve fund concerning San Joaquin River restoration and Navajo nation water rights settlements:", "In the House, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget may revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution for any bill, joint resolution, amendment, or conference report that would fulfill the purposes of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act or implement a Navajo Nation water rights settlement and other provisions authorized by the Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act by the amounts provided in such measure if such measure would not increase the deficit or decrease the surplus for the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2013 or for the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2018.", "Reserve funds are not always required to be deficit-neutral. They may, instead, allow the levels of spending set forth in the budget resolution to be exceeded, as long as the policy legislation meets the conditions of the reserve fund. In some instances, the increases authorized by a reserve fund are limited to specified amounts."], "subsections": []}]}}
