In addition, many have advocated enacting as law some ESA regulations promulgated during the Clinton Administration.", "The ESA has been one of the more contentious environmental laws. This may stem from its strict substantive provisions, which can affect the use of both federal and nonfederal lands and resources. Under the ESA, species of plants and animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate) can be listed as endangered or threatened according to assessments of their risk of extinction. Once a species is listed, powerful legal tools are available to aid its recovery and protect its habitat. The ESA may also be controversial because dwindling species are usually harbingers of broader ecosystem decline: the most common cause of listing species is habitat loss.", "The authorization for spending under the ESA expired on October 1, 1992. The prohibitions and requirements of the ESA remain in force, even in the absence of an authorization, and funds have been appropriated to implement the administrative provisions of the ESA in each subsequent fiscal year. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 3824 and S. 2110 proposed to extensively amend and reauthorize the ESA; the House passed H.R. 3824 (amended) on September 29, 2005. Proponents of both bills argued that they were designed to make the ESA more effective by redefining the relationship between private and public property uses and species protection, implementing new incentives for species conservation, and removing what some see as undue land use restrictions. However, critics argued that proposed changes created gaps in the ESA safety net of protections and prohibitions.", "The 109th Congress enacted legislation that (1) established a pilot project in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico to better coordinate consultations and the preparation of biological opinions under ESA \u00a77 (P.L. 109-58); (2) authorized certain activities related to the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program (P.L. 109-103); (3) reauthorized Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basin endangered fish recovery programs (P.L. 109-183); (4) expanded a Hawaiian National Wildlife Refuge to protect habitat for endangered waterbirds (P.L. 109-225); (5) expanded the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to assist private landowners in restoring, enhancing, and managing endangered and threatened species habitat on private land through the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program (P.L. 109-294); (6) reauthorized and amended the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the Great Ape Conservation Act of 2000 (P.L. 109-363); and (7) established programs to manage marine debris and address its adverse effects on endangered species (P.L. 109-449).

A stated purpose of the ESA is to protect the ecosystems of which listed species are a part. Under the ESA, species of plants and animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate) may be listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction. More flexible management can be provided for species listed as threatened. Distinct population segments may also be listed as threatened or endangered, but only of vertebrate species. Consequently, some populations of chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California are protected under the ESA, even as other healthy populations of these same species in Alaska are not listed and may be commercially harvested. More limited protection is available for plant species under the ESA. Once a species is listed, powerful legal tools, including penalties and citizen suits, are available to aid species recovery and protect habitat.

Of the 1,311 U.S. species (an increase of 49 species since December 31, 2002), 1,070 are covered in recovery plans (an increase of 70 species since December 31, 2002). Of the U.S. species, 475 have designated critical habitat (CH) in some portion of their range.", "At times, efforts to protect and recover listed species are controversial; declining species often function like the proverbial canary in the coal mine, by flagging larger issues of resource scarcity and altered ecosystems. Past resource debates in which ESA-listed species were part of larger issues include Tennessee's Tellico Dam (water storage and construction jobs versus farmland protection and tribal graves, as well as snail darters); Pacific northwest timber harvest (protection of logging jobs and communities versus commercial and sport fishing, recreation, and ecosystem protection, as well as salmon and spotted owls); and Texas's Edwards Aquifer (allocation of water among various users with differing short- and long-term interests, as well as several spring-dependent species)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Provisions of Domestic Law", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Listing", "paragraphs": ["Species may be listed on the initiative of the appropriate Secretary or by petition from an individual, group, or state agency.

The Secretary may postpone designation for up to one year after listing, if the information is not determinable (16 U.S.C. \u00a71533). As of June 16, 2006, FWS had designated CH for 36% of listed domestic species.", "As a practical matter, CH has not been designated for most listed species largely because FWS prefers to allocate its limited resources to listing new species, based on its regulation (50 C.F.R. \u00a7402.02) that takes away much of the legal value of designating CH to the recovery of the species. Yet FWS consistently loses legal challenges for failure to designate CH, and several courts have found the regulation in question to be an erroneous interpretation of the law, because it does not take into account the duty to avoid adverse modification of CH. Others have asserted the value of CH; for example, scientists with the Center for Biological Diversity published a study in April 2005, concluding that CH designation enhances species recovery. On April 28, 2006, the Keystone Center's ESA Working Group on Habitat released a report on habitat protection and the ESA. One of the conclusions of participants in this study was that identification of the habitat that species require to recover is better done in the context of recovery planning, after more rigorous analysis and deliberation have been completed, rather than at the time of listing.", "CH is frequently misunderstood by the public as posing a significant direct restriction on private landowners' authority to manage land. While a landowner may experience some additional procedures and possible restrictions on land management because of the presence of an ESA-listed species (through the ESA's prohibitions on taking a listed species), and the presence of CH may shed light on whether \"harm\" has occurred, the duty to avoid adverse modification of CH is an express obligation only for federal agencies and actions, or private (nonfederal) actors in actions with a federal nexus (i.e., actions that involve any federal funding, permit, or license).

To review the possible effects of their actions on listed species and CH, federal agencies must consult with the appropriate Secretary. If the Secretary finds that an action would jeopardize a listed species or destroy or adversely modify CH, the Secretary must suggest reasonable and prudent alternatives that would avoid these harms. Pending completion of the consultation process, agencies may not make irretrievable commitments of resources that would foreclose any alternatives. The Secretary issues a written statement, called a biological opinion , that may allow the agency or the applicant to take individuals of a species incidental to otherwise lawful activities without triggering the ESA's penalties, subject to terms and conditions specified in the opinion (16 U.S.C. \u00a71536), or may conclude that jeopardy cannot be avoided, in which case the agency may seek an exemption for the action from the Endangered Species Committee.", "For actions without a federal nexus (i.e., no federal funding, permit, or license), the appropriate Secretary may issue permits under \u00a710 of the ESA to allow the incidental take of species during otherwise lawful actions. An applicant for a permit must submit a habitat conservation plan (HCP) that shows the likely impact of the planned action; steps to be taken to minimize and mitigate the impact; funding for the mitigation; alternatives that were considered and rejected; and any other measures that the Secretary may require.

To date, this process has been little used and only one exemption (Grayrocks Dam, WY) has been granted and carried out. The committee is required to accept the President's determination (under specified circumstances) on an exemption in declared disaster areas. The ESA committee must grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense determines that an exemption is necessary for national security (16 U.S.C. \u00a71536).

Since a major goal of the ESA is the recovery of species to the point at which ESA protection is no longer necessary, this seems a good starting point. Since the ESA was enacted in 1973, 40 U.S. and foreign species have been delisted. The reasons cited by FWS are (a) recovery (17); (b) extinction (9, but some may have been extinct when listed); (c) new understanding of the taxonomy of the species, making some ineligible for listing under current law (7); and (d) new information, including a determination that erroneous data were provided to FWS at the time of listing (7). Recovered species include alligators, peregrine falcons (two subspecies), and three species of kangaroos. Extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow, Guam broadbill (a bird), and two small fish living in desert springs. However, it can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that or, in fact, are already extinct. For example, a rare shorebird thought by many to be extinct was rediscovered in a remote area of Canada a few years ago; it might just as easily have quietly gone extinct without being rediscovered. Rare species are, by definition, hard to find.", "Some have asserted that the ESA is a failure since only 17 species have been delisted as recovered, as of January 25, 2006. Others note that full recoveries are relatively few because the two principal causes of extinction\u2014habitat loss and invasive non-native species\u2014are increasing. In addition, some scientific studies have demonstrated that most species are listed only after they become very depleted (e.g., median population of 407 animals for endangered vertebrates, according to one study), thereby making recovery difficult. Another measure of \"success\" might be the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, even if the species are not actually delisted. If this standard is used, the ESA could be considered a success, since a large number (41%, according to one study) of listed species have improved or stabilized their population levels after listing. Other species (e.g., red wolves and California condors) might not exist at all without ESA protection, and this too might be considered a measure of success, although these species are still rare.", "On May 17, 2005, the House Committee on Resources released an oversight report entitled Implementation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 .

Conflicts between the ESA and property owners come about despite the existence of ESA mechanisms intended to soften its impact on property owners.", "Under the Fifth Amendment, property cannot be \"taken\" by the United States without just compensation. The Supreme Court has long tried, with limited success, to define which government actions affect private property so severely as to effect such a \"taking.\" In briefest outline, government actions usually are deemed a taking when they cause either a permanent physical occupation of private property or a total elimination of its economic use. When the government restriction removes only part, but not all, of the property's use or value, a three-factor balancing test is used. Although these factors have been little explicated by the courts, it is clear that for a taking to occur, the property impact must be severe. Moreover, except for physical takings, the property impact is assessed with regard to the property as a whole, not just the regulated portion.", "More than a dozen court decisions have addressed takings challenges to ESA restrictions on land or other property, with all but one finding no taking. These cases have involved restrictions on timber cutting, reductions in water delivery to preserve instream flows needed by listed species, restrictions on shooting marauding animals resulting in loss of livestock, and prohibitions on the transport or sale of endangered species. In several of these cases, the taking claim failed because it was filed in the wrong court or was not \"ripe.\" Where taking claims were reached by the court, they were rejected principally because the economic impact was insufficient as to the property as a whole, or because of the longstanding principle that the government is not responsible for the actions of wild animals. In the one decision favoring the property owner, ESA-related cutbacks in water delivered by a state reclamation project to water districts were held a taking by the United States of state-contract-created water rights. This decision has been controversial for several reasons, including the Department of Justice's settlement of the case (for $16.7 million) despite arguments pressed on it from several quarters that the case was incorrectly decided.", "ESA critics want the ESA amended to afford compensation for a broader range of property impacts than the Constitution provides\u2014perhaps by specifying a fixed percentage of ESA-related property value loss, above which compensation must always be paid.

Modifications to the no surprises rule required revoking an incidental take permit if the permitted taking would be inconsistent with the survival and recovery of the relevant listed species, and the inconsistency was not remedied in a timely fashion. These rules were reproposed and finalized in response to litigation, but may still present issues raised previously. Federal managers also focused on listing species as threatened rather than endangered, to allow FWS to take advantage of the ESA's more flexible provisions for protecting threatened species.
