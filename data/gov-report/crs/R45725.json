The act provides a significant degree of protection for U.S. shipyards, domestic carriers, and American merchant sailors. It is a subject of debate because some experts point out that it leads to high domestic ocean shipping costs and constrains the availability of ships for domestic use. The Jones Act has come into prominence amid debates over Puerto Rico's economic challenges and recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017; in the investigation into the sinking of the ship El Faro with 33 fatalities during a hurricane in 2015; and in discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been the subject of attention in conjunction with a congressional directive that the Administration develop a national maritime strategy, including strategies to increase the use of short sea shipping and enhance U.S. shipbuilding capability.", "The Jones Act of 1920 was not the first law requiring that vessels transporting cargo domestically be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. It restated a long-standing restriction that was temporarily suspended during World War I. Since 1920, Congress has enacted provisions that could be said to tighten Jones Act requirements as well as provisions that exempt certain maritime activity from the requirements. In 1935, Congress forbade Jones Act-qualified vessels that were sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign flag to subsequently requalify as Jones Act-eligible (P.L. 74-191). This provides additional protection from competition for Jones Act carriers if coastal shipping demand increases, because it can take around two years to construct a new ship. In 1940, Congress expanded the Jones Act to include towing and salvage vessels (P.L. 76-599). In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material required use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel, such that transport of dredge spoil or municipal waste would fall under the law (P.L. 100-329). Generally, dredging and towing vessels, as well as Great Lakes ships, have occasioned less debate about the Jones Act than oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels.", "Congress has enacted numerous exemptions or exceptions to the Jones Act. In some cases, Congress has enacted an exemption if there are no Jones Act-qualified carriers interested in providing service in a particular market (for example, passenger travel to and from Puerto Rico). Congress has allowed waivers of the Jones Act for national defense reasons, which most often have been executed to speed fuel deliveries to a region after a natural disaster disrupted normal supply lines.", "Regulatory interpretations of the Jones Act have been significant in defining what constitutes a \"U.S.-built\" vessel, what constitutes \"transportation\" between two U.S. points, and what are \"U.S. points.\" The Coast Guard has determined that a U.S.-built vessel can be assembled with major foreign components such as engines, propellers, and stern and bow sections. This interpretation has been consistent from the late 1800s. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has determined that cruise ship voyages that involve visits to foreign ports in addition to a domestic port are not domestic transportation and therefore not subject to the Jones Act. This interpretation also dates to the late 1800s. CBP's interpretations of what constitutes domestic transportation and U.S. points are significant to the offshore oil industry, as some of the vessels supporting that industry must be Jones Act-compliant while others need not be.", "By long-standing agreement, the military is to utilize U.S.-flag commercial ships for sealift before it utilizes government-owned vessels in its reserve fleet. Jones Act mariners are expected to crew sealift ships when needed, and thus the decades-long shrinkage of the oceangoing Jones Act fleet and mariner pool has been raised as a concern. The Department of Defense is planning to buy more used foreign-built ships for sealift rather than building them in the United States for cost reasons. It also has found that repairing its current fleet in U.S. shipyards is three times more expensive and has taken twice as long as estimated.", "Much of the commercial fleet is relatively old, raising safety concerns. Some useful types of ships are missing from the Jones Act-qualified fleet, such as heavy-lift vessels, liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, and deepwater offshore construction vessels. Both situations appear to some observers to be contrary to the policy goal of the Jones Act, which is to \"have a merchant marine of the best equipped and most suitable types of vessels sufficient to carry the greater portion of its commerce and serve as a naval or military auxiliary in times of war or national emergency.\""], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Jones Act, which refers to Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (P.L. 66-261), requires that vessels transporting cargo from one U.S. point to another U.S. point be U.S.-built, and owned and crewed by U.S. citizens.

Rather, it was a restatement of a long-standing restriction that was temporarily suspended during World War I by P.L. 65-73, enacted October 6, 1917. ", "Laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet over a foreign fleet were initiated by the third act of the First Congress (1 Stat. 27, enacted July 20, 1789), which assessed lesser duties on vessels built and owned domestically than on those foreign-built and -owned. On September 1 of the same year, Congress specified that only a U.S.-built vessel owned by U.S. citizens and with a U.S. citizen captain could register as a U.S. vessel (1 Stat. 55). In 1817, Congress enacted a precursor to the Jones Act by disallowing any vessel wholly or partially foreign-owned from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports (3 Stat. 351). In 1886, this prohibition was extended to vessels transporting passengers domestically (24 Stat. 81). ", "The early United States had a comparative advantage in shipbuilding due to its ample supplies of large timber. During the second half of the 1800s, it lost that advantage as wooden sailing ships gave way to iron steamships, with the advantage shifting to Scotland and England. Congress began debating how to respond to the steep drop-off in the share of U.S. foreign trade carried by U.S. vessels. The fall-off in domestic coastwise transport was less severe, but railroads began offering competition to coastal shipping. Proposals to allow foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag became known as the \"free ship\" movement. Opponents of the free ship movement argued that the higher cost of U.S. crews in and of itself would prevent a resurgence of trade carried by U.S. vessels even if foreign-built ships were allowed. While bills that would have allowed foreign-built vessels to qualify for U.S.-flag international service were reported by House and Senate committees in the late 1800s, it was in 1912 that Congress enacted such a measure (P.L. 62-33, 37 Stat. 562). Thus, since 1912, the domestic build requirement has principally applied to vessels making domestic voyages. ", "In the late 1800s, Congress considered but did not pass bills that would have allowed foreign-built ships in domestic trade. Rather, Congress tightened the language concerning coastwise transport in response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. For instance, in 1891 a shipper loaded 250 kegs of nails at the Port of New York with an ultimate destination of Los Angeles (Redondo).The shipper loaded the merchandise on a foreign-flag ship bound for Antwerp, Belgium, where the goods were transferred to another foreign-flag ship bound for Los Angeles. Despite the circuitous routing and extra port charges, the freight charges were apparently less than they would have been using a U.S.-built and U.S.-owned ship to carry the nails directly between New York and Los Angeles. A court found that the shipper had acted legally. Similarly, shipments from Seattle to Alaska often were routed via Vancouver, Canada, so shippers could use foreign-flag ships for both legs. Congress amended the coastwise law in 1893 (27 Stat. 455) and again in 1898 (30 Stat. 248) to prohibit shippers from routing cargo through a foreign port so as to avoid coastwise laws. ", "Nonetheless, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. In the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, Senator Wesley Jones of Washington, chair of the Commerce Committee, sought to stop this practice by requiring Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle by amending the coastwise language to cover shipments \"by land and water\" and replacing shipments between \"U.S. ports\" with shipments between \"U.S. points.\" These amendments remain current law. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Shipbuilding Costs Debated", "paragraphs": ["The relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries was part of the debate leading up to passage of the Jones Act. Four years earlier, in the Shipping Act of 1916, Congress had requested annual reports on the subject from the federal agency in charge of maritime transportation. The minority report to a 1919 House committee report to the bill that would become the Jones Act expressed the view that banning foreign-built ships would result in more costly domestically built ships:", "\u2026 in order to build up and sustain an American merchant marine it is absolutely necessary to remove every restriction against American merchants acquiring ships, whether built in the United States or out of the United States, at the lowest possible price, in order to enable them to compete with other nations in the transportation of the commerce of the world. If our merchants are allowed to buy ships in the open world market and place them under American registry with the privilege of using them both in the coastwise and overseas trade, it will inevitably follow that ships under the American flag will be bought as cheaply as ships under other flags.", "On the other hand, if the American merchant shall be permitted to buy ships only from American builders in order to engage in our coastwise trade, it necessarily follows that every ship built in the United States will command a higher price than any foreign-built ship.", "Our American iron and steel manufacturers were unable to compete until they had to. When they had to they did compete successfully. Our shipbuilders can and will do likewise.", "A 1922 government report on shipbuilding indicated that U.S.-built ships cost 20% more than those built in foreign yards. The cost differential increased to 50% in the 1930s. In the 1950s, U.S. shipyard prices were double those of foreign yards, and by the 1990s, they were three times the price of foreign yards. Today, the price of a U.S.-built tanker is estimated to be about four times the global price of a similar vessel, while a U.S.-built container ship may cost five times the global price, according to one maritime consulting firm. The cost differential is also an issue for Department of Defense officials in charge of military sealift ships. As discussed later in this report, the military has modified a plan to build sealift ships domestically, finding it unaffordable, and instead will buy more used foreign-built cargo ships. Since U.S. shipyards do not build vessels for export, they are not required to compete with foreign shipyards on price or vessel characteristics.", "However, as was argued in the late 1800s, shipbuilding costs are not the only cost factor. U.S. crewing costs are higher than those of foreign-flag vessels. U.S.-flag ships have an operating cost differential estimated to be over $6 million per ship per year compared to foreign-flag ships. While crewing is the primary cost element, this estimate also includes insurance and ship maintenance costs. A 2011 study by the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) found that in 2010, the average operating cost of a U.S.-flag ship was 2.7 times greater than a foreign-flag ship, but MARAD estimates that this cost differential has since increased.

A second important and enduring aspect of the bill is its statement of maritime policy. The policy goals stated in the 1920 act, which appear in Section 27, have continued to the present day (46 U.S.C. \u00a750101). The law stated the following:", "That it is necessary for the national defense and for the proper growth of its foreign and domestic commerce that the United States shall have a merchant marine of the best equipped and most suitable types of vessels sufficient to carry the greater portion of its commerce and serve as a naval or military auxiliary in times of war or national emergency, ultimately to be owned and operated privately by citizens of the United States; and it is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to do whatever may be necessary to develop and encourage the maintenance of such a merchant marine. ", "This statement reflects the United States' status as an emerging power at that time. When World War I began in 1914, European nations utilized their ships for the war effort or kept them in harbors for fear of submarine attacks, leaving the United States with a shortage of ships for carrying its foreign trade. The Merchant Marine Act therefore emphasized that the United States should have its own merchant marine so as not to be dependent on any other nations' merchant vessels.

Therefore, foreign-flag ships can transport cargo between these islands and other U.S. points. Puerto Rico is exempt for passengers but not for cargo.

Competing freight transportation modes have no requirement to purchase only domestically built equipment. Congress has not defined what constitutes a U.S.-built vessel, leaving this determination to the Coast Guard. Coast Guard regulations deem a vessel to be U.S.-built if (1) all \"major components\" of its hull and superstructure are fabricated in the United States, and (2) the vessel is assembled in the United States. The \"superstructure\" means the main deck and any other structural part above the main deck (e.g., the bridge, forecastle, pilot house). ", "The Coast Guard holds that propulsion machinery (the ship's engine), other machinery, small engine room equipment modules, consoles, wiring, piping, certain mechanical systems and outfitting have no bearing on a U.S.-build determination. Consequently, for oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards typically import engines from foreign manufacturers. This is allowed because engines are deemed components that are attached to the hull rather than an integral part of the hull's structure. A ship part or component that is self-supporting and independent of the vessel's structure and does not contribute to the overall integrity of the vessel or compromise the watertight envelope of the hull can be manufactured in a foreign country. However, the part or component must be attached or joined to the vessel in a U.S. shipyard, not an overseas yard. ", "The Coast Guard's test for \"major components\" of the hull or superstructure is based on weight; up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components can be manufactured abroad. By this reasoning, the propeller, stern bulb, bulbous bow, some rudders (depending on their design), and watertight closures used in U.S.-built vessels are often imported, as long as they (in the aggregate) do not exceed the steel weight limit. The Coast Guard also permits steel products in standard forms (\"off the shelf\") to be imported with no limit on their weight, but any shaping, molding, and cutting of the steel that is custom to the design of the vessel must be performed in a U.S. shipyard.", "Shipyards typically seek confirmation from the Coast Guard that incorporating certain foreign-built components in construction of a vessel will not disqualify the vessel from the Jones Act trade. These \"determination letters\" written by the Coast Guard detail which and to what extent foreign components are permissible. In the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-282 , \u00a7516) Congress directed the Coast Guard to publish these letters.", "Shipyard unions refer to ships built in this manner as \"kit ships.\" They sued the Coast Guard in 2007, arguing that the Coast Guard's interpretation of the statute violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sided with the Coast Guard, noting in part that the Coast Guard's interpretation is rooted and consistent with the Treasury Department's interpretation dating to at least the late 1800s (the Treasury Department was the agency of jurisdiction at that time), as well as U.S. Attorney General interpretations dating to the early 1900s. The shipyard unions' lawsuit was prompted by a Philadelphia shipyard's partnership with a South Korean shipbuilder, begun in 2004, to use the Korean builder's ship designs and other procurement services to build a series of Jones Act tankers. This partnership continues today and also includes container ships built in the Philadelphia shipyard. Since 2006, General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego, another builder of Jones Act oceangoing ships, has partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea to procure vessel designs, engineering, and some of the materials for the commercial ships it has since built for Jones Act carriers.", "Importing engines and other major ship components would appear to undermine the Jones Act policy objective of a domestic shipbuilding capability independent of foreign yards. In the court case cited above, the shipyards argued that not allowing use of such foreign components would increase the cost of ships further. This would reduce orders for new ships and harm the domestic fleet. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passenger Vessel Itineraries", "paragraphs": ["The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships. This is because CBP has determined that a cruise ship serving a U.S. port does not have to be Jones Act-compliant as long as it has visited a distant foreign port (any port outside North and Central America, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Virgin Islands). Thus, for example, if a cruise ship includes Aruba or Curacao in its itinerary, it does not need to be Jones Act-compliant. The reasoning is that the main objective of such a cruise itinerary is to visit such foreign ports, not to transport passengers from one U.S. port to another U.S. port. This reasoning was articulated in a 1910 Attorney General's opinion. ", "Another significant regulatory interpretation allowing for the prevalence of foreign cruise ships at U.S. ports is a 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. Customs Service (the predecessor of CBP). In this rulemaking, Customs allowed foreign-flag cruise ships to make round trips from a U.S. port and to visit other U.S. ports as long as they also include a visit to a nearby foreign port (such as those in Canada, Mexico, or Bermuda). All passengers must continue with the cruise until the cruise terminates at the same dock at which it began. Again, the reasoning is based on the primary intent of the cruise voyage; if the main purpose of the voyage is not domestic transportation of passengers then the Jones Act is not violated.", "Another type of passenger vessel excursion involves visits to no other ports. The purpose of the voyage could be whale watching, recreational diving, gambling, duty-free shopping, or deep-sea fishing, for example. These are so-called \"voyages to nowhere\" since passengers do not visit any other ports besides the one at which they embark and disembark. In these cases, CBP has determined that if such vessels stay within the 3-mile zone of U.S. territorial waters they must be Jones Act-compliant since CBP considers any places within such waters as \"U.S. points.\" This interpretation is based on Treasury Decision 22275, issued in 1900. However, CBP has determined that if the vessel journeys beyond 3 miles from shore (into international waters), then it does not need to be Jones Act-compliant. This determination is based on a 1912 Attorney General opinion. But the policy regarding charter fishing boats differs from that regarding other passenger vessels. If charter fishing boats venture into international waters, they still must be Jones Act-compliant. This determination is by virtue of a 1936 ruling by the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection (Circular Letter No. 103, June 3, 1936), and affirmed by Treasury Decision 55193(2) in 1960.", "Another element of CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act with respect to passenger vessels is its definition of a passenger. According to CBP, a passenger need not be a paying customer (such as a tour boat or cruise ship ticket holder); rather, the term encompasses anyone aboard a vessel who is not a member of the crew or an owner of the vessel. Thus, for example, an owner of a yacht who chooses to entertain business clients aboard his or her vessel must comply with the Jones Act. A construction company transporting construction workers to a construction site must use a Jones Act-compliant vessel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Offshore Oil and Gas Vessels", "paragraphs": ["In the offshore oil market, CBP's interpretations have affected \"lightering\" (the transfer of oil offshore from an oil tanker too large to transit a harbor to a smaller vessel) and offshore supply vessels (OSVs) used to supply oil platforms. CBP has determined that if a tanker to be lightered is anchored to the seabed and within 3 nautical miles of shore (which are U.S. territorial waters), it is a \"U.S. point.\" Many lightering areas in the Gulf of Mexico are 60 to 80 miles offshore and therefore the lightering vessels can be foreign-flagged. Lightering operations in the Delaware Bay and elsewhere are within the 3-mile zone, and therefore lightering vessels operating in these areas must be Jones Act-compliant (in which case tank barges rather than ships are typically used as lighters).", "Regarding OSVs, two factors determine whether these vessels must be Jones Act-compliant in servicing offshore oil rigs. By virtue of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-212), U.S. waters extend 200 miles offshore strictly for purposes related to the exploration, development, and production of offshore natural resources. CBP has determined that within this zone, only oil rigs attached to the seabed (anchored or submerged to) are \"U.S. points.\" Another type of oil rig is not attached to the seabed: some mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) are semisubmerged and can hold their positions with the use of propellers. CBP had determined that MODUs not attached to the seabed are not \"U.S. points,\" and therefore foreign-flagged vessels were permitted to service these units. However, in 2008, Congress required that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but need not be U.S.-built ( P.L. 110-181 , \u00a73525), which is the same requirement applied to U.S.-flag vessels engaged in international voyages. ", "A second factor determining whether OSVs must be Jones Act-compliant is whether the OSV is transporting supplies or workers to the oil rig, or if the vessel is involved in installing equipment necessary for the operation of the rig. CBP defines \"vessel equipment\" as anything \"necessary and appropriate for the navigation, operation or maintenance of a vessel or for the comfort and safety of persons on board.\" Consequently, a vessel laying cable or pipeline in U.S. waters does not need to be Jones Act-compliant. Similarly, while OSVs transporting supplies and rig workers must be Jones Act-compliant (if the rig is attached to the seabed), vessels involved in installing rig equipment or conducting geophysical surveying or diving inspections can be foreign-flagged, as well as \"flotels,\" which are vessels that provide living quarters for construction workers. The distinction can be unclear. In 2017, CBP proposed that most or all activities performed by OSVs fall under the Jones Act, but after reviewing comments, the agency withdrew the proposal.

Currently, wind farm developers are being guided by CBP's interpretations of the Jones Act with respect to OSVs and oil rigs. The Department of Energy has noted that the nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant \"Tower Installation Vessels\" (TIVs) can be a hindrance to offshore wind farm development, especially for installations in deeper water. In Europe, TIVs not only install the towers but also transport the equipment from shore to the offshore site. Since there are no Jones Act-compliant TIVs, U.S. wind developers either transport the equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels to transport the equipment to the site from a U.S. port alongside non-Jones Act-compliant TIVs to install the equipment.

CBP determined that if merchandise is transformed (manufactured or processed) into a new and different product at an intermediate foreign port, then the vessels transporting the original product from a U.S. port to this foreign port and transporting the transformed product from the foreign port to a U.S. port do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. For example, a Texas oil producer has shipped a gasoline product to a Bahamian storage facility where its product is blended with a different imported petroleum product to produce a final gasoline product that is shipped to New York. Foreign-flag tankers are allowed to make all of these shipments even though it could be argued that a portion of the cargo is being shipped between two U.S. points (Texas and New York). The transformation of the product into a new and different product at an intermediate foreign port distinguishes this case from the 1891 kegs-of-nails case mentioned above.

This provides additional protection from competition for Jones Act carriers if coastal shipping demand increases, because it can take two years to construct a new ship.

For instance, in 1984, Congress exempted passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any other U.S. port as long as no Jones Act-qualified operator was able to provide comparable service ( P.L. 98-563 ). This exemption remains in force, allowing foreign-flag cruise ships to carry passengers between the U.S. mainland and the island. On two occasions, in 1996 ( P.L. 104-324 ) and again in 2011 ( P.L. 112-61 ), Congress has permitted certain foreign-flagged liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers to provide domestic service because none existed in the Jones Act fleet; no ship owners have made use of these exemptions (see Table A-1 ). ", "Congress has also enacted exemptions due to a sudden spike in demand for Jones Act-qualified vessels. To address a vessel shortage, Congress enacted an exemption for iron ore carried on the Great Lakes during the 1940s that was related to a surge in steelmaking for the war effort. It did the same for a bumper grain harvest in 1951 (see Table A-1 ). In 1996, Congress enacted an exemption for vessels participating in oil spill cleanup operations when an insufficient number of Jones Act-qualified vessels are available. ", "Congress has enacted Jones Act waivers for two innovations in vessel designs used in foreign trade but whose cargo operations included domestic legs that technically would otherwise fall under the Jones Act. One concerned a ship designed to carry river barges on international voyages, a technology known as Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH). In 1971, Congress exempted these specific barges from the Jones Act (P.L. 92-163). The exemption is no longer relevant, as this type of shipping is not now in use. In 1965, as container ships were about to come into use internationally, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports from the Jones Act (P.L. 89-194). This exemption is restricted to containers used for international shipments, thus allowing the foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their empty equipment along U.S. coastlines.", "Jones Act-compliant ships are necessary for transshipment of loaded international containers. This distinction between carriage of loaded and unloaded containers has ramifications for the development of marine highways or short sea shipping routes.
