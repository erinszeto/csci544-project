Since it is directed at lobbying only on specified federal actions concerning the making of grants, loans, contracts and agreements, and the extensions or modifications of such agreements, loans, contracts, or grants, the Byrd Amendment would have limited application to lobbying on general program legislation. While the provision might bar the use of federal funds to lobby a Member of Congress to intervene with an agency concerning the making, extension, or modification of a grant, loan, contract or agreement, or might bar the lobbying of Congress concerning a direct, earmarked appropriation, or a specific program or spending instruction in a congressional report, the Byrd Amendment would not appear to apply to the lobbying of Congress concerning the consideration of program legislation generally.", "The Byrd Amendment, the OMB Circular, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation restrict the use of federal funds and do not place restrictions on the recipients themselves; that is, the provisions do not prohibit recipients, grantees, or contractors from using their own funds, or other non-federally appropriated funds to lobby the government on any matter.

Thus, the general appropriations law restrictions enacted yearly have been \"imputed\" by the Comptroller General to apply to the grantees of federal agencies: \"Federal agencies and departments are responsible for insuring that Federal funds made available to grantees are not used contrary to [the publicity and propaganda] restriction.\" In one case the GAO found a violation of the general appropriations restriction when a local transportation authority, and grantee of the Department of Transportation, used grant funds from the agency to produce a newsletter \"urging readers to write to their elected representatives in Congress to support continued funding....\" As explained in the appropriations treatise prepared by GAO:", "The case involved the Los Angeles Downtown People Mover Authority, a grantee of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), Department of Transportation. Fearing that its funding was in jeopardy, the Authority prepared and distributed a newsletter urging readers to write to their elected representatives in Congress to support continued funding for the People Mover project. The Comptroller General found that this newsletter, to the extent it involved UMTA grant funds, violated the anti-lobbying statute.", "In the later appropriations riders of this nature, the language of the provision was changed to now expressly include \"by private contractor\" in the restriction on the use of federal appropriations:", "No part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act shall be used directly or indirectly, including by private contractor, for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States not heretofore authorized by the Congress.", "This change may indicate an express emphasis by Congress that an agency may not accomplish indirectly through a private contractor what it may not do directly, that is, use federal appropriations for publicity or propaganda campaigns, or it may signal a broader reach to all contractor and grantor funds received from the federal government, even when the private recipient is not contracted or directed to engage in the particular questionable activity by a federal agency, but rather engages in such activity independently.", "GAO has traditionally interpreted the \"publicity and propaganda\" restrictions (as far as they applied to federal agencies ), as not necessarily restricting direct communications from the agencies to legislators, but rather as limiting and prohibiting \"grassroots\" type of lobbying campaigns:", "In interpreting \"publicity and propaganda\" provisions ... we have consistently recognized that any agency has a legitimate interest in communicating with the public and with legislators regarding its policies. ... An interpretation of [the anti-lobbying restriction] which strictly prohibited expenditures of public funds for dissemination of views on pending legislation would consequently preclude virtually any comment by officials on administration or agency policy, a result we do not believe was intended.", "We believe, therefore, that Congress did not intend ... to preclude all expression by agency officials of views on pending legislation. Rather, the prohibition of [the anti-lobbying restriction], in our view, applies primarily to expenditures involving direct appeals addressed to the public suggesting that they contact their elected representatives and indicate their support of or opposition to pending legislation, i.e. , appeals to members of the public for them in turn to urge their representatives to vote in a particular manner.", "When communications are made to the public concerning public policy matters, even if such communications give arguments for or against specific legislation, the Comptroller General found no violation of the publicity or propaganda \"anti-lobbying\" rider when the material was \"essentially expository in nature\" and did not urge or suggest anyone contact their representative in the legislature. In one example concerning Department of Transportation expenditures for displays and pamphlets and informational material at the time Congress was considering passive restraint systems (airbags) for cars, GAO noted, \"While, considering the timing and location of the displays, one would have to be pretty stupid not to see this as an obvious lobbying ploy, that did not make it illegal since there was no evidence that Transportation urged members of the public to contact their elected representatives.\"", "In addition to these general appropriations law riders, there may be more specific statutory or appropriations limitations on particular federal monies or on particular federal programs, which also limit the use of federal monies appropriated in a particular appropriations law for lobbying, or \"publicity or propaganda\" campaigns directed at Congress by private grant or contract recipients, or the use of grant funds to pay the salary of one who engages in such activities. Two examples of this included an appropriation rider on grantees in the HHS appropriations legislation which GAO found to have been violated \"when a local community action agency used grant funds for a mass mailing of a letter to members of the public urging them to write their Congressmen to oppose abolition of the agency.\" Similarly, the Comptroller General found that the provision was \"violated when a university, using grant funds received from the Department of Education, encouraged students to write to Members of Congress to urge their opposition to proposed cuts in student financial aid programs.\"", "The Comptroller General has thus interpreted the appropriations riders on grantees and contractors in a similar manner as the \"publicity and propaganda\" riders on federal agencies, that is, to apply to \"grassroots\" lobbying campaigns where the public is urged to contact Members of Congress. It should be noted that the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice has offered an opinion that the particular rider on grantees and contractors in the Labor, Education, and HHS Appropriations laws is broader than the general \"publicity and propaganda\" riders, and could apply even to funding communications from contractors and grantees receiving funds under that particular act directly to Members of Congress on pending legislation or appropriations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criminal Law", "paragraphs": ["The principal, permanent statutory prohibition on what is considered \"lobbying with appropriated funds\" is a federal criminal statute at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913, which prohibits the use of federal appropriations to pay for any \"personal services, advertisement, telegram, telephone, letter, printed or written matter ... intended or designed to influence\" Members of Congress or other officials on a variety of programs, legislation, or appropriations. Originally adopted in 1919, the law had always been interpreted to apply only to officers and employees of the federal government, and then only to lobbying the Congress. The provision at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 was amended in 2002. The 2002 amendments, while eliminating the criminal penalties and substituting the civil penalties of the so-called \"Byrd Amendment,\" substantially broadened the substantive prohibition to cover the use of federal appropriations to lobby or influence all levels of governmental authority, and removed the penalties provision which had indicated an applicability only to federal officers and employees. As noted by GAO, the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 might be considered to apply now to others who use \"federal appropriations\" for lobbying purposes, and not just to federal employees as had been done in the past.", "The exact parameters of this law, adopted in 1919, are not precisely known as there appears never to have been an enforcement action or indictment returned based on the provision. Although the payment for various activities financed with federal funds is barred, section 1913 expressly exempts from the prohibition the activities of officers and employees of the federal government \"communicating to members of Congress on the request of any member,\" or to Congress \"through the proper official channels, requests for legislation or appropriations\" deemed necessary for the efficient conduct of the public business. This provision of law has thus been consistently interpreted in the past by the Justice Department as permitting direct contacts and communications from federal executive officials and executive agencies to Members of Congress concerning pending or proposed federal legislation. Most likely, the provision would prohibit substantial letter writing or other types of significant \"propaganda\" or publicity campaigns (also called \"grassroots\" lobbying campaigns) funded with appropriated monies which are directed at the general public and which specifically urge or exhort the public or individuals to write or contact their congressman on an issue before the Congress.", "The exemption for communications through \"proper official channels\" applies expressly only to officers and employees of the federal government. It is thus not apparent that this exemption for direct communications to lawmakers and policy makers would extend to persons other than federal employees who use federal appropriations for such communications, such as federal grantees or contractors.

In 1976, a so-called \"safe harbor\" was offered to 501(c)(3) organizations where they could elect to come within specific percentage limitations on expenditures to assure that no violations of the \"substantial part\" rule would occur, or they could remain under the old, unspecified \"substantial part test.\" The specific statutory limitations upon organizational expenditures for covered lobbying activities (the \"expenditure test\" limitations) for electing 501(c)(3) organizations are as follows:", "20% of the first $500,000 of total exempt-purpose expenditures of the organization, then 15% of the next $500,000 in exempt-purposes expenditures, then 10% of the next $500,000 in exempt-purpose expenditures, and then 5% of the organization's exempt-purpose expenditures over $1,500,000; up to a total expenditure limit of $1,000,000 on lobbying activities. There is currently a separate \"grassroots\" expenditure limit of 25% of the \"direct\" lobbying limits.", "The activities covered under the tax code limitations on \"lobbying\" by charitable organizations generally encompass both \"direct\" lobbying as well as \"grassroots\" lobbying (for which there is a separate included expense limitation). \"Direct\" lobbying entails direct communications to legislators, and to other government officials involved in formulating legislation (as well as direct communications to an organization's own members encouraging them to communicate directly with legislators), which refer to and reflect a particular view on specific legislation. Indirect or \"grassroots\" lobbying involves advocacy pleas to the general public which refer to and take a position on specific legislation, and which encourage the public to contact legislators to influence them on that legislation.", "The definitions of and the specific exemptions from the term \"lobbying\" are important in observing the expenditure limitations on an organization's activities. For example, not all public \"advocacy\" activities of an organization are considered \"grassroots lobbying.\" As expressed by the IRS, \"... clear advocacy of specific legislation is not grassroots lobbying at all unless it contains an encouragement to action.\" Furthermore, not all communications to legislators are considered \"direct lobbying.\" The definition of \"lobbying\" for purposes of the tax code limitations expressly exempt s activities such as:", "(a) making available nonpartisan analysis, study or research involving independent and objective exposition of a subject matter, even one that takes a position on particular legislation as long as it does not encourage recipients to take action with respect to that legislation;", "(b) technical advice or assistance given at the request of a governmental body;", "(c) so-called \"self-defense\" communications before governmental bodies, that is, communications on those issues that might affect the charity's existence, powers, duties, tax-exempt status, or deductibility of contributions to it; and", "(d) contacts with officials unrelated to affecting specific legislation, even those that involve general discussions of broad social or economic problems which are the subject of pending legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 501(c)(4) Civic Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Organizations which are tax exempt under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code are generally described as \"[c]ivic leagues or organizations not operated for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare....\" If a civic league or social welfare organization is tax exempt under \u00a7 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, there is generally no tax consequence for lobbying or advocacy activities (as long as such expenditures are in relation to their exempt function). In fact, in upholding the limitations on lobbying by 501(c)(3) charitable organizations against First Amendment challenges, the Supreme Court noted that a 501(c)(3) organization could establish a 501(c)(4) affiliate through which its First Amendment expression could be exercised through unlimited lobbying and advocacy. The 501(c)(4) affiliate should be separately incorporated, keep separate books, and spend and use resources which are not part of or otherwise paid for by the tax-deductible contributions to the 501(c)(3) parent organization.

This provision, which is commonly called the \"Simpson Amendment,\" prohibits section 501(c)(4) civic leagues and social welfare organizations from engaging in any \"lobbying activities,\" even with their own private funds, if the organization receives any federal grant, loan, or award.", "The restrictions of the Simpson Amendment originally covered all 501(c)(4) organizations which received federal monies by way of an \"award, grant, contract , loan or any other form.\" The term \"contract,\" however, was subsequently removed from the provision by P.L. 104-99 , Section 129, leaving the prohibition on lobbying activities with an organization's own funds as a condition to the receipt of federal monies only upon 501(c)(4) grantees and those seeking an award or loan, but allowing unlimited lobbying activities with organizational funds for 501(c)(4) contractors of the federal government. The Simpson Amendment now reads as follows: \"An organization described in section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which engages in lobbying activities shall not be eligible for the receipt of Federal funds constituting an award, grant, or loan.\"", "While there may have been some constitutional objections to the provisions of the \"Simpson Amendment\" and its effect on First Amendment activities funded by an organization's own private, non-federal funds, the interpretation of the provision to allow for unlimited lobbying by affiliate organizations with their own, non-federal monies, has apparently obviated legal challenges. The legislative history of the provision clearly indicates that it was intended that a 501(c)(4) organization may separately incorporate an affiliated 501(c)(4), which would not receive any federal funds, and which could engage in unlimited lobbying. The method of separately incorporating an affiliate to lobby, or to receive and administer federal grants, which was described by the amendment's sponsor as \"splitting,\" was apparently intended to place a degree of separation between federal grant money and private lobbying, while permitting an organization to have a way to exercise its protected First Amendment rights of speech, expression and petition. As stated by the sponsor of the provision, Senator Simpson, \"If they decided to split into two separate 501(c)(4)s, they could have one organization which could both receive funds and lobby without limits.\"", "It may also be noted that although section 501(c)(4)s which receive certain federal funds may not engage in \"lobbying activities,\" the term \"lobbying activities,\" as defined in the LDA includes only direct \"lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts\" such as preparation, planning, research, and other background work intended for use in such direct contacts.

The Lobbying Disclosure Act's definitions of \"lobbying activities\" and \"lobbying contacts\" exclude, and do not independently apply to activities which consist only of \"grassroots\" lobbying and public advocacy.", "Similarly, since the term \"lobbying activities\" relates only to the direct lobbying of covered federal officials, the \"Simpson Amendment\" would not appear to limit in any way an organization's use of its own private resources to lobby state or local legislators or other state or local governmental bodies or units.

The Supreme Court has on numerous occasions emphasized the importance of protecting public advocacy rights, and has noted the \"profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide open,\" and has in the past even noted that \"expression on public issues 'has always rested on the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values.'\" The Supreme Court has therefore found that the advocacy communications involved in lobbying, political speech, and expression entail the exercise of protected First Amendment rights of association, speech and petition, and that any regulations imposed by Congress on such lobbying and advocacy activities may not unduly burden the exercise of those rights.", "In the area of political advocacy, as in the area of public policy advocacy and lobbying, the courts have been careful and deferential to the rights of private parties in terms of their freedoms of association and expression.

It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests\u2014especially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the Government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to \"produce a result which [it] could not command directly.\" Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526. Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.", "In 1996, the Court recognized, under the circumstances of the case before it, \"the right of independent contractors not to be terminated for exercising their First Amendment rights.\" In explicating the principles that work to prohibit the denial of governmental benefits for private parties who exercise their First Amendment rights of speech and advocacy, the Court noted", "Our unconstitutional conditions precedents span a spectrum from government employees, whose close relationship to the government requires a balancing of important free speech and government interests, to claimants for tax exemptions, Speiser v. Randall , 357 U.S. 513 (1958), users of public facilities, e.g. Lamb ' s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 390-394 (1993); Healy v.

League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 (1984), who are much less dependent on the government but more like ordinary citizens whose viewpoints on matters of public concern the government has no legitimate interest in repressing.", "Thus, while the government may place certain conditions on the recipients of federal benefits, grants, or subsidies, and may refuse to subsidize or pay for one's private lobbying or advocacy activities, the participation in First Amendment expression may arguably not be the basis for denying a public benefit. As explained by Justice Blackmun concurring in Regan v. Taxation With Representation , the \"denial of business expense deduction for lobbying is constitutional, but an attempt to deny all deductions for business expenses to a taxpayer who lobbies would penalize unconstitutionally the exercise of First Amendment rights\"; and that while \"denial of welfare benefits for abortion is constitutional, ... an attempt to withhold all welfare benefits from one who exercises right to an abortion probably would be impermissible.\" It may be noted in this regard that in Speiser v. Randall, the Supreme Court expressly found that the state may not place a condition on eligibility even for a tax-exemption on a basis that violates one's First Amendment freedoms of speech, expression, and association: \"To deny an exemption to claimants who engage in certain forms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such speech.\"", "Under this line of cases the Supreme Court thus invalidated a federal law which would have placed an advocacy restriction on any recipient of particular grants from a federally funded program (public broadcasting) in Federal Communications Commission v. League of Women Voters of California . In that case the federal statutory ban on public broadcasters \"editorializing\" was expressly found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. In the original provisions establishing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the non-commercial broadcast stations which received any grants or funding from CPB were prohibited from \"editorializing.\" Although broadcast stations may be required in the public interest to afford opportunities for opposing viewpoints and equal time under the so-called fairness doctrine, the Court found that such broadcasters, merely because they receive some federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, could not be prohibited from providing their own expression and opinions on matters of public interest, as the ban was not narrowly tailored to sufficiently address the government's asserted justifications for such restrictions on protected First Amendment conduct. The Court found that although the government may regulate the use of its own appropriations, and need not subsidize private advocacy, the complete ban on editorializing would impermissibly prohibit the private broadcast stations from using their own resources and funding for such public advocacy activity.", "In the recent case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , one of the arguments for maintaining the statutory restriction on corporate campaign expenditures was that the corporation had been granted by law certain benefits and privileges, and as a condition to receive such government-granted benefits, the corporations could be denied their First Amendment right to engage in political expression in making independent campaign expenditures. The Supreme Court, however, summarily dismissed such notion that government benefits could be given in this situation on the condition of forfeiting or forgoing First Amendment privileges:", "... [T]he Austin majority undertook to distinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the ground that \"[s]tate law grants corporations special advantages \u2013 such as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets.\" 494 U.S. at 658-659. This does not suffice, however, to allow laws prohibiting speech. \"It is rudimentary that the State cannot exact as the price of those special advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment rights.\"", "It is therefore questionable under this line of cases whether general or broad-based restrictions on independent expenditures for political speech and advocacy of all private individuals, firms, associations, or corporations could be instituted as a \"condition\" to receiving a federal grant or a federal contract. It is noted that under current federal law, a government contractor is prohibited from making a campaign \"contribution.\" Under the theory that campaign contributions directly to candidates have a more significant potential for quid pro quo corruption, the Supreme Court, in overturning the corporate campaign independent \"expenditure\" prohibition, left intact the limitation on such corporate campaign \"contributions.\" Campaign contributions to candidates or parties (and their potential for corrupting influences) have been distinguished by the Supreme Court from \"independent\" campaign \"expenditures.\" Such independent expenditures in campaigns are afforded greater First Amendment protection as speech, and are apparently not subject to the same considerations of potential corruption or corrupting influence because of the absence of pre-arrangement or coordination with the candidate or the candidate's campaign:", "The Buckle y Court recognized a \"sufficiently important\" government interest in \"the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption.\" Id. , at 25; see id . at 26. This followed from the Court's concern that large contributions could be given \"to secure a political quid pro quo .\" Ibid .", "The Buckley Court explained that the potential for quid pro quo corruption distinguished direct contributions to candidates from independent expenditures. The Court emphasized that \"the independent expenditure ceiling ... fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\" id ., at 47-48, because \"[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination ... alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate,\" id ., at 47.", "The Supreme Court then concluded in Citizens United :", "Limits on independent expenditures ... have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government's interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.", "***", "For the reasons explained above, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.", "The same considerations in allowing an exception to First Amendment principles in prohibiting contractor \"contributions\" to candidates, therefore, may not necessarily be present to justify a similar government restriction on contractor \"expenditures\" for independent political speech. Furthermore, it should be noted that subsequent to Citizens United , courts have been willing to more critically examine limitations on \"contributions\" than in the past. One state Supreme Court, for example, has invalidated that state's law against campaign contributions to state candidates by \"sole source\" government contractors as an unconstitutionally overbroad intrusion into the First Amendment rights of state contractors. Additionally, campaign \"contribution\" limitations under federal law which the Federal Election Commission sought to apply to contributions to groups making only independent expenditures was, subsequent to Citizens United , found unconstitutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Program Restrictions and \"Government Speech\"", "paragraphs": ["It is obvious that Congress may and does institute various conditions and requirements on the receipt of federal funds. Although the cases discussed in the preceding section found, to one degree or another, an \"unconstitutional condition\" on the receipt of federal funds by private parties (by restricting the use of the recipient's own resources for protected First Amendment advocacy as a condition to receive funds), the Supreme Court has permitted the government to require a restriction on the use of a recipient's own funds for certain speech within a particular program when that program is even partially funded with federal funds. In Rust v. Sullivan , a provision restricting participants in certain programs funded by the government from providing abortion counseling was upheld by the Supreme Court. The Court did note that the restriction examined there was, however, a restriction going only to the program which was partially federally funded, and not a restriction on the recipient of the funds, who could continue separately and independently to counsel on abortion or even to perform abortions apart from the federally funded program. The Court explained that the government did not place a \"condition on the recipient of the subsidy,\" but rather placed the restrictions on the \"particular program or service\" which \"merely require that the grantee keep such activities separate and distinct from the\" publicly funded activities. As stated by the Court: \"[T]he government is not denying a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply insisting that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized.\" Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, distinguished this situation from the \"unconstitutional conditions\" cases:", "In contrast, our \"unconstitutional conditions\" cases involve situations in which the Government has placed a condition on the recipient of the subsidy rather than on a particular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.", "More recently, the Supreme Court has noted that when the government funds activities and programs, it may limit, restrict, and fashion the speech of those speaking on its behalf either as \"government speech,\" or when the government uses \"private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own programs.\" In 1995, the Court explained that \"[w]hen the government disburses public funds to private entities to convey a governmental message , it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee.\"", "What might be considered an \"exception\" to the First Amendment, that is, allowing for government regulation of either \"government speech,\" or some private speech within the parameters of certain government programs or government created forums, would not, in any event, extend to all activities and programs of individuals or private entities which receive government grants or contracts.

Velazquez , the Court overturned a restriction on the Legal Services Corporation's grantees \"lobbying\" for changes in welfare legislation as part of legal representation of indigent clients. The Court found that even though the legal services program was government funded, and thus the speech that the government wished to regulate and limit by statute was, in fact, within the confines of that program (as in Rust ), the activity and speech involved, that is, lobbying the legislature on behalf of a client, could still not be considered \"government speech,\" and thus was not subject to regulation under the government speech doctrine.", "In light of the development of the \"government speech\" doctrine, the Supreme Court has engaged in a certain amount of reinterpretation of some of the previous precedents on what have been characterized as \"unconstitutional conditions\" cases. The Supreme Court in Velazquez , for example, discussed the holding in Rust v. Sullivan in terms of \"government speech\":", "The Court in Rust did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that the counseling activities of the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental speech; when interpreting the holding in later cases, however, we have explained Rust on this understanding. We have said that viewpoint-based funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government itself is the speaker, see Board of Regents of Univ. o f Wis. System v. Southworth , 529 U.S. 217, 229, 235 (2000), or instances, like Rust , in which the government \"used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its programs.\" Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the Univ. o f Va., 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995).", "Along a somewhat similar line as the \"government speech\" concept may be situations where private organizations serve as what might be described as surrogates or stand-ins for government agencies, to perform governmental functions of administering and disbursing public funds. Thus, as noted above, in some of these instances federal law has treated these organizations, for purposes of restrictions on the partisan political activities of their employees, as \"state or local\" governmental agencies under the provisions of the Hatch Act which apply to employees of state and local governments. If a contract or a grant were thus given to perform what might be considered \"governmental functions,\" or to have private parties serve as surrogates for government officials in administering or managing certain public programs, then arguments could be made that the government could then limit political speech or activities of such private participants in the program under the \"government speech\" guidelines, or under a similar rationale as the Hatch Act, to protect the fair administration of government programs. The Supreme Court in Citizens United noted that there is \"a narrow class of speech restrictions\" which may be permissible, such as in the Hatch Act (citing the Letter Carriers case, 413 U.S. 548 (1973)), \"based on an interest in allowing governmental entities to perform their functions.\" Such rationale, however, would not appear to be strong, nor particularly relevant, in the case of contractors who are merely providing goods or selling products to the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Governmental Interest Promoted by the Legislation; Least Restrictive Means of Accomplishing Objective", "paragraphs": ["The Supreme Court has found that while First Amendment rights are \"fundamental, they are not in their nature absolute.\" The Court has increasingly resorted to \"balancing\" conflicting interests of the government and private parties when possible limitations on First Amendment activities are somewhat indirect; when the governmental interest in the regulation is of a compelling enough nature; and when the statute is drawn with sufficient precision. When a provision of law limits, burdens, or interferes with protected First Amendment rights, the Supreme Court will engage in what it terms \"strict scrutiny\" to examine the law and its purposes to determine, initially, if there are significant, \"overriding\" or \"compelling\" governmental interests in the restriction that outweigh the impositions on protected First Amendment rights. If there are such governmental interests in the restrictions on First Amendment activities, then the Court will examine whether the restriction is sufficiently narrowly tailored to promote those interests asserted as the statute's justification.", "There are several governmental interests which might arguably be promoted by a prohibition on \"independent expenditures\" by government contractors or grantees, and such interests would need to be analyzed under the Supreme Court's standards. In cases involving the limitation of political advocacy in campaigns and the disclosure of lobbying activities, for example, the protection of basic governmental processes by disclosing the sources of pressures and influences on the legislative process, and the prevention of the corruption of the electoral process and undue influences on candidates and officeholders which may accompany large cash payments and contributions to candidates and political parties, have been found to be such important governmental interests which may justify in some cases certain limitations or burdens on First Amendment activities. Even while such interests have been found to be significant and important, however, the Court has struck down restrictions and direct or indirect limitations on advocacy speech and political activities which were not narrowly tailored to meet the objective of preventing undue influence or the appearance of corruption.", "As discussed earlier, the Supreme Court has found that although the governmental interest of preventing corruption may be forwarded by a restriction on direct contributions from individuals or corporations to candidates, the interest of preventing \"corruption\" or the appearance of corruption is not necessarily advanced by a restriction on \"independent expenditures\" by private entities in relation to political campaigns. In Buckley v. Valeo , the Supreme Court found \"that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption [was] inadequate to justify [the ban] on independent expenditures.\" Similar to the Court decision in Buckley overturning the over-all \"independent expenditure\" limit for campaigns in federal law, the Court found in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that a prohibition on independent expenditures does not generally advance in a sufficient manner the interest of preventing corruption: \"[W]e now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\" For this reason, it would seem that legislation which would restrict all private parties and entities receiving federal contracts or grants from engaging in public policy or political advocacy, for example, with their own non-governmental resources, would not necessarily advance the interest in the prevention of \"corruption\" of candidates or officeholders, or undue influences on basic governmental processes. As noted by the Supreme Court in Citizens United , the absence of any pre-arrangement or coordination with the candidate in the making of an \"independent expenditure\" by a private entity mitigates against a corrupting influence or quid pro quo agreement, and thus does not necessarily reach the concerns in so-called \"pay to play\" corruption schemes.", "A governmental interest in attempting to \"balance\" competing voices in public policy or campaign debate, by limiting expression of one group over another, was found by the Supreme Court not to be a compelling interest to justify suppression of speech. The Supreme Court thus rejected the so-called \"antidistortion\" rationale that would attempt to limit the influence of monied interests and aggregated wealth over less well-funded persons or groups in a political campaign.", "If the governmental purpose is not to prevent corruption of candidates or governmental processes, or to \"balance\" the relative weight of voices in the political arena, then such interest might be to protect government funds and programs. In such case the interests may be two-fold: one would be to prevent the use and diversion of federal government funds for private political or public policy advocacy activities which are not authorized by Congress; and the second would be to prevent the federal government \"subsidizing\" political advocacy, lobbying, or voter registration activities of private parties by providing such private parties with federal dollars for other purposes.", "As to the governmental interest of not paying for private political or lobbying activities, clearly the federal government need not \"pay for\" nor directly \"subsidize\" the political advocacy or lobbying of private entities. To that end, it should be noted, as discussed earlier, that current federal law and regulations already expressly prohibit the use of contract or grant funds by any governmental contractor or grantee for lobbying and political purposes, or the paying for or \"charging off\" of expenses for political advocacy or lobbying to any government contract or grant. The federal government may clearly limit the use of the funds it appropriates in this way for the specific public purposes it desires. Similarly, the government need not \"subsidize,\" through such things as tax exemptions or specific deductions for lobbying, the private advocacy activities of organizations or persons. In Cammarano v. United States , the Supreme Court noted that the denial of a tax deduction as a business expense for the lobbying expenses of a private entity was permissible because:", "Petitioners are not being denied a tax deduction because they engage in constitutionally protected activities, but are simply being required to pay for those activities entirely out of their own pockets, as everyone else engaging in similar activities is required to do under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.", "In the case of Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington , supra , the Supreme Court similarly approved the restrictions on \"charitable,\" 501(c)(3) organizations' lobbying as a basis for their tax exemption, and the deductibility of contributions to them from the donor's federal income tax, since \"Congress has merely refused to pay for the lobbying out of public moneys .\"", "If the interest of the government in a legislative restriction is merely to avoid directly subsidizing or paying for private lobbying or political activities out of public monies, then a restriction in any proposed legislation which barred all privately funded advocacy by grant or contract recipients might arguably, in the first instance, be considered \"over-inclusive\" because it reaches activities, speech, and conduct paid for completely with private , non-federal monies, as well as privately-funded activities wholly outside of the realm of the federal program. As such, the restriction may arguably be found, with respect to otherwise protected First Amendment speech and conduct, to be unnecessarily overbroad and burdensome on such First Amendment rights. As discussed by the Supreme Court in FCC v. League of Women Voters, supra, it may be argued that a less restrictive means to reach this goal of not paying for private lobbying or political activities out of government funds may be to enact and enforce more effective audits, restrictions, regulations, and accounting procedures prohibiting the use of any federal funds for such activities. This would reach the presumed goal of limiting the use of federal funds, but would not be a potentially overly broad restriction that would encompass within its prohibition the exercise by private recipients of protected First Amendment speech and conduct financed entirely with their own resources, and would not punish entities for entering the public debate on community, civic and national issues by engaging in protected public advocacy.", "A further interest of the government forwarded by legislation might also be to prevent an \"indirect\" subsidy for groups who engage in political advocacy by providing such groups with federal funds for other non-advocacy activities, studies, or services which the government desires. As such, this purpose is distinguished from the prevention of the use of government funds directly for lobbying or advocacy, or the \"subsidy\" for lobbying that a tax exemption for such activities or all activities of the organization would provide. The argument is that money is \"fungible\" and grants and contracts for proper public purposes to private groups \"frees up\" other non-federal money which the private grantee may use for any purposes, including lobbying or voter registration activities.", "There may be significant questions raised, however, as to whether a government grant or contract for one specific public purpose or service performed, or product provided, by the recipient is or may be considered a \"subsidy\" for other , private activities of the grant or contract recipient which are funded wholly by private, non-federal contributions and funds. The Supreme Court, in another context, has found that such a grant is not a subsidy of the other, non-federally funded activities. In Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty v. Regan , the Supreme Court specifically found that providing grant funds to a religious organization for one (secular) purpose, does not constitute a federal \"subsidy\" of the other, private, non-federally funded religious activities of the organization. Even the fact that federal grant funds to an organization for public purposes might arguably \"free up\" non-federal money for other, private activities which the government does not want to fund, does not make the federal grant or payment a subsidy of those other purposes. In specifically rejecting the \"fungibility\" of cash argument, the Supreme Court said,", "None of our cases requires us to invalidate these reimbursements simply because they involve payments in cash. The Court \"has not accepted the recurrent argument that all aid is forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resources on religious ends.\" Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734,743 (1973).", "The Supreme Court has thus expressly rejected this theory as a realistic or necessary outcome or result of government assistance to some activities of an organization vis-a-vis other, independent activities. It is logical to assume, therefore, that such concern would not necessarily be recognized as a \"compelling\" or \"overriding\" interest by the Court which could justify direct restrictions on protected First Amendment conduct that a private entity engages in with its own resources, outside of the government-sponsored program, whenever a government contract or grant is received."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
