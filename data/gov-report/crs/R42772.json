Because the negotiating parties include Vietnam, a major apparel producer that now mainly sources yarns and fabrics from China and other Asian nations, the agreement has the potential to shift global trading patterns for textiles and demand for U.S. textile exports. Canada and Mexico, both significant regional textile markets for the United States, and Japan, a major manufacturer of high-end textiles and industrial fabrics, are also participants in the negotiations.", "U.S. textile manufacturers produce yarn, thread, and fabric for apparel, home furnishings, and various industrial applications. In 2013, the U.S. textile industry generated nearly $57 billion in shipments and directly employed about 230,700 Americans, accounting for approximately 2% of all U.S. factory jobs. More than one-third of U.S. textile production is exported, with the bulk of the exports going to Western Hemisphere nations that are members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). These free trade agreements provide that certain exports from member countries may enter the U.S. market duty-free only if they are made from textiles produced in the region. This has encouraged manufacturers in Mexico and Central America to use U.S.-made yarns and fabrics in apparel, home furnishings, and other products. Exports to the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR countries contributed to a U.S. trade surplus of $2.4 billion in yarns and fabrics in 2013.", "The TPP has the potential to affect U.S. textile exporters in at least two ways. First, it could enable Asian apparel producers, principally Vietnam, to export clothing to the United States duty-free. This would eliminate much of the advantage now enjoyed by Western Hemisphere apparel producers in the U.S. market and, because Vietnamese manufacturers make little use of U.S.-made textiles, could reduce demand for U.S. textile exports. Second, if the TPP were to allow Western Hemisphere apparel manufacturers to use yarn and fabric made anywhere in the TPP region and still enjoy preferential access to the U.S. market, an enlarged Vietnamese textile industry could, at some future time, compete with U.S. exporters in Mexico and Central America.", "Textile industry trade groups have urged the United States to insist on a strict \"yarn forward\" rule that allows a garment to enter the United States duty-free only if yarn production, fabric production, and cutting and sewing of the finished garment all occur within the TPP region. U.S. negotiators have also proposed that certain textile inputs \"not commercially available\" in TPP-member countries could be sourced from outside the region, including China. On the other side, retailers and apparel companies with extensive global supply chains want maximum flexibility for sourcing and are less concerned about whether textiles manufactured in the United States are used; they urge textiles and apparel to be treated like other products in any TPP agreement, and they want any apparel cut and sewn within the TPP area, regardless of where the fabric originates, to be eligible for duty-free entry. Members of Congress have voiced their support for both sides.", "The TPP seems likely to have less impact on those segments of the U.S. textile industry that do not supply apparel manufacturing. U.S. manufacturers of household and technical textiles appear to be internationally competitive, and it is not evident that lower-wage countries would have comparative advantage in these highly capital-intensive sectors."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is a proposed regional free trade agreement (FTA) currently under negotiation among 12 Pacific Rim countries.

This report examines the potential implications of a TPP agreement, if one is reached, for the U.S. textile manufacturing industry.", "In 2013, the United States exported about $14 billion in yarns and fabrics worldwide. More than half of this output was shipped to Western Hemisphere nations that are members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). These FTAs provide that certain exports from member countries may enter the U.S. market duty-free only if they are made from textiles produced in the region.

Exports to the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR countries contributed to a U.S. trade surplus of $2.4 billion in yarns and fabrics in 2013.", "The TPP marks the first FTA negotiation for the United States initiated since the complete end of quotas on textile and apparel trade. Duty-free access to the U.S. market under TPP could be of considerable benefit to Asian manufacturers, which now face U.S. import duties on textiles and apparel of up to 32%. Textile industry trade groups have warned that, if approved, the TPP could lead to domestic job loss if it results in apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere, which often use U.S.-made textiles, losing U.S. market share to producers in Vietnam and other TPP countries. Aligned against them are retailers and apparel companies that want to be able to import apparel from producers wherever they are located, regardless of whether U.S. textiles are used; they urge full inclusion of textiles and apparel in any TPP agreement and favor preferential access for apparel cut and sewn from fabric made in countries not included in the TPP, such as China."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The U.S. Textile Industry and Its Markets", "paragraphs": ["With nearly $57 billion in industry shipments in 2013, textile manufacturing, which produces yarns and fabrics from raw materials such as cotton and various man-made fibers, is a supplier industry to three industrial sectors. The apparel industry, which transforms textiles into clothing, consumed only 12% of U.S.-manufactured fibers in 2012. About 40% of textile output went into home textiles and floor coverings, while almost half was used in technical textiles such as conveyor belts and automotive floor coverings.", "Textile manufacturing occurs largely in highly automated factories, whereas apparel manufacturing is characterized by decentralized, globally dispersed production networks that are coordinated by lead firms that control design, branding, and other activities. Many of the world's largest apparel retailing and marketing firms are headquartered in the United States, but because it typically costs less to manufacture apparel abroad, the United States imports far more clothing than it makes domestically. U.S. apparel shipments totaled more than $13 billion, and apparel manufacturers directly employed 143,600 workers in 2013 (see Appendix A ).", "Unlike textile manufacturers, most U.S.-headquartered apparel firms have limited or no U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Some manufacture through a combination of facilities they own and third-party arrangements, often with foreign factories. Others rely entirely on arrangements with third-party suppliers, mostly in Asia. Large retailers frequently contract directly with apparel sourcing companies, which in turn portion out the production work to independent manufacturers. The United States was responsible for approximately 1% of the $460 billion of global apparel exports in 2013, according to statistics from the World Trade Organization. China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Mexico rank as the top apparel suppliers to the United States. Beyond apparel manufacturing, countless other functions related to apparel are done domestically, such as design, branding, and marketing of finished products.", "The U.S. home furnishings industry has fared far better against import competition than the apparel industry, mainly because manufacturing of carpets, curtains, and tablecloths is highly automated. For example, the development of larger, faster carpet-tufting machines contributed to a decline in employment at U.S. carpet and rug mills, from 49,000 workers in 2003 to 31,200 in 2013. Shipments from U.S. carpet and rug mills totaled $8.9 billion in 2012. The health of the carpet and rug mills industry is tied in large part to conditions in the domestic housing and commercial building markets, raw material prices, and competition from foreign producers.", "The output of technical textile mills is used across various industrial sectors. According to one recent estimate, automotive manufacturers use more than 200,000 tons of textiles for automotive interior fabrics, including upholstery, headliners, and door panels, excluding textiles for carpets, floor mats, tire cords, seat belts, or air bags. The Industrial Fabrics Association International (IFAI) estimated that in 2013 about 160,000 workers in the United States produced fabrics specifically for the technical textile market."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Textile Manufacturing Process", "paragraphs": ["Textile manufacturing begins with fiber, which can be harvested from natural resources (e.g., cotton, wool, silk, or ramie), manufactured from cellulosic materials (e.g., rayon or acetate), or made of man-made synthetic materials (e.g., polyester, nylon, or acrylic). After the raw fibers are shipped from the farm or the chemical plant, they pass through four main stages of processing (see Figure 1 ): ", "yarn production, in which fiber is spun into filament or yarn; fabric production, which can take place at very small mills or large textile mill operations, and involves primarily either weaving or knitting; finishing, which prepares the textiles for further use by processes such as bleaching, printing, dyeing, and mechanical or wet finishing; and, fabrication, where the finished cloth is converted into apparel, household, or industrial products.", "Worldwide, in 2013, the textile industry produced 86.6 million metric tons of textiles. Man-made fibers accounted for more than two-thirds of total production, compared to the share of natural to man-made fibers at about half in the 1990s. Most of the global growth in man-made textile manufacturing has taken place in China, which by 2013 accounted for about two-thirds of total production. The United States was responsible for 5% of global production of man-made fibers in 2013. No other country produced more than 4% of the global total in 2013. ", "Cotton is the most important natural fiber. In the 2013-2014 marketing year, China ranked as the world's largest producer of cotton at 7 million metric tons, followed by India and the United States. Other large cotton producers include Pakistan, Brazil, Uzbekistan, and Turkey. Many of the leading cotton producers are also leading mill users of raw cotton. The top four consumers of cotton are China, India, Pakistan, and Turkey, which together account for more than two-thirds of world consumption. Consumption of cotton by U.S. textile mills peaked in 1997. Since then, due to the decrease in domestic textile production caused by competition from imported textile and apparel products, U.S. mill use of cotton has dropped about 70%. As for other natural fibers, two TPP negotiating partners, Australia and New Zealand, are among the world's leading wool-growing nations. Vietnam is a top 10 producer of silk, but accounts for only a small portion of global production. China and India are the world's two largest silk producers.

", "Domestic textile manufacturers have invested heavily in technology to reduce operating costs. For example, modern industrial looms incorporate air-jets to weave at speeds of 2,000 picks per minute (compared with 200 picks in 1980, which at the time was considered fast). Some modern textile mills have become almost completely automated, churning out thousands of square yards every hour with as few as 10 or 20 employees. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. textile industry invested $18.9 billion in new plants and equipment between 2001 and 2012. Since then, several manufacturers, including Gildan Activewear, Parkdale Mills, Zagis USA, and Keer, have announced plans to increase U.S. production of yarns, nonwoven and technical fabrics, and other types of textiles by building new textile plants or expanding current facilities. ", "Because yarn and fabric production are capital- and scale-intensive, they demand higher worker skills than apparel production. As a consequence, the textile industry has been less prone to relocation to lower-wage countries than apparel manufacturing. Significant production remains in the United States, Japan, and South Korea, where skilled labor is available and manufacturers can raise the capital to finance weaving mills costing an estimated $12 million to $25 million and spinning mills costing $50 million to $70 million. ", "Among all U.S. manufacturing industries, textiles rank near the top in productivity increases. This can be attributed both to automation and to the closure of less efficient mills. While imports of textiles and apparel undoubtedly have contributed to lower industry employment, over the past decade more than 200,000 textile manufacturing jobs have been lost due to automation, according to private estimates.", "At the end of 2013, the domestic textile industry employed about 230,700 workers, accounting for fewer than 2% of the nearly 12 million domestic factory jobs (see Appendix A ). Average annual pay was $39,000 in 2013, far below the average of $61,096 for all manufacturing. Figure 2 shows employment has declined by two-thirds since 1990.

Quotas on imports from more than 70 countries limited the quantities of textiles (such as cotton yarns and synthetic fabrics) and particular garments (such as t-shirts and sweaters) that could enter the United States and the European Union each year. This system made it necessary for buyers of textile and apparel products to source from countries for which quotas for particular products were available. This spread manufacturing to an ever-increasing number of countries, instead of concentrating it where production was cheapest.", "The expiry of the ATC on January 1, 2005, eliminated all textile and apparel quotas for members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since then, buyers have been able to source from any WTO member country, subject only to tariffs. However, U.S. tariffs on textile and apparel imports vary considerably from country to country, governed by bilateral and regional arrangements discussed in greater detail below.

Vietnam publicly supports a \"cut and sew\" rule that would allow it, and other TPP participants, to enjoy preferential access for apparel that has been cut and sewn from fabric made in China or other countries not included in the TPP. ", "U.S. domestic interests disagree over what ROOs should be included in any TPP agreement. On one side are fiber, yarn, and fabric manufacturers who want rules that would require more U.S. or TPP content. Organized as the Textile and Apparel Alliance for TPP (TAAT), they have endorsed a basic \"yarn forward\" rule applicable to all TPP countries. They warn that without such a rule Vietnamese apparel manufacturers could use Chinese textiles, thereby giving Chinese textile manufacturers duty-free access to the U.S. market and undermining U.S. textile production. More than 165 Members of Congress have endorsed TAAT's position, sending a letter in support to the U.S. Trade Representative recommending a yarn-forward rule.", "On the other side are U.S. retailers and importers of apparel, many with no domestic manufacturing, along with the National Retail Federation (NRF) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These interests formed the Trans-Pacific Partnership Apparel Coalition, which opposes the \"yarn forward\" ROO and calls for a \"flexible, liberal, 21 st century ROO standard\" for textiles and apparel. Their preferred rule would require only that the sewing of a garment be done in a TPP country to get duty-free status. This would permit use of yarns and fabrics from China and other countries in garments qualifying for duty-free access to all TPP countries. The TPP Apparel Coalition recommends that apparel qualify for preferential treatment if it meets a regional value content threshold, making it easier to switch sources of supply as fashions and relative costs change. Some Members of Congress support this position, and they asked President Obama in May 2012 to pursue \"a flexible general rule of origin for apparel that maximizes the incentive to grow U.S. exports, value, and jobs in the TPP.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Concerns about the health of domestic textile manufacturing have influenced many past trade negotiations, and they now figure prominently in the regional TPP negotiations. For textile manufacturers, the inclusion of a significant apparel producer such as Vietnam in a free trade agreement holds the potential to dramatically shift global trading patterns. ", "Depending upon its provisions, it is imaginable that a TPP agreement could result in apparel made in Vietnam displacing apparel from the Western Hemisphere in the U.S. market, weakening the export markets now served by U.S. textile producers in Mexico and Central America. An alternative scenario might allow apparel manufacturers in Mexico, a TPP participant, to use textiles made in any TPP country and still enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market; while no Asian TPP participant currently has the textile production capacity to supply Western Hemisphere producers in this way, it is conceivable that such capacity could be installed in the future.", "U.S. textile manufacturing interests have urged U.S. negotiators to insist on a \"yarn forward\" rule in the TPP. This would require that for apparel, home furnishings, or technical textiles to benefit from duty-free access, they would have to be assembled in a TPP country from fabric manufactured in a TPP country out of yarn produced in a TPP country. Such a rule would severely limit the ability of countries such as Vietnam to use Chinese or Indian yarns and fabrics in apparel, home furnishings, or technical textile products for the U.S. market, although it would not constrain imports if Vietnam were to develop a more fully integrated textile industry. However, a \"yarn forward\" rule would also affect U.S. apparel consumers and the household textiles and specialty textiles markets, as these products made in TPP countries from yarns and fabrics produced elsewhere would not qualify for duty-free treatment.", "Domestic manufacturers of household and technical textiles seem less likely to be immediately affected by any TPP agreement. U.S. manufacturers appear to be internationally competitive in these sectors, and Vietnam's low labor costs will provide little comparative advantage in areas where production is highly automated. In the case of technical textiles, U.S. manufacturers also benefit from proximity to their industrial customers. Domestic technical textile manufacturers point out that Vietnam has been expanding its reach into industrial fabrics and higher-end textiles in recent years, including tire cord and coated fabrics, but Vietnam will probably not be a significant global competitor in the near future.", "Appendix A.
