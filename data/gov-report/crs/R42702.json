Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the President to issue declarations that provide states, tribes, and localities with a range of federal assistance in response to natural and man-made incidents. Since 1953 the frequency of declarations has increased. For example, the average number of major disaster declarations issued from 1960 to 1969 was roughly 18.6 per year. In contrast, the average number of major disaster declarations issued from 2000 to 2009 was 57.1 per year. The highest number was declared in 2011, with 97 major disaster declarations.", "Declarations are of concern to Members of Congress and state delegations when incidents occur in their states and/or congressional districts. Declarations are also of broader congressional interest for at least two reasons: (1) the costs involved with the federal assistance provided by the declarations, and (2) concerns that declarations may be used as political tools\u2014especially during election years.", "Analysis of Stafford Act declarations from 1953 to 2016 demonstrates that:", "most emergency declarations are for winter storms and hurricanes; most major disaster declarations are for floods, tornados, winter storms, and hurricanes; the average number of declarations issued per year in presidential election years from 1974 to 2016 is slightly higher than the average number of declarations in other years from 1974 to 2016, but the number is not significant enough to draw a decisive conclusion regarding their use as a political tool.", "After providing an overview of each type of declaration, this report discusses factors that may be responsible for the increase in frequency of declarations, including federal policy changes, increases in severe weather incidents, population growth, and development.", "Some may contend that declaration policies should not be changed because they trigger important federal assistance to states and localities. Others argue that policies should be implemented to reduce either the number of declarations being issued each year, or the amount of federal assistance that they provide, or both. These policies include", "amending certain Stafford Act policies; changing the per capita threshold formula used to recommend the issuance of a declaration; implementing a state capacity indicator to assess whether the state is capable of addressing an incident on its own; substituting federal loans to states for recovery grants; and adjusting the federal to state cost-share.", "Such changes could reduce declarations and shift a portion of the funding back to the states. On the other hand, reducing declarations could hamper the ability of states and localities to recover from an incident and could create long-term consequences.", "The selected approach will likely be influenced by how policymakers view the role of the government when a disaster strikes. It is generally agreed that the government should help disaster victims in times of need, but it is debatable whether the fiscal responsibility resides primarily with the federal or the state government. Many of the policy options described in this report shift a greater share of disaster-related costs to states and localities. It remains to be seen if reducing declarations and/or limiting the amount of disaster assistance provided to requesting states would severely disrupt the state's ability to respond and recover from an incident.", "This report concludes that the upward trend in declarations will likely continue if declaration policies remain unchanged and severe weather patterns, population growth, and development continue to increase. All of these variables appear to play a role in declaration activity. It could be argued that the policy mechanisms used to address the increase in declarations should be shaped in response to the given variable or variables. This may prove to be difficult because it is unclear which of the variables (or combination of variables) has had the greatest impact on the increase in disaster declarations over the years.", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["When a state is overwhelmed by an emergency or major disaster, the governor may request assistance from the federal government.

In contrast, from 2000 to 2009 the average number of declarations issued per year was 57.1. Calendar year 2011 was the busiest year on record with 97 major disaster declarations. ", "Congressional concern over the rising number of declarations is primarily focused on their associated costs because once declared, the majority of disaster relief costs (at least 75%) are shifted from the state to the federal government. The current fiscal environment, including concern over the federal deficit, has heightened congressional interest in the costs of disasters, leading to proposals to offset some portion of disaster assistance spending by implementing new budgetary mechanisms.", "The increase in declarations has led some critics to argue that thresholds for issuing major disaster declarations are set too low, allowing too many \"marginal incidents\" to receive a declaration. Related criticisms and questions have been voiced concerning the declarations process. For example, are incidents increasing or is the federal government being more generous in its interpretation of disaster or emergency criteria? Another point of discussion is the relative capacity of state governments to respond to disaster events. The federal government's openness in describing factors considered for declarations may have led some state officials to believe they have met the factors under consideration and are entitled to support.

Since that amount is larger than $500,000, cumulative fire damages in Pennsylvania must meet or exceed $2,724,660 to be eligible for assistance. In contrast, the individual fire threshold for Alaska is $100,000, but the cumulative threshold is $500,000, not the sum of three individual fire thresholds ($300,000). For some states, such as West Virginia, the state population is high enough that the individual threshold exceeds $100,000.

While tribes and Native Americans have long received assistance under Stafford Act declarations, working through the state government for all assistance has been viewed as an issue of tribal sovereignty. For example, states might have been reluctant to request on behalf of a tribe when the damage was localized on tribal property. Other challenges to administering disaster relief involved language barriers and the physical isolation of some tribal lands. Also, the tribes wished to have the same ability as states to help manage the response and recovery from a disaster.

In addition, the \"Savings Provision\" of Sections 401 and 501 ensures that a tribal government is not prohibited from receiving assistance under a declaration made by the President at the request of the governor if the President has not made a separate declaration for the tribal government. In effect, a tribal government will retain the ability to be treated as a local government in those situations. There has only been limited use of the Savings Provision over the first several years.

As illustrated in Figure 7 , the reporting of weather incidents has had an upward trajectory since 1974. In the latter half of the 1970s, there was a gap between the number of declarations and severe weather incidents, with more declarations than reported weather incidents. In the 1980s and the first part of the 1990s the two tracked fairly closely together, but then another gap occurred in the early part of the 2000s, this time with more reported weather incidents than declarations.

Others might be skeptical of the data. For example, it may be argued that the trend shown in Figure 7 could be explained by improvements in weather tracking technology. As this technology becomes more sophisticated, more weather incidents are reported. Furthermore, Figure 7 does not provide statistical information on flooding\u2014one of the most frequent types of incidents to receive declarations\u2014or other incidents such as winter storms.

From 1950 through 1980, the federal role in disaster response and recovery gradually expanded, both through executive action and legislation. In the 1950s, the federal approach to disaster assistance was less comprehensive than today. In general, the assistance consisted of initial repairs to infrastructure, modest assistance to help families and individuals, and loans for homeowners and businesses. Later there was an emphasis on mitigation to lessen the effect of future disaster events. Key legislation was passed in each decade, but especially in the 1970s, that addressed distinct problems caused by natural disasters. This was also the time when FEMA was created by President Jimmy Carter under his reorganization plan of 1978. As one observer summarized the myriad of actions taken during this period:", "For almost thirty years the federal government had, at different times, inched toward a policy that gave administrators a superior and determinative role in emergency management. At times during that period federal policy received a hard push from nature, such as the Alaska earthquake or Hurricane Betsy. Periodically, members of Congress or administration officials nudged federal policy in a different direction. By 1978, however, experience had shown that coordination of federal and nonfederal action, not dispersion, was the best approach.", "The federal/state framework that had been created was, ironically, not really tested during the 1980s. That relatively quiet decade did not have large disaster events to present challenges to the disaster relief programs nor large supplemental expenditure requests to Congress. In spite of that, P.L. 100-707 , which became law in 1988, contained a number of significant changes. In addition to naming the Disaster Relief Act in honor of former Vermont Senator Robert Stafford, it also established in law the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) as well as the federal/state cost-share for the Public Assistance program. As a result of the quiescent period disaster policy changes then enacted that would later address an increasing number of unique and devastating disaster situations, were not employed until the 1990s.", "P.L. 106-390 , the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (hereinafter DMA2K) established for the first time a pre-disaster mitigation (hereinafter PDM) program to reduce risk regardless of disaster declarations. While the PDM program was funded separately, outside of the President's Disaster Relief Fund, DMA2K also permitted increased funding to states under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which is funded from the Disaster Relief Fund. However, while DMA2K increased potential mitigation spending, it also capped home repair costs at $5,000 per household, which limited disaster spending in that category.", "Significant changes to the administration of disaster relief were included in the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006, P.L. 109-295 (hereinafter PKEMRA). This legislation was developed in response to the problems encountered in the recovery from the Gulf Coast storms of 2005. While the legislation did not alter the declaration process, it did make several changes to Stafford Act authorities that increased the available aid for post-disaster recovery. For example, the $5,000 cap that was enacted in 2000 was repealed. Also, PKEMRA included authority for states to provide case management services for disaster victims as well as assistance for transportation.", "In 2013 Congress passed the Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act of 2013, P.L. 113-2 , in response to the impact of Hurricane Sandy.

Most of these events were defined as snow emergencies because of the relatively limited assistance requested and provided. However, since FEMA published new regulations for snow declarations in 2009, the agency considers most, but not all, snow-related events as major disasters. As FEMA explained, the intent of the change was to make FEMA's snow policy conform more closely to the Stafford Act:", "FEMA's 1999 Snow Assistance Policy evaluated requests for snow assistance under both the criteria for an ''emergency'' declaration under 44 CFR 206.35, as well as a request for a ''major disaster'' declaration under 44 CFR 206.36. However, the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5122, and FEMA regulations, 44 CFR 206.2(a)(17), expressly include ''snowstorm'' in the definition of a ''major disaster.'' By comparison, FEMA regulations define ''emergencies'' as those types of events that do not qualify under the definition of a major disaster. In this revised policy, snowstorm events will be considered by FEMA for major disaster declarations under 44 CFR 206.36, consistent with the Stafford Act and FEMA regulations.

The number of declarations in these instances is doubled when a state receives both an emergency and major disaster declaration for the same event.", "These pre-landfall declarations are made for states \"immediately threatened with impact from a major hurricane or typhoon.\" The guidance suggests these declarations be made for storms projected to a category 3, 4, or 5 on the Saffir/Simpson scale.

It remains a process that can be observed and evaluated as it occurs in the area affected by the disaster and grows opaque as it moves up through layers of FEMA and DHS management to the White House.", "That observation reflects the fact that damage assessments are done publicly with federal, state, and local officials working together to determine the amount of eligible damage. Similarly, the governor's letters requesting federal, supplemental help are usually available to the public. In that respect, FEMA provides a template to state emergency management offices so they can anticipate the types of information that should be provided (including legal language regarding state activities, state commitments toward program cost shares, and other necessary information). ", "With the encouragement of Congress, FEMA has gradually made the disaster declaration process more transparent. The prime example of this greater transparency is the set of regulations that details the factors FEMA considers when evaluating a governor's request. These regulations first appeared in the Federal Register in September 1999.", "Another step in the direction of transparency was the publishing, on FEMA's website, of the preliminary damage assessment (PDA) reports that help to inform both the governor's decision on whether to make a request as well as the declaration decision itself.

Prior to the move for greater transparency, FEMA officials could have private discussions to evaluate a range of factors when determining a state's financial capacity to respond to an incident without federal assistance. These factors could include the state's economic well-being or whether the state had a budget surplus, among others. These factors are often subjective and difficult to quantify, which in turn makes the rationale for certain recommendations more difficult to justify. Some would contend that recommendations that are exclusively based on per capita thresholds make the recommendation process appear more equitable, but in reality, just using per capita thresholds to determine whether to provide disaster assistance eliminates important factors that establish state capacity. It could be argued that the move toward transparency eliminated private and frank discussions concerning state capacity that could potentially prevent a state from receiving federal assistance for an incident it could conceivably handle on its own.", "Finally, as emergency managers have become more knowledgeable of the declaration process and the use of per capita indicators, they may dissuade the governor from making a request when they believe the per capita threshold for their particular incident is too low.

In comparison, in all years without a presidential election, there are an average of 52.1 declarations and 16.0 turndowns. However, as shown in Table 4 , there is also variation in the average numbers of declarations and turndowns in years without a presidential election.", "On one hand, the increase in declarations and decrease in turndowns may lead some to conclude that political factors influence declaration decisions during presidential election years.

It is difficult to establish evidence to support that political reasons play a role in declaration determinations.", "As demonstrated in Table 3 , the differences in presidential and non-presidential election years are slight and prove to be statistically insignificant. Moreover, methodologically, there are more nonelection years in the sample than election years, which may skew the results since an increase in the sample will usually generate a figure that is more statistically normal. Additionally, the slight increase in declarations during presidential election years could be the result of other variables that have been described in this report.

Both of these arguments are difficult to prove and recent studies on this issue have led to differing conclusions. For example, in a 2002 study economists Thomas A. Garrett and Russell S. Sobel postulated:", "States politically important to the President have a higher rate of disaster declaration by the President, and disaster expenditures are higher in states having congressional representation on FEMA oversight committees.

For example, it could be argued that President Reagan's number of approvals of gubernatorial requests was low and his record of turndowns was high, representing a conservative approach to governing in the disaster realm. However, very few natural disaster events occurred during President Reagan's presidency (see Figure 7 ). Had there been more disasters he may have approved more gubernatorial requests for assistance.
