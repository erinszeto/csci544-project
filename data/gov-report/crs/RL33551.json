Of the $120 million provided for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, $15 million was to fund continued advertising against the use of methamphetamine. No more than 10% of the campaign's appropriation could be used for administrative costs.

This differs from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods, a practice that had been utilized by most U.S. agricultural exporters to Cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001. U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress strongly objected that the action constituted a new sanction that violated the intent of TSRA, and could jeopardize millions of dollars in U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba.
