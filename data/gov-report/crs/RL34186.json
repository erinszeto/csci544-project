Railroads accounted for over 70% of coal shipments to power plants in 2005, and due to economic and physical limitations on other modes (truck, barge, and conveyor) the heavy dependency of the power industry on rail transportation is likely to continue into the future. From the standpoint of the rail industry, coal transportation is an important business, accounting in recent years for about 20% of freight revenues for the major railroads.", "The mutual dependency between the rail and power industries creates a complex business relationship. There are connections and to some degree tradeoffs between such factors as railroad investments in capacity and service enhancement, and power company tolerance for transportation risk and willingness to carry the cost of larger coal stockpiles. A central point is that increasing the reliability of coal deliveries to power plants costs money, as does coping with disruptions. A central issue between power companies and railroads is how these costs should be shared.", "Proposed legislation before the 110th Congress discussed in this report includes the Freight Rail Infrastructure Capacity Expansion Act of 2007 (S. 1125 and H.R. 2116), the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 2007 (S. 953 and H.R. 2125), and the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2007 (S. 772 and H.R. 1650).", "This report will be updated as developments warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction and Review of Findings", "paragraphs": ["Half the nation's electricity comes from coal, and most of that coal is delivered to power plants by railroads.

The causes of these problems vary, including severe weather; surges in demand; difficulties with rail system integration consequent to railroad mergers; and major, unplanned maintenance programs. The most significant events were probably in 1997 and 1999 (merger-related), and in 2005 (related to unplanned maintenance to western coal lines). Research indicates that each of these events involved major, widespread congestion and concomitant delivery delays. However, the cost consequences of these events appear to be ill defined. We are unaware of any comprehensive cost estimates by the electric power industry, government agencies, or other entities. CRS identified, from scattered electric power industry sources, estimates totaling $228 million in costs from the rail service delays that began in 2005 ( Appendix B ).", "In addition to these major events, other more persistent indicators of service issues have appeared. The average speed of coal unit trains on the major coal-carrying railroads has generally declined since the early part of this decade. The electric power industry and other industrial shippers claim that the railroads are increasingly unwilling to offer strong service quality guarantees. This may indicate the reluctance, or inability, of the railroads to guarantee service quality when their systems are capacity constrained.", "Capacity limits on the rail system appear to have contributed to coal transportation service problems. The rail industry has historically been plagued with uneconomic excess capacity. Since passage of the Staggers Rail Act in 1980, the railroads have brought capacity and the demand for rail services into alignment by increasing traffic, shedding assets and staff, and by generally not building new capacity far ahead of near-term demand expectations.", "It appears that the railroads believe it would be uneconomic to build more buffer capacity to handle service contingencies, and question whether customers would be willing to pay for it. Wall Street has at times encouraged the rail industry to pursue a conservative approach to capital spending. However, without more buffer capacity, the rail network may lose resiliency. Unexpected events, such as bad weather or surges in demand, may be more likely to cause persistent congestion, and delays in deliveries of coal and other commodities.", "A final aspect of tight rail system capacity is that it seems to have been an important factor in allowing the railroad industry\u2014which has never been found revenue adequate by the Surface Transportation Board (STB)\u2014to significantly increase coal and other rates, and boost profits since 2004. Other factors contributing to the ability of the railroads to raise rates include demand growth and muted competition from trucks (due to cost and capacity issues in that sector). Some parties have also suggested that the increase in rates is indicative of the ability of the rail industry to exercise pricing power, at least in some markets. The Government Accountability Office has performed a limited study of this issue, with inconclusive results. The STB is planning a study of this issue, due to be completed in late 2008.", "The coal stockpiles stored at power plants are in some respects a backstop to rail system capacity. Power plant coal stocks cannot replace reliable rail service\u2014even large stocks will eventually be depleted by a major transportation disruption, and not all plants have the space to store large amounts of coal\u2014but stocks can act as a \"shock absorber,\" postponing the need for plant operators to find expensive alternative fuel or electricity supplies in the event of delivery delays. Power plant coal stockpiles, measured in days of burn, have generally been declining since the 1970s (stocks dropped by 40% by the latter half of the 1990s). Coal transportation problems likely contributed somewhat to this decline, but a primary factor seems to have been efforts by the power industry to cut costs to improve financial results. In the case of regulated electric utilities, the impetus to cut costs was sometimes at the behest of regulators. The unregulated independent power producers (IPPs), who entered the coal generation market in the 1990s with the advent of power market restructuring, have generally maintained lower stocks then regulated utilities. This may reflect the greater exposure of IPPs to market forces and investor demands.", "The electric power industry cut stocks even as more coal was shipped long distances from western mines. The decisions made to cut stocks presumably reflected, in part, the service guarantees included in rail transportation contracts, and the receding risk of coal miner strikes as more production came from non-union western mines. Nonetheless, it appears the power industry reduced stocks even as its supply lines lengthened and arguably became more vulnerable.", "Since 2006, as rail service improved, the power industry has increased coal stocks. In addition to rebuilding western coal stocks depleted due to the rail service problems beginning in 2005, this trend probably reflects recognition of the risk of being caught short on coal supplies given the capacity constraints on the rail network. The stock build also may reflect the difficulty, noted above, the power industry (and other industries) claims to have had securing strong service quality guarantees from the railroads.", "Several legislative proposals before the 110 th Congress address rail service and other rail issues such as rate levels. These proposals fall into two categories: tax incentives to encourage the expansion of rail system capacity, and regulatory restructuring proposals aimed at changing the rail regulatory regime that has been in effect since the 1980s.", "The tax incentives are intended to encourage investments in rail system capacity, particularly for investments that expand system capacity. Our understanding is that the incentives would be available to any party making rail-related investments, including, in addition to railroads, power plants and coal mines that make such capital expenditures.", "The objective of increasing system capacity appears to be broadly consistent with the interests of coal and other shippers who want a more robust and reliable rail network, and of transportation planners who believe the market should have more options for moving some freight traffic off of highways. By effectively reducing the cost of capital expansion, the tax incentives also seem to address the reluctance of the rail industry to take on the additional financial risks inherent in greater capital spending.", "Issues that may be of interest in evaluating the tax incentive proposals include:", "Scope of the Problem and Information : There is limited public information on rail system capacity or service for coal shipments and other traffic. This makes it difficult to quantify the current rail capacity and service situation, and would make it difficult to measure any benefits that flow from rail tax incentives. If there is interest in having the government collect and publish additional service and capacity data, a potential issue is data confidentiality. The rail industry may consider detailed capacity and service data to be business sensitive and proprietary. If data confidentiality is a concern, steps can be considered to prevent disclosure of confidential information, such as by aggregating or otherwise masking carrier-specific data. Expected Outcomes : Coal shippers appear to want a fluid, resilient rail network able to operate reliably even under adverse conditions. However, this may imply a level of investment in buffer capacity that the rail industry would find undesirable and unaffordable, even with tax incentives. As noted earlier, excess capacity has historically been a financial burden on the railroad industry; more recently, the close balance between rail capacity and demand appears to have contributed to the ability of the industry to raise rates and increase profits. Because of these factors, the response of the railroad industry to tax incentives may be cautious and yield limited, not system-wide, improvements in capacity and service quality. Control : Some groups have argued that the public should have more control over how the rail tax incentives would be used. The rail industry believes that the direction of rail system investments should be left to private managers who have the best information on railroad capacity constraints and traffic patterns. Another consideration is that it may be difficult to implement some proposals for limiting the tax incentives to certain categories of traffic, such as coal shipments to power plants captive to a single railroad. As pointed out by transportation system analysts, railroads are networks, so an investment in one location can have wide effects. It may therefore be difficult to determine if a specific investment will primarily benefit any one category of traffic.", "The regulatory restructuring proposals include bills that would remove certain antitrust law exemptions that apply to the rail industry, and bills that would more generally revise the current regulatory scheme. The intent of the bills appears to be to use new regulatory rules to introduce more competition into the rail industry. The concept is that more competition will lead to innovation and cost reductions that will improve coal and other service, decrease rates, and help the rail industry win new business. The railroad industry characterizes these proposals as \"re-regulation.\" It argues that the proposals would inhibit the pricing and operational freedom that has been important to the revival of the rail industry, and would cause the industry's finances and service quality to regress.", "The emphasis in the regulatory restructuring proposals on enhanced competition appears consistent with an underlying principal of the current regulatory regime, which is \"to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail\" (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101). However, the proposals would accomplish this goal through new rules and government oversight, so depending on how the goals outlined in the proposed legislation are actually implemented there is a risk that the outcome could be, at least to some extent, more regulatory control instead of more reliance on the market. In general, the outcomes from the regulatory restructuring bills may depend heavily on the details of implementation.", "Other factors that may be of interest in evaluating the regulatory restructuring proposals include:", "Scope of the Problem and Information : Are the coal and other rail service reliability and related issues (such as rates) of sufficient severity to justify major revisions to the current regulatory framework? This is arguably an open question because of the limited available data on rail service, rates, and the degree to which coal and other shippers are subject to market power. Financial Condition : A central objective of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 was to restore the long-term financial health of the railroad industry. An evaluation of regulatory restructuring may turn in part on whether the rail industry has achieved this goal of \"revenue adequacy.\" However, the reliability of the STB's annual revenue adequacy determinations is uncertain. Some parties contend that various aspects of the STB's methodology are flawed. Based on a review of financial literature, one technical criticism seems to have particular significance. This criticism is that the STB, by using a specific computational approach (a \"single-stage discounted cash flow\" model) in combination with the recent high rates of earnings growth in the railroad industry, has overstated the railroad industry's threshold for achieving revenue adequacy. A more general concern is also suggested by a review of financial literature. This is whether the STB's reliance on one financial ratio to determine if a railroad has achieved revenue adequacy may put too much weight on a single metric. A contrast can be drawn to typical electric power rate cases, where an evaluation of multiple factors by the regulatory body is used to determine a utility's rate of return. Service Focus : as an alternative to extensive revision of the current regulatory regime, could more limited changes result in material improvements in coal rail service? If otherwise desirable, a more limited agenda might include elements of current proposals, including giving rail service problems and their resolution greater public visibility; creation of a rail public advocate; and new requirements in the law for reliable rail service.", "The remaining sections of this report include:", "Background: Coal and Rail in the U.S. Power System.

Most coal moved by rail because coal mines are often distant from power plants, and rail is usually the most economical means for moving bulk commodities long distances. Truck shipments of coal are generally uneconomic over about 50 miles; barge is practical only for mines or power plants near navigable water; and conveyors can be used only if a power plant is adjacent to a coal mine.

In 2005 the PRB accounted for 38% of all coal produced in the United States (430 million tons), making it not only the largest source of coal, but the nation's largest single source of any fuel for electricity. PRB coal is in high demand due to its environmental and cost advantages. PRB coal emits fewer air pollutants when burned than most coal. The coal is found in seams dozens of feet thick located near the surface, so it can be strip-mined at low cost. Economical transportation, primarily by rail, has made it practical for PRB coal mined in Wyoming to fuel power plants in Georgia.", "The PRB is in the lightly-populated northern plains. To reach the nation's population and power generation centers the coal must be transported by railroad. Although some PRB coal is transferred from rail to water for final delivery to power plants, almost all shipments originate on railroads.", "The large volume of production in the PRB means that the nation's largest single source of fuel for electricity rests on one concentration of infrastructure located in a limited geographic area. All of this coal comes from 18 mines, most in northeastern Wyoming. PRB shipments are originated by one of two railroads, the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) or the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), and most PRB traffic begins the journey to consumers by traveling over a single rail corridor, the 103 mile \"Joint Line\" in Wyoming ( Figure 2 ). Handling over 60 loaded coal trains a day, each train more than a mile long, the Joint Line is the busiest stretch of railroad in the world. Once out of the PRB, most of the coal travels over a handful of major rail corridors to consumers.", "PRB rail capacity and routing options may increase if a long-planned project to build a new rail line into the PRB comes to fruition. The Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad (DM&E), a regional (\"Class II\") carrier that currently serves grain markets in the northern plains, proposed in 1997 a multi-billion dollar project to open a new route into the PRB. The project would involve upgrading 600 miles of existing rail lines and building about 250 miles of new track. If completed, the DM&E project would open a new outlet for PRB coal into the Midwest, bypassing the Joint Line and the existing BNSF and UP main line rail corridors (see Figures 3, 4, and 5 ).", "Although the DM&E project has been in development for many years and received regulatory approvals, it has never begun construction and there is no firm initial operating date. The backers have been unable to secure the financing needed to launch the project. In February 2007 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) rejected the project's application for a $2.3 billion loan guarantee, concluding that the project was too risky to commit public funds. The project has also been opposed, at least without changes to the routing, by some landowners and communities on the project's route, in particular by the city of Rochester, Minnesota, and the Mayo Clinic.", "In September 2007 the Canadian Pacific Railway, a large (\"Class I\") carrier with operations in the United States and Canada, announced a plan to purchase the DM&E, fold it into the CP system, and possibly pursue the PRB project. Although CP expects to close the acquisition before the end of 2007, it would not actually take control of the DM&E until and if control is approved by the STB. CP expects the STB to complete its review by the end of 2008.", "Based on statements by CP, there is no assurance as to if or when it will commit to building the PRB project. CP stated that it is buying the DM&E based on the DM&E's access to U.S. agricultural and ethanol markets, and it characterized the PRB project as potential \"icing on the cake,\" not as the centerpiece of the deal. Other information indicates that CP's horizon for starting construction could extend as far as 2025, although CP has said that it may make a launch decision within three years. Other observers reportedly claim that \"CP would not have paid so much for the deal if it did not intend to pursue the PRB plan....\" If CP decides to proceed and is able to do so, the expected construction time is reportedly two to three years.", "The DM&E's PRB line would be one of the largest rail construction project in the U.S. in more than a century. If the project is ultimately built, it would add a large amount of capacity to the biggest U.S. coal transportation market.

These railroads play an important role in freight transportation. As described by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), \"in the 'freight transportation service spectrum,' rail occupies a place between and overlapping water transport and trucking. It competes with water transport for heavier, lower-value, less time-sensitive commodities. It competes with trucking for higher-value, often containerized, shipments moving over longer distances. And it is the preferred mode for a number of economically important, but heavy and bulky commodity groups, such as coal, farm products, and minerals.\"", "Within the group of seven Class I railroads, most rail traffic is carried by four dominant carriers: In the western states, the UP and BNSF ( Figures 3 and 4 , above), and in the eastern states, the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) and CSX Transportation (CSX; Figures 6 and 7 , below). These four carriers are the industry giants, accounting in 2005 for 92% of Class I railroad operating revenues.", "The rail industry is sometimes characterized as consisting of two duopolies, one in the east and one in the west. The actual situation may be more complex. The degree to which the railroads have market leverage appears to vary by commodity, individual customer, geography, and other factors. For example, in general the railroads face more competition from trucks for general merchandise shipments than for coal and other heavy bulk goods. A coal-fired plant with access to barge shipments of coal has more competitive leverage in the transportation market than a plant remote from navigable waterways served by a single railroad. The competitive environment also changes over time. As discussed in the report's section on rates, coal rates declined for many years but have more recently increased sharply. The extent to which the rail industry is able to exercise market power appears to vary across markets and time.", "Since 2004 the freight market has been especially favorable for railroads. For reasons discussed later in this report, the rail industry has been able to significantly increase rates, which have translated to strong financial results. In May 2007, UBS Investment Research concluded that \"the North American railroads are in their best financial shape in decades as the so-called rail renaissance enters its fourth year in 2007.\" According to Standard and Poor's, Class I railroad industry profits grew by 46% in 2005 and 32% in 2006, and return on investment also improved substantially. (Note that these results are not necessarily equivalent to the railroad industry achieving the regulatory goal of revenue adequacy, as discussed elsewhere in this report.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Period Before Passage of the Staggers Rail Act", "paragraphs": ["Today's highly concentrated and increasingly profitable rail industry contrasts with the situation in the 1970s. Prior to 1980 the rail industry included 39 Class I railroads, many in poor financial and physical condition. Current policy debates are colored by the history of the railroads, in particular by concerns, expressed by some parties, that changing the existing regulatory system could cause the rail industry to regress, financially and operationally.", "Until the mid-1970s, the rail industry labored under tight federal regulation. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) controlled rail rates, conditions of service, and construction and abandonment of rail lines, and had authority over proposed railroad mergers. This regulatory system was designed for a 19 th and early 20 th Century transportation market dominated by railroads and characterized by \"indiscriminate construction, market manipulation, rate abuses, and discriminatory practices against certain types of freight customers and passengers.\" But by the 1920s the railroads faced increasing competition from trucks and barge shipments. While trucks and barge companies had significant freedom to adjust rates and terms of service to meet market needs, regulation handicapped the ability of the railroads to respond to competition and changing market conditions (regulation did not insulate the industry from periodic booms and busts related to overall economic trends). Between 1950 and 1975 the railroad share of domestic surface freight shipments declined from 63% to 50%, with most of the market share lost to trucks (see Figure 8 ).", "The loss of market share was accompanied by financial and physical decay. In 1970 the Penn Central, the major northeastern railroad, collapsed in what was then the largest bankruptcy in the nation's history. Other large carriers also failed, and for the industry as a whole returns on investment dropped to low levels (just over 1% in 1975). The railroad industry was in \"serious economic decline.\"", "By 1976, 15% of the route miles of the entire Class I rail system were owned by bankrupt carriers. Most of the northeastern rail system had been absorbed within a government-owned corporation, Conrail. In part because of the reluctance of the ICC to allow railroads to abandon lightly-used rail lines, the railroad industry was operating thousands of miles of uneconomic railroad. According to a 1978 U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) report, \"the railroad industry finds itself in the worst economic condition of any privately operated mode of transportation,\" with very low return on investment, deteriorating physical plant, and, if trends continued, the likelihood of more railroads falling under government control.", "As difficult as the picture appeared, the extent and depth of the rail industry's troubles in the 1970s and early 1980s should not be overstated. The financial and physical condition of the rail industry in the 1970s was mixed, not uniform. The 1978 report by DOT cited above, in addition to cataloging the rail industry's troubles, also concluded that the weakness of the rail industry was to a degree a regional problem centered in the Northeast and Midwest, where problems were most severe, and that other parts of the industry were in reasonably good financial and physical condition. The investment analysis firm Standard and Poor's, writing in 1979, found that \"the financially strong and profitable carriers should be able to fund their sizable [capital] requirements from internally generated monies, and excellent credit standings will provide access to the debt and equity markets....the negative industry picture masks sectors of acute weakness and relative strength.\" As DOT concluded in 1978, \"parts of the [rail] system are sick, but the system as a whole is far from dead.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Staggers Act", "paragraphs": ["Congress decided to address the ills of the rail industry with deregulation.

Within this balance, restoring the financial integrity of the railroad industry was a primary objective. According to the conference committee report:", "The overall purpose of the Act is to provide, through financial assistance and freedom from unnecessary regulation, the opportunity for railroads to obtain adequate earnings to restore, maintain and improve their physical facilities while achieving the financial stability of the national rail system.", "The act and its implementation by the ICC and STB have given the railroads wide discretion to freely set coal and other rates in response to market conditions. As directed by the act, the ICC exempted almost entirely from regulation categories of traffic with general access to competitive transportation options, such as most agricultural commodities and intermodal shipments. Shippers of traffic potentially subject to railroad market dominance and rates that could be unreasonable, such as coal and grain shipments, retained the option of appealing rates to the ICC. However, rates could be appealed only if the shipper could demonstrate that it was \"captive\" to one railroad; that is, it had no credible competitive alternative for receiving coal other than delivery by a single railroad.", "The act also provided for:", "Faster processing of railroad applications to merge, and of requests to abandon, sell, or lease track a railroad no longer wanted to operate. The Class I railroads responded with rapid consolidation and contraction of parts of its physical plant. Between 1980 and 2002, the Class I rail industry shrank from 39 carriers to the current seven, of which four account for most traffic and revenues. Other things being equal, the most profitable business for a railroad is typically long-haul movements where the entire route is on its own tracks (\"single-line\" movements). But past regulatory practice had required railroads to offer joint (multi-carrier) rates \"on practically all possible combinations of railroad tracks between two points,\" and to offer identical rates for each route \"without regard to the actual cost of providing the service.\" Staggers gave a railroad wide discretion to rationalize its traffic flows by canceling joint movements, changing rates, and funneling traffic to its single line routes. This was economically beneficial to the railroads, but potentially reduced the competitive routing options available to coal and other shippers. However, Staggers gave the ICC new authority to direct railroads to interchange traffic when in the public interest or \"necessary to provide competitive rail service.\" Railroads were given an unambiguous right to enter into confidential contracts for rail service, with rates and service terms customized for specific customers. The terms of contracts are outside of regulatory jurisdiction.", "The Staggers Act left substantial regulatory powers with the federal government, including rate appeals for non-exempt traffic, authority to approve and condition mergers, authority to direct railroads to routinely interchange traffic at designated gateways when in the public interest, emergency powers to direct rail traffic in the event of disruptions to railroad service such as severe congestion, authority to proscribe unreasonable business practices by railroads, and authority to require financial and operations reports by the rail industry.", "The ICC Termination Act of 1995 ( P.L. 104-88 ) replaced the ICC with the STB, an independent regulatory agency with a three-member board administratively housed within DOT.

As discussed later in this report, the improvement in real-dollar margins after 2003 is consistent with reported increases in rail rates due to tight capacity and other factors.", "The railroads have achieved some cost reductions by encouraging or demanding the transfer of costs from the carriers to shippers. For example, the railcars on a coal train can be either railroad-supplied or \"private\" cars supplied by the shipper. Railroads have offered rate discounts to encourage power companies to provide railcars, freeing the railroads of coal car investment and maintenance costs. Many power companies now provide the railcars used to move coal to their power plants. Between 1987 and 2007 the percentage of coal shipped in private railcars grew from 47% to 68%.", "Cost-shifting combined with rate reductions can save money for railroads and shippers. However, the utility industry claims that as rail capacity has tightened and the market power of the railroads has increased, railroads have sometimes insisted that power companies \"pay for substantial infrastructure improvements identified by the railroad as a condition for discussing or providing rates and service terms.\" From the power company perspective these costs may be \"onerous;\" from the standpoint of the railroad this may be a rational response to a situation in which rail capacity is tight and the carrier must stretch a limited capital budget."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Railroad Capacity", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rail System Capacity and Service", "paragraphs": ["The national rail system generally had substantial excess capacity when the railroad industry was largely deregulated in 1980. The railroads have since brought their capacity and volume of business into alignment by increasing traffic; selling off, leasing, or abandoning surplus track and equipment; and by cutting staff. They have also added capacity in some sectors; for example, to support intermodal traffic and PRB coal shipments.", "The changing traffic mix on the rail system has also contributed to tighter capacity. There is a tradeoff between the number of coal and other bulk cargo trains running on a system versus high-speed/high-priority intermodal traffic. To compete against trucks, rail intermodal traffic must be price competitive and offer speed and timeliness. Consequently, intermodal traffic usually takes priority over coal trains (and other freight traffic). When intermodal and coal trains are in conflict for the same segment of track, the intermodal train is typically allowed to run through while coal and other traffic is moved to a siding or otherwise held. In general, when trains of varying speeds are mixed on a rail system and the faster trains are given priority, the effective carrying capacity of the slower trains\u2014the amount of cargo they can move over a given period of time\u2014is reduced.", "A capacity-constrained rail network may lack resiliency and have limited ability to deal with unexpected events (e.g., bad weather, mechanical failures, unexpected growth in demand). Shocks to the system can result in widespread and prolonged congestion. According to 2006 congressional testimony by the FRA, \"... events that once would have had little effect now cause major disruptions throughout the rail network, because there is no reserve capacity.\" As explained by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO):", "Capacity can be constrained by a shortage of any critical input\u2014infrastructure (for example, tracks or switching systems), equipment (locomotives and other railcars), or labor. And because the transportation industries are networks, the existence of capacity constraints at one key junction or along one key corridor can cause delays that cascade throughout the system. A late afternoon thunderstorm at a hub airport, for example, can cause airplanes destined for that hub to be grounded at numerous other locations. Even people traveling between cities with clear weather may be delayed, either because they have to travel through the disrupted hub or because the aircraft they are supposed to fly aboard has been held up. Such effects can occur in the freight rail industry....", "Unlike airlines, which can \"reset\" their networks relatively quickly because of the mobility of aircraft and their freedom from fixed infrastructure except at the origin and destination, railroad equipment has limited mobility within a system of track and yards that cannot be appreciably expanded or modified over the short term. Consequently, congestion on rail networks can persist for weeks or months.", "When a rail system is congested it loses \"fluidity.\" As the term suggests, the system slows down. Trains are late and the railroads may be unable to carry all the traffic a shipper has contracted for or otherwise wants to move. A congested railroad may not be able to deliver all of the coal required by generators, and power plants can run short of fuel.", "Tight capacity and consequent risks of delays in rail service have been identified since at least the mid-1990s. According to a 1998 White Paper by an advisory panel to the STB, \"the serious railroad transportation problems experienced in 1997 throughout the United States prompted [our analysis of] whether rail infrastructure continues to be capable of efficiently moving the volume of goods demanded by citizens. Our conclusion is that ... our rail system has reached the point of being capacity constrained.\" The Wall Street Journal reported in 1998 that \"railroads say they increasingly are caught short of the resources to handle more business.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Means of Increasing and Allocating Rail System Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Railroads have several avenues for increasing capacity, including:", "Running more trains . However, operating more trains is not always an effective means of increasing capacity. If a system is already congested or on the edge, adding more trains can trigger or exacerbate slowdowns. Running trains faster . Greater velocity allows a railroad to move more traffic with the same amount of equipment. Railroads can increase velocity through capital improvements that de-bottleneck the system and by streamlining train handling procedures. Running trains closer together . A minimum headway between trains is required for safe operations. If the headway can be reduced the density of trains on the system increases. The freight railroads are testing advanced braking and train control systems that could reduce headway. Running bigger trains. By increasing the number of cars in a train and using more locomotives a railroad can deliver more coal with fewer trains, releasing capacity for new coal traffic or other business. The biggest coal trains in routine power plant service currently have 135 cars and tests are underway on 150 car trains. Installing and improving track . Examples include adding double-track and more sidings to heavily-used rail corridors, straightening curves that force trains to slow down, replacing light-duty rail with heavier track that permit faster and heavier trains, and expanding or building new rail yards and intermodal terminals. Technological improvements . New technology has historically been instrumental to increasing rail system capacity and productivity. Examples include more powerful and reliable locomotives, light-weight aluminum railcars that carry more coal than steel cars, and track-side sensors that can detect and automatically alert a train crew to incipient equipment failures before a railcar breaks down. Adding and managing staff. Personnel planning and management is essential to fluid rail operations. At the system level, railroads want to avoid overstaffing but must have enough crews to handle traffic. In 2004 the UP was caught short-staffed, causing delivery shortages and delays for power companies and other shippers. Because it takes months to train new crews, staff shortages cannot be quickly eliminated. At the individual train management level, railroads must precisely synchronize the positioning of coal and other long-haul trains with relief crews. A train must stop, wherever it is, when its crew reaches the end of its 12 hour shift. The train will sit idle until the railroad can transport a new crew to the train. Stalled trains can block tracks and delay other trains, causing more crews to reach the end of their shifts remote from crew change points. These delays can cascade through a rail system, causing widespread congestion.", "Railroads allocate capacity, current and planned, to balance customer demands, operational constraints, and the railroad's financial goals. As discussed above, capacity is routinely allocated by assigning priorities to different classes of rail traffic. The highest priority is given to passenger traffic and to time-sensitive, truck-competitive intermodal traffic. The lowest priority is given to bulk shipments, such as coal trains. Another means of allocation is through pricing. Under federal law railroads are \"common carriers\" that are required to provide service, when reasonably practicable and on reasonable terms, to any requesting shipper. In practice, the rail industry uses \"price rationing of available capacity\" (also known as \"congestion pricing\") as a means of managing traffic. According to AASHTO, in some cases railroad companies use high prices to \"de-market\" business in order to release capacity that can be used more profitably and to prevent overloading of their systems. As explained by the Union Pacific railroad:", "We ... need to maintain a balance between the traffic we accept and the capacity we own. We maintain this balance as any other business would in the marketplace: we adjust prices to reflect demand in the market, at least where contracts give us that freedom. If we fail to act in this responsible manner, we could again be overwhelmed by more traffic than we could handle and suffer severe congestion, a situation we encountered in the fall of 2003 when traffic surged unexpectedly.", "Requiring us to satisfy all demand and requiring us to provide reliable service on infrastructure that lacks capacity to meet every shipping demand would put us in an impossible position.", "Railroads, and other transportation modes, can also deal with capacity shortages by reducing the quality of service, generally or for some customers. As described by a former railroad executive, \"A railway may simply accept lower standards of service during peak times or lower service quality for some customers. A strategy of poorer service or higher rates during peak times is a de facto reality with all transportation modes today.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Railroad Capital Spending", "paragraphs": ["Most of the options for increasing railroad capacity involve capital investment in equipment or infrastructure. In addition, railroads must invest large sums annually to renew or replace their existing capital stock. Railroads are consequently much more capital intensive than most businesses and comparable to electric power companies. Over the period 1998-2005, the Class I railroads spent on average the equivalent of 17% of their annual revenues on capital investment, compared to 3% for all manufacturing industries and 5% for the truck transportation sector.", "As shown in Figure 11 , Class I railroad capital spending in real dollars has varied since 1983, in part tracking the overall economic performance of the rail industry:", "Investment grew strongly in the mid-1990s, peaking at $7.6 billion (constant 2000 dollars) in 1998. The railroads invested to meet expected demand growth and to integrate merged rail systems. Following the 1998 peak, capital expenditures dropped by over a third to a recent low of $5.0 billion (constant 2000 dollars) in 2001. Factors in the decline include the 2001 recession, efforts by the railroads to pay down debts and resolve operating problems associated with the mergers of the 1990s, less demand growth than anticipated, and generally mediocre financial performance in the latter part of the 1990s. Since 2001, railroad capital spending has increased continuously to an estimated $7.2 billion (constant 2000 dollars) in 2006, 43% higher than the 2001 trough and on-par with the peak years of the 1990s.", "The recent growth in capital expenditures has been almost directly proportional to the increase in operating revenues that has resulted from volume growth and higher rates. Railroad capital spending as a percentage of revenues has been relatively steady from 2000 through 2005 at 15% to 16%, compared to 22% in 1998. Railroad capital investment proportional to traffic has also been steady since 2000, varying, in constant 2000 dollars, from a low of 3.3 mills per revenue ton mile in 2001 (a mill is a tenth of a cent) to a high of 3.7 mills per revenue ton mile in 2005. This compares to 5.5 mills in 1998.", "This pattern, in which capital investment changes in-step with growth in revenue and traffic but not more rapidly or slowly, appears to be consistent with the industry's stated approach to capacity expansion. In order to improve their return on investment, the railroads tailor investments to the expected change in demand over the short term. They do not \"build ahead\" of short-term demand forecasts. As one former industry executive explains, \"[T]oo much capacity (again, track, terminals, cars, locomotives, and crews) means that financial returns decline and the availability of capital becomes more expensive. So management is in a constant struggle to create 'just in time' capacity; having the needed resources in place when needed and not six months too soon or six months too late.\" According to the President of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), a \"build ahead\" approach is financially unviable:", "... to contend that railroads can afford to have significant amounts of spare capacity on hand 'just in case'\u2014or that shippers would be willing to pay for it, or capital providers willing to finance it\u2014is completely unrealistic. Like other companies, railroads try to build and staff for the business at hand or expected soon to be at hand. \"Build it and they will come\" has rarely been a winning strategy for freight railroads.", "A related point is that when a railroad expands its asset base it also incurs on-going costs for operating and maintaining those assets. Because rail investment tends to be long-lived, railroads focus their investment dollars where they can either expect long-term traffic and revenues, or can recover investments quickly.", "In trying not to build capacity too far ahead of, or behind, demand, railroads are not unique; the same capital budgeting problem can face any firm. In respect to coal traffic, the railroad industry, and the coal production and power industries, must deal with long-term strategic questions in making investment decisions. Because of actual or prospective actions at the state and federal levels in such areas as carbon emission controls, enhanced controls on other air emissions, and encouragement of renewable energy sources, there is uncertainty concerning the volume and source of future coal flows. The degree of this uncertainty has not stopped coal-related investment, as evidenced by continuing railroad investment in coal traffic and power company construction of new coal plants. Nonetheless, these uncertainties and incomplete information complicate long-term investment planning for railroads. For example, according to a trade press report:", "Eastern U.S. coal producers and railroads are moving to better plan for coal-sourcing shifts in the East, calling on the STB for assistance, as one railroad [CSX] cites a lack of solid information on which to base capital expenditures.... [According to the railroad] CSX recognizes the coming shift, but the railroad has little solid information to go on.", "A conservative approach to capital investment has been encouraged at times by Wall Street; for example, an investment analyst testified to Congress in 2001 that \"investors, again becoming aggravated by poor returns, are now pressuring railroad management to cut back on capital expenditures.\" Tight rail system capacity has also helped the railroads increase rates and profits. The chief executive officer of the BNSF noted in a 2007 STB hearing that it has taken about 25 years for the rail market to find an \"equilibrium of demand and capacity,\" and in such a market rail rates will tend to rise. The GAO identified a \"capacity-constrained environment in which the demand for [rail industry] services exceeds its capacity in some areas\" as contributing to rate increases.", "There are no firm estimates of how railroad capital spending is divided between system maintenance and capacity expansion. A rough estimate is that the railroads dedicate about 15% to 20% of their annual capital spending to capacity expansion, or about $1 billion to $2 billion. Industry-wide data are unavailable on how much of the capacity-expansion investment made by the railroad industry is attributable to coal shipments, but data for the BNSF suggests that coal-specific spending can be highly variable. As shown in Figure 12 , BNSF's annual coal-related capacity-expansion capital spending varied from over $400 million (constant 2000 dollars) to zero during the period 1994 to 2005.", "In addition to investments by railroads, coal producers and power companies install coal train loading and unloading facilities. Modern facilities load and unload the largest trains in four hours or less, compared to older equipment which can take 24 hours to process a train. Large mines, as in the PRB, also build \"landing spots\"\u2014holding tracks which position trains off the main lines and close to the mine, ready for loading on short notice. These investments increase system capacity by improving train utilization. However, there appears to be no compiled historical data or tracking of these investments by the electric power industry or otherwise, so a clear picture of the past, current, or projected future spending by mining and power companies on rail-related infrastructure is unavailable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rail Capacity Metrics", "paragraphs": ["Policy development would probably benefit from quantitative measures of railroad capacity utilization and service quality. However, most of the public information on railroad capacity are anecdotal. This is in contrast, for example, to the industrial capacity utilization indices published by the Federal Reserve Board. The unavailability of public data on rail capacity is in part because rail system capacity is difficult to measure and define. Another consideration is that the rail network is privately owned, and capacity data may be considered proprietary by the railroads. However, as discussed below, these complications are not in themselves insuperable barriers to making more data on rail system capacity publicly available.", "One study broadly defines rail capacity \"as the greatest possible output while maintaining a specified minimum acceptable level of service (e.g., a minimum speed).\" However, this kind of formulation does not address a host of complications. There are in fact no standard definitions or measures of rail system capacity. As noted by the CBO, the concept of transportation network capacity is \"elusive.\"", "A measure of rail system capacity is ultimately a function of the assumptions made by the analyst. The U.S. rail network has 70,000 origin-destination pairs, many routing options, and carries a wide variety of products. The carrying capacity of a section of railroad depends on the quality of the track, whether the corridor is single-tracked or double-tracked, the number and length of sidings, and the type of signaling system installed. Railroads move trains over the network at varying speeds, depending on the quality of service needed to compete with trucks or barges, the weather, maintenance programs, and the condition of the track. Capacity is also a function of the cost of service the railroad is willing to incur and which shippers are willing to pay. Without a consideration of cost, \"the concept of capacity is meaningless.\"", "Railroad network capacity is consequently not a single metric, but is different for each type of traffic, and depends on the assumptions made for traffic mix, acceptable costs, and many other variables. Since the amount of capacity on a rail network is hard to pin down, the degree to which total capacity is being utilized is also \"elusive.\"", "In spite of these complications, estimates of rail system capacity and capacity utilization are developed and used by the rail industry itself. The drivers of rail system capacity have been defined by railroad executives and other analysts; for example, the BNSF lists volume, train density, physical plant elements, and productivity as determinants of system capacity. And while the practicality (and utility) of encapsulating the capacity utilization of an entire rail system in a single index number may be questionable, it is possible to define capacity for key corridors and categories of traffic for a given set of assumptions. For instance, in the past CSX has reported the degree of capacity utilization on its network for general merchandise traffic and for intermodal traffic. Union Pacific has described its capacity situation in terms of specific corridors:", "[Capacity] ... is by certain corridors. Like the Sunset Corridor [from Los Angeles to El Paso]. We're at capacity on the Sunset Corridor. We are pressing capacity on the South Central [corridor] between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. There's other areas we are not at capacity. So ... it's a little more complicated answer than probably you would like to hear but [in] some areas [with] the railroad we're bumping capacity [and in] other areas we are still in pretty good shape.", "Railroads estimate the current and projected capacity of parts of their systems in order to make investment decisions. An example is the critical Joint Line in the PRB, the nation's most important coal-carrying rail line. According to BNSF and UP:", "For many years, CANAC, a Montreal-based rail engineering firm, has been evaluating [for the railroads] PRB coal production forecasts and both railroad and mine infrastructure capacity needed to support forecasted production. Recommendations for railroad capacity proposed by CANAC in 1999 ... will be fully implemented by September 2006.... CANAC began a new study of the Joint Line in early Fall 2005.... In response, Union Pacific and BNSF have advanced construction plans to add the more than 40 miles of third and fourth main line capacity to meet the annual projected growth in demand for S[outhern]PRB coal in 2007 through 2009.", "In summary, while a system-wide capacity index may be difficult or impractical to develop, corridor-specific capacity measures appear to be meaningful and feasible. However, the federal government does not collect the data needed to estimate rail system capacity or require the railroad industry to provide estimates.", "The Association of American Railroads doubts the value and feasibility of publishing capacity estimates. In September 2006, the National Industrial Transportation League (NITL, an industrial shipper trade association which has at times raised concerns over rail industry service) suggested to the AAR a joint project to \"create an objective measure of capacity for the rail industry.\" NITL stated that even if not entirely precise, \"given the significant public dialogue about the need for increased rail capacity, such a metric would allow rail carriers, their customers and the public sector to gain a better view of the [capacity] problem.\" AAR's response was that creation of a capacity metric was probably impractical. Because the rail system is so complex, \"... it is difficult to believe that meaningful aggregations or comparisons across railroads can be obtained.\" The AAR was concerned that compared to the basic performance measures, such as train speed, already publicly available, a capacity index would be \"far more complicated, considerably less applicable to any particular circumstance, and potentially subject to greater misuse.\"", "Nonetheless, as noted above, capacity estimates are made and used by railroads. While the possibility of misuse or misinterpretation of capacity estimates exists, this same risk presumably can exist for any metric of economic activity. As discussed later in this report the absence of published railroad capacity estimates may impede informed analysis of rail and coal transportation policy. It also can impede efficient private-sector decision-making. In a 2007 STB hearing, the Canadian National Railway suggested that the STB \"consider organizing efforts by the railroads and shippers to project future traffic growth over capacity-constrained lanes. This could help lead to efforts to direct investment dollars more efficiently.\"", "Some or much of the relevant data may be considered confidential by the railroads, coal producers, and power companies. GAO found in 2006 and 2007 studies that the railroads considered information on capacity planning, and on the condition of railway tunnels and bridges (which has system capacity as well as safety implications), to be business-sensitive and proprietary.

Because \"what gets measured, gets managed\" there is no systematic national management of the nation's rail congestion needs. The individual railroads run their companies efficiently and make investments that meet the criteria of their business plans but, from the perspective of the performance of the national freight transportation system, there is no baseline for service, no standards for operations, no true measure of what type of system and service the country needs.", "A principal reason the national planning process, management, and data do not exist is that the rail network is privately owned and operated, unlike the publicly owned and operated highway system. As noted above, GAO reports indicate that much of the data AASHTO specifies would likely be considered business-sensitive and proprietary by the railroads.", "Trends in railroad capacity and system congestion are important to transportation policymakers because freight traffic is projected to grow enormously. DOT and AASHTO both estimate growth in the freight traffic carried by all modes of about 60% from the 2000-2002 time period to 2020. Because rail capacity can be less expensive to build, more cost-efficient to operate, and more friendly to the environment than truck transportation and road-building, some transportation planners are advocating a large increase in rail system capacity with the primary goal of displacing growth in truck traffic.", "For example, in a widely-cited 2003 study, Freight Rail Bottom Line Report , AASHTO estimates that \"there is an estimated unfunded annual need for $2.65 billion to $4.15 billion of additional freight-rail infrastructure improvements,\" or $53 billion to $83 billion over 20 years. However, this estimate is focused on the new capacity needed to put part of the growth in general merchandise traffic on rail instead of trucks, not on the capacity needed to reliably ship coal or other bulk commodities. Moreover, AASHTO cautions that its cost estimates are no more than \"'first approximations' for purposes of illustration and discussion\" based on extrapolation from other studies and professional judgment. It notes that \"long-term, system-wide cost estimates that are comparable to those developed for the highway and transit systems do not exist. The railroads and the states generate cost estimates for specific projects to calculate return on investment and estimate public benefits, but there is no program to systematically compile these costs estimates and forecast future investment levels.\" In summary, rigorous national-level assessments of rail system capacity needs and expansion costs do not appear to exist."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coal Stocks as a Complement to Rail Capacity Expansion", "paragraphs": ["Coal-fired power plants maintain coal stocks for two purposes: as a buffer against short term variability in coal deliveries and to provide an emergency supply in case deliveries are badly disrupted.

However, there is also a cost in tying up working capital in a large coal stockpile.", "There is a rough analogy between the excess capacity a railroad can build to handle peak demands and contingencies, and the coal stocks a power plant holds to provide a reserve of fuel. Railroads have suggested that it may be more economical for power companies to store more coal at their power plants than to pay the railroads to build enough surplus capacity to minimize the chance of a service problem. For example, at an April 2007 hearing before the STB on railroad capacity, CSX Chief Executive Officer Michael Ward said:", "... it would make \"better economic sense\" for utilities to keep higher inventory levels to give them \"flexibility\" to make up for some unreliability of the coal supply chain. \"When you think about the supply chain, my guess is that the better economic tradeoff [for utilities] is to have larger stockpiles,\" he said. If utilities want \"100% guaranteed delivery\" they would need to be willing to pay for necessary rail infrastructure, which would not be as good of an economic choice for them....", "This suggestion assumes that a plant has the room to keep a large coal stockpile, which is not always the case.", "Coal inventories are often measured as \"days of burn\"; that is, the number of days the coal stockpile can keep a plant running assuming no coal deliveries. As shown in Figure 13 , days of burn for the electric power sector have generally declined since the 1970s and early 1980s, from a range of about 80 to 100 days of burn to 40 to 50 days of burn by the turn of the century.", "The electric power industry cut its coal stocks for several reasons:", "To reduce inventory holding costs and coal handling expenses in order to improve financial results. The reduced threat of major coal miner strikes, as more coal production moved to non-union western mines. Opposition to larger stocks by staff or other parties at state public utility commission rate hearings. The change in coal inventory levels presumably reflected to some degree the performance guarantees included in rail transportation contracts.", "Another factor was the sale of coal-fired power plants to non-utility independent power producers (IPPs), following the advent of power market restructuring. IPPs began buying large coal plants from utilities in the latter half of the 1990s and by 2006 accounted for 24% of total electric power sector coal consumption. IPPs face more financial risk and potential rewards than utilities. Utilities often have monopoly service territories and regulated rates, and can earn a regulated return on the working capital tied up in coal inventories. IPPs have none of these regulatory benefits, but have more latitude to earn profits than utilities (whose rates are designed to earn a target rate of return). In this environment IPPs reduce costs by maintaining smaller stockpiles than utilities (see Figure 14 , below).", "The ability of power companies to build up stockpiles has been limited at times by coal transportation problems. Nonetheless, the long-term trend by the electric power industry to reduce its coal inventories is clear. By reducing inventories as more coal was shipped long distances from western coal mines, the power industry was cutting its \"shock absorber\" against coal supply interruptions at the same time the coal supply chain was getting longer and potentially more vulnerable to interruption. The reduction in coal stocks also occurred in the context of the history of coal transportation disruptions (see Appendix A ).", "By cutting its coal inventories the electric power industry incurred more coal supply risk. According to one 2005 analysis power company \"inventory optimization programs typically indicated that the holding costs of maintaining a large coal stockpile exceeded the expected [i.e., probability-weighted] cost of running out of coal.\" Utility inventory studies prior to 2005 may have excluded the possibility of extended, major delays in coal shipments, based on the assumption that past major disruptions were \"historical anomalies.\"", "Inventories declined sharply due to the 2005 coal transportation problems. Electric power sector coal stocks dipped to an average of 37 days in 2005 and hit bottom at 32 days in August 2005; these are the lowest levels on record going back to January 1973. Stocks actually began to decline in 2004, which is consistent with the drop in coal train speeds during this decade (discussed below) and claims by some power companies that the deterioration in western rail service pre-dated the May 2005 derailments in the PRB.", "Rail service has generally improved since 2005 and power companies have been rebuilding stockpiles. Electric power sector coal inventories averaged 51 days of burn in 2006, the highest level since 2002, and continued to increase into early 2007. The increase in stocks has been especially large for utility companies (see Figure 14 , above).", "In summary, in an effort to reduce costs, the rail industry and the power industry have both been pursuing types of \"just in time,\" cost-minimizing strategies. For the rail industry, this has meant not building capacity ahead of demand; for the power companies, it had meant reduced inventory policies. The simultaneous pursuit of these policies by the power and rail industries, and the development of a resilient coal supply chain, may be mutually exclusive. An issue between power companies and railroads is how should the cost of improving reliability be shared between paying for larger stocks at power plants and building more rail capacity.", "The trend toward increased stocks\u2014though still not to the levels of the 1973-1990 period\u2014suggests that power producers have decided to bear higher inventory costs to improve the reliability of their coal supplies. Given, as discussed below, the reported unwillingness of railroads to offer strong service guarantees, power companies may have had little choice except to increase coal stockpiles.

According to a electric utility trade group, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), even after the western railroads claimed in 2006 to have recovered from the severe coal service disruption of 2005 (discussed later in this report) some power plants were still not receiving their contracted coal tonnage. EEI noted that the increase in deliveries since 2005 to the Louisiana and Arkansas coal plants operated by Entergy (a large utility company), had been achieved by adding trains to the routes, not by restoring velocities to pre-2005 standards.

The UP and BNSF determined the derailments were due to a widespread track instability problem caused by the infiltration of coal dust into the railroad ballast (ballast is the material, usually crushed rock, on which track is laid). The railroads had to launch a months-long maintenance program to fix the problem, causing major delays, and a delivery shortfall in 2005, as estimated by a shipper trade association, of about 30 million tons. UP and BNSF both triggered the force majeure clauses in their coal transportation contracts to excuse non-performance. The UP recommended that power companies take steps to conserve coal. BNSF believed that enough coal would ship so \"that everybody is okay,\" but also stated that almost every BNSF-served plant using PRB coal was below target on inventory, customers would not be able to increase coal stockpiles until late 2005 or Spring of 2006, and that it would be prudent for customers to have contingency plans for alternate coal and transportation.

A power company can also keep large coal inventories on-site as a backup fuel source in the event of transportation or supply problems. These steps can keep a power plant from running out of coal, but the tradeoff is higher costs.

Transfer of some costs from railroads to shippers, as discussed above.", "The swing from declining or relatively stable rates to increasing rates happened abruptly, around 2004, due to the confluence of several factors. As noted above, rail capacity began to tighten in the mid-1990s. After peaking in 1998, railroad capital spending declined for several years and did not return to 1995 real dollar levels until 2005. Coincident with the slow recovery in capital spending, intermodal traffic, which is especially capacity-intensive, was rapidly increasing. Intermodal shipments grew by 27% between 2000 and 2005 (see Table 1 in the section of the report on \" Railroad Productivity and Efficiency Trends ,\" above).", "Intermodal traffic grew in part because trucking capacity was also limited. New hours-of-service rules effective in January 2004 cut the number of hours drivers could work between breaks, effectively reducing trucking capacity. Trucking companies also found it very difficult to recruit and retain drivers. Rising fuel costs have increased truck rates, and growing highway congestion has degraded service. These circumstances threw long-haul traffic from truck to intermodal rail and reduced the importance of the truck option as a check on rail rates. This shift may represent the leading edge of a long-term trend favorable to the rail industry. According to Standard & Poor's:", "Due to a combination of driver shortages, rising fuel prices, and cost differentials, the trucking industry appears to be gradually moving away from long-haul, cross-country routes, and towards shorter hauls.

Consequently, some carriers are increasing their purchases and ownership of rail intermodal containers, chassis, and trailers.", "Rates have also increased in response to higher fuel costs, an issue that has been contentious between railroads and shippers. A final consideration in rail rate increases is the consolidation of the rail industry into seven large carriers of which four are dominant.

According to the Electric Power Research Institute, comparing 1999 and 2005, rates for new coal transportation agreements increased by 20% to 40% for shippers with competitive alternatives and by 40% to 70% for captive shippers. Figure 19 shows an estimate of the long-term trend in rates for new PRB rail transportation agreements for service to customers with competitive rail access.

The underlying assumptions are that railroads are less costly to expand than highways, and that rail freight is more fuel efficient and less polluting than truck transportation. However, according to the AAR, \"funding constraints will prevent railroads from meeting socially-optimal future infrastructure investment needs entirely on their own.\"", "FRICEA includes two distinct but related inducements for capital spending. The first is a 25% tax credit for capacity-expanding rail investments. The tax credit would be available to any taxpayer making qualified investments, not only railroads.", "The second incentive would increase rail investment generally, not just for capacity expansion, by enhancing \"modal tax equity.\" This would be accomplished by allowing railroads and other tax payers to immediately deduct (\"expense\") qualifying rail capital investments from gross income. The immediate deduction of capital costs is in contrast to the normal practice of depreciating the value of capital investments over several years.", "The option to expense investments is intended to end a discrepancy in the tax treatment of the capital investment costs borne by railroads and other freight modes, particularly trucks and barges. Railroads own and pay for their own rights of way and structures. Tax recovery of these investments is made over time through tax depreciation. In contrast, waterways and highways are usually publicly funded and owned. Truck and barge operators pay for these facilities through taxes and user fees that can be immediately taken as an income tax deduction. The notion is that allowing the railroads to expense infrastructure investment will level the financial playing field between freight transportation modes.", "Advocates of modal equity in the tax treatment of freight investment costs argue it will lead to a more optimal allocation of society's resources, likely including greater investment in rail capacity. A closely related issue is whether trucks and barges pay the full cost of the infrastructure provided by the public. According to the CBO:", "The Federal Highway Administration estimates that large trucks pay in taxes only about 50 percent to 80 percent of the [federal] costs attributed to them. Barge operators on the inland waterways pay taxes that cover only about 20 percent of the amount the Corps of Engineers spends on navigation projects. In contrast, the railroads pay for their rights-of-way and infrastructure and often must pay local taxes on those investments as well. Those factors translate into lower private costs for truckers and water carriers and enable them to attract some freight shipments that could be carried at a lower total cost by the railroads. That encourages greater spending on highway and waterway construction than would be justified on economic grounds and leads to an inefficient use of the economy's resources.", "As proposed, FRICEA defines two main categories of railroad property. Qualified Freight Rail Infrastructure Property includes investments in hardware (such as track, rail yards, and freight loading and unloading terminals, and communication and control equipment) and related software. Investments in land and rail cars are specifically excluded. Qualified Locomotive Property includes purchases of locomotives that meet the following criteria: 1) the taxpayer's total locomotive capacity, measured in horsepower, is greater at the end of the tax year than at the end of the preceding tax year, and 2) the new locomotives meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission standards for locomotives in effect on December 31, 2006.", "The 25% tax credit would be available for New Qualified Freight Rail Infrastructure Property and New Qualified Locomotive Property.

However, our work has shown that it is difficult to target tax credits to the desired activities and outcomes and ensure that tax credits generate the desired new investments, as opposed to substituting for investment that would have occurred anyway.", "The impact of FRICEA investments on coal or other shippers is unpredictable. However, the railroads could choose to focus the incremental investments triggered by FRICEA toward specific geographic areas or categories of traffic, such as intermodal traffic. Intermodal investments have reportedly far out-stripped coal-related spending since the middle of this decade. If FRICEA puts more intermodal traffic on the rails, it would achieve the aims of public officials concerned with highway congestion, but could put at risk or even degrade the reliability of coal shipments. As one analyst notes, this is because \"mixing the much faster intermodal trains with the slower bulk freight train movements tends to devour network capacity at an alarming rate.\" There have been instances in which railroad efforts to increase intermodal service have caused major delays for other traffic.", "Specific qualifications shippers have recommended that Congress impose on FRICEA include:", "The credit should be tied to the imposition of mandatory railroad reliability standards and a firm obligation to serve. Capacity expansion should focus on assistance to domestic coal and other domestic shipments, including domestic shipments moving to export ports, in contrast to import traffic. First priority for investment should be captive coal shippers and other shippers captive to a single railroad, and there should be a ban on applying the tax credit to help fund investments that would enhance railroad monopoly power. A general recommendation for regulatory oversight to ensure that the tax credit is used in the public interest and not simply to increase capacity in the most profitable rail markets.", "All of these proposed qualifications lack specificity and perhaps, in some cases, would be difficult to implement. Railroads are networks, so an investment in one location can have wide effects. It can be very difficult to determine if a specific investment will primarily benefit specific domestic shippers or groups of shippers. The implication of the proposed qualifications is that each FRICEA investment would have to be individually reviewed by the government before it could qualify for the tax credit. This degree of review (and likely associated delay) might choke off the additional investment FRICEA is intended to encourage.", "It is also important to consider that the community of railroad shippers is not homogenous. For example, intermodal shippers are unlikely to support restrictions designed to funnel investment toward captive coal traffic. Other shippers support FRICEA as it stands, including the National Mining Association (which represents coal and other mining industries) and TXU, a large Texas-based electric power company.", "If Congress does want to consider the possible restrictions on FRICEA investments mentioned above, other formulations might require less intrusive federal oversight. An example is limiting the FRICEA incentives to specific types of investments with system-wide effects on capacity and quality of service. Examples of these \"freight-neutral\" investments include advanced electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes and positive train control (PTC) systems, and de-bottlenecking specified major choke points. This targeted-investment approach could supplement current \"public-private partnerships\" which jointly fund specific freight rail projects.", "This alternative approach to directing FRICEA investments may require less detailed federal supervision than some other approaches, but still has potential disadvantages, including the following: it pre-judges today which investments would best enhance system capacity, something which could change with market and technical developments; tax incentives would not flow to worthwhile investments outside of the specified categories; and this approach, like other proposed limitations on FRICEA investments, could constrain the ability of the private sector managers responsible for the coal supply chain (and other traffic) from directing the incentives to what in their judgment would be the most productive uses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expected Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier, information on rail capacity and service quality is limited.

Power companies want fast, reliable service over a rail network with sufficient capacity to smoothly absorb traffic growth at what they view as economical rates. They also want the system to have enough redundancy to be able to quickly bounce back from disruptions, such as bad weather or unexpected surges in demand. However, from the railroad perspective this scenario may imply ill-considered investment in excess rail capacity in lieu of the power industry purchasing larger coal stocks for power plants.", "The railroad industry entered the post-Staggers era with financially burdensome excess capacity. As noted above, it has eliminated this surplus by, for example, increasing traffic, shedding assets and labor, increasing efficiency, and not building too far ahead of excess demand. The resulting tight capacity had directly contributed to the ability of the rail industry to raise rates and revenues. According to JP Morgan Securities, \"it appears that the long term trend of growth in demand for rail transportation finally caught up with available capacity, and the past two years have been a period of much tighter rail capacity compared to the historical norm. As a result rail transportation rates have risen significantly in 2004 and 2005.... While the situation of tight capacity has had a negative impact on rail service for several railroads and many shippers have received less reliable rail transport service, it has also been a significant positive from a investor perspective.\" In early 2007 the railroads were reported to be \"buoyed by new financial reports that validate their strategy of keeping capacity snug and pricing firm.\"", "The rail industry has expressly noted the pricing advantages of running railroad systems with limited surplus capacity. According to the BNSF, \"We don't bring capacity on sooner than we need it, so we always have a natural tightness.... Supply chains from all industries are feeling a 'tightness' in their ability to immediately leverage up for additional volume. This will result in increasing the value for our service, improving our returns.\" CSX's strategy for increasing the profitability of its intermodal business included reducing excess capacity. UP told Wall Street analysts in 2005 that \"in some ways we are where we always wanted to be with the demand for our service outstripping the supply.\" Part of the business strategy outlined by UP was to \"leverage strong demand to drive [revenue] yield improvement by swapping out less profitable business for higher yielding moves ... our price plan is actually designed to meter the flow of business onto the railroad and to drive up the profitability of the business that we do handle.\"", "The strategy of minimizing excess capacity to support prices is not unique to the railroad industry.

It's crazy to operate without a margin of safety,\" he said. Wise utility regulation allows for extra capacity and an adequate return on investment.... \"The last thing in the world an unregulated operator wants is excess capacity around....\"", "However, it may be possible for industry actors to deliberately maintain a tight capacity environment, conducive to pricing power, only if the industry is highly concentrated or if competition is otherwise muted.", "To the degree that tight capacity has contributed to the recent ability of the railroads to raise rates, it is not clear why the railroads would build significant surplus capacity with or without FRICEA incentives.

The process is to take no longer than nine months, \"shall not require excessive litigation costs,\" and puts the burden of proof on the railroad to demonstrate that the rate is reasonable (currently the burden of proof is on the complainant to show that a rate is unreasonable). It also explicitly bans any rate appeal process that relies, like the current procedure, on the cost of a hypothetical competitor.

The existing process is deliberately designed to allow railroads to charge rates to captive customers that will include a large share of the system-wide \"non-attributable\" costs that cannot be specifically tied to any individual rail movement. This allows the railroads to charge lower rates (but never lower than direct cost) to customers who have competitive alternatives and are price sensitive.

The exemptions were predicated on the assumption that normal market forces could not operate in the rail industry, and accordingly allowed the rail industry to operate in ways, such as the coordination of rates, that would have been unacceptable in a free market. The exemptions also reflected the notion that the comprehensive regulation of rates, service, market entry and exit, and mergers by the ICC effectively replaced the usual antitrust oversight of the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission.", "In its most recent revision to rail regulation, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the Congress chose to continue these exemptions. The key exemptions include:", "The STB has sole jurisdiction over railroad mergers. Railroads are the only regulated industry whose mergers cannot be challenged by Department of Justice (DOJ). Railroads generally cannot be sued for injunctive relief for antitrust violations by private parties. \"Railroads are generally exempt from Sherman Act antitrust actions for treble damages if common carrier rates 'approved by the [government]' are involved.\" Joint rates established by two or more railroads which have been approved by the STB are exempt from antitrust review.", "While these exemptions do not block all possible avenues for antitrust inquiry, they are significant. In 2004, DOJ noted that bottleneck rates and interchange commitments might be areas of interest for antitrust review, but because these transactions were approved by the STB they may not be subject to the antitrust laws. On the other hand, DOJ at the same time expressed interest in reviewing for possible antitrust violations the practice of the western rail carriers of publicly disclosing certain rates. The status of this review, if underway, is not known.", "The proposed legislation would eliminate these exemptions. Advocates apparently anticipate that shippers will use these new openings to attack bottleneck rates and paper barriers, and perhaps seek to add what they view as pro-competitive conditions to existing rail merger terms.

The limited exemptions that apply to the railroads are \"narrowly applied,\" are intended to avoid dual jurisdiction between the STB and other parts of the government, and in some cases reflect special circumstances. For example, according to the AAR the exemption from private demands for injunctive relief is intended to prevent interruptions in rail system operations. The proposed changes to the law are unnecessary. For example, \"the STB has the authority to enforce certain provisions of the antitrust laws in lieu of the Federal Trade Commission. Moreover, the federal government is not precluded from seeking injunctive relief, and the federal antitrust provisions permitting private parties to sue for damages contains no exclusion for railroads.\" In the view of the AAR, proponents of this legislation basically do not like certain decisions made by the STB and are seeking to move decisions to a different forum.

It leads to a fundamental shift in thinking, away from a static and ultimately counterproductive effort to protect a \"franchise,\" toward a positive effort to grow business opportunities and eliminate costs.

The bills also do not directly address the limited information on rail service and capacity discussed earlier in this report. Without more information, aspects of the proposed legislation are difficult to evaluate. For example, the emphasis on rate relief and greater competition in the bills presumes that high rail rates, especially for captive shippers, is a significant national issue. This may or may not be the case. No thorough analysis exists on the degree to which rail traffic is captive or of the rates paid by these shippers. According to a 2006 study by GAO, there is:", "... a reasonable possibility that shippers in selected markets may be paying excessive rates related to a lack of competition in these markets. While our analysis of available measures shows that the extent of captivity appears to be dropping in the freight railroad industry, shippers that may be captive are paying substantially over the statutory threshold for initiating a rate relief case. This situation may simply reflect reasonable economic practices ... or it may represent an abuse of market power. Our analysis provides an important first step in assessing competitive markets nationally, but it is imperfect given the inherent limitations of the Carload Waybill Sample [an STB data set] and the proxy measures available for weighing captivity. A more rigorous analysis of competitive markets nationally is needed\u2014one that identifies the state of competition nationwide and inquires into pricing practices in specific markets.", "The GAO recommended that the STB conduct a comprehensive study of rail competition and rates, a suggestion the STB initially rejected based on GAO's inconclusive findings and its own lack of resources. In June 2007 the STB reversed itself and said it would hire a contractor to conduct such a study to be completed by late 2008. GAO commended the STB \"for taking this action, [but] it remains to be seen whether these analysts would have STB's statutory authority and sufficient access to information to determine whether rail rates in selected markets reflect justified and reasonable pricing practices or an abuse of market power by the railroads.\"", "The effect of the bills, particularly RCSIA, is also difficult to evaluate because the outcomes will largely depend on how the legislation is implemented. Implementation may produce results that differ from the apparent objectives of its supporters. For example:", "Under reciprocal switching or other avenues for opening rail bottlenecks, the new competing railroad would be required to pay the incumbent railroad a fee for the use of the incumbent's tracks. For example, a new competing railroad delivering coal to a previously captive power plant might pay a trackage rights fee to the incumbent for each ton of coal it delivers. A study performed for the FRA suggests that the fee should be designed to, in effect, include all of the profit the incumbent carrier had earned before the bottleneck was opened. The report suggests that this and other aspects of its recommended approach would yield the most efficient outcome and keep incumbent railroad financially whole, but such a large fee could, in many cases, eviscerate the competitive value of reciprocal switching. RCSIA requires the STB to replace its current rate appeal process with a cost of service approach \"similar to the rate regulatory systems of [state] public service commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\" However, traditional utility rate cases can be complex, time consuming to prepare and litigate, and very expensive. While RCSIA puts a nine month time limit on rate cases, it may nonetheless have less impact on the accessibility and affordability of the process than its proponents intend. As noted above, Section 105 of RCSIA authorizes the STB to designate areas of inadequate rail competition and implement within those zones numerous remedies, not all of which are specified in the legislation (\"other remedies authorized by law\"). This provision is so broad that its potential geographic and regulatory scope, and its impact on rail rates, revenues, service, and profits, are very difficult to judge. Section 105 is probably the part of RCSIA with the greatest potential for reintroducing pervasive regulation into the rail industry.", "In general it is unclear how complex and intrusive a regulatory framework the STB would have to create to implement RCSIA. A related issue is the practical ability of the STB to timely handle the additional workload RCSIA would assign to the agency.

It may be difficult for the Board to effectively execute the proposed additional duties without more resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revenue Adequacy", "paragraphs": ["An important question concerning the rail restructuring proposals is the impact they would have on a central goal of the Staggers Act, returning the rail industry to financial health. By reducing the number of captive shippers and otherwise driving down rail rates, the restructuring proposals would likely cut railroad revenues and profits for some period of time. The railroad industry's position is that the financial impact would be crippling, particularly since the railroads have still not achieved the objective of revenue adequacy established by Staggers. If this is the case service would likely deteriorate for coal and other shippers.", "The issue of the financial impact of the restructuring proposals is particularly apt because the proposals could have the effect of changing the existing approach to railroad rate setting. This approach, called \"constrained market pricing,\" was developed by the ICC in 1985 with coal traffic at the forefront. Constrained market pricing is predicated on two principles: The railroad industry is not revenue adequate, and to achieve revenue adequacy the railroad industry must be able to differentially price its services based on the price sensitivity of various groups of customers. For instance, when trying to win business that has a truck alternative, the railroad might price the movement to recover little more than the costs directly attributable to that movement, and few or none of the system-wide \"non-attributable\" costs (such as yard expenses) incurred by the railroad. On the other hand, it may set rates to move coal to a captive power plant at a price that recovers all the attributable costs of the movement plus a substantial share of the non-attributable system-wide expenses.", "Demand-sensitive differential or \"strategic\" pricing is widely used in American industry. In the case of the rail industry, where potential competition is limited by high barriers to entry, rates to the captive customers are, in principle, ultimately \"constrained\" by the shippers' option to appeal to the STB. Rates can be appealed if the shipper can demonstrate that it is captive and that rates exceed 180% of the direct costs of the movement. If a protested rate meets these initial criteria, the STB then determines whether the rate exceeds the costs of a hypothetical most-efficient competitor (a \"stand-alone\" railroad). The costs of the stand-alone railroad represent, according to the underlying theory, the highest reasonable rate ceiling; if the rate is ultimately determined by the STB to exceed stand-alone costs, a new rate is prescribed based on this ceiling.", "In short, constrained market pricing is designed to help the rail industry achieve financial recovery by allowing it to charge relatively high rates to captive customers and relatively low rates to customers who have competitive options. The rail restructuring proposals, by providing avenues for reducing the number of captive shippers and the rates they pay, would chip away at a pillar of the constrained market pricing system. However, this may be more or less of a concern depending on whether or not the rail industry has reached the Staggers goal of revenue adequacy.", "In summary, it can be hypothesized that if the railroad industry is revenue adequate, it may be better able to withstand the stronger dose of competition and regulation the proponents of regulatory restructuring propose, and may be better positioned to respond to more intense competition with lower costs, greater efficiency, and better service. If the industry is not revenue adequate, then the regulatory status quo may be the better course of action. In particular, should the regulatory restructuring proposals, if implemented, undermine the industry's finances, then the results of regulatory change could be deterioration in rail service for coal and other traffic. There is arguably a contradiction between demands for both lower rates and better service. This point is made by Norfolk Southern:", "[The Norfolk Southern CEO testified at an STB hearing] that he hears three things from rail customers. \"They want more capacity; they want better service; and they want lower rates. And I don't know how you do all three\".... [H]is summary of the three themes he hears from rail customers was reinforced by subsequent witnesses with no one even trying to reconcile the irreconcilable.... Unfortunately, many parties fail to see that infrastructure investment, better service, and rates are three legs to one stool. No one wants to pay; everyone wants someone else to pay.", "The counter-argument, noted above, is that more competition will force innovation, efficiency gains, and traffic growth that will leave the railroads whole or better off.", "Because of these considerations it would be useful to know if the rail industry is achieving the Staggers Act objective of revenue adequacy. As required by statute, the STB makes an annual determination of revenue adequacy for each Class I railroad. However, for the reasons discussed below, the reliability of these determinations is problematic.", "The ICC's methodology for determining revenue adequacy was defined in a 1981 decision. The test selected by the ICC is whether a railroad's return on investment was at least equal to its cost of investment capital. As explained by the ICC:", "... \"adequate\" revenues are those which provide a rate of return on net investment equal to the current cost of capital (i.e., the level of return available on alternative investments). This is the revenue level necessary for a railroad to compete equally with other firms for available financing in order to maintain, replace, modernize, and, where appropriate, expand its facilities and services. If railroads cannot earn the fair market rate of return, their ability both to retain existing investments and obtain new capital will be impaired, because both the existing and prospective funds could be invested elsewhere at a more attractive rate of return.", "The ICC \"emphasize[d] that revenue adequacy is a long-term concept that calls for a company, over time , to average a return on investment equal to its cost of capital.\" Therefore, while a railroad might be revenue adequate in one year, it would not be deemed to have met the Staggers Act objectives for financial performance until it had achieved this threshold for a period of time. However, the ICC declined to specify \"what period of time may be sufficiently representative in every case. This will vary depending upon the carrier's traffic base and the relative stability of the economy at the time.\"", "The ICC also noted that \"we want to make clear that we will not and cannot guarantee any railroad a return equal to the cost of capital. A railroad, like any other firm, should earn such a return only if it provides a desired service in an efficient manner. We want to take great care, however, not to deny railroads the opportunity to earn the cost of capital.\"", "The ICC applied this approach retroactively to 1979 and subsequently. Using this standard, the financial performance of the railroad industry has been poor. As shown in Figure 20 , over 27 years the Class I railroad industry as a whole has never once been revenue adequate. The difference between the industry's return on investment and cost of capital narrowed from 1979 to 1990, but the gap has not subsequently been closed or consistently narrowed ( Figure 20 ). During this period the ICC and STB made 445 individual determinations of revenue adequacy for railroad companies. It found railroads to be revenue adequate in just 32 instances, of which just over half were for two companies, the Illinois Central (now part of Canadian National) and Norfolk Southern. Including subsidiaries and merger partners, the Union Pacific had one finding of revenue adequacy in 27 years by the STB's reckoning, CSX three findings, and BNSF four findings.", "Under the economic theory underpinning the Board's revenue adequacy test, the consistent inability of the railroad industry as whole, or even individual carriers, to achieve revenue adequacy for over a quarter century should result in significant capital shortages and even disinvestment in the rail industry. According to testimony relied upon by the ICC in developing its revenue adequacy test:", "In the final analysis, the only valid test of adequacy of a railroad's revenues is that they yield a rate of return equal to the opportunity cost of capital. Failing that, regulation will result in service deterioration as a result of disinvestment.", "... any firm that earns less than this amount [its cost of capital] will be unable to compete in the market for funds. Its owners will neither wish nor be able to keep the enterprise's capital intact. They will withdraw their capital as quickly and as expeditiously as they can.", "The ICC concluded that \"railroad management has little incentive to reinvest funds generated by ratepayers in continued rail uses if greater returns are available elsewhere. Railroads are private companies whose stockholders would not permit such reinvestment. Thus, even retained earnings will not be invested in the company if they cannot earn a rate of return equal to the cost of capital.\"", "Nonetheless, the railroads continued to invest billions of dollars in their systems over the years, even as they consistently fell short of the regulatory standard for revenue adequacy. This discrepancy between the failure to achieve revenue adequacy and the continued availability of investment capital has been explained as a consequence of optimistic investors putting money into the rail industry in anticipation of financial results that were not realized. Other observers have suggested that the ICC's methodology for measuring railroad revenue adequacy does not comport with the true state of the industry. The ICC itself made adjustments to the details of its methodology in 1986 after observing that its approach \"does not appear to produce a realistic picture of the state of the rail industry.\" According to Standard and Poor's, writing, respectively, in 1995 and 1999:", "... until it earns at least its cost of capital, the rail industry is considered unhealthy\u2014at least in the technical sense. We think the industry is actually fit as a fiddle, so how can this be? We believe that the [ICC's] definition of cost of capital is at fault.", "... the industry technically remains \"revenue inadequate\".... The fact that the industry may not achieve revenue adequacy is not particularly meaningful, however, given the many flaws in the design of this financial test.", "The revenue adequacy conclusions drawn by the STB are contradicted at times by statements made by railroads to financial analysts. The STB determined that NS was revenue adequate in 2004, but the railroad told investment analysts that it had not achieved its cost of capital. UP, which according to the STB analysis has been revenue adequate only once since 1979, told Wall Street that it \"did achieve our cost of capital in many years and even exceeded.\" These contradictions can perhaps be explained by differences which may exist between the financial measurement methods specified by the STB for regulatory filings versus those used by individual companies for their own purposes. Nonetheless, a situation in which the Board's metric of revenue adequacy\u2014which in essence is a measure of how willing investors should be to put money into the railroad industry\u2014differs from the rail industry's own reports to the investment analysts who advise those same investors, creates some uncertainty about the utility of the STB determinations.", "Critics who claim that the STB's methodology understates the rail industry's actual financial performance have raised numerous technical objections to the Board's approach. One criticism that appears to have particular significance relates to the methodology used by the Board to determine the rail industry's cost of equity capital, a component of the overall cost of capital.", "The STB uses a \"single-stage discounted cash flow\" (DCF) model to estimate the cost of equity. A key input into this method is an earnings growth rate that is assumed to continue, unchanged, indefinitely. The assumption of an unchanging growth rate is workable for steady-state industries with growth rates that roughly mirror the growth of the overall economy. However, if an industry has been growing rapidly\u2014as has recently been the case for the railroads\u2014and this current high growth rate is used in the DCF formula\u2014as the STB has done\u2014the DCF model will produce an overstated cost of equity. This methodological pitfall is documented in the financial literature; for example, one standard text notes that \"The simple constant-growth DCF formula is an extremely useful rule of thumb, but no more than that. Naive trust in the formula has led many financial analysts to silly conclusions ... resist the temptation to apply the formula to firms having high current rates of growth. Such growth can rarely be sustained indefinitely, but the constant-growth DCF formula assumes it can.\"", "This problem was pointed out to the STB at least as early as 1997. In August 2007 the STB proposed changing the approach used to estimate the cost of equity from the DCF model to an alternative \"capital asset pricing model\" (CAPM) methodology. The Board's sample CAPM calculations show that application of the new method could cut its estimate of the railroad industry's overall cost of capital in 2005 by more than a third, from 12.2% to 7.5%. Using these new estimates, the railroad industry as a whole was revenue adequate in 2005.", "The significant change in revenue adequacy that results from what is, in essence, a technical adjustment, points at a broader possible problem with the STB's revenue adequacy methodology. This is the STB's effort to peg the financial state of the railroad industry to a single, relatively simple to calculate measure that can be determined with a minimum of judgment. This objective may be difficult to achieve.", "Financial analysis is often not as cut-and-dried as running numbers through a model and receiving clear results. For example, the Board noted that the literature on estimating just the equity component of the cost of capital is \"vast ... covering the fields of finance, economics, and regulation.\" Another source notes that \"there is no generally accepted definition of the cost of equity capital, but only a number of competing theories that are more or less capable of being applied numerically.\"", "In a situation with this degree of methodological uncertainty, it is not clear that an essentially mechanical determination of revenue adequacy based on one financial ratio will necessarily yield reliable results. Note that in traditional utility rate hearings the appropriate rate of return is typically set through a contested hearing process, not through the mechanical application of a formula and procedure. According to one source, for a public utility commission:", "It is appropriate to use the results of mathematical financial models to provide a 'zone of reasonableness' for the [return on equity or ROE].... However, the determination of the ROE is not an exact science. Judgment is inherent and certainly used by financial analysts when applying financial models. Certainly, a commission needs to exercise similar judgment to evaluate the overall results of those models and select an appropriate ROE....", "In contrast to the current use of a single financial ratio to determine revenue adequacy, prior to passage of the Staggers Act the ICC relied on a qualitative evaluation of multiple financial indicators. When it adopted its current methodology in 1981, the Commission rejected a \"multi-faceted standard\" because it would require \"a considerable amount of subjectivity in terms of selecting the mix of indicators to use and the performance standards applicable to each indicator.... Based on the record, we must reject a multi-indicator standard ... because no practical way has been shown to implement it objectively.\" The STB later noted that an advantage of the ICC's method for computing the key cost of equity component is that \"the simple DCF method required few inputs and few judgment calls....\" However, it may be difficult to avoid introducing considerable judgment into the revenue adequacy determination. For example, the CAPM approach the STB has proposed using in its future revenue adequacy determinations requires its own set of assumptions; the STB notes that \"there are disputes over how to apply the model and whether newer methods are superior.\" According to a survey of finance practitioners, there are \"substantial disagreements\" on how to estimate all three of the key inputs to the CAPM model.", "As one text observes, \"finance is in large part a matter of judgment, and we simply must face this fact.\" Financial analysis of a firm or industry for revenue adequacy purposes may require the use of multiple measures, and the application of judgment in weighing the indicators and arriving at a final assessment.", "There is no consensus on whether or not the railroad industry has achieved revenue adequacy. There is a large body of opinion that the railroad industry has not achieved returns equal to its cost of capital or perhaps has done so only recently, or question how long current favorable financial trends will continue. For example, the Financial Times reported in 2007 that industry consolidation \"along with solid demand ... has done wonders for pricing, allowing the sector to earn its cost of capital and more for a change. It is far from clear, however, how long that trend can continue.\" A study for the Electric Power Research Institute concluded in 2005 that the rail industry returns were approaching but had not yet reached the industry cost of capital. A transportation investment analyst testified to Congress in 2001 that \"the bottom line is the railroads don't earn their cost of capital ... they destroy capital every year.\"", "In summary, opinion on the regulatory restructuring proposals may hinge in part on views of the railroad industry's financial condition. For the reasons discussed above, the STB's revenue adequacy determinations may be of uncertain value in developing such a view."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Restructuring: Considerations and Options", "paragraphs": ["The following issues may be of interest in evaluating the regulatory restructuring proposals:", "Are the coal and other rail service (and related rate and competitive access) issues the restructuring bills address of sufficient import to justify extensively revising the current regulatory framework? Existing data on service, capacity, rates, and the degree to which captive coal and other shippers are subject to market power are incomplete at best. Should the executive agencies be directed to gather and analyze additional data in these areas on an ongoing basis? As of mid-2007 the STB plans to conduct a study of rail competition and rates, but this will apparently be a one-time analysis. What is the actual financial state of the railroad industry? Congress's view of the restructuring proposals may depend in part on an evaluation of the financial condition of the railroads; in particular, whether they have achieved the regulatory goal of revenue adequacy. A financially robust industry may be able to respond to enhanced competition with the innovation and service improvements suggested by proponents. A weaker industry may contract in response to more intense competition, and service could deteriorate. There are other perspectives: if the railroads have achieved revenue adequacy then it might be unwise to make major changes; if it has not, then more competition may be needed to jump-start the industry. A predicate for reaching any of these conclusions is a rigorous analysis of the financial state of the railroads, and this does not currently appear to be available. Would the restructuring proposals actually achieve substantial service improvements? RCSIA leaves implementation details undefined, making the outcomes from the law uncertain. These implementation issues include, for example, the fees for bottleneck service, how a cost of service rate appeal process could be economically managed, and operation of the remedies proposed for areas of inadequate competition. Service Focus : as an alternative to extensive revision of the current regulatory regime, could more limited changes result in material improvements in coal rail service? If otherwise desirable, a more limited agenda might include elements of current proposals, including giving rail service problems and their resolution greater public visibility; creation of a rail public advocate; and new requirements in the law for reliable rail service.", "Appendix A.
