To address concerns about the quality of programs that prepare students for gainful employment and concerns about the level of student loan debt assumed by students who attend these programs, ED issued new rules on gainful employment in late 2010 and early 2011.", "The final rules established a series of reporting and disclosure requirements for institutions of higher education that offer gainful employment programs and additional requirements for institutions that add new gainful employment programs. The rules also established a series of three performance metrics designed to measure how effectively completers of gainful employment programs repay the student loans they borrow to attend these programs, and the relationship between their student loan debt and their earnings. One metric, a loan repayment rate, was designed to measure how effectively students who are borrowers of federal student loans and who attended a gainful employment program repay the loans they borrowed to attend the program. Two additional metrics\u2014an earnings rate and a discretionary income rate\u2014are debt-to-earnings measures and were designed to measure the proportion of students who complete a gainful employment program whose combined federal and non-federal student loan debt exceeds certain percentage thresholds of their earnings. A program failing to pass at least one of the three performance metrics for any three out of the most recently completed four fiscal years would lose eligibility to participate in HEA, Title IV programs.", "The Department of Education's efforts to establish new rules on gainful employment were very contentious. When ED published proposed rules in the summer of 2010, it received an unprecedented volume of comments. Overall, ED received more than 90,000 comments, with approximately three-quarters opposed to the rules and one-quarter in support. Many were concerned that the new rules would increase regulatory burden and potential adverse effects from programs losing eligibility to participate in HEA, Title IV federal student aid programs. Others supported the regulation of gainful employment programs, particularly with regard to the student loan debt of students who attend them.", "Prior to the effective date of the gainful employment regulations, they were challenged in court by the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities.

Also, according to ED many proprietary institutions receive most of their income from funds made available to students through the Title IV aid programs. Importantly, many students who receive Title IV aid to enroll in programs at proprietary institutions receive at least some of their aid in the form of loans that they are required to repay. Students enrolled at proprietary institutions have often also borrowed non-Title IV loans to help finance their educations. Over the years, concerns have been raised about the quality of programs offered by proprietary institutions and whether individuals who have attended these programs are adequately prepared for employment. For example, in the 1990s the Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified lower student completion rates and placement rates, and higher default rates, at proprietary institutions that relied most heavily on Title IV aid.

The performance measures were proposed to be used to assess the repayment of loans borrowed by students who attended applicable programs and the relationship between the student loan debt payments of borrowers who completed these programs and their earnings from employment. Programs were to be deemed successful at preparing students for gainful employment if sufficient percentages of individuals who borrowed student loans were reducing the balance owed on their loans, or the student loan payments of students who successfully completed the programs were low relative to their earnings from employment. By focusing on the repayment of student loans and student loan debt, the measures were designed to shine a spotlight on institutions that have a high percentage of students who borrow to finance their postsecondary expenses\u2014particularly proprietary institutions.

A 10-year repayment schedule would have been used for certificate and associate's degree programs, a 15-year repayment schedule for bachelor's and master's degree programs, and a 20-year repayment schedule for doctoral and first-professional degree programs.

Thus, a gainful employment program would have passed the ER measure if the intersection between the greater of mean or median annual earnings and median student loan debt fell on or below the solid line for the applicable program level. It would have failed the measure if the intersection occurred above the solid line. For example, for a bachelor's degree programs, the 12% threshold is shown by the solid green line. If the mean (or median) annual earnings of program completers of a bachelor's degree program was $40,000, and the median student loan debt was $60,000, the program would have failed to pass the measure, as the ER would have been greater than the 12% threshold.", "For the DIR measure, a gainful employment program would have passed if the annual loan payment on median student loan debt was less than or equal to 30% of the discretionary income of program completers.

A gainful employment program would have passed the DIR measure if the intersection between the greater of mean and median student loan debt fell on or below the dashed line for the applicable program level; and it would have failed the measure if the intersection occurred above that line. To continue the example from above, for bachelor degree programs, the 30% threshold is shown by the dashed green line. If the mean (or median) annual earnings of program completers of a bachelor degree program is $40,000, and the median student loan debt is $60,000, the program would have passed the measure, as the DIR would have been less than or equal to 30%.", "An important distinction between the two earnings measures is their differential treatment of the relationship between student loan debt and annual earnings. This is indicated by the slope of the lines in Figure 1 . (Passing programs are those that fall on or below the line.) The DIR measure was designed in a manner such that for a program to be considered successful, completers of the program must devote no more than 30% of their discretionary income (i.e., income in excess of 150% of the poverty guideline) to student loan debt service. However, according to this framework, a program would automatically fail the measure if the mean or median income was less than 150% of the poverty guideline. The ER measure is designed to provide an alternative path for programs whose completers have lower annual earnings to pass one of the debt-to-earnings measures. Under this measure, a program is considered successful if its completers devote no more than 12% of their annual earnings to student loan debt service. Overall, for programs whose completers have lower annual earnings, the ER measure is comparatively easier to pass than the DIR measure; whereas for programs whose completers have higher annual earnings, the DIR measure is comparatively easier to pass.", "Figure 1 also shows the effect that using different loan repayment schedules has on the calculation of the annual loan payment amount for the three categories of program types, based on a range of median student loan debt amounts. The use of different amortization periods to calculate annual student loan payment amounts for different types of programs is designed to recognize that students who attend higher level degree programs tend to have larger amounts of student loan debt that they typically repay over longer repayment schedules. For example, consider a case using the DIR measure in which mean or median annual earnings is $40,000. The maximum median student loan debt of a passing certificate or associate's degree program would be $50,497, the maximum student loan debt of a passing bachelor's or master's degree program would be $65,465, and the maximum student loan debt of a passing doctoral or professional degree program would be $76,129."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Calculating the Performance Measures, Corrections and Adjustments, and Alternative Earnings Data", "paragraphs": ["The final regulations provided that as part of the process of calculating the three gainful employment measures, institutions would have had several opportunities to review and correct the data used by ED in their calculation.
