While NATO's collective defense guarantee remains at the core of the alliance, members have also sought to redefine its mission as new security challenges have emerged on Europe's periphery and beyond. At the same time, EU members have taken steps toward political integration with decisions to develop a common foreign policy and a defense arm to improve EU member states' abilities to manage security crises, such as those that engulfed the Balkans in the 1990s.", "The evolution of NATO and the EU, however, has generated some friction between the United States and several of its allies over the security responsibilities of the two organizations. U.S.-European differences center around threat assessment, defense institutions, and military capabilities. Successive U.S. administrations and the U.S. Congress have called for enhanced European defense capabilities to enable the allies to better share the security burden, and to ensure that NATO's post-Cold War mission embraces combating terrorism and countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. U.S. policymakers, backed by Congress, support EU efforts to develop a European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) provided that it remains tied to NATO and does not threaten the transatlantic relationship.", "Most EU member states support close NATO-EU links, but also view ESDP as a means to give themselves more options for dealing with future crises, especially in cases in which the United States may be reluctant to become involved. A minority of EU countries, spearheaded traditionally by France, continue to favor a more autonomous EU defense identity. This desire has been fueled further recently by disputes with the United States over how or whether to engage international institutions, such as the United Nations, on security matters and over the weight given to political versus military instruments in resolving international crises.", "This report addresses several questions central to the debate over European security and the future of the broader transatlantic relationship that may be of interest in the second session of the 110th Congress. These include what are the specific security missions of NATO and the European Union, and what is the appropriate relationship between the two organizations? What types of military forces are necessary for NATO's role in collective defense, and for the EU's role in crisis management? Are NATO and EU decision-making structures and procedures appropriate and compatible to ensure that there is an adequate and timely response to emerging threats? What is the proper balance between political and military tools for defending Europe and the United States from terrorism and weapons proliferation? What is the effect of enlargement on security and stability?", "This report will be updated as events warrant.

NATO's original purpose was to provide collective defense through a mutual security guarantee for the United States and its European allies to counterbalance potential threats from the Soviet Union. The European Community's purpose was to provide political stability to its members through securing democracy and free markets. Congress and successive Administrations have strongly supported both NATO and the EC/EU, based on the belief that stability in Europe has engendered the growth of democracy, reliable military allies, and strong trading partners.", "In the second session of the 110 th Congress, Members will likely exhibit an interest in NATO's effort to develop more mobile combat forces, enhance the alliance's role in Afghanistan, examine the appropriateness of a possible missile defense system for Europe, and enlargement of the alliance. As in the previous several years, the evolution of the NATO-EU relationship is also likely to attract congressional attention.", "Evolution of NATO and the EC/EU after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 has brought with it some friction between the United States and several of its allies over the security responsibilities of the two organizations. These differences center around threat assessment, defense institutions, and military capabilities.", "European NATO allies that were also members of the EC/EU have sought from 1990 to build a security apparatus able to respond to developments believed to threaten specifically the interests of Europe. In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, some European governments\u2014led by France\u2014concluded that they lacked the military capabilities to respond beyond the North Atlantic Treaty area to distant threats. In consultation with the United States, they sought to establish the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within NATO, in which they would consult among themselves and with NATO over response to a threat. Both the first Bush Administration and the Clinton Administration asked that ESDI not duplicate NATO structures, such as headquarters and a planning staff, but rather \"borrow\" NATO structures for planning and carrying out operations. Initial reluctance of the Clinton Administration to involve the United States in the emerging conflicts accompanying the break up of Yugoslavia led some allies to redouble their efforts to enhance their political consultation, unity, and military capabilities. They saw a threat in the form of large refugee flows, autocratic regimes, and the spread of nationalist ideas emanating from the conflict-ridden Balkans.", "In 1994-1996, NATO endorsed steps to build an ESDI that was \"separable but not separate\" from NATO to give the European allies the ability to act in crises where NATO as a whole was not engaged.", "In 1998-1999, the EU largely adopted ESDI as its own and began to transform it into a European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), given greater definition by more detailed arrangements for the Europeans to borrow NATO assets for the \"Petersberg tasks\" (crisis management, peace operations, search and rescue, and humanitarian assistance). Britain, in a major policy reversal, joined France in moving forward discussions of these new arrangements within the EU. ESDP's principal differences with ESDI were in the effort to secure more independence from NATO tutelage and guidance in the event that the United States expressed reluctance to become involved in a crisis, a renewed discussion of more carefully outlined EU decision-making structures, and consideration of forces appropriate for potential crises. The Kosovo conflict of 1999 further spurred this effort, when most EU members of NATO conceded that they still lacked adequately mobile and sustainable forces for crisis management. All EU members express a wish to see a strong U.S.-led NATO. However, there are disputes with the United States over how or whether to involve international institutions, such as the UN, in international crises. There are also disagreements over the weight given to political versus military instruments in resolving these crises. These disputes have fueled European desires to develop a more independent ESDP. The United States maintains that ESDP must be closely tied to NATO, given the large number of states that belong to both NATO and the EU (see membership chart in Appendix ) and limited European defense resources.", "Congress is actively engaged in the evolving NATO-EU relationship. While Congress has supported the greater political integration that marked the European Community's evolution into the European Union, many Members have called for improved European military capabilities to share the security burden, and to ensure that NATO's post-Cold War mission embraces combating terrorism and WMD proliferation. In 1998 and again in 2003 the Senate approved the addition of new members to the alliance as a means to build European stability through securing democratic governments and adding states that shared concerns over emerging threats.", "During the 1998 NATO enlargement debate, Senator Jon Kyl offered an amendment to the instrument of ratification that described terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as new threats that NATO must counter. The Kyl amendment called on the European allies to develop capabilities \"to project power... and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of willing partners....\" Member states should \"possess national military capabilities to rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the United States in high intensity conflict.\" The amendment passed by a wide margin. Its essence was apparent in NATO's Strategic Concept, the alliance's strategic guidelines, adopted at the Washington summit in April 1999, and in subsequent NATO agreements to redefine the alliance's mission and to improve capabilities.", "The issues raised in the 1990s debate over European security remain the essence of the debate today. What are the missions in security affairs of NATO and the European Union? What is the proper weight to be given to political and military instruments in defending Europe and the United States from terrorism and proliferation? What types of military forces are necessary for NATO's role in collective defense, and for the EU's role in crisis management? Are NATO and EU decision-making structures and procedures appropriate and compatible to ensure that there is an adequate and timely response to emerging threats?

NATO's 1999 Strategic Concept states that the allied \"defense posture must have the capability to address appropriately and effectively the risks\" associated with the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The document also describes terrorism as a threat, but indicates that political and diplomatic means should be the main instruments against both terrorism and proliferation. The attacks of September 11, 2001, on the United States led to a refinement of the allied posture on these threats.", "In a May 2002 communiqu\u00e9, NATO agreed that the allies must \"be able to field forces that can move quickly to wherever they are needed, sustain operations over distance and time, and achieve their objectives.\" The communiqu\u00e9 marks the moment that NATO decided to assume responsibilities around the globe should an ally be threatened.", "In November 2002, at the Prague summit, the allies made a commitment to build the capabilities necessary to go out of area. They agreed to establish a NATO Response Force (NRF) of 20,000 troops for rapid \"insertion\" into a theater of operations. The NRF consists of highly trained combat units from member states, and could be used to fight terrorism. In addition, the allies agreed to a scaled-down list of new capabilities, called the Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC), that declining European defense budgets might be able to sustain. Under the PCC, some allies have agreed to develop consortia to fund jointly such systems as strategic airlift and aerial refueling, meant to provide mobility for combat operations distant from Europe, or specialized \"niche\" capabilities, such as special forces or units to detect chemical or biological agents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S.-European Differences over Threat Response", "paragraphs": ["Despite the transatlantic agreement on the new common threats, the NRF, and the PCC, there are significant differences between the United States and its allies over appropriate responses. Most allied governments contend that the Administration places excessive emphasis on military over political means to counter a threat, and that the allies have other domestic budget priorities (such as pension plans) that compete with allocations for defense.", "The allies' response to the Bush Administration's doctrine of \"pre-emptive attack\" in the face of an imminent threat captures elements of the transatlantic debate over response to the threat. The Administration's National Security Strategy (2002) notes that the United States reserves the right to take military action \"to forestall or prevent... hostile acts\" by an adversary. While most allies would concede such a right, some view the doctrine as an example of U.S. unilateralism at the moment of U.S. global military pre-eminence. In general, they believe that military action must be undertaken within a multilateral framework.", "The allied debate over pre-emptive attack was affected by the U.S. decision to terminate UN weapons inspections and to go to war against Iraq in March 2003, a conflict Administration officials indicate was undertaken to prevent the Hussein regime from developing and using weapons of mass destruction against the United States and other countries. The initial refusal by France, Germany, and Belgium to approve NATO military assistance to Turkey in February 2003 in anticipation of a possible attack by Iraq sharply divided the alliance. Most allies said then, and maintain now, that a UN resolution is a requisite step, whenever possible, for NATO military action. The inability of the Bush Administration to locate WMD in Iraq led to renewed insistence among the European allies that their opposition was correct and that a UN imprimatur should be sought for NATO operations.", "Allied insistence on involvement of international institutions in \"legitimizing\" conflict has its origins in the aftermath of the 20 th century's two world wars. Europeans remain wary of arguments justifying the crossing of borders and resorting to military action. Establishment of the United Nations in 1946, under U.S. leadership, was one means to ensure that international diplomatic and public opinion could be brought to bear to enhance understanding of an impending danger and how to respond to it. The North Atlantic Treaty's (1949) reliance on the consensus method of decision-making was another.", "The allied debate over pre-emptive attack, out-of-area engagement, and \"legitimization\" of military operations was brought to a head by the Bush Administration's frustration with cumbersome alliance decision-making procedures. The Administration believes that NATO military actions should mostly be conducted by \"coalitions of the willing.\" In this view, the allies, of which only a small number have deployable forces capable of high-intensity conflict, should use coalitions of member states that agree upon a threat and have the means to counter it. Most European allies believe that \"coalitions of the willing\" undermine the solidarity of the alliance and the consensus decision-making principle. Their support for the principle of consensus centers upon a desire to maintain political solidarity for controversial measures. In this view, the consent of 26 sovereign governments, each taking an independent decision to work with other governments, is a formidable expression of solidarity and in itself provides a measure of legitimization for an operation. Some allies believe that this view was given weight, for example, in NATO's decision to go to war against Serbia in 1999 when Russian resistance prevented passage of a UN Security Council resolution approving intervention on behalf of Kosovo.", "The Administration proposed a controversial ground-based missile defense system, to be placed in Poland and the Czech Republic, to defend against a possible missile attack by Iran. Questions immediately arose in Congress and Europe about the feasibility of the proposed system, as well as the nature of the perceived threat.", "Some allies believe that NATO should develop a new Strategic Concept, given the ongoing debate over the proper balance between the use of military and political tools to bring global stability. Some allies wish to see a brief document that clearly states NATO's purpose and its role in regional and global stabilization. The allies are likely to discuss the possibility of drafting a new Strategic Concept at NATO's Bucharest summit in April 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capabilities and \"Usability\"", "paragraphs": ["Most allies lack mobile forces that can be sustained distant from the European theater. In October 2003, former NATO Secretary General George Robertson said that \"out of the 1.4 million soldiers under arms, the 18 non-U.S. allies have 55,000 deployed on multinational operations..., yet they feel overstretched. If operations such as the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan are to succeed, we must generate more usable soldiers and have the political will to deploy more of them in multinational operations.\" Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander (SACEUR) General James Jones told Congress in March 2004 that only 3%-4% of European forces were \"expeditionarily deployable.\" The Bush Administration proposed both the NATO Response Force (NRF) and the Prague Capabilities Commitment in 2002 to help remedy this problem. The purpose of the initiatives has been to create forces that integrate, for example, aerial refuelers and airlift capacities to allow troops and equipment to be moved to a conflict. The allies believe that shared funding of some of these capabilities will moderate the costs to individual governments.", "At NATO's Riga summit in November 2006, the allies declared the NRF fully operational, perhaps prematurely. The NRF was to have 20,000 troops, on rotation, in high-readiness status. It can be packaged to respond to a range of crises, from humanitarian assistance after an earthquake, for example, to an insertion force for high-intensity combat. The NRF is to reach its destination within 7-30 days and sustain itself for a period of time.", "However, the alliance has had difficulty in filling out the NRF and planning for three rotations. Some allies are overstretched in security operations around the globe. Others express concern about the potentially high costs of participating in an ongoing NRF mission, and are asking that the allies consider a more equitable plan for sharing such costs; in the meantime, some governments are reluctant to contribute forces to the NRF. There is now a debate about the \"evolution\" of the role of the NRF. The United States and several other allies believe that the NRF should be used in current operations, such as in Afghanistan. Others, such as France and Germany, wish to preserve the original concept of an NRF by keeping it available as a quick-insertion force in a crisis, and as an apparatus to spur member governments to continue the transformation of their militaries to more mobile forces.", "General Jones pressed the idea that more NATO assets be funded jointly to ensure availability of needed equipment and forces. Today, NATO for the most part follows the concept of \"costs lie where they fall,\" meaning that governments pay the costs for forces they send to an operation, such as in Kosovo in 1999. Such a practice translates into the larger countries with more military capabilities and political will bearing disproportionate costs in providing security for all. Otherwise, the concern is that NATO risks failing to develop appropriate forces, such as the NRF, as governments decline to contribute troops because they might be used for expensive operations. At the Riga summit, sixteen allies announced that they were pooling resources to purchase four Boeing C-17s in 2007, a step that will enhance NATO's capability to airlift troops and equipment to distant theaters.", "The Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) is a slimmed-down version of an earlier capabilities initiative and has eight capability goals targeting the allies' principal deficiencies. The list of PCC capabilities includes strategic lift (air and sea), aerial refueling, precision-guided munitions, secure communications, ground surveillance systems, and special forces. At the Istanbul summit in June 2004, NATO announced that a Chemical/Biological, Radiological, and nuclear defense battalion had become fully operational, fulfilling one of the capability goals. There has been some progress in purchase or leasing of sea lift, and the acquisition of precision-guided munitions is on schedule. While some U.S. officials say that the PCC is on schedule, others say that there remain serious shortfalls in aerial refuelers and air lift, where PCC goals are unlikely to be met in the foreseeable future.", "The allies designed the capabilities list to form an integrated set of systems; because allies are not acquiring some systems, other systems' effectiveness will be diminished. For example, improved lift capacity is necessary if equipment, munitions, and forces are to reach a theater of operations in a timely fashion. Some governments, such as the German government, have pleaded that competing budget necessities, such as pension programs, are forestalling plans to modernize their militaries. The German parliament has also reduced and capped defense expenditures for the next several years.", "At the 2006 NATO Riga summit, the allies issued a document called the \"Comprehensive Political Guidance,\" signed by the members' 26 heads of state. In the coming years, the leaders called on all allies to develop forces of which 40% would be structured for deployment, and 8% for sustained operations at any given time.", "Some analysts worry that NATO and the EU might \"compete\" for the use of more mobile, high-readiness forces. The EU is developing its own rapid reaction forces for crisis management. Some of these units are \"double hatted\" for use either by the EU or by NATO. The EU also has embarked on an initiative to enhance its military capabilities and equipment procurement, including, for example, greater strategic lift and weapons for suppression of enemy air defenses. The issue of which organization, NATO or the EU, could use national forces if there were simultaneous crises has not been resolved.", "Some NATO officials believe that the EU places more restrictions on use of its forces than does NATO and that these restrictions are reflected in the training of those forces. In this view, NATO and the EU train their forces to different standards, and EU forces have a different \"language\" of command and operations; these hurdles must be cleared for forces trained for the EU to be useful to NATO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"National Caveats\"", "paragraphs": ["Former SACEUR General Jones was critical of NATO governments that commit forces to an allied mission, then impose restrictions on tasks those forces may undertake. Such \"national caveats\" have troubled operations in the Balkans, for example. In March 2004, when Albanians rioted against Serbs in Kosovo (see below), German troops refused orders to join other elements of KFOR in crowd control; only 6,000 of KFOR's 18,000 troops were eligible to use force against the rioting crowds. NATO is attempting to overcome this problem by providing more riot-control training for troops designated for assignment in Kosovo.", "In NATO's mission in Afghanistan, a number of governments have placed caveats on their forces. Some, for example, lack appropriate equipment and prohibit their aircraft from flying at night. Others restrict the movement and use of their forces. Germany, for example, largely restricts the use of its forces to northern Afghanistan, a relatively stable part of the country. Only in an urgent situation may they go to southern Afghanistan, an area increasingly unstable and the location of considerable fighting by U.S., British, Canadian, and Dutch forces against the Taliban. The allies lifted some, but not all, caveats in Afghanistan at the Riga summit.", "At the same time, national caveats are an expression of sovereignty by member governments and on occasion may be the price that must be paid to secure the participation of a government in a NATO mission. \"National caveats\" is a political term and not an official NATO description of restrictions on forces. The United States has taken the lead in criticizing governments that place caveats on their forces. However, some U.S. military officials say that some allies might also contend that the United States has its own caveats but that Washington chooses to call them by another name. For example, the United States, as do other governments, places restrictions on the range of actions that its forces may undertake in the Balkans and Afghanistan, but describes these restrictions as tactical rules of engagement.", "In general, however, U.S. military officials oppose national caveats because they complicate the force-planning process. With caveats in place, force planners must cajole member states to supply troops who have the authority and skills to accomplish a mission.

The United States leads a separate, non-NATO mission, called Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF); its mission is to eliminate Taliban and Al Qaeda remnants, primarily active in the eastern part of the country. NATO governments have decided to bring these two missions closer together, although their commands and mission will remain separate.", "In 2006, ISAF brought all of Afghanistan under its control, under a U.N. resolution. ISAF now has approximately 41,000 troops; the forces are overwhelmingly from NATO's member states, above all from the United States, Germany, Canada, Britain, France, and the Netherlands. Increasingly, partner countries such as Australia and New Zealand, recognizing that stability in south Asia is in their interests, have been contributing troops. This development reflects an effort led by the United States to make NATO a global security organization, under the logic that terrorism and the proliferation of WMD is a threat to all societies.", "Since the spring of 2006, there has been a resurgence of the Taliban, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country. They are exploiting the weak governance of the Karzai government in Kabul, with which there is growing discontent by the population. Warlords are also re-exerting authority in parts of the country. ISAF has established Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), composed of soldiers and civil affairs officers, in parts of Afghanistan. The objective of the PRTs is to extend the authority of the central government, provide security, and undertake projects (such as infrastructure development) that would boost the Afghan economy. This effort has met with only mixed success, in part because allied governments have been slow to sponsor PRTs and to provide troops for them, in part because some allies lack deployable, sustainable forces. A key element lacking in some PRTs is quick-response combat and medical units that could assist PRTs that find themselves in danger.", "The allies are debating among themselves the next steps to stabilize Afghanistan. Some allies believe that NATO relies too heavily on combat power to stabilize the country, and that economic and political reconstruction must be given greater emphasis. The United States and several other allies respond that there can be no ongoing reconstruction without security.

There is an effort to develop alternative crops, a program that could take years to come to fruition. The Bush Administration has proposed an aerial spraying program to reduce the poppy crop, which both the Karzai government and the allies are resisting. The allies believe that the Afghan government must take the lead in reducing the poppy crop, as only Afghan leaders can have long-term credibility in the country.

Most allies are members of the European Union. They place great importance on international institutions as a means of solving transnational problems, from economic dislocation to narcotics trafficking to prevention of conflict. The legacy of two world wars in Europe remains a central factor in shaping governments' policies; prevention of illegitimate violations of sovereignty was a principal reason for their support of the establishment of the UN, the EU, and NATO. This view lies behind the general European opposition to the Bush Administration's doctrine of \"pre-emptive action.\" Some European observers today believe that there is an \"absence of anything that could be called an international security architecture,\" in part because the United States, in this view, avoids reliance on the UN. U.S. global leadership was once \"embedded in the international rule of law that constrained the powerful as well as the weak.\" However, in this view, the U.S. resort to force in Iraq, without clear support from the UN, has made the United States \"a revolutionary hyperpower.\"", "Some U.S. officials counter that there is good cooperation with the allies on the use of law enforcement to combat terrorism, but that there are moments when the danger of impending catastrophic developments or an imminent attack justifies the use of force without \"legitimization\" through the often time-consuming process of obtaining a UN resolution. The Clinton Administration (and ultimately all the allies) reached this conclusion when it decided that NATO must act to prevent ethnic cleansing in Kosovo without explicit U.N. authorization in light of a threatened Russian veto, and the Bush Administration reached this conclusion when it went to war in Iraq in the belief that the Hussein regime possessed a WMD arsenal.", "As noted above, some allies contend that the United States is seeking to use NATO as a \"toolbox.\" They object to former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's repeated advocacy of \"coalitions of the willing\" to fight in conflicts as a means of using allied resources and supportive NATO governments to endorse U.S. interventions on foreign soil. They argue that the Administration's contention that \"the mission drives the coalition\" undermines allied solidarity; such a doctrine weakens the long-held view that all member states must believe that they have a stake in allied security operations.", "Some allies believe that the United States relies too heavily upon military power to resolve issues that may have a political solution.

Blair joined then-French President Jacques Chirac in pressing the EU to develop a defense identity outside of NATO.

European shortfalls in strategic airlift, precision-guided munitions, command and control systems, intelligence, aerial refueling, and suppression of enemy air defenses were among the most obvious. In setting out the parameters of the 60,000-strong \"Headline Goal\" rapid reaction force, EU leaders sought to establish goals that would require members to enhance force deployability and sustainability, and to reorient and ultimately increase defense spending to help fill equipment gaps. The most ambitious members envisioned the EU's rapid reaction force developing a combat capability equivalent, for example, to NATO's role in the Kosovo conflict.", "In 2000 and 2001, the EU held two military capability commitment conferences to define national contributions to the rapid reaction force and address the capability shortfalls. Member states pledged in excess of 60,000 troops drawn from their existing national forces, as well as up to 400 combat aircraft and 100 naval vessels as support elements. In 2001, the EU also initiated a European Capability Action Plan (ECAP) to devise strategies for remedying the capability gaps. In May 2003, the EU declared that the rapid reaction force possesses \"operational capability across the full range of Petersberg tasks,\" but recognized that the force would still be \"limited and constrained by recognized shortfalls\" in certain defense capabilities. As a result, ESDP missions in the near to medium term will likely focus on lower-end Petersberg tasks rather than higher-end peace enforcement operations.

A key focus of the EDA will be to help EU members stretch their scarce defense funds farther by increasing cooperation in the areas of weapons research, development, and procurement. In November 2005, EU defense ministers agreed on a voluntary \"code of conduct\" to encourage cross-border competition in the European defense equipment market. Traditionally, EU member states have tightly guarded their national defense markets; defense equipment contracts have been largely exempt on national security grounds from normal EU internal market rules that eliminate trade barriers. The EU hopes that more competition will lead to lower defense procurement costs, improved capabilities, and increase the competitiveness of the European defense market globally. The new code of conduct took effect in July 2006 for those countries that decided to take part.", "Critics, however, charge that promises to spend existing defense resources more wisely have not yet materialized in any substantial way.

Critics point out that the new agreed code of conduct to liberalize the European defense markets will be voluntary and, therefore, unenforceable. Many expect that some European defense ministries will also be slow to move away from their trusted national suppliers. Skeptics also criticize European leaders' continued devotion to the increasingly expensive but still non-existent Airbus's A400M military transport project, in which seven European allies are investing large portions of their procurement budgets.
