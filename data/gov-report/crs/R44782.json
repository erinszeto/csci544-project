The marijuana policy gap has widened each year for some time. It has only been a few years since states began to legalize recreational marijuana, but over 20 years since they began to legalize medical marijuana. In addressing state-level legalization efforts and considering marijuana's current placement on Schedule I, Congress could take one of several routes. It could elect to take no action, thereby upholding the federal government's current marijuana policy.

For example, federal authorities may confiscate any property used to grow marijuana or facilitate its sale or use, as well as all proceeds derived from the sale of marijuana. When financial institutions provide financial services to business customers, they generally are not directly involved in the sale, possession, or distribution of their customers' products.

Similarly, a bank officer could face a 10-year prison term and criminal money penalties under Section 1957 for knowingly depositing or withdrawing $10,000 or more in cash that is derived from the distribution and sale of marijuana.

The DEA requests such scientific and medical evaluations from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in response to petitions asking the DEA to reschedule marijuana administratively. ", "National Academies Evaluation. The National Academies evaluated cannabis, its constituents, and drugs containing synthetic THC. For each of 11 health topics, the report assessed \"fair- and good-quality\" research, relying on systematic reviews published since 2011 (where available) and primary research published after the systematic review (or since 1999, if no systematic review exists). The 11 health topics are (1) therapeutic effects; (2) cancer; (3) cardiometabolic risk; (4) respiratory disease; (5) immunity; (6) injury and death; (7) prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal exposure to cannabis; (8) psychosocial effects; (9) mental health; (10) problem cannabis use; and (11) cannabis use and abuse of other substances. The report presents nearly 100 conclusions, including some related to the challenges in conducting research with cannabis and cannabinoids.", "Federal Research Requirements for Marijuana", "Many federal research requirements are standard across all schedules of controlled substances; however, some requirements vary according to the assigned schedule of the particular substance. Federal regulations are more stringent for Schedule I substances\u2014including marijuana. Examples of this include the following:", "For Schedule I substances, such as marijuana, even if practitioners have a DEA registration for a substance in Schedules II-V, they must obtain a separate DEA registration for Schedule I substances. Individuals who seek to register to manufacture a controlled substance in Schedule I or II are subject to production quota limitations as determined by the DEA, but registrants for substances in Schedules III-V are not subject to such quotas. Researchers are required to store Schedule I and II substances in electronically monitored safes, steel cabinets, or vaults that meet or exceed certain specifications. They are required to store Schedule III-V substances by secure standards but the requirements are less stringent than those required for Schedule I and II substances. When researchers apply for a DEA registration to conduct research involving Schedule I controlled substances, they must comply with federal regulations specifying the form and content of the research protocols. The DEA Administrator must forward a copy of the application and research protocol to HHS, which is responsible for determining \"the qualifications and competency of the applicant, as well as the merits of the protocol.\" The HHS Secretary delegates that responsibility to the FDA. No equivalent process is required for Schedule II -V controlled substances.", "Marijuana Supply for Researchers", "Under the CSA, the Attorney General is required to register an applicant to manufacture Schedule I or II controlled substances \"if he determines that such registration is consistent with the public interest and with United States obligations under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on May 1, 1971.\" In the case of marijuana, the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi has been the only registered manufacturer, operating under a contract administered by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) within HHS's National Institutes of Health. For nearly 50 years, it has been the only official source through which researchers may obtain marijuana for research purposes\u2014and which some have referred to as a \"federal research monopoly.\" Some have contended that marijuana provided by NIDA to researchers is \"both qualitatively and quantitatively inadequate.\" Marijuana's status as a Schedule I drug has reportedly created difficulty for researchers who seek to study the substance but are potentially unable to meet the strict requirements of the CSA, or perhaps they seek to utilize a different quality of marijuana than what is available through NIDA.", "In August 2016, the DEA announced a policy change \"designed to foster research by expanding the number of DEA-registered marijuana manufacturers.\" Under the new policy, the DEA is willing to license additional growers to \"operate independently, provided the grower agrees (through a written memorandum of agreement with DEA) that it will only distribute marijuana with prior, written approval from DEA.\" In addition, under the new policy, these growers will only be permitted to supply marijuana to DEA-registered researchers whose \"protocols have been determined by [HHS] to be scientifically meritorious.\" This new approach, DEA states, will allow individuals to obtain a DEA cultivation registration \"not only to supply federally funded or other academic researchers, but also for strictly commercial endeavors funded by the private sector and aimed at drug product development.\" Given that both the FDA and the DEA identified the lack of research as a significant factor in denying the rescheduling petitions in 2016, and to the extent that this policy may increase the amount of marijuana research conducted, the change could contribute to future debate on rescheduling.", "Appendix B. Background on Federal Marijuana Policy", "Early 20 th Century", "Prior to 1937, the growth and use of marijuana was legal under federal law. During the course of promoting federal legislation to control marijuana, Henry Anslinger, the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), and others submitted testimony to Congress regarding the evils of marijuana use, claiming that it incited violent and insane behavior. Of note, Commissioner Anslinger had informed Congress that \"the major criminal in the United States is the drug addict; that of all the offenses committed against the laws of this country, the narcotic addict is the most frequent offender.\" The federal government unofficially banned marijuana under the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 (MTA; P.L. 75-238). The MTA imposed a strict regulation requiring a high-cost transfer tax stamp on marijuana sales, and these stamps were rarely issued by the federal government. Shortly after passage of the MTA, all states made the possession of marijuana illegal. ", "Mid-20 th Century", "In the decades after enactment of the MTA, Congress continued to pass drug control legislation and further criminalized drug abuse. For example, the Boggs Act (P.L. 82-255), passed in 1951, established mandatory prison sentences for some drug offenses, while the 1956 Narcotic Control Act (P.L. 84-728) further increased penalties for drug offenses. In conjunction with growing support for a medical approach to addressing drug abuse, there was a strong emphasis on law enforcement control of narcotics. Congress shifted the constitutional basis for drug control from its taxing authority to its power to regulate interstate commerce, and in 1968 the FBN merged with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control and was transferred from Treasury to the Department of Justice. Several years later, President Nixon would declare a war on drugs.", "Congress and President Nixon enhanced federal control of drugs in the enactment of comprehensive federal drug laws\u2014including the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), enacted as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-513). The CSA placed the control of marijuana and other plant, drug, and chemical substances under federal jurisdiction regardless of state regulations and laws. In designating marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, this legislation officially prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, and possession of marijuana.", "The Shafer Commission", "As part of the CSA, the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, also known as the Shafer Commission, was established to study marijuana in the United States. Specifically, this commission was charged with examining issues such as", "(A) the extent of use of marihuana in the United States to include its various sources of users, number of arrests, number of convictions, amount of marihuana seized, type of user, nature of use;", "(B) an evaluation of the efficacy of existing marihuana laws;", "(C) a study of the pharmacology of marihuana and its immediate and long-term effects, both physiological and psychological;", "(D) the relationship of marihuana use to aggressive behavior and crime;", "(E) the relationship between marihuana and the use of other drugs; and ", "(F) the international control of marihuana.", "The Shafer Commission, in concluding its review, produced two reports: (1) Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding , and (2) Drug Use in America: Problem in Perspective . ", "In its first report, the Shafer Commission discussed the perception of marijuana as a major social problem and how it came to be viewed as such. It made a number of recommendations, including the development of a \"social control policy seeking to discourage marihuana use, while concentrating primarily on the prevention of heavy and very heavy use.\" In this first report, the commission also called the application of criminal law in cases of personal use of marijuana \"constitutionally suspect\" and declared that \"total prohibition is functionally inappropriate.\" Of note, federal criminalization and prohibition of marijuana was never altered, either administratively or legislatively, to comply with the recommendations of the Shafer Commission. ", "In its second report, the Shafer Commission reviewed the use of all drugs in the United States, not solely marijuana. It examined the origins of the country's drug problem, including the social costs of drug use, and once again made specific recommendations regarding social policy. Among other conclusions regarding marijuana, the commission indicated that aggressive behavior generally cannot be attributed to its use. The commission also reaffirmed its previous findings and recommendations regarding marijuana and added the following statement:", "The risk potential of marihuana is quite low compared to the potent psychoactive substances, and even its widespread consumption does not involve social cost now associated with most of the stimulants and depressants (Jones, 1973; Tinklenberg, 1971). Nonetheless, the Commission remains persuaded that availability of this drug should not be institutionalized at this time.", "At the conclusion of the second report, the Shafer Commission recommended that Congress launch a subsequent commission to reexamine the broad issues surrounding drug use and societal response. While a number of congressionally directed commissions regarding drugs have since been established, no such commission has been directed to review the comprehensive issues of drug use, abuse, and response in the United States."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
