Eventsof the past decade indicate that the terrorist threat has changed significantly in ways that make itmore dangerous and much more difficult to counter. The terrorist attacks of the 1970s and 1980susually had clear political objectives. These attacks resulted in just enough bloodshed and loss of lifeto gain attention to the terrorists' cause yet not enough to alienate them from the public support theysought. Bombings, kidnapings, and aircraft hijacking were accomplished by declared, identifiablegroups with specific political goals in mind. In contrast, the decade of the 1990s has produced adifferent type of terrorism - terrorism designed to produce massive casualties with little regard fordistinct political goals and often no claims of responsibility. Recent examples of this type of attack,such as the World Trade Center bombing in New York City, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Buildingbombing in Oklahoma City, the East African Embassy bombings in 1998, and destruction of theWorld Trade Center in 2001 make it appear that a terrorist's aim is to kill as many people as possible. The possible inclusion of weapons of mass destruction in the terrorists' arsenal now makes this aneven more dangerous proposition.", "Recently, in the trial of the perpetrators of the East African Embassy bombings, a witnesstestified that Usama bin Laden's group, al Qaeda (Arabic for \"the Base\"), sought to acquire chemicaland nuclear material to use against the United States.

Today's terrorists, liketheir predecessors, seek to instill fear, undermine government authority, and possibly goad thegovernment into overreacting to the incident or threat.

Section 334, Proclamation to Disperse . First, the President would issue a proclamationcommanding all persons engaged in acts of domestic violence and disorder in the affected area tocease and desist and to leave the area peaceably. The President would then immediately issue anexecutive order authorizing the Secretary of Defense to use active duty members of the armed forcesto suppress the violence described in the proclamation.

The order would alsorequire the Secretary to coordinate law enforcement policies with the Attorney General. (48) ", "Military Tactical Assistance OperationalResponse. If military force is authorized by the President, DoD has a variety ofoptions. The most likely option in the case of terrorism (especially a WMD situation) would involvetactical assistance in the form of a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF). The task force isan agile, highly trained special mission force available to the FBI if a threat or an actual incident ofdomestic terrorism is considered beyond the tactical response capability of law enforcement. In sucha case, the FBI On-Scene Commander would request that the FBI Director recommend that theAttorney General seek DoD support for the situation. The FBI would normally ask for militarysupport only if its assets are overwhelmed by multiple threats or incidents, or if the specific target,including a suspected or known WMD, is beyond the capability of FBI tactical and technical assets. The JSOTF may include or have immediate access to specially trained personnel capable of dealingwith various types of WMD. The Attorney General will begin the process by conferring with theSecretary of Defense to determine if military support is appropriate using the same criteria employedin a technical assistance situation.", "The OSC will also request that the FBI Director ask the Attorney General to deploy theemergency support team if it has not already been launched to the incident site. The DoD componentof the DEST will include liaison officers familiar with the capabilities of the military units mostlikely to be tasked to support the FBI in a potentially hostile domestic terrorism situation. Thelaunching of the DEST aircraft and all DoD personnel assigned to the team must be authorized bythe Secretary of Defense. The military liaison officers assigned to the DEST are allowed to reportdirectly to DoD and contingency planning for possible military intervention may begin. Thecommander of the JSOTF is integrated directly into the command group of the FBI JOC in order togain first-hand knowledge of the tactical situation. Technical assistance operations may run inconcert with military tactical assistance planning. DoD may undertake precautionary steps, such asthe prepositioning of a limited number of military forces near the incident site with the approval ofDoJ and the OSC.", "When the OSC anticipates that federal military assistance is necessary to resolve the incident,he will immediately notify the FBI Director who will advise the Attorney General of the situation. After consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General will advise the President thatconditions warrant the employment of federal military forces. If the President decides to approvethe use of military force, he invokes the Insurrection Statutes as previously discussed. The AttorneyGeneral, through the FBI, remains responsible for coordinating all activities for federal, State, andlocal agencies assisting in the resolution of the incident and the administration of justice in theaffected area.", "When presidential approval to use military force is granted, the Attorney General will advisethe FBI who will notify the OSC. The Secretary of Defense will advise the commander of themilitary task force who in turn will begin coordination with the OSC for transfer of operationalcontrol of the incident site to the military. Responsibility for the tactical phase of the operation istransferred to military authority when the OSC relinquishes command and it is accepted by themilitary commander. The OSC may revoke the military authority at any time prior to the assaultphase of the operation if he determines that military intervention is no longer required provided thatthe military commander agrees a withdrawal of forces can be accomplished without endangering thesafety of his personnel.", "Once the incident is resolved, the military commander will return on-scene authority andresponsibility to the OSC. The military forces will normally evacuate the area to a mutually agreedupon relocation site to prepare for redeployment to their home station. However, key militarypersonnel may be requested to remain at the incident site if the OSC determines their presence isnecessary in the investigative process. The FBI will provide the military members the appropriateconstitutional and procedural safeguards, including the presence of military counsel if required bythe circumstances. The FBI will also, to the extent permitted by law, protect the identity of themilitary members participating in the event and any sensitive tactics, techniques, and proceduresused by the military during the operation.", "The decision to employ active military forces against a target in the United States, especiallyif it involves American citizens, remains a sensitive and complicated issue with numerous potentialpolitical and legal ramifications.

The State Department, the Department of Justice, and DoD, all usedefinitions with subtle, yet far-reaching differences. If terrorism is defined as merely a legal issue,then law enforcement takes priority. In legal terms, terrorist-related acts are now arson, murder, orkidnaping. If terrorism is seen as affecting national security, it is a political or military issue thatcould end with response by military forces to prevent, deter, or interdict the terrorist act.", "With no specific national objectives for which federal, State, and local agencies can gaugeprogress or measure capability, terrorism policy, it is argued, becomes an exercise in executingprograms within a set budget. The general policies that involve preparation for interdicting athreatened terrorist act have no clear priority of implementation among those responsible forexecuting the policy.

Many experts assertthat a clearly specified legal authority in place prior to the use of federal military forces in a domesticsituation could allow for a more streamlined and effective use of these forces while ensuring civilliberties and law enforcement concerns are respected. Different laws apply when employing themilitary in a tactical role as opposed to providing non-hostile technical assistance. Current laws maytend to delay or complicate military involvement in the situation which could reduce effectiveness. Another issue is that some in DoD see the use of crisis response forces in a domestic situation as notbeing a legitimate mission. They express concern about the effect such use has on the preparationof those forces to fight and win our nation's wars. Reduced force structure and shrinking budgetsalso make it difficult to focus on taskings outside of their primary mission.
