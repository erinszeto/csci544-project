A number of countries, including the U.K., France, the Netherlands, and China, have adopted a patent box. Rates generally range from 5% to 15%. Patent boxes are in some cases referred to as innovation boxes because they cover income from non-patented as well as patented intellectual property. Patent boxes can have narrow coverage (providing a lower tax rate on royalties and licenses from patents) or broadly cover income attributable to intellectual property, including that used directly by the firm in production. The purpose of a patent box is to encourage research and development, and, in some cases, to encourage the location of profits from intellectual property in the country.", "Proposals for a patent box in the United States include a draft proposal by Representatives Boustany and Neal, the Innovation Promotion Act of 2015; proposed legislation in the 112th Congress by Senator Feinstein; and a bill introduced by Representative Schwartz in the 113th Congress (H.R. 2605). The Feinstein proposal provided a 15% tax rate on income from patents developed and used for manufacture in the United States, whereas the Boustany-Neal proposal and H.R. 2605 allowed a 71% deduction of income, which produces an effective 10% rate for corporations. The Boustany-Neal draft proposal would allocate profit between the ordinary tax rate (35% for corporations) and the patent box rate, based on the share of (research and development) R&D spending in total spending.", "Current tax law contains incentives for investment in research and development. One is the option to expense certain R&D costs (deduct immediately) rather than deduct them over the life of the investment. Expensing is the equivalent of a zero effective tax rate on the return to investment. The tax code also contains a research tax credit. R&D subsidies are justified because the average company is likely to invest less in R&D than the amount warranted by the social returns from the investment. There may be disagreement over whether tax subsidies are the best method.", "The expected effectiveness of a patent box on R&D depends on its design, and particularly whether it applies to net profit, where the tax rate on the up-front deductible cost is the new, lower patent box rate, or to gross investment, where the deductible cost is still valued at the higher regular statutory rate. The Boustany-Neal draft proposal applies to net profit, which means that lower statutory rate has no effect on the incentive to invest in R&D. The effective rate is still zero under expensing regardless of the statutory tax rate, and the credit is not driven by the tax rate. Moreover, if part of the revenue cost for the lower patent box rate is offset by slower recovery of costs, the effective tax rate rises. Similarly, the R&D credit, which was recently made permanent, is more valuable in reducing effective tax rates than a lower rate applied to net profit.", "It is possible to design a patent box where the lower rate applies to gross rather than net profit. This approach would produce large subsidies for R&D that could lead to negative pre-tax returns, which might be justified depending on the size of R&D spillover effects.", "A global economy also raises a number of policy issues. To the extent that a patent box has been adopted to discourage profit shifting to low-tax foreign jurisdictions, the Boustany-Neal patent box proposal may not be very effective. For an additional dollar of profit, the rate is a weighted average of the regular 35% rate and the 10% patent box rate; estimates suggest that the rate would still be relatively high. The effect of a patent box when part of profits are already shifted to a low-rate country is an increase in effective rate domestic R&D, for a patent box that applies the rate to net income rather than gross income."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["A patent box provides a lower tax rate on income from patents.

The European patent boxes generally do not have these restrictions. Another issue is the treatment of income from existing patents and innovations.

Companies generally choose between two types of credits. One is a credit of 20% in excess of a fixed base that is unrelated to prior R&E spending and thus has a marginal effective rate of 20%. The other is a credit of 14% in excess of 50% of the past three years of research expenditures. Because additional research spending increases the base in the future, reducing future credits, the marginal effect of the credit is smaller, estimated (see Appendix ) at 7.9%. Weighting the credit by the spending on the 20% and 14% credits results in an effective credit of 11.3%.

The potential underinvestment in research arises from the spillover effects that benefit other firms. Even when products are patented, new innovations may give rise to similar products or direct competition following the expiration of the patent. For that reason, the true value to society is greater than the value earned by the firm, and more of these valuable investments would be desirable. It is also possible to overinvest in R&D if firms are engaged in a competitive race to make discoveries before other firms do and secure a larger share of the market, a phenomenon sometimes called product market rivalry or business stealing. In this case, the private return to the firm may displace the return to another participant and the social benefit will be below the private benefit. Which effect dominates is an empirical matter. ", "Empirical studies have more often found that research and development has positive spillover effects, although some studies have found negative or ambiguous effects. A 2010 review covering 20 studies found that half produced positive effects, a quarter negative effects and the remainder ambiguous effects. A more recent study explicitly attempted to deal with the two opposing forces (spillovers and product rivalry). It found the social return to be 3.5 times the private return. The majority of studies suggest a positive spillover effect. These positive spillover effects mean that firms, based on their own private return, will not invest in the optimal amount of R&D, even in the presence of patent protection.", "Evidence indicates that R&D tax subsidies in general are effective in encouraging R&D spending, although estimates of the extent of the stimulus vary substantially across studies. Patent boxes are too recent to have been the subject of more than a preliminary assessment.

A way to compare the incentive effect for investment in research and development is to examine the effective tax rate on a new investment at the margin (that is an investment that is worth making because it earns a high enough rate of return to satisfy stockholders). The effective tax rate is the share of the return that is paid in taxes. (See Appendix for data and methods of calculation.) If income is measured correctly (in that the present value of depreciation deductions for tax purposes equals the present value of economic depreciation), the effective tax rate is the statutory tax. If costs are recovered more rapidly than the rate of economic decline in value of the asset, or if credits are allowed, the rate can fall below the statutory rate, or even become negative. The effective tax rate captures the value of tax subsidies in a single measure, and the lower the tax rate, the greater the subsidy. Another way of capturing the effects of a subsidy is through a percentage change in the user cost of capital (also termed the rental price of capital), a measure that determines how much should be paid for the use of the investment if rented. The user cost of capital is the sum of the pre-tax rate of return on investment and its rate of economic depreciation.

That is, with the credit the project earns a return that is below the required after-tax return: the tax system provides a subsidy. As the effective tax rate falls, the required pre-tax return falls. As the pre-tax return is pushed lower, more projects that were not otherwise profitable would now earn a large enough return to be undertaken.", "Most investment in R&D is in intangibles (such as salaries for scientists and supplies) and subject to a zero or negative rate, but a portion reflects tangible investment A Canadian study used to compare taxation of intangibles across countries used a 7.3% share for equipment and a 6.6% share for structures.

Another way of considering the effect of these subsidies is based on the effect on the rental price (or user cost) of capital. This measure is the price of using capital, which must cover not only the required return, but the decline in the value of the asset. It is the sum of the pre-tax return and the economic depreciation rate. The effect of the 6.1% effective tax rate (as compared with a 35% rate) is the equivalent of a reduction of 10% in the cost of capital. The -57% rate reduces the cost of capital by 19.2%. Thus the research credit alone is responsible for a decrease in the cost of capital (given that expensing exists) of around 10%. ", "Note that the tax rates capture only the corporate tax on equity investment. A total tax rate that captures debt-financed investment (and its deductibility) along with taxes on shareholders and creditors would produce lower tax rates. The tax rate falls because nominal interest is deductible to the firm but largely not taxed to creditors because a significant share of assets is in tax exempt retirement funds.

An overall R&D project including depreciable equipment and structures is subject to an effective tax rate of 6.1% without the credit and a negative 57% with the credit. These numbers are unchanged by the innovation box because the effective tax rate on intangibles without the credit is zero, regardless of the tax rate applied. The credit, if retained, is not affected by the statutory rate. Thus the innovation box results in no additional incentive when investments are already expensed and is largely a windfall for preexisting innovations. ", " Table 2 also shows that the financing of an innovation box with five-year amortization of intangible expenses raises the overall effective tax rate to 11.5% without the R&D credit, and the -43.8% without the credit (a smaller negative compared to current law). In both cases, these effects raised the user cost of capital (compared to current law) by 1.5%.

To explain this effect, consider a simplified example, where an investment of $100 is made, earning a return of $110 in one year. The rate of return on this investment is 10%. If the investment is subject to economic depreciation, $100 of the $110 in the future will be deducted as a recovery of principal, and the remainder subject to tax. If the tax rate is 35%, the remaining $10 is subjected to tax, reducing the after-tax amount by $3.50. With a net of $106.50, the rate of return is 6.5%, and the effective tax rate is 35% ($3.50 is 35% of $10). If the cost is deducted when incurred, however, the firm saves $35 on its investment for a net cost of $65 and earns $71.5 ($110 times 0.65), for a return of 10%. ", "Still the result is not precisely the same as no tax at all, because the scale of the investment has been reduced. That is, the investment can now be seen as a partnership between the government (who finances 35% of the cost) and the firm (who finances 65%). The firm earns the pre-tax return on its share. Although this treatment reduces the scale of the investment, the firm could expand its R&D investment by grossing the size of the investment by dividing by one minus the tax rate (0.65), and investing $154.86 rather than $100. This change would leave a net investment of $100 and the outcome would be identical to a zero tax rate. ", "Some arguments have been made that expensing at a lower statutory tax rate is better than expensing at a higher statutory rate, i.e., that the higher statutory rate is more burdensome, for two reasons. The first is that the tax system does not allow perfect loss offset; that is a start-up firm with no other taxable income or a firm with a history of losses cannot take the deduction immediately. This delay in deduction has a smaller impact with a lower statutory tax rate. The other argument is that reducing the scale of the investment is burdensome to the firm, because there may not be other innovations that earn the same rate of return available. That is, it may not be possible to find an additional investment that could restore its net investment to $100 and still earn the same return.", "There are, however, arguments that can be made expensing at a lower statutory rate is worse than expensing at a higher statutory rate. First, much of the research in the United States is by multinational firms. If these firms are successful in artificially shifting profits abroad to tax havens with low or no tax countries so that expenses are deducted at 35% but the earnings are taxed a lower, perhaps 0% rate, then a higher statutory tax rate is better than a lower one because the amount of tax savings from the investment is larger. Much of profit shifting is associated with intangible assets, and this phenomenon may be more typical of today's larger firms that engage in most innovation than being in a loss position and affected by imperfect loss offset.", "The second issue is more fundamental to tax policy. While, from the firm's point of view, the scale of its investment is reduced, the total investment is not reduced, and it is the total size of the investment that is relevant to the social value of the investment. The investment, and all of its potential spillover effects, has nevertheless been made, although part of the investment is financed by taxpayers. In addition, to the extent that R&D tends to be more risky than other investments, the presence of taxes, while reducing the return, also reduces the variance of returns. In order for firms to get back to their original risk-return preferences, they are likely to expand the size of their R&D investments relative to other investments. This incentive is larger with higher tax rates. So from both of these perspectives, a higher statutory tax rate encourages investment in R&D in the presence of expensing.

This effect would be the case in narrow patent box proposals that apply only to royalties and licenses from patented products, where the owner does not manufacture goods or services that use the innovation. That is, when all income comes from royalties and license fees, the tax falls on gross income and expenses are deducted at the higher regular tax rate. ", "It would also be possible to design a patent/innovation box similar to the Boustany-Neal proposal where expenses are nevertheless deducted at the statutory rate. Expenses could be used to split net profit into patent box and non-patent box shares. Then the research expenses could be added back to the net patent box profit and subtracted from the non-patent box profit. Alternatively, a credit could be added equal to 25% (the difference between the regular rate of 35% and the patent box rate of 10%) of research expenses. ", "This treatment results in very generous subsidies. These subsidies can no longer be reasonably compared using effective tax rates as, in some cases, pre-tax returns become negative (investments lose money). Therefore, Table 3 compares current law with a lower rate on gross investment using changes in pre-tax returns. For intangible R&D investments it produces negative returns with the innovation box. The five-year amortization provision results in a small (almost zero) positive pre-tax return without the credit and a negative return with the credit.", "The effect on the cost of capital, which is a comparable number, is much larger. With the patent box rate applying to gross profit, the user cost of capital falls by 25% (with or without the credit).

In an international environment, the tax system can affect the location of investment as well.

A patent box may offer an alternative to locating profits in these countries. The Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) has developed a set of proposed actions to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). In addition, one of the action items on harmful tax practices addresses patent boxes and the concern that preferential tax regimes be applied to income that involves real economic activity, raising concerns among some U.S. policymakers that R&D might be relocated abroad to satisfy these requirements. ", "There are choices that could be affected by a patent box in a global economy. ", "First, the analysis above has not concerned itself with infra-marginal investments (investments that earn a return in excess of that required to break even at the margin), since such investments would be undertaken in any case. With a location choice, the rate can matter even when the patent box is applied to net investment because a lower rate does benefit infra-marginal investment by lowering the tax imposed on super-normal profits. So the net income patent box could have an effect on the location of investment because an investment expected to yield a large return would face a lower tax and encourage location in the United States. ", "Second, as noted earlier some multinational firms engage in profit shifting (artificially moving the earnings from investment to another jurisdiction) while retaining the investment in the United States. Two issues arise here. The first is the extent to which lower rates will attract profit from abroad without making any real changes. The second is how the patent box regime will affect marginal investment in the United States when profits have already been shifted to low-tax jurisdictions. ", "Evidence suggests a significant amount of shifting of profits out of the United States, which may arise in large part from an inability to enforce arms-length pricing between related parties. If a U.S. parent sells the rights to difficult-to-value intangible assets (such as drug formulas, search algorithms, and design of communication devices) to its foreign subsidiary, it is easier than with other assets to set the price too low and reduce profits in the United States. By offering a lower tax rate in the United States, more profits appropriately attributable to U.S. investments would be retained (or brought back) to the United States. ", "Design is an important issue in this case as well. Under the Boustany-Neal proposal, if an additional dollar is shifted to a U.S. firm it would be taxed not at the 10% patent/innovation box rate, but at the rate between 35% and 10% that arises from the cost allocation formula. Peter Merrill estimated that the lowest tax rate across the industries he examined was 27%.", "It is possible to design a patent box so that the marginal dollar of profit would be taxed at 10%. A way to achieve this effect is to make the patent box income equal to total profit minus an imputed return on tangible assets (and perhaps non-research intangibles, such as advertising). Since the imputed return is fixed in the absence of real changes in investment, any additional profit would be taxed at the 10% rate. This change could also be combined with treatment that would apply the rate to gross profit through the mechanisms described earlier.", "Another issue that arises with profit shifting is the incentive effect of a patent box at the margin if part of profits are already shifted abroad, perhaps to a zero-rate country. It is possible for R&D to take place in the United States but have profits allocated abroad through cost-sharing arrangements, where the firm's foreign subsidiary contributes to the cost of U.S. R&D in exchange for a share of the profits. When the transaction is the equivalent of an arms-length one, and the cost-sharing payment is equal to the present value of the expected profits, nothing in the analysis above changes. If, however, the cost-sharing payment is too small, profits are shifted abroad. ", "In this case, a patent box based on net profit is likely to discourage investment in the United States because research and development costs are now being deducted at a 10% rate rather than a 35% rate with no corresponding decrease in the tax rate on the profit that has been shifted to another jurisdiction. This penalty is offset (but only partially) because additional R&D spending also produces a benefit in that it reduces the weighted average tax rate on all profit.

To determine z, a tax life is needed. Instruments are depreciated largely under the 7-year life although small shares are estimated to be depreciated under a 5-year or a 20-year life. These methods are accelerated (larger deductions in the earlier year). The present value of depreciation, z, is estimated at 81.4 cents per dollar of investment for equipment. Structures are depreciated over 39 years at a straight line basis (equal amounts in each year) and the estimated value of depreciation is 34.2 cents per dollar of investment. Intangible assets are expensed (deducted when incurred). Research expenditures are also eligible for a research and experimentation (R&E) credit. This credit, which was a temporary provision extended a year or two at a time (and effective in place almost every year since 1981) was made permanent.

", "Estimating the Total Effective Tax Rate", "To estimate the total tax rate, the total discount rate, R T , is used in equation (1) which is a combination of the firm's equity discount rate and the interest rate on debt net of taxes: ", "(2) R T = f(i(1-u)-p)+(1-f)R ", "where f is the share of debt finance, i is the nominal interest rate, and the other variables are as described above.", "The pre-tax return is derived from that discount rate. The effective tax rate is (r-R i )/r, where r is the estimated pre-tax return and R i is the after-tax return to the suppliers of capital (stockholders and creditors).", "(3) R i = f(i(1-ati)-p)+(1-f)R(1-v)", "where a is the share of interest taxed, t is the marginal tax rate on interest, and v is the effective tax rate on dividends and capital gains for corporation stock.", "In addition to the data used above, data are needed for the rates of return (R and i), the inflation rate, the share of debt finance, and the tax rates. Note again that the effective tax rates are not very sensitive to real rates of return but are quite sensitive to the inflation rate. ", "The equity rate of return is based on historical trends and is after corporate tax but before individual tax is set at 7%, allowing a 4% dividend rate and a 3% real growth rate. (The rate of growth in real GDP from 1965 to the last year before the recession, 2007, was 3.2%.) The nominal interest rate is set at 7.5%, reflecting recent experience with the Baa bond rate prior to the recession (for a real interest rate of 5.5%). Debt is weighted at 36% and equity at 64% based on data from the Flow of Funds Accounts. The overall discount rate is close to the 5% rate used above.", "The marginal rates for interest, dividends, and capital gains, respectively, are 22%, 14.6% and 15.4%. A large fraction of interest and dividends paid do not appear on individual income tax returns, according to Tables 7.1 and 7.2 of the National Income and Product Accounts and IRS Statistics of Income. In previous years a direct reconciliation had been prepared, and the current amounts included, 19% and 25%, are slightly lower than in the past, but similar. The same share for dividends is used for capital gains. Rosenthal and Austin find a similar share (24%) using data from the Federal Reserve. The small share reported is largely due to the large share of assets in pension, retirement, and insurance plans. In addition, half of the capital gains held privately is assumed to be untaxed because it is held until death. ", "Estimating the Statutory Rate for Patent Box Income", "While the patent box proposal specifies a statutory rate for patent box income, this rate is applied to income depending on a formula, and the rate may not be precisely the statutory rate implied. This section derives the statutory tax rate that would be applied to investment in R&D under the proposal to allocate net profit based on the share of research expenditures and shows that, under reasonable assumptions, the statutory rate will be equal to the patent box rate.", "The objective of this derivation is to obtain a measure of dT/d\u220f R , where T is taxes and \u220f R is profits on investments in research, with d times any variable referring to a small change in that variable. This measure will provide the rate of tax imposed on a change in research profits.

In order to relate to spending and costs, they are expressed as the cost of an additional unit of capital, either K for ordinary capital or K R for research capital. ", "(6) x= C K K/(C K K+C KR K R ) ", "where C K is the cost of a marginal investment in K, K is the stock of ordinary capital, C KR is the cost of a marginal investment in research capital, and K R is the stock of research capital.
