As noted, in establishing and amending monuments, Congress can set the size of monument areas and regulate uses of monument lands. This report covers the 21 land-based national monuments established or expanded since 1996 in which the size exceeded 100,000 acres, which are being reviewed under President Trump's executive order. Monument proclamations provide presidential direction on management of federal lands and resources within the monument boundaries. Although proclamations vary as to the number and type of topics covered, they typically address particular uses and activities on monument lands as well as management planning. This report focuses on provisions of proclamations related to six topics that have been important in the debate on national monuments: energy, livestock grazing, use of motorized and non-motorized mechanized vehicles, timber, hunting and fishing, and tribes. The major provisions on each of these topics are summarized to provide an overview of their emphasis and variation. An analysis of the impact (if any) on changes in land management on the ground resulting from the proclamations is beyond the scope of this report. ", "This report does not reflect more general provisions of the proclamations that may bear on the six topics discussed. As examples of the more general provisions, the proclamations typically \"warn\" against destroying or removing any \"features\" of the monument and make the monument the dominant reservation of the land without revoking existing reservations or withdrawals. The proclamations also usually establish the monuments subject to valid existing rights; this report addresses valid existing rights only in the context of the energy-related activities. An examination of the provisions on the six topics in the context of these more general provisions and the entirety of the proclamations might provide additional insights on monument management. ", "The summaries of provisions on the six topics are not intended to capture all textual differences (or nuances) in the language of the proclamations. For this purpose, the verbatim text of the pertinent provisions for the 21 monuments is provided in six separate tables. Monuments are listed in the tables in alphabetical order. ", "A few caveats about the tables deserve note. First, the tables provide the text of the provisions of monument proclamations, as noted, rather than characterizations or legal interpretations of the provisions. Second, although the tables may show differences in the text of provisions on a particular topic, these textual differences may not necessarily reflect differences in meaning. Third, the tables do not reflect other authorities pertaining to monument lands, such as laws, regulations, and agency land management plans. These other authorities govern use and protection of resources on agency lands, the development of land management plans, and public and other participation in agency decisionmaking, among other topics. The authorities vary from agency to agency, with Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands generally managed for multiple uses, Fish and Wildlife Service lands managed under a dominant use mission, and National Park Service lands governed by a dual-use mission. An analysis of the monument proclamations in the context of other authorities would be necessary to determine the extent to which activities are authorized on particular lands and the role of the public, states, and tribes in decisionmaking by the four agencies.

This is typically accomplished by language to withdraw the lands within the monuments from entry, location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under public land laws, including mining laws and mineral and geothermal leasing laws. A few of the proclamations contain exceptions. For instance, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument is to remain open for oil and gas leasing and development because most of the lands have already been leased and development is occurring, according to the proclamation. However, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to issue new leases only for specified purposes. Another example is the proclamation for the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, which allows for the disposal of materials under the Materials Act of 1947. ", "In addition to the general protections for valid existing rights for land uses, the proclamations for three of the monuments\u2014Canyons of the Ancients, San Gabriel Mountains, and Upper Missouri River Breaks\u2014also specify how energy development or energy-related rights are to be managed. Although monument proclamations (at least since 1996) typically contain protections for valid existing rights, the extent to which monument designations may affect existing rights is not always clear. A common concern is that monument designation potentially could result in new constraints on development of existing mineral and energy leases, claims, and permits. Some fear that mineral exploration and extraction activities may have to adhere to a higher standard of environmental review, and may have a higher cost of mitigation, to ensure compatibility with the monument designation. ", "Several of the monument proclamations also contain provisions pertaining to facilities and/or rights-of-way, such as for pipelines, utilities, and other purposes. The extent to which such facilities or rights-of-way pertain to energy-related land uses or other activities, such as telecommunications, has not been analyzed for this report. The provisions vary across monuments. Some contain broad assertions that the proclamations are not to be construed as interfering with these structures and uses. As an example, the proclamation for the Sand to Snow National Monument states that it is not to be construed as interfering with the operation, maintenance, replacement, or modification of existing water resource, flood control, utility, pipeline, or telecommunication facilities; existing facilities may be expanded; and new facilities may be constructed\u2014to the extent consistent with the proper care and management of monument resources. Other proclamations appear more restrictive. For instance, the proclamation for the Basin and Range National Monument states that no new rights-of-way for electric transmission or transportation will be authorized in the monument except as necessary for the care and management of the protected objects or for livestock grazing. ", " Table 1 provides the energy-related provisions of the proclamations for the 21 national monuments. The table does not identify the extent to which there have been determinations of valid existing rights on monument lands or the status of any rights, such as if there is development activity under such rights or federal government efforts to buy out the rights. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Livestock Grazing", "paragraphs": ["For all but one of the 21 monuments\u2014Sand to Snow\u2014the proclamations address livestock grazing. The most common language among the proclamations provides that legal authorities governing livestock grazing on agency lands also apply to lands within the monument. The precise text on this point varies among monuments. However, the proclamation for Ironwood Forest National Monument is an example: \"Laws, regulations, and policies followed by the Bureau of Land Management in issuing and administering grazing permits or leases on all lands under its jurisdiction shall continue to apply with regard to the lands in the monument.\" Some of the provisions within proclamations make explicit that the application of livestock grazing authorities is to be consistent with the care and management of objects in the monument that were identified for protection (e.g., Berryessa Snow Mountain). ", "For a couple of monuments, the proclamations appear to authorize grazing only under existing permits and leases at the time of monument designation. However, further research or analysis, such as of other authorities governing the lands at issue, might be needed to determine if grazing could be authorized under new permits and leases. For example, the proclamation for the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument provides that \"[n]othing in this proclamation shall be deemed to affect existing permits or leases for, or levels of, livestock grazing on Federal lands within the monument; existing grazing uses shall continue to be governed by applicable laws and regulations other than this proclamation.\" This proclamation does not expressly ban future permits and leases while affirming that existing permits and leases are unaffected by the proclamation. ", "Livestock grazing is prohibited in two of the monuments analyzed. It is banned in the Hanford Reach National Monument to protect the objects identified in the proclamation. Hanford Reach is managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Energy. Lands of these agencies are not generally open to and managed for livestock grazing. Livestock grazing is also barred in the Gold Butte National Monument, where livestock grazing has not been permitted since 1998, according to the proclamation. ", "A couple of monument proclamations condition or restrict livestock grazing. For example, in the Sonoran Desert National Monument, grazing permits in a particular area of the monument cannot be renewed, and grazing in another area could continue only if the managing agency determines grazing to be compatible with the protective purposes of the monument. In another example, the Secretary of the Interior is to study the impacts of livestock grazing on biological objects in the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. Existing grazing may continue with \"appropriate terms and conditions.\" If existing permit holders and leaseholders relinquish their permits and leases, the Secretary of the Interior can reallocate the forage only under specified conditions. If grazing is determined to be incompatible with protecting the biological objects in the monument, the Secretary of the Interior is to retire the grazing allotments.

Most of the proclamations prohibit the use of motorized and non-motorized mechanized vehicles off-road except for emergency or administrative purposes. This is accomplished by either a direct prohibition against using vehicles off-road (with the specified exceptions), or by limiting the use of vehicles to designated roads and/or trails. Some of the proclamations generally limit the use of motorized vehicles to roads existing at the time of monument designation (e.g., Basin and Range, Mojave Trails, and Sand to Snow), or roads designated as open at the time of monument designation (Gold Butte). ", "Many of the proclamations call for development of transportation or management plans to address motorized and non-motorized mechanized use of vehicles. Some of them require planning to designate roads and trails where motorized and/or non-motorized mechanized vehicles are allowed (e.g., Basin and Range, Bears Ears, Mojave Trails). Several proclamations require plans to address actions, including road closures or travel restrictions, necessary to protect objects in the monuments (e.g., Canyons of the Ancients, Carrizo Plain, Cascade-Siskiyou, Craters of the Moon, Ironwood Forest, San Gabriel Mountains, Sonoran Desert, Upper Missouri River Breaks, and Vermilion Cliffs). ", "A few proclamations authorize the Secretary to allow off-road areas to be open to motorized use, such as in the Cascade-Siskiyou expansion area (for snowmobiles and non-motorized mechanized use) and San Gabriel Mountains (for off-highway vehicle areas existing on the date of the proclamation). In contrast, a few of the proclamations direct or authorize certain areas to be closed, as for the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument (for a particular road) and the Giant Sequoia National Monument (for trails after a specified date, prior to issuance of the management plan).

Nine of the 14 proclamations also include language regarding protection of Indian sites and access to sites by members of Indian tribes for traditional cultural and customary uses, consistent with relevant authorities. The text of these protection provisions differs in a number of ways. For example, eight of the nine proclamations require protection by the relevant Secretary in consultation with Indian tribes, whereas the proclamation for the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument provides for the management plan to protect sites.
