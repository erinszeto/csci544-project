It is alsoa major producing and transit point for methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs. (4) Agency experts agree thatMexico's share of illicit traffic in the various areas has remained high over the years, although thereare some variations in the estimates. The methodology for making the estimates (whether derivedfrom seizures or some other means) is not regarded as entirely adequate, and the estimates may beaffected by changing trafficking patterns and demand as much as enforcement efforts.

The INCSR covering 2002 stated that\"approximately 65 percent of cocaine reaching the United States passes through Mexico and watersoff the Pacific and Gulf coasts, \" and the INCSR covering 2001 stated that Mexico was the transitpoint for \"more than one half of the cocaine sold in the United States.\" ", "With respect to heroin, the INCSR report covering 2003 states that Mexico produces less thanfive percent of the world's opium poppy, but because of the geographical proximity to the UnitedStates it is \"the supplier of some 30 to 40 percent of the U.S. heroin market -- especially in stateswest of the Mississippi.\" This appears to be a slightly higher estimate than in the past. The INCSRreport covering 2002 stated simply that geographical proximity to the United States \"allowscultivators and processors [in Mexico] to supply a disproportionately large share of the U.S. heroinmarket.\" A U.S. Customs official stated, in March 2001 hearings, that 14% of the heroin seized inthe United States comes from Mexico, while an independent study indicated that Mexico is thesource of 29% of the heroin used in the United States.

Mexico continues to be a majormoney-laundering center, in which trafficking organizations exploit Mexican banks and financialinstitutions to transfer significant amounts of illicitly obtained currency through the global financialsystem. Favored money laundering methods include the smuggling of U.S. currency into Mexicoand the movement of the funds back into the United States via couriers, wire transfers, and armoredvehicles.", "In short, Mexico's share of illicit traffic has remained high over the years, and seemed toincrease in 2003 in major areas, especially in the supply of cocaine and heroin to the U.S. market.

Despite this stance, Mexicancourts continued to be reluctant to approve extradition of Mexican nationals, even whenrecommended by the Mexican Foreign Ministry, and they freed several alleged drug traffickers afterraising questions about the constitutionality and appropriateness of extraditions, especially wherecapital punishment or life sentences might be applied. ", "In January 2001, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Mexican citizens may be extraditedto the United States for prosecution on drug charges provided that they are sentenced under Mexicanguidelines. This seemed to clear one legal hurdle, but the INCSR report in 2001 noted that adverselower court decisions on other issues, particularly the question of life imprisonment and capitalpunishment, continued to impede the extradition process. (10) In October 2001, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that lifeimprisonment is unconstitutional in Mexico and a bar to extradition for fugitives facing that penaltyin another country, although extradition may take place if the requesting country provides assurancesthat this penalty will not be imposed. The INCSR report in 2002 characterized this decision as asignificant setback, with the potential to frustrate the extradition of the most serious criminals. Italso expressed concern about overly technical legalistic analysis of extradition requests. (11) ", "The INCSR report in 2004 noted that the two governments were working hard to narrow the impactof the October 2001 decision and to eliminate the backlog of extradition requests, and that theForeign Ministry was asserting its prerogative to judge the adequacy of U.S. assurances.

The MexicanSenate in December 2000 approved a protocol to the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty, alreadyapproved by the U.S. Senate, that would permit the temporary surrender for trial of fugitives whoare serving sentences in one country but are also wanted on criminal charges in the other country. Following the meeting of Presidents Bush and Fox in Mexico in mid-February 2001, officialsworked to implement this temporary surrender protocol, and the protocol entered into force in May2001. According to the INCSR covering 2003, Mexican authorities have reported legal difficultiesin implementing the Protocol.", "Anti-Corruption Efforts. As the first presidentto be elected from an opposition party in 71 years, President Fox has promised to strengthendemocracy and the rule of law in Mexico, and to fight corruption and crime. He has proposed theprofessionalization of the police under a new Public Security Ministry to deal with widespread publicconcerns with security and police corruption. As part of those efforts his Administration hasreorganized the Attorney General's office (PGR), reformed the Federal Judicial Police (PJF), andcreated a new Federal Investigative Agency (AFI) patterned after the FBI to some extent.

After that, a large number of the prison officials in the state of Jalisco were questionedand charged, and many customs officials and anti-drug agents in the state of Chihuahua wereremoved from office. In early November 2002, President Fox presented a tougher, morecomprehensive, six-year National Drug Control Plan, which recognized Mexico's growing drugproblem and the need for greater cooperation among agencies, while noting Mexican successesagainst major drug traffickers. At a broader level, President Fox has ordered the Secretariat of PublicAdministration (SFP) to aggressively attack official corruption.

These provisions would modify the drug certification process for three years,require designation of the countries subject to sanctions only, and encourage development of amultilateral strategy. Lacking congressional action on S. 219 or S. 1401 ,the drug certification requirements were temporarily modified in late 2001 by enactment of theForeign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2002 ( H.R. 2506 / P.L. 107-115 ). Thismeasure waived the drug certification requirements for FY2002 and required the President todesignate only countries that had demonstrably failed to meet international counter-narcoticsobligations. (16) ", "During the Bush-Fox meeting in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002, the Presidentsacknowledged \"major successes achieved by Mexico in the fight against narco-trafficking\" andagreed on \"the importance of redoubling judicial cooperation\" between the countries. The March2002 INSCR report on Mexico noted that the two countries cooperated in a range of bilateralcounter-narcotics and law enforcement fora, including the Legal Working Group of the BinationalCommission, and the Senior Law Enforcement Plenary Group. It emphasized that the climate ofcooperation within the bilateral law enforcement and military communities had improveddramatically in recent years, stating that \"For the first time in recent memory, both sides are sharingsensitive information on counternarcotics issues.\" The report mentioned bilateral air-to-aircommunications on interdiction operations, joint post-seizure analysis of maritime operations, andbilateral military intelligence sharing. It noted that U.S.-sponsored law enforcement training tripledin 2001, and that military-to-military contacts increased, with ion scanner and night vision goggletraining being especially useful in Mexico's drug interdiction efforts. Among the joint operationsthat might be cited to exemplify the close cooperation between the countries is Operation Marquis,which culminated in June 2001 with the arrest of about 80 individuals in the United States andMexico. (17) ", "In this cooperative bilateral environment, in September 2002, the Congress and Presidentenacted the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003 ( H.R. 1646 / P.L. 107-228 )that, in Section 706, made permanent a requirement that the President designate in mid-Septemberof each year, before the beginning of the fiscal year, the countries which have demonstrably failedto meet international counter-narcotics obligations, thereby removing an irritant in the bilateralrelationship.", "According to the INCSR covering 2002 and 2003, the cooperation between the countries hascontinued along the same trajectory. Both reports state that \"the United States and Mexico achievedunprecedented levels of cooperation in fighting drug trafficking and other transnational crimes.\" Thereport covering 2003 went on to say that \"U.S. and Mexican law enforcement personnel routinelyshare sensitive information to aid in the capture and prosecution of drug traffickers and the seizureof cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine shipments.\" (18) The reports mentionedthe continuing dialogue between officials of the countries through the annual BinationalCommission meetings, the twice yearly Senior Law Enforcement Plenary (SLEP) meetings, and theBilateral Interdiction Working Group (BIWG) meetings, with each forum having various sub-groupsworking on relevant issues. ", "The reports mentioned the continuing professionalization of the law enforcement and militaryinstitutions, and indicated the prominent role of the United States in these efforts. In 2003, theUnited States sponsored over 140 training courses for 6,484 Mexican police officers, prosecutorsand investigators. In 2002, it provided computer equipment and software to the Office of theAttorney General (PGR) and the Federal Investigative Agency (AFI) and the National Center forAnalysis, Planning and Intelligence (CENAPI). During FY2002, over 200 Mexican militarymembers received U.S.-sponsored military training, and Mexican liaison officers participated onsome U.S. vessels and task forces. In activities with counter-narcotics and counter-terrorismimplications, U.S. and Mexican officials are installing Non-Intrusive Inspection Equipment (NIIE)at border crossing points, establishing Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS) to reviewcommercial airline passenger lists, training to rescue migrants stranded in remote desert regions, anddeploying software to plan for infrastructure and staffing needs at ports of entry.", "In the end, the results of United States and Mexican efforts are mixed. Despite theunprecedented levels of cooperation between the United States and Mexico and the major Mexicanstrides against the leading drug trafficking organizations, Mexico continues to be the principal transitcountry for South American cocaine entering the United States, the leading foreign source ofmarijuana, and a principal source of heroin. Despite impressive eradication efforts, the estimatedproduction in Mexico of opium poppy gum and marijuana increased significantly in the last year forwhich reporting is complete.
