Research has found that most abducted children murdered by their kidnappers are killed within three hours of the abduction. Prompt response to child abductions is therefore deemed critical by many. Amber Alert plans are voluntary partnerships including law enforcement agencies, highway departments, and companies that support emergency alerts. Technologies used for alerts include the Emergency Alert System (EAS), highway message boards, telephone alert systems, the Internet, text messaging, and e-mail. All 50 states have statewide Amber Alert programs.", "Because kidnappers can cross state lines with their victims, the Department of Justice will often be involved in responding to an abduction. For this and other reasons, there is increased federal involvement in and support of Amber Alert plans. The National Center for Missing Adults is another example of an alert program that receives support from the U.S. Department of Justice.", "Amber Alert and related technologies are in place for other at-risk programs as well. For example, a number of states have created Silver Alert programs to assist in locating missing adults with cognitive impairments.", "Government, non-profit, and volunteer programs use alert technologies as tools to meet their larger goals. Participants choose among the tools available to them. From the perspective of technology policy, more thought might be given by the various program managers, and policy-makers in general, as to how to ensure that the development paths of these technologies mesh. Ideally program alerts should be interoperable \u2013 able to exchange information seamlessly across different systems. Planning for state and national emergency alert systems might provide gateways that would ensure access for alerts from all certified programs. Among the new systems being developed, with federal support, that could provide such gateways are the Commercial Mobile Alert System, for cell phone alerts, and new networks using Internet protocols to support 911 call center and other non-commercial communications needs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Amber Alerts Work", "paragraphs": ["Amber Alerts (also referred to as AMBER ) use technology to disseminate information about child abductions in a timely manner. Typically an Amber Alert is triggered for children under 18 who are believed by law enforcement officers to have been abducted (except in cases of parental abduction). Research has found that most abducted children murdered by their kidnappers are killed within three hours of the abduction. Prompt response to child abductions is therefore deemed critical by many. Law enforcement officers are encouraged to send out an alert if circumstances indicate that the child is in harm's way, if they have sufficient descriptive information about the child and/or the abductor for an alert, and if they believe that the immediate broadcast of an alert will help. When there is information about a vehicle used in an abduction, this information will usually be transmitted to highway message boards, if that technology is in place. While each plan sets its own parameters, most follow guidelines set by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).", "A typical Amber Alert would include an Emergency Alert System (EAS) broadcast, alerts on highway message boards, and notifications to public service partners such as police, highway patrols and the field crews of public utilities. A number of counties and cities have Amber Alert programs that notify local residents using e-mail or telephone alert systems to aid in the recovery of abducted children. Alerts can also be sent by text messages to cell phones and other wireless devices. AT&T Mobility, Sprint Nextel, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile are among the wireless service providers that participate in the Amber Alert network; subscribers can sign up for free text messages. These systems have the advantage of targeting selected audiences by function or geographical location but may not be received in a timely manner; telephone alert systems, for example, can be blocked by call-screening technologies.", "Amber Alert technology and alerting techniques are also used for other missing person notifications. A number of local or faith-based organizations maintain services to assist in locating missing adults. Some states participate in a consortium that operates an Amber Alert Web Portal using Internet technology. Information about an Amber Alert is sent to a web portal and reconfigured for different types of broadcasting, including cell phones, pagers, e-mail, highway signs, TV news websites, and emergency communications centers. The technology allows police officers to transmit details and photos through encrypted computer systems in patrol cars. Information, therefore, is disseminated both more quickly and more widely, maximizing the opportunity to find a missing child in the critical first three hours. The alert system is managed from a dedicated web portal that can be accessed by statewide or local systems. The software recognizes the reported locations of abductions and sends emergency messages to targeted areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emergency Alert System (EAS)", "paragraphs": ["The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is jointly administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in cooperation with the National Weather Service (NWS), an organization within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The EAS sends emergency messages with the cooperation of broadcast radio and television and most cable television stations. Its most common use is for weather alerts. EAS technology is also used in the Amber Alert programs administered in some states and communities. To facilitate transmittal, EAS messages are classified by types of events, which are coded. These event codes speed the recognition and retransmittal process at broadcast stations. For example, a tornado warning is TOR, evacuation immediate is EVI, a civil emergency message is CEM. When a message is received at the broadcast station, it can be relayed to the public either as a program interruption or, for television, a \"crawl\" at the bottom of the TV screen. In the early stages of Amber Alert program development the CEM (civil emergency) event code was used for EAS messages. In February 2002, the FCC added several new event and location codes for broadcast and cable stations to use; included was a Child Abduction Emergency (CAE) event code. Although broadcaster participation is mandatory for national alerts, the participation of broadcast and cable stations in state and local emergency announcements is voluntary.

The Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, NCMEC, broadcasters, and law enforcement officers collaborate on national strategies for the Amber Alert program.

One of the new alert technologies that will use the gateway is the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS). The regulations for CMAS were established by the FCC through its rule-making process. In addition to message formats and other standards, regulations require three alert categories that must be carried by participating carriers: presidential, imminent threat, and Amber Alerts.", "Another investment in emergency communications infrastructure that will likely benefit Amber Alerts and similar programs is for the transition to Internet protocols in 911 call centers and networks.

The next version of the plan, due in 2010, is expected to expand the planning process to include 911 systems, alert programs, and other communications tools that are needed in responding to large-scale emergencies. The NECP is widely viewed as the capstone of coordinated planning for emergency communications between and among agencies at all levels of government. The scope of the plan, however, may not be wide enough to include the type of technology-policy decisions that would ensure that all facets of emergency communications are developed in concert. Such a step is widely considered to be essential to an effective response capacity for crises big or small, personal or global, that would endeavor to protect everyone with equal zeal and efficiency.
