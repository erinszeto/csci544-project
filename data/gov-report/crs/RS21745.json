The historic debate centered on whether to award leadership to a qualified, pious individual who would follow the customs of the Prophet or to transmit leadership exclusively through the Prophet's bloodline. The question was settled initially when community leaders elected a companion of the Prophet's named Abu Bakr to become the first c aliph (Arabic for \"successor\"). Although most Muslims accepted this decision, some supported the candidacy of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, husband of the Prophet's daughter Fatima. Ali had played a prominent role during the Prophet's lifetime, but he lacked seniority within the Arabian tribal system and was bypassed.", "This situation was unacceptable to some of Ali's followers, who considered Abu Bakr and the two succeeding caliphs (Umar and Uthman) to be illegitimate. Ali's followers believed that the Prophet Muhammad himself had named Ali as successor and that the status quo was a violation of divine order. A few of Ali's partisans orchestrated the murder of the third caliph Uthman in 656 AD, and Ali was named caliph. Ali, in turn, was assassinated in 661 AD, and his son Hussein (680 AD) died in battle against forces of the Sunni caliph. Ali's eldest son Hassan (d. 670 AD) is also revered by Shiite Muslims, some of who claim he was poisoned by the Sunni caliph Muawiyah. ", "Those who supported Ali's ascendancy became later known as \"Shi'a,\" a word stemming from the term \" shi ' at Ali,\" meaning \"supporters\" or \"helpers of Ali.\" Others respected and accepted the legitimacy of his caliphate but opposed political succession based on bloodline to the Prophet. This group, who constituted the majority of Muslims, came to be known in time as \"Sunni,\" meaning \"followers of [the Prophet's] customs [ sunna ].\"", "The caliphate declined as a religious and political institution after the 13 th century, although the term \"caliph\" continued to be used by some Muslim leaders until it was abolished in 1924 by Turkey's first President Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The decline and abolition of the caliphate became a powerful religious and political symbol to some Sunni Islamist activists during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. These activists argued that leaders in the Islamic world had undermined the caliphate by abandoning the \"true path\" of Islam. Inspired by these figures, some contemporary Sunni Islamist extremists, such as Osama bin Laden and others, advocate the restoration of a new caliphate based on \"pure\" Islamic principles. The religious, ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic diversity that exists within the global Muslim community presents significant challenges to the reemergence of centralized, pan-sectarian, and widely recognized Islamic religious leadership."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Terrorism", "paragraphs": ["Islamic theology and sectarian considerations are rarely sufficient explanations for instances of terrorism and political violence involving Muslims or taking place in the contemporary Muslim world. Political, social, and economic factors often determine whether a given dispute reflects sectarian identities or transcends them. The use of violence by members of a given religious sect may be motivated by secular political goals or individual factors. Sunni and Shiite organizations and governments often collaborate when they perceive that their interests overlap. In other instances, theological differences can directly fuel sectarian hatred and violence and undermine calls for cross-sectarian cooperation. Members and supporters of terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and its affiliates exhibit regional and theological diversity that makes it difficult to identify universally shared motives that can be linked to specific religious doctrines. However, many Sunni and Shiite Muslims refer to members and supporters of Al Qaeda and similar groups simply as takfiris (Arabic for \"those who accuse others of apostasy\") because of Al Qaeda supporters' habit of denouncing Muslim and non-Muslim individuals who don't accept their narrow interpretation of Sunni Islam as non-believers and legitimate targets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Core Beliefs and Shared Practices", "paragraphs": ["Although there are considerable differences between Sunni and Shiite Islam, the two Islamic sects share common traditions, beliefs, and doctrines.

The concepts of piety, striving for goodness, and social justice are fundamental to Islamic belief and practice.

The primary function of learned religious leaders in the Islamic faith is the interpretation of Islamic law ( shari ' a ). There are no codified laws in either Sunni or Shiite Islam. Rather, there are sources for the interpretation of law outlined above, and these sources are similar among Shiites and Sunnis.

In theory, Sunnis believe that the leader ( imam ) of the Muslim community should be selected on the basis of communal consensus, on the existing political order, and on a leader's individual merits. This premise has been inconsistently practiced within the Sunni Muslim community throughout history. Sunni Muslims do not bestow upon human beings the exalted status given only to prophets in the Quran, in contrast to the Shiite veneration of imams. Sunnis have a less elaborate and arguably less powerful religious hierarchy than Shiites. In contrast to Shiites, Sunni religious teachers historically have been under state control. At the same time, Sunni Islam tends to be more flexible in allowing lay persons to serve as prayer leaders and preachers.

The world's Salafist movements hold a range of positions on political, social, and theological questions and include both politically quietist and violent extremist groups. ", "The terms \"Wahhabism\" and \"Wahhabi\" are often applied to groups and individuals who espouse a particular brand of Salafist thought commonly associated with the religious establishment of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its original context, \"Wahhabism\" refers to a movement founded in Arabia by the scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab (1703-1791 AD) as an offshoot of the Hanbali school of Islamic legal interpretation. Abd al Wahhab encouraged a return to the orthodox practice of the \"fundamentals\" of Islam, as embodied in the Quran and in the life of the Prophet Muhammad. In the 18 th century, Muhammad ibn Saud, founder of the modern-day Saudi dynasty, formed an alliance with Abd al Wahhab and unified the disparate tribes in the Arabian Peninsula. From that point forward, there has been a close relationship between the Saudi ruling family and the local Wahhabi religious establishment. The most conservative interpretations of Wahhabist Sunni Islam view Shiites and other non-Wahhabi Muslims as dissident heretics. ", "Following the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Shiite Islamic revolution in Iran, Saudi Arabia's ruling Sunni royal family began allowing their clerics and citizens to more actively promote Saudi religious doctrine abroad, and Saudi individuals and organizations since have financed the construction of mosques, religious schools, and Islamic centers in dozens of countries. The content of Saudi-funded religious programs ranges from apolitical to activist depending on its sources and sponsors within the kingdom. However, in host societies many observers refer to Saudi funded or supported religious centers and clerics as \"Wahhabi.\" Similarly, although significant differences may exist between the religious views and actions of Saudi Arabia's domestic religious establishment and those of specific Salafists active outside of the kingdom, non-Saudi Salafis frequently are identified as \"Wahhabi\" by other Muslims and non-Muslims who perceive them to be ideologically similar to their Saudi counterparts or believe that they receive financial support from Saudi Arabia or other Sunni Gulf states."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Shiite Islam: Development and Basic Tenets", "paragraphs": ["Initially, the Shiite movement gained a wide following in areas that now include Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and parts of Central and South Asia.

Each imam chose a successor and, according to Shiite beliefs, he passed down a type of spiritual knowledge to the next leader. Imams served as both spiritual and political leaders. But as Shiites increasingly lost their political battles with Sunni Muslim rulers, imams focused on developing a spirituality that would serve as the core of Shiite religious practices and beliefs. Shiites believe that when the line of imams descended from Ali ended, religious leaders, known as mujtahid s, gained the right to interpret religious, mystical, and legal knowledge to the broader community.
