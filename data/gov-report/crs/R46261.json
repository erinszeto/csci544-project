It is FDA's intention that this expansion will help the country meet the increasing and substantial demand for testing generated by community spread of the disease and expanded clinical testing guidelines issued by the CDC.

This second type of test\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as a laboratory-developed test, or an LDT\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the more commonly used type of test because of its flexibility and differing federal regulatory requirements, among other reasons. Although the CDC's test is being manufactured as a test kit and initially has been distributed to specific CDC-qualified labs, the FDA guidance targets LDTs that are generally carried out in clinical and academic settings or private commercial laboratories. All clinical laboratories in the United States, regardless of whether they are part of the country's public health infrastructure or part of the health care delivery system, are regulated by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) program, administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). ", "Federal agencies involved in the regulation of IVDs include FDA and CMS. FDA derives its authority to regulate the sale and distribution of medical devices, such as IVDs, from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). CMS's authority to regulate IVDs is through CLIA ( P.L. 100-578 ).

As with other medical devices, the application of FDA regulatory requirements to IVDs depends on the IVD's risk classification according to its intended use. Classification is based, in turn, on the risk the device poses to the patient. For IVDs, which are informational tests, the risk to the patient is that of an incorrect test result, either a false positive or a false negative result, either of which may cause serious harm to the individual. In the case of infectious diseases\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0094the risk of a false negative test extends beyond the individual patient into the community at large. The FDA has three classes of medical device: Class I (low risk), Class II (moderate risk), and Class III (high risk). Regulatory controls are dependent on the class of a given medical device. COVID-19 diagnostics would most likely fall in Class III, as they would be considered to be high-risk devices.

However, the FDA traditionally exercised enforcement discretion over LDTs\u00e2\u0080\u0094choosing not to enforce applicable statutory and regulatory requirements with respect to such tests\u00e2\u0080\u0094meaning that most of these tests have neither undergone premarket review nor received FDA clearance or approval for marketing. To date, FDA has instead focused its enforcement efforts on commercial IVD kits, which are broadly commercially marketed. In recent years, despite the absence of specific agency guidance on the regulation of LDTs, FDA has nevertheless begun to assert authority over LDTs, and specifically over some direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests, that it considers to be higher-risk tests."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is CLIA and How Is It Involved in LDT Regulation?", "paragraphs": ["CLIA of 1988 provides CMS with authority to regulate clinical laboratories. CLIA establishes quality standards for clinical laboratory testing and a certification program for clinical laboratories that perform testing using IVD devices. All laboratories that perform diagnostic testing for health-related reasons (i.e., with results returned to the patient or a health care practitioner) are regulated by CMS under the authority of CLIA. For CLIA to apply, testing must be carried out on a human specimen. CLIA certification is based on the level of complexity of testing that the laboratory performs, specifically (1) low (therefore, waived) complexity, (2) moderate complexity, and (3) high complexity. FDA is responsible for categorizing tests according to their level of complexity. CLIA requirements are used to evaluate a test's analytical validity , defined as the ability of a test to detect or measure the analyte it is intended to detect or measure. Laboratories that perform moderate- and high-complexity testing must meet specific standards and requirements as a condition of certification, including proficiency testing (PT), patient test management, quality control, personnel qualifications, and quality assurance.

This declaration facilitates access to not-yet-approved medical products in an expedited manner during certain emergency situations. In the case of the COVID-19 disease, HHS Secretary Azar determined that \"there is a public health emergency and [declared] that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the novel coronavirus.\" On the basis of this declaration, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization authorizing the emergency use of the CDC-developed diagnostic test for COVID-19. The FDA also issued an EUA to the state of New York for an LDT developed by the state public health labs. To date, these are the only two EUAs for coronavirus diagnostics that the FDA has issued.

As noted above, FDA generally waives most regulatory requirements (e.g., premarket review) for LDTs in normal situations; nevertheless, LDTs may only be used with authorization (e.g., an EUA) during an emergency declaration pursuant to FFDCA Section 564. That is, statutory requirements under FFDCA Section 564 apply to LDTs as they do to other medical products, and they apply to both commercial test kits\u00e2\u0080\u0094which are normally subject to FDA regulatory requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to LDTs. ", "The EUA process is usually used to expedite access to medical products that would otherwise need premarket approval or clearance in emergency situations. However, because premarket approval requirements for LDTs are generally waived through enforcement discretion by the agency, the EUA represents additional regulatory requirements for the use of an LDT in emergency situations. This is because, among other things, in the case of a communicable disease, the test result has implications beyond the individual being tested, and so a false negative result could have serious consequences for the community. Therefore, FDA states that these tests need an EUA in an emergency prior to clinical use as do other medical products. In contrast, for commercial test kits, the EUA represents an abbreviated mechanism that allows the unapproved product to be used without undergoing the FDA premarket review typically required (for a complex molecular test for a novel pathogen, that review would generally be a Premarket Approval, or PMA, for high-risk medical devices).", "Despite a request from the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) to FDA, the agency declined to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs that detect SARC-CoV-2 and diagnose COVID-19 and the requirement that they receive an EUA prior to use. APHL maintains that these labs are regulated by CLIA, and that this regulatory oversight is sufficient. However, on February 29, 2020, FDA announced a new policy allowing certain laboratories that have developed and validated COVID-19 LDTs to begin to use the test clinically prior to it receiving an EUA from the agency but after validation of the test and notification of the agency (see \" What Steps Did FDA Take to Expand Testing Capacity in Response to the Problems with CDC's Test? \")."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Does the CDC's COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Work?", "paragraphs": ["The diagnostic test developed by the CDC, called the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel, is a complex molecular diagnostic test that relies on generally standard molecular biology laboratory techniques.

Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u00e2\u0080\u0094the virus that causes COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0094is an RNA virus, the RNA must be first reverse transcribed to generate copy DNA, or cDNA, which is then amplified (multiple copies are generated) using PCR.
