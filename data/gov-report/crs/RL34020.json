However, some webcasters may also have the option of paying different royalty fees that are privately negotiated with SoundExchange, the entity that collects performance royalties on behalf of sound recording copyright owners and recording artists.", "On March 9, 2007, the CRB announced statutory royalty rates for certain digital transmissions of sound recordings by webcasters for the royalty period January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2010. Several webcasters appealed the CRB's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appellants argued that the rates were unreasonably high and that the absence of a cap on minimum fees paid per licensee was arbitrary and capricious. On July 10, 2009, the federal court of appeals issued a decision that upheld nearly all aspects of the CRB's determination of rates.", "Two recent laws, the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008 (WSA of 2008; P.L. 110-435) and the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009 (WSA of 2009; P.L. 111-36), facilitated the ability of webcasters to enter into voluntary agreements with SoundExchange that provide alternative royalty rates that substitute for the statutory rates established under the CRB's decision. These agreements generally permit a webcaster to pay lower rates and may cover a longer royalty period. Pursuant to the WSA of 2008 and 2009, voluntarily negotiated royalty agreements were reached between SoundExchange and the following entities: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (for the online streaming of public radio stations); the National Association of Broadcasters (for online simulcasts by FM and AM radio stations); a group of \"small\" webcasters; certain \"pureplay\" commercial webcasters (those that derive nearly all of their revenue from the streaming of sound recordings) such as Pandora, Live365.com, and AccuRadio; noncommercial educational webcasters (college-affiliated Internet radio stations); noncommercial religious broadcasters (that stream their AM/FM programming over the Internet); and Sirius XM (concerning Internet streaming of Sirius programming as opposed to its satellite-transmitted programming).", "Although the above settlements cover the same royalty period as the CRB's determination (from 2006 through 2010), some rate agreements extend beyond that period, until the end of 2015. Thus, webcasters that are parties to extended agreements need not participate in the CRB proceedings to determine statutory royalty rates for the period 2011 to 2015, which were initiated in January 2009. Any webcaster that chooses not to opt-in to a settlement agreement with SoundExchange must instead comply with the applicable statutory rates and terms established by the CRB for the period 2006-2010, and will be subject to any new rates that the CRB determines for 2011-2015.", "This report surveys the legislative history of this issue, the CRB's rate decision, and the congressional and public response."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Licenses", "paragraphs": ["Among the creative works that U.S. copyright law protects are sound recordings, which the Copyright Act defines as \"works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds.\" Owners of copyrighted sound recordings have exclusive rights to reproduce, adapt, or distribute their works, or to perform them publicly by digital means. Normally, anyone who wants to exercise any of the copyright owner's exclusive rights must obtain the copyright owner's permission to do so, typically by direct negotiations between copyright owners and users. However, the copyright law also provides several types of statutory, or compulsory, licenses for sound recordings. These licenses allow third parties who pay statutorily prescribed fees to use copyrighted sound recordings under certain conditions and according to specific requirements, without having to negotiate private licensing agreements.", "In 1998, in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Congress amended several statutory licensing statutes to provide for and clarify the treatment of different types of Internet broadcasting, or \"webcasting.\" Some transmissions of sound recordings are exempt from the public performance right, for example, a nonsubscription broadcast transmission; a retransmission of a radio station's broadcast within 150 miles of its transmitter; and a transmission to a business establishment for use in the ordinary course of its business. In contrast, a digital transmission by an \"interactive service\" is not exempt from the public performance right, nor does it qualify for a statutory license. The owner of an interactive service\u2014one that enables a member of the public to request or customize the music that he or she receives \u2014must negotiate a license, including royalty rates, directly with copyright owners.", "But, two categories of webcasting that do qualify for a compulsory license are specified \"preexisting\" subscription services (existing at the time of the DMCA's enactment) and \"an eligible nonsubscription transmission.\" A subscription service is one that is limited to paying customers.

A Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) issued a recommendation for the initial statutory royalty rate for eligible nonsubscription webcasters on February 20, 2002. Small-scale webcasters objected to the proposed rates. In accordance with then-existing procedures, the Librarian of Congress, on the recommendation of the U.S. Copyright Office, rejected the CARP's recommendation and revised rates downward. Congress interceded as well with enactment of the Small Webcasters Settlement Act (SWSA) of 2002, P.L. 107-321 . Although very complex, the law permitted more options than the royalty rates established by the Librarian's order. Qualifying small webcasters, for example, could elect to pay royalties based on a percentage of revenue or expenses rather than on a per-song per-listener basis. The rate agreement made pursuant to SWSA was published in the Federal Register but not codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. However, by SWSA's own terms, its provisions were not to be considered in subsequent ratemaking proceedings.", "Subsequent to passage of the SWSA and the initial ratemaking proceeding, Congress substantially revised the underlying adjudicative process. Enactment of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, P.L. 108-419 , abolished the CARP system and substituted a Copyright Royalty Board composed of three standing Copyright Royalty Judges. Rates established pursuant to the original ratemaking determination and SWSA were to remain in effect through 2005.

Explaining its interpretation of the governing language, the CRB wrote the following:", "Webcaster I clarified the relationship of the statutory factors to the willing buyer/willing seller standard. The standard requires a determination of the rates that a willing buyer and willing seller would agree upon in the marketplace. In making this determination, the two factors in section 114(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) must be considered, but neither factor defines the standard. They do not constitute additional standards, nor should they be used to adjust the rates determined by the willing buyer/willing seller standard. The statutory factors are merely to be considered, along with other relevant factors, to determine the rates under the willing buyer/willing seller standard.", "The board considered the proposals of representatives for \"small\" webcasters that rates be structured as a percentage of revenue, but ultimately rejected them:", "In short, among the parties on both sides who have proposed rates covering Commercial Webcasters, only Small Commercial Webcasters propose a fee structure based solely on revenue. However, in making their proposal, this group of five webcasters clearly is unconcerned with the actual structure of the fee, except to the extent that a revenue-based fee structure\u2014especially one in which the percent of revenue fee is a single digit number (i.e., 5%)\u2014can protect them against the possibility that their costs would ever exceed their revenues.... Small Commercial Webcasters' focus on the amount of the fee, rather than how it should be structured, is further underlined by the absence of evidence submitted by this group to identify a basis for applying a pure revenue-based structure to them. While, at times, they suggest that their situation as small commercial webcasters requires this type of structure, there is no evidence in the record about how the Copyright Royalty Judges would delineate between small webcasters and large webcasters.", "And, in a substantive footnote, the board expressed its view that it lacks statutory authority to carve out royalty rate niches for the emergent business models promoted by small commercial webcasters:", "It must be emphasized that, in reaching a determination, the Copyright Royalty Judges cannot guarantee a profitable business to every market entrant. Indeed, the normal free market processes typically weed out those entities that have poor business models or are inefficient. To allow inefficient market participants to continue to use as much music as they want and for as long a time period as they want without compensating copyright owners on the same basis as more efficient market participants trivializes the property rights of copyright owners. Furthermore, it would involve the Copyright Royalty Judges in making a policy decision rather than applying the willing buyer/willing seller standard of the Copyright Act.", "In setting the rates, the board looked to proposed \"benchmark\" agreements to determine what a hypothetical buyer and seller would agree to in the marketplace. It rejected the proposals advanced by the radio broadcasters and small commercial webcasters that the appropriate benchmark was the fee paid to performing rights organizations (PROs), such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC, for the digital public performance of the underlying musical composition. It also rejected a proposal that analog over-the-air broadcast music radio be used as a benchmark, with reference to musical composition royalties paid by such broadcasters to the PROs. Based on the evidence before it, the Copyright Royalty Board found that the most appropriate benchmark agreements are those in the market for interactive webcasting covering the digital performance of sound recordings, with appropriate adjustments.", "In summary, the Copyright Royalty Board's decision, like that of its predecessor, the CARP, declines to delineate a separate class or to integrate a separate market analysis on behalf of \"small\" webcasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reactions and Responses to the CRB Decision", "paragraphs": ["The expiration of the option to pay a percentage of revenues, to be replaced by a minimum payment, per-song per-listener formula, was, predictably, not well received in the small webcasting business community, among others.

In response to a request from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property, SoundExchange offered in May 2007 to extend the terms of the Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002, with some modifications, to certain qualified small webcasters through 2010. \"Small\" webcasters, those with annual revenues of less than $1.25 million, could pay royalties based on a percentage of revenue model, that is, fees of 10% of all gross revenue up to $250,000, and 12% for gross revenue above that amount. SoundExchange's proposal for small webcasters, however, was met by criticism that the deal would effectively restrict small webcasters from becoming larger, more profitable businesses and would limit the diversity of music that may be played.", "Another proposal that was discussed and subsequently agreed to between several of the largest webcasters and SoundExchange is a $50,000 per year cap on the $500 annual-per-channel minimum fee through 2010. In exchange for this cap, the webcasters agreed to provide SoundExchange with a comprehensive annual accounting of all songs performed (24 hours a day, 365 days a year) and to form a committee with SoundExchange to evaluate the issue of unauthorized copying of Internet radio streams (a practice known as \"streamripping,\" or the process of converting ephemeral Internet-streamed content into permanent recordings). The agreement does not require webcasters to implement technological measures aimed at preventing their listeners from engaging in streamripping, however.", "In a unilateral offer put forth by SoundExchange, qualified small webcasters (those earning $1.25 million or less in total revenues) would be permitted to stream sound recordings of all SoundExchange members by paying royalties under the old percentage-of-revenue scheme.

Circuit requesting a stay pending their appeal of the board's decision. The motion alleged that the board's decision is arbitrary and capricious in several respects, but particularly with regard to the requirement of a minimum fee \"per station\" or \"per channel.\" On July 11, 2007, a three-judge panel of the court of appeals denied the emergency motion to delay the CRB decision pending the parties' appeal. The five separate appeals by the parties were consolidated into one case.

The court expressed concern that the CRB's determination on minimum fees did not reveal an awareness of the possibility of a licensee paying \"hundreds of thousands of dollars or more\" in minimum fees, depending on the potential interpretation of the phrase \"per channel or station\":", "Depending on future interpretations of \"channel or station,\" the Judges' determination might impose enormous fees on some business models and tiny fees on others, based on regulations that have not yet been defined.
