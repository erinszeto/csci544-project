For example, in February 2012, the President signed into law an amendment to the Social Security Act that authorizes states to condition the receipt of certain unemployment compensation benefits on passing drug tests. Additionally, lawmakers in a majority of states reportedly proposed legislation in 2011, 2012, 2013, and/or 2014 that would require drug testing beneficiaries of governmental assistance under certain circumstances, while at least 12 state governments over that time have enacted such legislation.", "Federal or state laws that condition the initial or ongoing receipt of governmental benefits on passing drug tests without regard to individualized suspicion of illicit drug use may be subject to constitutional challenge.

Acton", "paragraphs": ["In Vernonia , the Court first considered the constitutionality of student drug testing in the public schools. At issue was a school district program for random drug testing of high school student athletes, which had been implemented in response to a perceived increase in student drug activity. All student athletes and their parents had to sign forms consenting to testing, which occurred at the start of the season and randomly thereafter for the season's duration. Students who tested positive were given the option of either participating in a drug assistance program or being suspended from athletics for the current and following seasons.", "A 6-to-3 majority of the Court upheld the program against Fourth Amendment challenge. The Court noted a prior holding that \"'special needs' [] exist in the public school context\" where compliance with the traditional probable cause requirement \"would undercut the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools.\" Central to the Vernonia majority's rationale was the \"custodial and tutelary\" relationship that is created when children are \"committed to the temporary custody of the State as schoolmaster.\" This relationship, in effect, \"permit[s] a degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free adults.\" ", "Additionally, students had diminished expectations of privacy by virtue of routinely required medical examinations, a factor compounded in the case of student athletes by insurance requirements, minimum academic standards, and the \"communal undress\" and general lack of privacy in sports' locker rooms. Because \"school sports are not for the bashful,\" student athletes were found to have a lower expectation of privacy than other students.", "Balanced against these diminished privacy interests were the nature of the intrusion and importance of the governmental interests at stake. First, the school district had mitigated actual intrusion by implementing urine collection procedures that simulated conditions \"nearly identical to those typically encountered in public restrooms\"; by analyzing the urine sample only for presence of illegal drugs\u2014not for other medical information, such as the prevalence of disease or pregnancy; and by insuring that positive test results were not provided to law enforcement officials. Second, school officials had an interest in deterring student drug use as part of their \"special responsibility of care and direction\" toward students. That interest was magnified in Vernonia by judicial findings that, prior to implementation of the program, \"a large segment of the student body, particularly those involved in interscholastic athletics, was in a state of rebellion ... fueled by alcohol and drug abuse....\"", "Consequently, the Court approved the school district's drug testing policy, reasoning that the Fourth Amendment only requires that government officials adopt reasonable policies, not the least invasive ones available. The majority in Vernonia , however, cautioned \"against the assumption that suspicionless drug-testing will readily pass muster in other constitutional contexts.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Board of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls", "paragraphs": ["Earls concerned a Tecumseh Public School District policy that required suspicionless drug testing of students wishing to participate \"in any extracurricular activity.\" Such activities included Future Farmers of America, Future Homemakers of America, academic teams, band, and chorus, cheerleading, and athletics. Any student who refused to submit to random testing for illegal drugs was barred from all such activities, but was not otherwise subject to penalty or academic sanction. Lindsay Earls challenged the district's policy \"as a condition\" to her membership in the high school's band, show choir, and academic team.", "By a 5 to 4 vote, the Court held that the Tecumseh school district's drug testing program was a \"reasonable means\" of preventing and deterring student drug use and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The majority, citing Vernonia , stated that \"this Court has previously held that 'special needs' inhere in the public school context.\" In its role as \"guardian and tutor,\" the majority reasoned, the state has responsibility for the discipline, health, and safety of students whose privacy interests are correspondingly limited and subject to \"greater control than those for adults.\" Moreover, students who participate in extracurricular activities \"have a limited expectation of privacy\" as they participate in the activities and clubs on a voluntary basis, subject themselves to other intrusions of privacy, and meet official rules for participation. The fact that student athletes in the Vernonia case were regularly subjected to physical exams and communal undress was not deemed \"essential\" to the outcome there. Instead, that decision \"depended primarily upon the school's custodial responsibility and authority,\" which was equally applicable to athletic and nonathletic activities.", "The testing procedure itself, involving collection of urine samples, chain of custody, and confidentiality of results, was found to be \"minimally intrusive\" and \"virtually identical\" to that approved by the Court in Vernonia . In particular, the opinion notes test results were kept in separate confidential files only available to school employees with a \"need to know,\" were not disclosed to law enforcement authorities, and carried no disciplinary or academic consequences other than limiting extracurricular participation. \"Given the minimally intrusive nature of the sample collection and the limited uses to which the test results are put, we conclude that the invasion of students' privacy is not significant.\"", "The majority concluded that neither \"individualized suspicion\" nor a \"demonstrated problem of drug abuse\" was a necessary predicate for a student drug testing program, and there is no \"threshold level\" of drug use that must be satisfied. \"Finally, we find that testing students who participate in extracurricular activities is a reasonably effective means of addressing the School District's legitimate concerns in preventing, deterring, and detecting drug use.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chandler v. Miller", "paragraphs": ["Conversely, the Court in Chandler struck down a 1990 Georgia statute requiring candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, the state judiciary, the state legislature, and certain other elective offices to file a certification that they have tested negatively for illegal drug use. The majority opinion noted several factors distinguishing the Georgia law from drug testing requirements upheld in earlier cases. First, there was no \"fear or suspicion\" of generalized illicit drug use by state elected officials in the law's background that might pose a \"concrete danger demanding departure from the Fourth Amendment's main rule.\" The Court noted that, while not a necessary constitutional prerequisite, evidence of historical drug abuse by the group targeted for testing might \"shore up an assertion of special need for a suspicionless general search program.\" ", "In addition, the law did not serve as a \"credible means\" to detect or deter drug abuse by public officials. Since the timing of the test was largely controlled by the candidate rather than the state, legal compliance could be achieved by a mere temporary abstinence. Another \"telling difference\" between the Georgia case and earlier rulings stemmed from the \"relentless scrutiny\" to which candidates for public office are subjected, as compared to persons working in less exposed work environments. Any drug abuse by public officials is far more likely to be detected in the ordinary course of events, making suspicionless testing less necessary than in the case of safety-sensitive positions beyond the public view. The Court explained:", "We reiterate, too, that where the risk to public safety is substantial and real, blanket suspicionless searches calibrated to the risk may rank as \"reasonable\"\u2014for example, searches now routine at airports and at entrances to courts and other official buildings.", "The Court went on to stress that searches conducted without individualized suspicion generally must be linked to public safety in order to be reasonable. \"But where, as in this case, public safety is not genuinely in jeopardy, the Fourth Amendment precludes the suspicionless search, no matter how conveniently arranged.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Synthesis of Supreme Court Precedent", "paragraphs": ["Skinner and Von Raab indicate that \"compelling\" governmental interests in public safety or national security may, in appropriate circumstances, override constitutional objections to testing procedures by employees whose privacy expectations are diminished by the nature of their duties or the workplace scrutiny to which they are otherwise subject. In Earls and Vernonia , the Court concludes that specials needs are inherent to the public school setting in which the government serves as \"guardian and tutor\" to minor students. The Earls and Vernonia rulings also make clear that minors have diminished privacy expectations relative to adults, especially when drug testing is implemented by individuals in a guardian or tutor capacity. Although not dispositive, Earls , Vernonia , and Chandler also illustrate that drug testing programs imposed on a subset of the population that has a \"demonstrated problem of drug abuse\" may tilt the balancing test in the government's favor, especially if the testing program is designed to effectively address the problem. The extent to which drug test results are shared or kept confidential also may be relevant to a court's review of the competing public and private interests. Drug testing programs that require results to be kept confidential to all but a small group of non-law enforcement officials, are not conducted for criminal law enforcement purposes, and that only minimally impact an individual's life are more likely to be considered reasonable. On the other hand, programs that allow drug test results to be shared, especially with law enforcement, or that otherwise have the potential to negatively impact multiple or significant aspects of an individual's life, may be less likely to be considered reasonable.

The court also was unmoved by the state's argument that the drug testing served a special need of reducing child abuse and neglect. Upon an examination of the programs' express legislative purposes, the court found that neither TANF nor FIP was designed specifically to address child abuse and neglect. Therefore, \"... the State's financial assistance to parents for the care of their minor children through the FIP cannot be used to regulate the parents in a manner that erodes their privacy rights in order to further goals that are unrelated to the FIP.\" Further, allowing the state to conduct suspicionless drug tests in this context would provide a justification for conducting suspicionless drug tests of all parents of children who receive governmental benefits of any kind, such as student loans and a public education, which \"would set a dangerous precedent.\" Thus, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the \"Plaintiffs have established a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claim.\" ", "On appeal, a 12-member en banc panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals split evenly, with six judges voting to affirm and six judges voting to reverse the district court's ruling.

However, governmental benefit programs like TANF, SNAP, unemployment compensation, and housing assistance do not naturally evoke the special needs that the Supreme Court has recognized in the past. ", "The implementation of governmental assistance programs and the receipt of their benefits do not raise similar public safety concerns as those at issue in Skinner and Von Raab . In implementing these programs, the government also does not clearly act as tutor or guardian for minors, as the Court considered important in Earls and Vernonia . Finally, the evidence in Lebron failed to show a pervasive drug problem in the subset of the population subjected to suspicionless testing that strengthened the government's interests in Earls and Vernonia . Thus, if lawmakers wish to pursue the objective of reducing the likelihood of taxpayer funds going to individuals who abuse drugs through drug testing, legislation is less likely to run afoul of the Fourth Amendment if it only requires individuals to submit to a drug test based on an individualized suspicion of drug use, for example by providing that only those TANF applicants whom administrators have a \"reasonable cause to believe\" use illegal drugs be drug tested. ", "Additionally, the way drug testing programs are implemented can affect a court's constitutional analysis of the program. For instance, until a subsequent administrative rulemaking promulgated in response to issues raised in the district court's preliminary injunction order, Florida's Section 414.0652 program required positive drug test results to be shared with government officials outside of the TANF program, such that the information ultimately could be made available to law enforcement officials. As a result, prior to the administrative rulemaking, applicants who failed drug tests under the Florida program also could have been subject to criminal drug investigations or investigations of child abuse, in addition to losing their TANF benefits. This information sharing increased the level of intrusion into the privacy interests of TANF applicants more than if the results were kept confidential to all but the administrators of the TANF program, who had a legitimate need to know the information. In contrast, the testing programs that complied with the Fourth Amendment at issue in Von Raab , Earls , and Vernonia limited the number of people who had access to the test results, prohibited the results from being passed to law enforcement officials, and restricted the negative consequences of failing a drug test to the specific activities the testing was designed to address (e.g., school extracurricular activities). Although they may not have been determinative, these factors reduced the privacy intrusion of the plaintiffs and seem to have played a role in the Court's balancing test evaluation.
