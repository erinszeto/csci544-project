Tax-subsidized financing, specifically tax-favored bonds, reduce the cost associated with making oftentimes capital intensive investments in renewables and energy efficiency. This report provides an overview of the various federally tax-favored financing options available for renewable energy and energy-efficiency investments. This report also highlights the economic foundations for subsidizing renewable energy investment and comments on economic issues specific to tax-favored financing.", "Various forms of federally tax-favored bonds have been used to subsidize investments in renewables and efficiency. Some of these bonds, such as the Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) and Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs), are tax-credit bonds available only for investments in renewables or efficiency. CREBs alone have been used to finance 1,727 renewable energy projects, through $3.4 billion in CREB allocations. Other types of tax-favored bonds, such as tax-exempt governmental bonds or private activity bonds and Build America Bonds (BABs), are more widely available but have been used for energy-related projects. More than $10 billion worth of BABs have been issued to finance electric and public power projects (although it is not clear what share of this issue is dedicated to renewables).", "The magnitude of the subsidy afforded by the different types of federally tax-favored financing differs from both the perspective of the bond issuer and the investor. An example, where a hypothetical CREB, BAB, and tax-exempt bond is used to finance the same project, illustrates how policymakers can adjust bond terms to manipulate the subsidy provided to issuers and investors.", "Tax incentives promote investment in renewables and energy efficiency by reducing the cost of such investments relative to fossil energy alternatives. Investments in renewable energy generation capacity, especially wind, have led to an increasing share of renewables in the nation's overall energy portfolio. Subsidizing investments in renewables using tax policy, however, may not be the most economically efficient mechanism for increasing the use of renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency. Subsidizing renewables through tax incentives leads to federal revenue losses, requiring that federal revenues be raised by some other, potentially distortionary, form of taxation.", "Tax-exempt bonds may not be the best tool for subsidizing investment in renewables when evaluated in terms of economic efficiency and equity. With tax-exempt bonds, federal revenue losses may exceed the subsidy provided to issuers, and thus be an inefficient subsidy. Tax-exempt bonds also provide a larger subsidy to taxpayers in higher tax brackets, raising equity concerns. Tax-credit bonds, as an alternative, represent a tax-subsidization option that is not subject to the inefficiencies and inequities associated with tax-exempt debt.", "While tax-subsidized financing has been a popular tool in recent years for promoting investment in renewables and efficiency, a number of these bonds are not currently available as options for project investors. Specifically, all available CREB financing has been allocated, and projects were unable to issue BABs after December 31, 2010. Whether these programs have successfully promoted renewable energy investment, and should be extended, may be an issue the 112th Congress will want to consider."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Domestic energy policy has historically been, and continues to be, motivated by two goals. First, U.S. energy policy has sought to promote domestic energy security. Uncertainty surrounding energy prices and imports generates interest in further developing domestic energy-generation capacity. With respect to energy security, the concern is greatest in the transportation sector, where 94% of the sector is powered using petroleum. Renewable energy resources have the potential to play an important role in developing domestic generation capability. Second, U.S. energy policy is driven by a desire to address environmental concerns. One environmental goal is the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Approximately 48% of electric power in the U.S. is produced using coal. Producing electricity and fuels using renewable energy technologies offers the possibility of production with low GHG emissions.", "Despite energy policy objectives, growth in renewable energy production has been slow. Figure 1 illustrates domestic energy production by source over the past 50 years. In 1949, nearly 32 quadrillion btus of energy were produced. More than 9% of the energy produced was from a renewable energy source (4.5% from hydro electric power and 4.8% from biomass). By 2009, energy production had more than doubled to 73 quadrillion btus. In 2009, 10.6% of energy production came from a renewable source (3.7% from hydro electric power, 5.3% from biomass, with less than 1% coming from wind, geothermal, or solar sources).", "More recent evidence, however, suggests that the use of renewables is growing and overall energy consumption is decreasing. For example, in 2009, 39% of all new electric generating capacity installed was wind power. This new capacity was the result of $21 billion in investment. Overall, wind power's share in domestic energy production increased by 28%. Despite this increase, wind power accounts for less than 1% of domestic energy production. In 2008, wind power was 0.73% of domestic energy production, increasing to 0.96% in 2009. ", "While domestic energy production ( Figure 1 ) has continued to increase in recent years, domestic energy consumption has declined. In 2009, domestic energy consumption was less than 95 quadrillion btus, down from 99 quadrillion btus in 2008. Renewables, as a share of energy consumption, were 7.4% in 2008 and 8.2% in 2009. The increased share of domestic energy consumption from renewable sources is partially due to increased production from these sources. The overall decline in energy consumption from all sources, however, also increased the renewables' relative share. ", "There are several federal policies that could potentially increase energy production from renewables. One option is to establish a national renewable portfolio standard (RPS), which would require that a certain share of energy supplied come from renewable sources. A number of states have an RPS in place. Legislative proposals to establish a federal RPS date back to at least the 105 th Congress. Legislation introduced during the 111 th Congress, if enacted, would have required that 25% of energy be generated using renewable resources by 2025. Proposals in the 110 th Congress sought to enact an RPS of 15% by 2020. While Congress continues to explore the possibility of a federal RPS through various hearings, it does not appear that adoption of such a standard is imminent.", "While adoption of a federal RPS does not appear likely in the near future, strong interest remains in increasing the use of renewables and in increasing investments in energy efficiency. Current policies, including tax incentives, loan guarantees, and federal grants, have promoted renewables and energy efficiency in the past, and are expected to play an important role in shaping future energy policy. Current policies recognize the important role private capital plays in renewable energy investments, and seek to mobilize and attract such capital to renewables and energy efficiency projects.", "Promotion of both renewables and energy efficiency is consistent with the long-standing energy policy goals of enhancing domestic energy security while simultaneously addressing ongoing concerns regarding the environment. As such, it is expected that Congress will continue to look for ways to encourage these investments. Understanding how to best encourage investments in renewable energy involves understanding what has been done in the past, evaluating the success of these initiatives, and evaluating whether previous initiatives should play a role in future energy policy.", "This report focuses specifically on federally subsidized or supported debt designed to promote investment in renewables and energy efficiency. These instruments have played an important role in the renewable energy financing landscape in recent years. Understanding what types of debt instruments currently are and previously have been available, the degree of federal subsidization contained within these instruments, and what types of investments have resulted from these programs, will help policymakers evaluate if and how these tools can be used in the future to promote renewables and efficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Framework", "paragraphs": ["An economic justification for government intervention in energy markets is to address market failures arising due to externalities. These externalities may lead to over consumption of some energy sources generating a loss in economic efficiency. Government policy, in particular tax policy, may be capable of guiding the market toward a more economically efficient allocation of resources by internalizing the externalities. ", "Both the production and consumption of energy may be associated with negative externalities. For example, burning fossil fuels contributes to air pollution and generates greenhouse gasses, both widely considered negative externalities. Imposing a tax on the polluting activity can improve economic efficiency by forcing polluters to face the total costs associated with polluting activities.", "Fossil fuels used to produce energy, specifically traditional coal and crude oil, generate environmental costs that are not directly borne by either the energy producer or the energy consumer. Because producers and consumers do not bear the full cost of fossil fuel energy production, the market outcome results in more energy from fossil fuels being produced than would have been the case if environmental costs were taken into account. Imposing a tax on (or regulating) polluting activities would increase the cost associated with such activities, and ultimately decrease the quantity of the polluting activity. In theory, if the tax is equal to the external social costs not previously considered, the tax will guide the market to a more economically efficient allocation of resources.", "While taxes or similar instruments are the most economically efficient mechanisms for addressing market failures stemming from negative externalities, an alternative policy option is to subsidize a non-externality-generating alternative. In other words, instead of increasing the cost of fossil fuel sources, decrease the cost of renewable sources. Energy tax policy in the United States has tended toward this alternative approach, providing a number of tax credits and other tax preferences for investments in renewables and energy efficiency. By making renewables cheaper relative to traditional energy sources, investment in renewable alternatives is expected to increase. ", "Critics of tax preferences for renewables and efficiency, however, maintain that preferences are not likely to be economically efficient for a number of reasons. They note that first, tax subsidies reduce government revenues, while taxes that correct for negative externalities increase government revenues. Tax subsidies for renewables, therefore, can require the government to raise taxes by taxing other activities, such as labor, through an income tax. Second, tax subsidies may distort investments, directing resources toward technologies that may not be the most cost-effective mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions reduction or for achieving other goals, such as job creation. Supporters of setting a price on greenhouse gas emissions assert that it would allow the market to select the most cost-effective alternatives. With tax subsidies, the government is choosing the preferred technology, and may \"pick winners\" rather than allowing the market to identify the most cost-effective energy resources. Finally, they note that tax subsidies for renewable energy reduce the average cost of energy resources. As the average cost of energy falls, the quantity of energy demanded from all energy sources, including non-renewable sources, increases. Thus, while subsidizing renewables increases investment in renewables by reducing their cost relative to non-renewable alternatives, a possible unintended consequence of such incentives could be additional fossil fuel consumption resulting from reduced energy costs broadly. Overall, it seems likely that tax incentives for renewables will increase investment in renewables, but that some of those gains may be reduced by increased fossil energy consumption resulting from reduced energy prices.", "Investments in energy projects are generally capital intensive. One method for promoting renewables investments is through tax incentives that reduce a project's cost. Historically, tax incentives have been available for the investment in and production of renewable energy. As noted above, U.S. energy tax policy has tended to use the tax code to subsidize certain energy resources as a mechanism for achieving energy policy goals.

The interest costs of issuers are lower because the interest payments are exempt from income taxes. The tax-free interest payments allow the issuer to offer lower interest payments to investors. For example, in October 2010, the average interest rate on high quality tax-exempt bonds was 3.87% and for taxable corporate bonds of similar maturity and quality, the rate was 4.68%.", "High-income investors, those in the top income tax brackets, receive a rate of return on their tax-exempt bond investments that exceeds that of any other investment of similar risk profile. Consider a 35% marginal tax rate investor who purchases a 4.0% tax-exempt bond with principal of $1,000 that is to be repaid after 20 years. Each year for 20 years this taxpayer receives $40 in tax-exempt interest income. If the investor had purchased a taxable bond carrying a 5% interest rate, he would have received $50 in interest income while paying $17.50 in income taxes on that income. Each year the federal government forgoes collecting $17.50 of revenue from the tax-exempt bond because the revenue loss is based upon the interest earnings the taxpayer forgoes and the income taxes that would have been generated. In this example, the after-tax rate of return is $40 for the tax-exempt bond and $32.50 for the taxable bond.", "The average interest rates alluded to above mask in part the significant variation in bond yields across jurisdictions and by project financed. Less credit worthy jurisdictions and riskier projects carry above-market interest rates. The amount of the federal subsidy rises with the interest rate.", "There are two types of tax-exempt bonds. In addition to bonds issued to finance projects related to governmental service, Congress has extended the authority to issue tax-exempt bonds to selected projects whose benefits are more private in nature.

General obligation bonds carry the least risk for investors. Another type of governmental bond is a revenue bond where a specific stream of government revenue, such as a sales tax, is used to secure repayment of the bond.", "Many governments own and operate utilities that generate electricity. These governmental projects are oftentimes financed with tax-exempt bonds. In 2009, $12.1 billion of tax-exempt debt was issued for government-owned electric power production facilities. The interest rate spread between taxable corporate bonds and tax-exempt bonds was 69 basis points (5.31% for corporate bonds less 4.62% for tax-exempt bonds). A rough estimate of the annual federal subsidy to the issuer of tax-exempt bonds for energy production in 2009 would be $83.4 million. Note, however, that the federal subsidy is different from the loss in tax revenue. Investors avoid paying taxes on what would have otherwise been a taxable investment.

This act also extended the expiration date for the allocation of the total $1.2 billion through 2008.", "The federal government subsidized the borrowing costs for entities issuing CREBs by providing tax credits to bondholders. Since bondholders are receiving tax credits from the federal government, the issuing entity can borrow while paying little or no interest on the debt. Theoretically, the Treasury was to set the credit rate such that the CREB issuer would not need to issue the bond at a discount or pay interest payments. The Treasury used market rates based on AA-rated corporate bonds. A number of municipalities issuing CREBs had credit ratings lower than AA. Thus, these issuers had to sell the bonds at a discount or pay supplemental interest to attract investors.", "The data in Table 1 show that in the first allocation of CREBs, 78% of projects were approved, representing 31% of the total authority requested. This data reflects the IRS selection process, whereby projects are selected using a smallest-to-largest approach.

The $2.4 billion was to be allocated in equal shares to government entities, cooperatives, and public power providers. All of this $2.4 billion had been allocated to projects by the end of 2009 (see Table 1 for allocation details). Currently, the IRS is not accepting applications for CREB allocations as no funds are available.", "While the allocations for government entities and cooperatives were allocated using the previously employed smallest-to-largest methodology, CREBs for public power providers (municipal utilities) were awarded on a pro-rata basis to all eligible projects. In other words, each eligible project was allocated a portion of the $800 million based on the fraction of the project's total request relative to the total CREB volume requested by all public power projects.", "New CREBs differ from the traditional CREBs in a number of ways. First, the tax credit rate for new CREBs is 70% of the rate determined by the Treasury as being required for issuers to pay zero interest. With this lower credit rate it is expected that issuers will be required to make supplemental interest payments. Second, the Treasury determines the tax credit rate for new CREBs by looking at the yield on \"single A\" or BBB bonds. Using a lower investment grade to determine the credit rate reduces the amount of supplemental interest issuers will be required to pay. Third, issuers of new CREBs can pay the entire principal at the bond's maturity. This provides renewable energy projects with additional capital in the early years, when projects are most likely to be capital constrained. Fourth, in the 111 th Congress, P.L. 111-147 expanded the direct issuer payment option (the issuer receives the tax credit in contrast to the investor) to include new CREBs. Finally, investors in new CREBs are allowed to strip the tax credits from the principal payments and sell each separately. This change increased the liquidity of CREBs, making them a more attractive investment.", "The high demand for financing investment under the original CREB mechanism continued under new CREBs despite the lower 70% credit rate. The Treasury had the capacity to approve 78% of all applications under the original CREBS. The project application approval rate for new CREBs was 43%.", "In March 2010, provisions included in the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (HIRE Act; P.L. 111-147 ) allowed issuers of CREBs (and other qualified tax-credit bonds) to receive a direct payment from the Treasury instead of providing tax credits to bondholders. Essentially, this transforms CREBs into a refundable tax credit for the issuer, which can be used to subsidize borrowing costs. ", "As noted above, having fully subscribed all capacity, CREB funding authority is not currently available. Thus, public entities have limited options when it comes to securing low-cost financing for investments in renewables.

These incentives are not available for non-taxable entities, putting their projects at somewhat of a financing disadvantage thought they do have access to tax-exempt bond financing.

BABs were intended as general assistance to state and local governments whereas CREBs were intended to encourage investment in clean renewable energy projects. Tax-exempt bonds were originally afforded their tax-exemption for constitutional reasons, not necessarily the incentive effects. Nevertheless, they do subsidize investment in public capital formation.", "Investors, on the other hand, are intent on maximizing after-tax rate of return on bond investments. These investors can be split into two broad groups: taxable investors and nontaxable investors. For taxable investors, tax-exempt bonds are preferred only if the additional yield (higher interest rate) offered by alternative taxable investments, such as BABs and CREBs, does not fully compensate for the taxable interest payment. Investors in marginal tax rates below the hypothetical market clearing rate, where the after-tax return of taxable and tax-exempt bonds is equated, would choose taxable bonds. Multiple marginal tax rates for individuals (and to a lesser extent corporations) investing in tax-exempt bonds can create opportunities for windfall gains that are not available for tax credit bonds investors.", "Clearly, for nontaxable investors, the a tax-exempt bond is not a wise investment as there is no tax advantage. Taxable bonds, like BABs and CREBs, are more attractive to these investors and marginal tax rates do not influence the federal revenue loss. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comparison of Tax-Exempt Bonds, CREBs, and BABs", "paragraphs": ["Below is an illustrative example of the variation in subsidy provided by the different types of bonds, highlighting how the subsidy changes across different types of investors. On March 5, 2010, a government owned electricity producer in Georgia, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), offered just over $1 billion of Build America Bonds as part of a larger bond issue for an expansion project. The interest rate on the long-term bonds (they mature on April 1, 2057), was set at 6.655%. On March 6, 2010, tax-exempt bonds of similar risk profile were offering an average interest rate of 4.34%. MEAG clearly believed the BAB structure presented the most financially sound option for financing the expansion of their nuclear power generating facility.", "Recall that the BAB credit rate is 35%, meaning the federal government will make direct payments to MEAG equal to 35% of the interest cost. In contrast, new CREBs carry a 70% credit rate. The MEAG project would not have been eligible for CREB financing because nuclear energy is not considered a renewable energy source, though the example uses a hypothetical 70% credit for comparative purposes.", " Table 4 compares three types of bonds using the parameters of the above MEAG project. The first is a new CREB (with a 70% credit rate), the second is a BAB (with a 35% credit rate), and the third is a traditional tax-exempt bond (TEB). Three hypothetical investors in different tax situations are also compared: (1) a tax free investor (a pension fund or international investor); (2) a 28% bracket investor, and (3) a 35% bracket investor.", "The annual federal payment to the issuers under the direct payment option would be 35% of the interest rate for BABs and 70% of the interest rate for CREBs. This would generate a $47.2 million payment if the bonds were issued as CREBs and $23.6 million if they were issued as BABs (which they were). The issuer would still make annual payments to investors of $67.4 million under CREBs and BABs. Tax-exempt bonds, in contrast, do not provide for a direct payment to the issuer. The tax-exempt interest rate at the time of this issuance was 4.34%, which would generate a payment to the investor of $43.9 million. Thus, the \"after-federal-payment\" interest cost for issuers as a percentage of principal would 1.997% for CREBs, 4.326% for BABs, and 4.34% for tax-exempt bonds.", "The CREB would generate the largest incentive for the issuer, though this option is not available for nuclear power facilities like the MEAG project. The second best option is the BAB with a lower interest cost than tax-exempt bonds. This simplified example does not take into account other features that would further differentiate bonds issued under the three scenarios including call provisions, sinking fund arrangements, and principal repayment. Also, the relatively late maturity in 2057 makes these bonds somewhat unusual.", "The bottom panel of Table 4 reports the investor's after tax return for the three bonds for three investors in different tax brackets. Importantly, for the investor in the 35% bracket, the TEB has the highest rate of return. For the nontaxable investor and the investor in the 28% bracket, the tax credit bonds are a better investment. The implicit tax rate that equates the rate of return across the bonds is 34.79%, meaning any investor in a tax bracket below that rate would be wise to invest in tax-exempt bonds. The following section provides a more generalized presentation of the economic efficiency and equity questions surrounding tax favored bonds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Efficiency and Equity Considerations", "paragraphs": ["An economic evaluation of tax-exempt bonds leads to concerns regarding both economic efficiency and equity. Tax-exempt bonds are economically inefficient if the loss in federal revenue exceeds the subsidy provided to issuers. In practice, evidence suggests that tax-exempt bonds are an inefficient subsidization mechanism. Historically, the \"implicit tax rate\" of tax-exempt bonds has been below the top marginal tax rate. Evidence also suggests that the majority of investors in tax-exempt debt face a marginal tax rate that is greater than the implicit tax rate implied by the difference in returns on tax-exempt and taxable debt. Take, for example, an entity issuing tax-exempt debt at a 25% subsidy (determined by the market through the implicit tax rate). Suppose an investor facing a 33% marginal tax rate purchases this debt. Since this debt is tax-exempt, the federal government does not collect the $0.33 per dollar of interest income it would have collected on taxable interest. The federal government's revenue losses are determined according to investor's marginal tax rates. If the marginal tax rates of investors exceeds the implicit tax rate on tax-exempt bonds (which evidence suggests is the case), tax-exempt debt is an inefficient mechanism for delivering federal subsidy.", "Tax-exempt bonds may also generate equity-related concern, as the distribution of the tax benefits for tax-exempt bonds is regressive. Under a tax system with increasing tax rate brackets, the value of holding tax-exempt debt increases as the tax bracket rises. Empirical evidence suggests that eliminating the tax-exemption for state and local debt would increase tax liability primarily for taxpayers in the highest income quintile. Tax data from 2008 indicate that 49% of tax-exempt interest reported on individual tax returns was reported by those with an adjusted gross income of at least $250,000. For comparison, only 2% of individual tax returns filed were in this high-income group. ", "Tax credit bonds reduce some of the inefficiencies associated with tax-exempt debt while also enhancing equity. Tax credit bonds enhance efficiency by providing an equivalent subsidy to borrowers with less revenue loss, as compared to subsidization using tax-exempt debt. With tax-credit bonds, the subsidy provided to the borrower through the tax credit is equal in value to the federal revenue loss. Thus, the inefficiency associated with tax-exempt debt, where the loss in revenues to the federal government exceeds the subsidy to borrowers, is eliminated with the use of tax-credit bonds.", "Tax credits, generally, are more equitable than tax exemptions. With tax credit bonds where investors receive a tax credit, their reduction in tax liability is on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Thus, the benefits are not greater for those in a higher marginal tax bracket. In the case of tax credit bonds, since the credits are generally taxable for recipients, tax-credit bonds are worth less to higher income taxpayers. In cases where the issuer claims the tax credit, individuals in higher income tax brackets pay more in taxes per dollar of interest payments received.

State and local governments established PACE programs to provide loans for energy-efficiency improvements. Under the PACE model, the issuing entity floats bonds to provide the initial capital for the program. The proceeds are then used to make loans to individuals or businesses investing in energy-efficiency improvements. The loans are added to property tax bills through special assessments and are paid off over time. The PACE model was modeled after land-secured municipal finance projects. With these projects, the public benefits are repaid through special assessments secured by the property. Ideally, the energy savings realized from installing energy-efficient property will compensate for increased property tax bills.", "In the PACE model, the special assessments are senior liens on the property. As a senior lien, the loans pose less risk, reducing the interest rates required by investors.

", "Objections to the senior lien status of PACE loans, however, has effectively stopped PACE programs. In July 2010, FHFA released a statement directing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks to tighten lending standards in PACE districts. FHFA objected to the senior lien status of PACE loans, noting that PACE programs present \"significant safety and soundness concerns\" and have the potential to \"disrupt fragile housing finance markets.\" One option for PACE programs would be to subordinate PACE assessments.

Requiring that some level of electricity be produced using renewable resources would drive markets to invest more in renewables and may lead to energy efficiency investments. In the absence of such market drivers, tax-subsidized financing is another option for promoting investment in the renewable sector. Further, the use of tax-credit bonds addresses some of the economic efficiency and equity concerns that have been raised with respect to the use of tax-exempt bonds in the past. ", "The goal of tax favored financing is to reduce the cost of borrowing for those investing in renewables and efficiency, making it easier for such projects to attract investors. While federally subsidized financing may attract investment, there is also the possibility that investment would have taken place without subsidization. In this case, tax favored bonds may reduce a project's borrowing costs, rewarding bond issuers at taxpayer expense without creating additional renewable energy capacity. Energy tax subsidies reduce federal revenues, an issue that is of growing concern in an era of high budget deficits.

Oftentimes, in practice, tax favored investment opportunities are given to specific types of technologies.
