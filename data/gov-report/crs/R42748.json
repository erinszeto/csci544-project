This report provides a primer on CTE to support congressional discussion of initiatives designed to rationalize the workforce development system.", "CTE prepares students for roles outside the paid labor market, teaches general employment skills, and teaches skills required in specific occupations or careers. In order to focus and structure programs, curricula, and resources, practitioners at the local, state, and federal levels often organize CTE into 16 career clusters and various career pathways for each career cluster. CTE career clusters include several occupational areas, such as health science and manufacturing. Career pathways generally refer to a series of connected education and training strategies and support services that enable individuals to secure industry-recognized credentials and obtain employment within an occupational area and to advance to higher levels of future education and employment in that area.", "At the secondary level, CTE is offered in high schools, area CTE centers, community colleges, and detention centers. Nearly all 2009 public high school graduates (88%) earned at least one CTE credit, and 19% earned at least three CTE credits in a single occupational area. Four issues confound the offering of CTE at the secondary level. The first is whether CTE courses should be offered to (1) broaden the students' education and provide early exposure to several career options or (2) ensure students are prepared to enter the workforce immediately with an industry-recognized credential after completion of a career pathway in high school or after one to two additional years of postsecondary education or training. The second issue is the expense of maintaining and updating the instructional resources and equipment for a single career cluster or pathway, particularly at the secondary level. The third issue is whether CTE adds value to a college preparatory high school curriculum. For example, U.S. Department of Education statistics of 2004 public high school graduates demonstrated no significant difference in average wages between all graduates working for pay but not enrolled in postsecondary education and CTE graduates working for pay but not enrolled in postsecondary education. However, of the CTE graduates working for pay but not enrolled in postsecondary education, only 30% were in an occupation related to their high school CTE concentration. The final issue is related to state adoption in recent years of the common core standards that are termed college- and career-ready standards, although the standards do not define career-ready and thus may not provide immediate career preparation.", "At the postsecondary level, CTE is offered by community colleges, vocational schools, and employers through apprenticeships and on-the-job training. Some CTE programs are terminal (few courses are transferable for credit toward a more advanced credential), while others may lead to stackable credentials (a sequence of credentials leading to more advanced qualifications). The ability or inability to transfer CTE credits toward a credential with higher earning potential or a bachelor's degree highlights one conflict among policymakers. The difficulty in structuring every postsecondary CTE program to include the first one to two years of general bachelor's degree requirements is that the CTE program will likely require more time to accomplish and may be of less interest to the CTE student.", "CTE for adults is work-related course-taking that may incorporate adult basic education (ABE).

The rates at which adults engage in work-related course-taking increases with age, labor market engagement, and education.", "The Bureau of Census collects earnings data for the adult population with various educational credentials. The most recent data available on subbaccalaureate populations suggests that alternative credentials (such educational certificates or professional certification and licenses) are associated with a statistically significant wage premium for populations with no postsecondary degree when compared to others with comparable levels of formal education.

The career clusters were developed by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and various stakeholders. Their development was informed by state educational agencies (SEAs), secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, employers, industry groups, other stakeholders, and federal agencies.", "There are 16 career clusters. The Appendix demonstrates the scope and breadth of CTE, organized by career cluster. For example, the agriculture, food , and natural resources career cluster comprises the development of agricultural products, including plants, animals, food, textiles, and other consumer products. Because even a single career cluster covers several areas, they are further disaggregated into career pathways. Career pathways generally refer to a series of connected education and training strategies and support services that enable individuals to secure industry relevant certification and obtain employment within an occupational area and to advance to higher levels of future education and employment in that area. For example, the agriculture, food, and natural resources career cluster is divided into seven career pathways: food products and processing systems; power, structural, and technical systems; plant systems; natural resource systems; animal systems; environmental service systems; and agribusiness systems. The Appendix includes the related career pathways for each career cluster.", "States use career clusters to inform education reform at the secondary and postsecondary levels and to enhance economic development. As of 2012, 94% of states and territories had either adopted career clusters or had adapted their own framework from the 16 career clusters. Schools can focus on a limited number of career clusters in order to maximize resource efficiency. For example, schools and school districts use the career clusters and pathways to organize small learning communities and career academies. The requisite environment, context, resources, and equipment for a single cluster may be resource intensive. Since career clusters help convert labor market information into useable career information, career guidance and academic counseling programs use the career clusters to help students and parents understand and explore broad career pathways within and among the career clusters. Students can choose a career cluster in which to explore or specialize while gaining valuable, related skills. ", "Federal agencies also use career clusters and pathways. The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL's) Employment and Training Administration (ETA) categorizes occupations according to the career clusters in its O*NET database, which is the nation's primary source of occupational information. ED classifies instructional programs and courses of study according to the career clusters.

Some IRCs are recognized nationally, while others are recognized only regionally or locally. For example, Maryland licenses and regulates individuals who practice cosmetology in the state by requiring individuals to pass an exam and prove a number of hours of training or hours of apprenticeship.

Although \"recent studies of vocational course taking provide mixed results, \u2026 the more rigorous analyses do not support the compelling anecdotal evidence\" of a link between CTE and higher student engagement. In some cases, students may take a CTE course with no intention of pursuing a career in that area. For example, a student may take a class on computer programming because the class is of interest to the student, not because the student is considering becoming a computer programmer or even completing a career pathway in this area. In some cases, a school may offer courses in computer programming in an effort to broaden the students' education and provide early exposure to several career options to help students make informed decisions about their futures, not as part of a career pathway. On the other hand, some students may expect practical occupational preparation. Some schools are designed to ensure students are prepared to enter the workforce immediately with an industry-recognized credential after completion of a career pathway in high school or after one to two additional years of postsecondary education or training.
