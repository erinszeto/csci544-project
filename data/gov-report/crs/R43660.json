As a general matter, a \"gift\" is usually distinguished from something of value that is received as \"compensation\"; that is, compensation would be a payment of a fee, salary, or wage for some service rendered, while a gift is given without any such consideration in return. ", "Although the gift regulations apply only to federal employees themselves, there are circumstances in which gifts to others may be imputed to the federal employee.

Where a personal relationship develops from an on-going work relationship, it can be very difficult to clearly establish that the gift is not being given because of the employee's official position. A gift given out of appreciation for some action the employee took, particularly one that relates to an employee's official responsibilities, is not clearly motivated by a personal relationship. Therefore, an employee bears a considerable burden in establishing that a gift is based on a personal relationship rather than the employee's Government position. ...
