With exceptions, it makes the United States liable for injuries caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any federal employee acting within the scope of his employment, in accordance with the law of the state where the act or omission occurred. Three major exceptions, under which the United States may not be held liable, even in circumstances where a private person could be held liable under state law, are the Feres doctrine, which prohibits suits by military personnel for injuries sustained incident to service; the discretionary function exception, which immunizes the United States for acts or omissions of its employees that involve policy decisions; and the intentional tort exception, which precludes suits against the United States for assault and battery, among some other intentional torts, unless they are committed by federal law enforcement or investigative officials.", "This report discusses, among other things, the application of the Feres doctrine to suits for injuries caused by medical malpractice in the military, the prohibition of suits by victims of atomic testing, Supreme Court cases interpreting the discretionary function exception, the extent to which federal employees may be held liable for torts they commit in the scope of their employment, and the government contractor defense to products liability design defect suits.", "In the 111th Congress, three bills have been introduced that would amend the Federal Tort Claims Act: H.R. 1478/S. 1347, the Carmelo Rodriguez Military Medical Accountability Act of 2009, H.R. 3285, and S. 1578."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680, is the statute by which the United States authorizes tort suits to be brought against itself. As a result of the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity, \"the United States cannot be sued without its consent.\" \"Congress alone has the power to waive or qualify that immunity.\" In 1946, by enacting the FTCA, Congress waived sovereign immunity for some tort suits. With exceptions, it made the United States liable:", "for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.", "28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b).", "Thus, the FTCA makes the United States liable for the torts of its employees to the extent that private employers are liable under state law for the torts of their employees. The fact that state law would make a state or municipal entity\u2014as opposed to a private person\u2014liable under like circumstances is not sufficient to make the United States liable under the FTCA.", "The FTCA, however, contains exceptions under which the United States may not be held liable even though a private employer could be held liable under state law. Three of these exceptions are examined in separate sections of this report: the Feres doctrine, which prohibits suits by military personnel for injuries sustained incident to service; the discretionary function exception; and the intentional tort exception. Among the other exceptions, the United States may not be held liable in accordance with state law imposing strict liability; it may not be held liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674); for the act or omission of an employee exercising due care in the execution of an invalid statute or regulation (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680); for claims \"arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\"; for claims \"arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\"; for claims caused by the fiscal operations of the Treasury or by the regulation of the monetary system; for claims arising out of combatant activities; or for claims arising in a foreign country.", "Prior to filing suit under the FTCA, a claimant must present his claim to the federal agency out of whose activities the claim arises. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675. This must be done within two years after the claim accrues. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02401(b). If, within six months after receiving a claim, the agency mails a denial of the claim to the claimant, then the claimant has six months to file suit in federal district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401, 2675. No period of limitations applies to a plaintiff if the agency fails to act within six months after receiving his claim. Alternatively, if a claimant sues a federal employee, in federal or state court, for a tort committed while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment, the suit will be dismissed and the United States will be substituted as the defendant in federal district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1). At this point, the federal district court will dismiss the suit that is now against the United States because the plaintiff failed to present a claim to the appropriate federal agency. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02679(d)(5). The claimant may then file the claim with the appropriate federal agency, and, if he meets two conditions, it will not matter if he files the claim more than two years after the injury occurred. These conditions are that (A) the claimant had sued the federal employee within two years after the injury occurred, and (B) the claimant files the claim with the appropriate federal agency within 60 days after the dismissal of the suit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401(b); 2679(d)(5).", "Suits under the FTCA are tried without a jury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02402.", "An agency may not settle a claim for more than $25,000 without the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his designee, unless the Attorney General delegates to the head of the agency the authority to do so. \"Such delegations may not exceed the authority delegated by the Attorney General to United States attorneys to settle claims for money damages against the United States.\" United States attorneys are authorized to settle claims in amounts up to $1 million.

The Attorney General's certification conclusively establishes that the defendant had been acting within the \"scope of office or employment for purposes of remov[ing]\" a case from state court to federal district court. If the Attorney General refuses to certify that the federal employee \"was acting within scope of employment,\" then the employee may petition the court in which he was sued for certification that he had been acting within the scope of employment.

In Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno , 515 U.S. 417 (1995), the Supreme Court held that the Attorney General's certification that a federal employee acted within the scope of employment is reviewable in court. The majority opinion explained:", "When a federal employee is sued for a wrongful or negligent act, the [Westfall Act] empowers the Attorney General to certify that the employee \"was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose ...\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(1). Upon certification, the employee is dismissed from the action and the United States is substituted as defendant. The case then falls under the governance of the [FTCA]... If, however, an exception to the FTCA shields the United States from suit, the party may be left without a tort action against any party.", "Id . at 419-420. This is what occurred in this case, so, \"[e]ndeavoring to redeem their lawsuit, plaintiffs ... sought review of the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification, for if the employee was acting outside the scope of his employment, the plaintiffs' tort action could proceed against him. The lower court held the certification unreviewable.\" Id . at 420. The Supreme Court reversed, finding that \"Congress did not address this precise issue unambiguously, if at all,\" and \"that judicial review of executive action 'will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress.'\" Id . at 424.", "In Osborn v. Haley , 549 U.S. 225 (2007), a federal employee had been sued in state court, and the Attorney General had certified that the employee had been acting within the scope of employment. The federal district court had invalidated the Attorney General's certification, finding it improper because the government maintained that the incident in dispute never happened. The federal district court then remanded the suit to the state court, thereby preventing the United States from substituting itself as a defendant. The court of appeals vacated the district court decision and the Supreme Court affirmed the court of appeals decision. The Supreme Court held that the Attorney General's certification was proper and that the United States must remain as a substitute defendant \"unless and until the District Court determines that the employee, in fact ... engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment.\" 549 U.S. at 231. Next, the Supreme Court examined two conflicting statutory provisions to determine whether a case that the Attorney General had certified and that had been removed from a state court to a federal district court could be remanded to the state court. One provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02679(d)(2), states that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for the purposes of removing a case from a state court to a federal district court. The other provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01447(d), bars appellate review of \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed.\" The Supreme Court held that 28\u00a0U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2) controls, so that once an Attorney General certifies, requiring the action to be removed from state court to federal district court, the federal district court must retain jurisdiction and cannot remand.", "The application of the FTCA's statute of limitations to suits against the United States that were initially brought against a federal employee is discussed above in the \" Introduction .\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Feres Doctrine and Medical Malpractice", "paragraphs": ["In Feres v. United States , 340 U.S. 135 (1950), the Supreme Court unanimously held that, although the FTCA contains no explicit exclusion for injuries sustained by military personnel incident to service, such an exclusion results from construing the act \"to fit, so far as will comport with its words, into the entire statutory scheme of remedies against the Government to make a workable, consistent and equitable whole.\" 340 U.S. at 139. One reason the Court found that to prohibit recovery for injuries sustained incident to service would fit the entire statutory scheme was that the act, at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674, makes the United States liable only \"to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" This limitation could be construed to exclude service-connected injuries because, the Court found,", "that plaintiffs can point to no liability of a \"private individual\" even remotely analogous to that which they are asserting against the United States. We know of no American law which ever has permitted a soldier to recover for negligence, against either his superior officers or the Government he is serving. Nor is there any liability \"under like circumstances,\" for no private individual has power to conscript or mobilize a private army with such authorities over persons as the Government vests in echelons of command.", "340 U.S. at 141-142.", "Another basis for the Court's decision in Feres was that the act makes \"the law of the place where the act or omission occurred\" (28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01346(b)) govern liability, yet, in the case of a soldier, who is not free to choose his habitat, \"[t]hat the geography of an injury should select the law to be applied to his tort claims makes no sense.\" Id . at 143. The Court also was influenced by the fact that Congress has enacted laws that \"provide systems of simple, certain, and uniform compensation for injuries or death of those in armed services,\" yet Congress made no provision as to how recovery under the FTCA would affect entitlement to such compensation. \"The absence of any such adjustment is persuasive that there was no awareness that the act might be interpreted to permit recovery for injuries incident to military service.\" Id . at 144. The Court concluded:", "that the Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service. Without exception, the relationship of military personnel to the Government has been governed exclusively by federal law. We do not think that Congress, in drafting the Act, created a new cause of action dependent on local law for service-connected injuries or death due to negligence. We cannot impute to Congress such a radical departure from established law in the absence of express congressional command.", "340 U.S. at 146.", "In Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. v. United States , 431 U.S. 666, 671-672 (1977), the Supreme Court identified three rationales as the foundation for the Feres doctrine:", "First, the relationship between the Government and members of its Armed Forces is \"'distinctively federal in character,'\" ... ; it would make little sense to have the Government's liability to members of the Armed Services depend on the fortuity of where the soldier happened to be stationed at the time of the injury.", "Second, the Veterans' Benefits Act establishes as a substitute for tort liability, a statutory \"no fault\" compensation scheme which provides generous pensions to injured servicemen, without regard to any negligence attributable to the Government.", "A third factor was explicated in United States v. Brown , 348 U.S. 110, 112 (1954), namely, \"[t]he peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors, the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline, and the extreme results that might obtain if suits under the Tort Claims Act were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty ...\"", "The Supreme Court reaffirmed the Feres doctrine in United States v. Shearer , 473 U.S. 52 (1985), and again addressed the reasons for its adoption. \" Feres seems best explained,\" the Court wrote:", "\"by the 'peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors, the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline, and the extreme results that might obtain if suits under the Tort Claims Act were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty.'\" The Feres doctrine cannot be reduced to a few bright-line rules; each case must be examined in light of the statute as it has been construed in Feres and subsequent cases.", "473 U.S. at 57 (citations omitted).", "The Court emphasized that significant factors in determining whether the Feres doctrine bars a suit are \"whether the suit requires the civilian court to second-guess military decisions... and whether the suit might impair military discipline.\" Id . at 57. It noted that \"other factors mentioned in Feres\" are \"no longer controlling.\" Id . at 58 n.4. These other factors apparently were the distinctively federal nature of the relationship between the government and military personnel, and the alternative compensation system available to military personnel. Subsequently, however, in United States v. Johnson , 481 U.S. 681 (1987), discussed below, the Court reaffirmed these factors.", "In Atkinson v. United States , a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, relying primarily on Shearer , allowed a medical malpractice suit to be brought under the FTCA by a servicewoman who suffered injuries \"incident to service\" in an Army hospital. The government sought a rehearing, and, in the interim, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Johnson , supra , which caused the Ninth Circuit's panel to grant the rehearing and issue a new opinion in Atkinson , reversing itself. The Supreme Court subsequently declined to review the case. These three decisions\u2014the panel's first decision in Atkinson , Johnson , and the panel's second decision in Atkinson \u2014are now examined in turn.", "The plaintiff in Atkinson alleged that negligence on the part of Army hospital personnel had caused her to deliver a stillborn child and to suffer physical and emotional injuries. The panel, in its first decision, wrote:", "[T]he Feres doctrine bars suit only where a civilian court would be called upon to second-guess military decisions or where the plaintiff's admitted activities are of the sort that would directly implicate the need to safeguard military discipline... In Shearer , the Supreme Court also confirmed that courts should take a case-by-case, rather than per se , approach to claims [by the government] of immunity.", "804 F.2d at 563. Taking such an approach, the court wrote:", "At the time Atkinson sought treatment, she was \"not subject in any real way to the compulsion of military orders or performing any sort of military mission.\"... No command relationship exists between Atkinson and her attending physician. No military considerations govern the treatment in a non-field hospital of a woman who seeks to have a healthy baby. No military discipline applies to the care a conscientious physician will provide in this situation... There is simply no connection between Atkinson's medical treatment and the decisional or disciplinary interest protected by the Feres doctrine.", "Id . at 564-565.", "Note that this decision did not hold that all military malpractice suits are exempt from the Feres doctrine. In taking a case-by-case approach, the court allowed for the possibility of a situation in which there is a connection between a serviceman or servicewoman's \"medical treatment and the decisional or disciplinary interest protected by the Feres doctrine.\"", "In 1987, in United States v. Johnson , supra , the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, held that the Feres doctrine bars suits on behalf of military personnel injured incident to service even in cases of torts committed by employees of civilian agencies. The plaintiff in Johnson was the widow of a serviceman killed incident to service in a helicopter crash allegedly caused by the negligence of the Federal Aviation Administration. Reexamining the reasons for the Feres doctrine, the Court concluded that whether the tortfeasor was a civilian or a military employee was not significant. The reasons for the Feres doctrine that it reexamined, and reaffirmed, were the three cited in Stencel , set forth earlier in this report. Thus, it removed any doubts that it had cast in Shearer upon the significance of those factors.", "Justice Scalia, joined by three other justices in dissent, noted that the Feres doctrine is not in the FTCA as enacted by Congress, and found the reasons offered by the Court for adopting the doctrine to be unsatisfactory:", "[N]either the three original Feres reasons nor the post hoc rationalization of \"military discipline\" justifies our failure to apply the FTCA as written. Feres was wrongly decided and heartily deserves the \"widespread, almost universal criticism\" it has received.", "481 U.S. at 700.", "Citing Johnson , the Ninth Circuit's panel subsequently reversed itself in Atkinson :", "Significant for our purposes [the panel wrote] is the Court's articulation, with apparent approval, of all three rationales associated with Feres ... Simply put, Johnson appears to breathe new life into the first two Feres rationales, which until that time had been largely discredited and abandoned... Although we believe that the military discipline rationale does not support application of the Feres doctrine in this case, the first two rationales support its application... We are... reluctant to carve out an exception to Feres after five members of the Court appear to have emphatically endorsed Feres and all three of its rationales. That task, if it is to be undertaken at all, is properly left to the Supreme Court or to Congress.", "825 F.2d at 205-206.", "In Del Rio v. United States , 833 F.2d 282 (11 th Cir. 1987), a servicewoman who had given birth to twins brought a medical malpractice suit under the FTCA, alleging that, as a result of negligent prenatal care at a military hospital, one of her twins suffered bodily injury and the other died. The Eleventh Circuit held that the Feres doctrine, as interpreted in Johnson , barred her claim. It agreed with the Ninth Circuit's second decision in Atkinson that the first two Feres factors operated to preclude suit, but, unlike the Ninth Circuit, believed that even the third factor did so. \"Obviously,\" the court wrote, \"the suit ' might impair essential military discipline' ...\"", "In Irvin v. United States , 845 F.2d 126 (6 th Cir. 1988), cert. denied , 488 U.S. 975 (1988), another servicewoman alleged that negligent prenatal care by the military had resulted in her infant's death, and another court of appeals held that the Feres doctrine barred suit under the FTCA.", "In Bowers v. United States , 904 F.2d 450 (8 th Cir. 1990), the court held that the Feres doctrine precludes an individual from recovering for medical malpractice allegedly committed at his pre-induction physical. Although the plaintiff was not a service member at the time of the alleged negligence, and was not eligible for either veterans' benefits or treatment in a military hospital, the court found that two of the three Feres rationales spelled out in Johnson were applicable: \"the relationship between Bowers and the armed forces is distinctively federal,\" and a decision for Bowers \"would have a direct effect upon military judgments and decisions.\" Id . at 452.", "Thus, the Feres doctrine stands and contains no exception for medical malpractice cases. Because the first two Stencel factors\u2014the federal nature of the relationship between the government and military personnel, and the alternative compensation scheme\u2014would seem to apply in every case, there may not even be occasion for courts to use the case-by-case approach of Shearer . This could change, however, as a result of action by either the Supreme Court or Congress.", "As for the Supreme Court, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that it could completely overrule Feres . In Johnson , as noted, the four dissenting justices said that Feres had been wrongly decided, and even downplayed the significance of the fact that Congress since 1950 has not overturned Feres . 481 U.S. at 702 (Scalia, J., dissenting). As for Congress, some Members in the past have shown interest in amending the Feres doctrine to the extent of authorizing medical malpractice suits.", "Although Feres was an interpretation of the FTCA, it has been applied to bar suits against the United States under other statutes, including the Privacy Act.

The Supreme Court, applying the principles it had set forth in Dalehite , held:", "Here, the FAA has determined that a program of \"spot-checking\" manufacturers' compliance with minimum safety standards best accommodates the goal of air transportation safety and the reality of finite agency resources. Judicial intervention in such decisionmaking through private tort suits would require the courts to \"second-guess\" the political, social, and economic judgments of an agency exercising its regulatory function... It follows that the acts of FAA employees in executing the \"spot-check\" program in accordance with agency directives are protected by the discretionary function exception as well... The FAA employees who conducted compliance reviews of the aircraft involved in this case were specifically empowered to make policy judgments.", "Id. at 820.", "In Berkovitz v. United States , 486 U.S. 531 (1988), the Supreme Court held that the United States could be held liable under the FTCA, because the plaintiffs had proved that federal employees had failed to follow regulations that specifically prescribed a course of action. The plaintiffs were an infant, who had contracted a severe case of polio from a dose of Orimune, an oral polio vaccine, and his parents. They claimed that the Division of Biologic Standards, then a part of the National Institutes of Health, had violated a federal statute and accompanying regulations in issuing a license to a vaccine manufacturer to produce Orimune, and that the Bureau of Biologics of the Food and Drug Administration had violated federal regulations in approving the release of the particular lot that contained the dose that injured the infant. The regulatory scheme governing licensing in Berkovitz , unlike the one challenged in Varig , did not permit spot-checking; it required the agency, \"prior to issuing a product license, to receive all data the manufacturer is required to submit, examine the product, and make a determination that the product complies with safety standards.\" Id . at 542. The regulatory scheme governing release of vaccine lots apparently would have given the agency the power to establish a spot-checking program as was used in Varig . However, the plaintiffs alleged that the agency had:", "adopted a policy of testing all vaccine lots for compliance with safety standards and preventing the distribution to the public of any lots that fail to comply. [Plaintiffs] further allege that notwithstanding this policy, which allegedly leaves no room for implementing officials to exercise independent policy judgment, employees of the Bureau knowingly approved a lot that did not comply with safety standards.", "Id . at 547.", "The Court sent the case back for trial, holding that if these allegations were proved, then the discretionary function exception would not bar the claim.

Gaubert , 499 U.S. 315 (1991), the Court held that the discretionary function exception barred suit against the United States for the activities of federal bank regulators in connection with a failing savings and loan association, the Independent American Savings Association (IASA). The regulators became \"involved in IASA's day-to-day business. They recommended the hiring of a certain consultant to advise IASA on operational and financial matters; they advised IASA concerning whether, when, and how its subsidiaries should be placed into bankruptcy; they mediated salary disputes; they reviewed the draft of a complaint to be used in litigation; they urged IASA to convert from state to federal charter; and they actively intervened when the Texas Savings and Loan Department attempted to install a supervisory agent at IASA.\" Id . at 319-320.", "The plaintiff, who was IASA's chairman of the board and largest shareholder, alleged that these activities were performed negligently and cost him $100 million in damages.

The court of appeals found that only some of the regulators' activities were protected by the discretionary function exception: while \"policy decisions\" fall within the exception, \"operational actions\" do not.

United States , 487 U.S. 392 (1988), three naval corpsmen found a naval enlisted man named Carr unconscious from alcohol consumption and attempted to take him to a hospital emergency room. Before they reached the emergency room, Carr regained consciousness, broke away from the corpsmen, and displayed the barrel of his rifle to them. The corpsmen fled and did not alert any authority that Carr was inebriated and armed. Carr ended up near a public street and began shooting at passing vehicles, hitting one of the plaintiffs.", "Because of the intentional tort exception, the plaintiffs in Sheridan could not sue the government based on Carr's shooting. Therefore, they sued the government based on the three corpsmen's negligence in failing to alert authorities as to the threat posed by Carr. The government argued that the intentional tort exception barred this claim because, even though it was based on negligence, it was a claim \"arising out\" of assault or battery within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02680(h). The Supreme Court did not rule on the government's argument because it decided for the plaintiff on another ground: that the intentional tort exception should \"be construed to apply only to claims that would otherwise be authorized by the basic waiver of sovereign immunity... The tortious conduct of an off-duty serviceman, not acting within the scope of his office or employment, does not itself give rise to Government liability, whether that conduct is intentional or merely negligent.\" Id . at 400-401. This is because the FTCA makes the government liable only for torts committed by an employee while acting \"within the scope of his office or employment.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01346(b). Thus, since the government could not be liable for Carr's acts, the intentional tort exception did not apply to bar a suit based on the negligence of others that led to Carr's acts, even if, as the government argued, the suit arose out of Carr's intentional tort. Had Carr not been a federal employee at all, the result would have been the same: since the government could not be liable for Carr's acts, whether such acts were negligent or intentional, the intentional tort exception would not apply to bar a suit based on the negligence of federal employees that led to Carr's intentional tort.", "The Court left open the question whether a suit based on the \"negligent hiring, negligent supervision, or negligent training may ever provide the basis for liability under the FTCA for a foreseeable assault or battery by a Government employee [acting within the scope of his employment].\" Id . at 403 n.8.

United Technologies Corp. , 487 U.S. 500, 504 (1988), the Supreme Court held that \"uniquely federal interests\" in the government's procurement of equipment require that a \"government contractor defense\" be available in certain cases. This is a defense that manufacturers may assert in products liability cases alleging design defects. These are cases, brought under state law, in which the plaintiff alleges that his injuries were caused by a product that was defective in that the manufacturer failed to use the safest feasible design for the product. In its defense, the manufacturer may assert that it manufactured the product pursuant to a government contract and that the design it used was required by contract specifications. In Boyle , the Supreme Court held that, notwithstanding state law, \"federal common law\" requires that the government contractor defense be available in certain cases. This is because \"[t]he imposition of liability on Government contractors will directly affect the terms of Government contracts: either the contractor will decline to manufacture the design specified by the Government, or it will raise its price. Either way, the interests of the United States will be directly affected.\" Id . at 507.", "The Court found that displacement of state law will occur only where \"a 'significant conflict' exists between an identifiable 'federal policy or interest and the [operation] of state law,'... or the application of state law would 'frustrate specific objectives' of federal legislation ...\" Id .

In some cases, however, the state-imposed duty of care will not conflict with the federal contract, or, even if it does, will not be significant, as where \"a federal procurement officer orders, by model number, a quantity of stock [items that happen to have a design defect].\" Id . In such cases, the government contractor defense would not be available.", "Boyle was a suit by the father of a Marine who had been killed incident to service in a helicopter accident, allegedly caused by the helicopter's having been defectively designed. The lower court had allowed the government contractor defense on the basis of the reasoning behind the Feres doctrine. As the Supreme Court explained: \"Military contractor liability would conflict with this doctrine, the Fourth Circuit reasoned, since the increased cost of the contractor's tort liability would be added to the price of the contract, and '[s]uch pass-through costs would ... defeat the purpose of the immunity for military accidents conferred upon the government itself.'\" Id . at 510. The Supreme Court did not adopt the Feres doctrine as the basis for the government contractor defense:", "Since that doctrine covers only service-related injuries, and not injuries caused by the military to civilians, it could not be invoked to prevent, for example, a civilian's suit against the manufacturer of fighter planes, based on a state tort theory, claiming harm from what is alleged to be needlessly high levels of noise produced by jet engines. Yet we think that the character of the jet engines the Government orders for its fighter planes cannot be regulated by state tort law, no more in suits by civilians than in suits by members of the Armed Services.", "Id . at 510-511. Rather, the Court found that the reasoning behind the discretionary function exception furnished a better basis for the government contractor defense:", "We think that the selection of the appropriate design for military equipment to be used by our Armed Forces is assuredly a discretionary function within the meaning of this provision... The financial burden of judgments against the contractors would ultimately be passed through, substantially if not totally, to the United States itself, since defense contractors will predictably raise their prices to cover, or to insure against, contingent liability for the Government-ordered designs... In sum, we are of the view that state law which holds Government contractors liable for design defects in military equipment does in some circumstances present a \"significant conflict\" with federal policy and must be displaced.", "Id . at 511-512. Delineating these circumstances, the Court ruled:", "Liability for design defects in military equipment cannot be imposed, pursuant to state law, when (1) the United States approved reasonably precise specifications; (2) the equipment conformed to those specifications; and (3) the supplier warned the United States about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the United States. The first two of these conditions assure that the suit is within the area where the policy of the \"discretionary function\" would be frustrated\u2014 i.e. , they assure that the design feature in question was considered by a Government officer, and not merely by the contractor itself. The third condition is necessary because, in its absence, the displacement of state tort law would create some incentive for the manufacturer to withhold knowledge of risks ... [thereby] cutting off information highly relevant to the discretionary decision.", "Id . at 512.", "Although the defendant in Boyle was a military contractor, and the Court throughout its opinion refers to military equipment, the fact that it based its opinion on the discretionary function exception and not on the Feres doctrine seems to indicate that the government contractor defense is available to both civilian and military contractors. In Nielson v. George Diamond Vogel Paint Co. , 892 F.2d 1450 (9 th Cir. 1990), the court acknowledged that the Supreme Court's reliance on the discretionary function exception meant that the government contractor defense can in principle apply to civilian equipment. \"Yet,\" it added, \"the policy behind the defense remains rooted in considerations peculiar to the military.\" Id . at 1455. In the case before it, which involved civilian equipment, it found \"no reason to hold that the application of state law would create a 'significant conflict' with federal policy requiring a displacement of state law.\" Id .

As to the first, the Court held that there was no contract either express or implied in fact; as to the second, the Court held that the government \"warrants that the contractor will be able to perform the contract satisfactorily if it follows the specifications\" ( id . at 425), but that this warranty does not extend to third-party claims against the contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Suits by Victims of Atomic Testing", "paragraphs": ["From 1946 to 1962, approximately 235 tests of atomic weapons were performed by federal government contractors.

In the instant case, no evidence was presented of any act or omission of the AEC or its employees that clearly contravened a specific statutory or regulatory authority. There was no evidence, for example that the Test Information Officer failed to give out, or that the Radsafe Officer failed to take a specific radiation measurement that had been decided upon.

Federal law, however, bars victims of atomic testing from suing federal government contractors. Section 1631 of P.L. 98-525 , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2212 (known as the \"Warner Amendment\"), provides that an action against the United States under the FTCA shall be the exclusive remedy for injuries \"due to exposure to radiation based on acts or omissions by a contractor in carrying out an atomic weapons testing program under a contract with the United States.\" Under this provision, a contractor's employees shall be considered federal employees for purposes of any lawsuit.", "Thus, the Warner Amendment makes suits against the United States under the FTCA the exclusive remedy for claims based on atomic testing injuries. This remedy, however, is illusory, because the Feres doctrine precludes recovery by military personnel and the discretionary function exception precludes recovery by anyone. The constitutionality of the Warner Amendment has been upheld by two federal courts of appeals.

Before examining federal employees' immunity from liability for constitutional torts, however, it is necessary to discuss their liability for such torts. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents , 403 U.S. 388 (1971), federal agents, without a warrant, entered and searched the plaintiff's apartment and arrested the plaintiff for alleged narcotics violations. A state official who commits such a tort, in addition to being subject to liability under state tort law, may be sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983, which provides that any person who, under color of any state statute, deprives another person of rights secured by the Constitution or a federal statute, shall be liable to the person injured. A federal official who commits a constitutional tort is not subject to liability under state tort law (because of the Westfall Act), and no statute similar to \u00a7 1983 makes federal officials liable under federal law for violating another person's constitutional rights. In Bivens and subsequent cases, however, the Supreme Court held that such a statute is not necessary for an injured party to recover damages from a federal official who commits a constitutional tort. \"Having concluded that petitioner's complaint states a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment, supra , at 390-395, we hold that petitioner is entitled to recover money damages for any injuries he has suffered as a result of the agents' violation of the Amendment.\" Id . at 397.", "Subsequently, however, the Supreme Court indicated \"that such a remedy may not be available when 'special factors counselling hesitation' are present.\" Chappell v.

The plaintiff had sought to distinguish his case from Chappell on the grounds that, unlike in Chappell ,", "the defendants in this case were not Stanley's superior military officers, and indeed may well have been civilian personnel, and that the chain-of-command concerns at the heart of Chappell ... are thus not implicated. Second, Stanley argues that there is no evidence that this injury was \"incident to service.\"", "Id . at 679-680. The Court found that the second argument was not available to Stanley because the issue of service incidence had been decided adversely to him previously.", "As for his first argument, Stanley and the lower courts may well be correct that Chappell implicated military chain-of-command concerns more directly than do the facts alleged here... It is therefore true that Chappell is not strictly controlling, in the sense that no holding can be broader than the facts before the court.", "Id . at 680. However, the Court added:", "Since Feres did not consider the officer-subordinate relationship crucial, but established instead an \"incident to service\" test, it is plain that our reasoning in Chappell does not support the distinction Stanley would rely on... Today, no more than when we wrote Chappell , do we see any reason why our judgment in the Bivens context should be any less protective of military concerns than it has been with respect to FTCA suits, where we adopted an \"incident to service\" rule.", "Id . at 680-681.
