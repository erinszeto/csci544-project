The year 2015 may be a pivotal year for making progress toward the objectives of both of these laws. It could also be a year in which the democratic aspirations of many Hong Kong residents remain unfulfilled.", "Hong Kong's current Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying, initiated a six-step process in July 2014 whereby Hong Kong's Basic Law could be amended to allow the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage in 2017. On August 31, 2014, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) completed the second step of the reform process when it issued a decision setting comparatively strict conditions on the adoption of universal suffrage for the 2017 CE elections that seemingly preclude the nomination of a pro-democracy candidate. The third step of the process, the CE submitting legislation to Legco to amend the Basic Law, came on June 17. On June 18, Legco defeated the proposed election reforms by a vote of 28 against and 8 in favor of the legislation, completing the fourth step and terminating one path to universal suffrage.", "Public opinion in Hong Kong over the proposed CE election reforms is split, with opinion surveys showing a sharp division of opinion on accepting the NPCSC's conditions. In the autumn of 2014, anger in Hong Kong over the NPCSC's August 2014 decision precipitated the occupation of several major Hong Kong roads by thousands of Hong Kong residents. These occupations were ended in December 2014 by the deployment of thousands of police officers, but scattered protests continue.", "The democratization of Hong Kong not only has implications for U.S. relations with Hong Kong, but also for U.S. relations with China and the political development of Taiwan and cross-Strait relations.", "In response to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Members of the 113th Congress introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (H.R. 5696 and S. 2922), to amend the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.

Although China's leaders have agreed in principle that the Chief Executive for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (HKSAR) may be chosen by universal suffrage in 2017, the conditions placed on the method of nominating candidates may prove to be unacceptable to the people of Hong Kong and the city's legislature, the Legislative Council (Legco). ", "Hong Kong's current Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying (C.Y. Leung), submitted his proposed resolution to change the CE selection process to Legco on June 17, 2015. Controversies over restrictions on the CE's proposal to Legco imposed by an August 2014 decision of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) have led to ongoing protests across Hong Kong and serious opposition from some Legco members. On June 18, 2015, Legco voted 28 against and 8 in favor, thereby defeating the resolution. It remains to be seen if this effectively ends prospects for reforming the CE selection method before the 2017 election, or if the NPCSC, CE Leung, or Legco will identify a new path toward the CE's election by universal suffrage. ", "Since Hong Kong's reversion from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, many of the people of Hong Kong have looked forward to and campaigned for the fulfilment of the promise contained in the city's Basic Law\u2014the election of the Chief Executive and Legco by universal suffrage. Past attempts to reform Hong Kong's election process have had mixed results. In December 2005, Legco voted down proposed CE election reforms after up to 250,000 people rallied against the proposed reforms. On December 29, 2007, in response to a request from then CE Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, the NPCSC issued \"Decision on Issues Relating to the Methods of Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the Year 2012 and on Issues Relating to Universal Suffrage,\" which stated that the Chief Executive may be elected by universal suffrage in 2017. Despite the apparent promise in the NPCSC's December 2007 decision, legislation in 2010 to make modest changes in the CE selection process were approved by Legco only after the PRC government and Hong Kong's Democratic Party struck a last-minute agreement.", "The prospects for democratic election reforms in Hong Kong are of potential interest to Congress for several reasons. First, the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5731; P.L. 102-383 ) states, \"Support for democratization is a fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy. As such, it naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong Kong.\" Second, how China handles the possible democratic election reforms in Hong Kong is one indicator of its commitment to its \"one country, two systems\" policy as it applies to Hong Kong, as well as its tolerance of political reform in general. Third, Hong Kong plays an important role for U.S. economic interests in Asia. If the Chinese and Hong Kong governments are unable to formulate CE election reforms acceptable to Legco and the people of Hong Kong, possibly continued and intensified political unrest could harm Hong Kong's ability to function as an economic hub for U.S. interests in Asia.

All of the pro-democracy Legco members, commonly referred to as the \"pan-democrats,\" have stated they will vote against any proposal that complies with the August 2014 NPCSC decision. The various pro-democracy voices in Hong Kong have called upon the NPCSC to revise or amend its August 2014 decision to provide for more flexibility in the nomination process, and have pressed CE Leung to urge NPCSC to reconsider the constraints imposed by its decision. Neither the Chinese government nor the Hong Kong government has demonstrated a willingness to reconsider their decisions regarding the 2017 CE election reforms. ", "Underlying the objections to the NPCSC August 2014 decision is the perception that the constraints violate the spirit and the intent of past commitments by the Chinese government to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy over its governance and a promise to allow the people of Hong Kong to elect their Chief Executive through a free and fair democratic process. These perceived promises and commitments can be traced back at least 25 years to the 1990 passage of the Basic Law, and contribute to the sense of frustration among many Hong Kong residents with the latest NPCSC decision.

Some observers of Hong Kong/Mainland relations perceive a gradual drift in Hong Kong towards its taking on characteristics associated with Mainland China. Such observers argue that this drift has in part been caused by greater interaction between Hong Kong and Mainland China, and has in part been the result of Chinese government policies toward Hong Kong. According to this analysis, rather than Mainland China taking on characteristics of Hong Kong, Hong Kong is slowly becoming more and more like Mainland China.

Critics also note that the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Liaison Office) has commented publicly about local political issues in Hong Kong with greater frequency.

Hong Kong's economy has become increasingly reliant on the Mainland economy, and a growing number of businesses in Hong Kong are owned by or are subsidiaries of Mainland companies. In addition, Hong Kong's retail sector is increasingly geared to serving the demand of the over 50 million Mainland visitors, and the thousands of new Mainland immigrants to Hong Kong each year. The Hong Kong press routinely contains accounts of conflict between Mainland tourists and immigrants and local Hong Kong residents over cultural and behavioral differences. Some Hong Kong residents have expressed fear that their city is being taken over by Mainland companies and immigrants.
