It was designed to facilitate cooperation between U.S. and foreign courts and to clarify administration of three types of international insolvency proceedings: (1) full or \"main\" bankruptcy proceedings, commenced either in the U.S. with cooperation sought from foreign courts or vice versa; (2) ancillary proceedings, such as limited requests to administer specific assets under U.S. jurisdiction; and (3) requests to suspend or dismiss U.S. proceedings so as to avoid conflicts with foreign proceedings already in progress. Provisions addressing these situations in current law first appeared in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 and were codified primarily at 11 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 303-306. In response to practitioner requests for greater multilateral cooperation, from 1994 to 1997 the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) developed a Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (Model Law). The BAPCPA implemented the Model Law by adding chapter 15 to the Code. Chapter 15 replaced 11 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 304, which was repealed; modified 11 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 303, 305, and 306; and addressed other concerns.

Cooperation between courts of different jurisdictions is essential to efficiently identify, preserve, manage, and allocate the debtor's dispersed assets. Such cooperation between courts is called \"comity\" or \"reciprocity\" and may be procedural or substantive in form.", "Comity is the voluntary consideration of laws or judicial decisions made in another jurisdiction. Reciprocity is the recognition and enforcement of laws, privileges, or judicial decisions made in another jurisdiction. In cross-border insolvency proceedings, procedural cooperation can give the foreign creditor or trustee: (1) the right to appear and request that the host court declare a debtor insolvent, (2) the ability to enforce a foreign court order for turnover of assets in the host jurisdiction, and (3) assurance that the assets within the host jurisdiction will be preserved until a final ruling is issued. Procedural cooperation also involves communication (e.g., notifying creditors of proceedings and deadlines, exchanging transcripts and documentation, updating other courts with new information, overseeing administration of reorganization or liquidation plans).", "Substantive cooperation has been the principal obstacle for foreign creditors and trustees who may find their claims unrecognized by the host court or subordinated to those of domestic parties in interest. U.S. creditors and trustees encountered such problems abroad. Likewise, foreign creditors and trustees found their claims against a debtor's assets impacted by U.S. state statutes\u00e2\u0080\u0094depending on the nature of the claim (e.g., wages, mortgages) or by its timing (e.g., local parties in interest usually were the first to file their claims)\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than participating in a single pro rata distribution among all parties who filed claims by a set deadline.", "In the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, several nations entered into bankruptcy treaties or held international conferences in order to facilitate the handling of concurrent bankruptcies in multiple jurisdictions. The U.S. did not enter into these treaties, opting instead to maximize judicial discretion for the relatively few international insolvency cases that U.S. courts encountered. This ad hoc system existed until three high-profile cases in the mid-1970s gave impetus to the 1978 reforms regarding international insolvency. The discussion below summarizes the developments from the mid-1970s through 2005 that led to the enactment of chapter 15."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Critical Cases in the Mid-1970s", "paragraphs": ["Three high-profile cases gave impetus to the enactment of 11 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 303-306 in 1978. These cases involved foreign banks that were declared insolvent abroad but held assets in the U.S. Prior to 1978, \"[f]oreign banks desiring to establish a direct U.S. presence obtained state licenses\" and fell under separate rules for insolvent banks. However, none of the three banks (Herstatt, IBB, or Finabank ) had a direct presence in the U.S. None had an office or had done business in the U.S.; they only had accounts with major U.S. banks in order to settle foreign exchange contracts. Were the three entities banks or corporations under U.S. law? Confusion arose because the foreign banks' structure did not clearly correspond to U.S. forms of business organization (e.g., corporation, partnership).", "The central issue in all three cases was whether the foreign bank was covered by or exempt from the predecessor to the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. If the banks were subject to the 1898 Act, then they would be entitled to file a petition for voluntary bankruptcy, just like any other corporation, and benefit from the fact that certain claims made against their assets within four months prior to filing would be voidable preferences under U.S. law. Voiding transactions made within four months prior to the debtor's filing was intended to promote equity among all creditors, rather than favoring those creditors who first sensed that the debtor was going to declare bankruptcy.", "The 1898 Act, as amended, was silent regarding Congress' intended coverage of foreign banks. If the foreign banks were \"banking corporations\" under U.S. law, then they would be exempt from coverage under the 1898 Act and would be subject to the separate regime for insolvent banks. If the banks were simply foreign corporations, akin to a partnership, then they would be eligible to file a petition under the bankruptcy law.", "Major U.S. banks attached claims to the foreign banks' U.S. accounts, arguing that the foreign banks were banking corporations, ineligible to file for bankruptcy. The three foreign banks tried to have the U.S. attachments voided and the funds turned over to their respective liquidators, each of whom had been appointed by a non-U.S. court. If the U.S. banks prevailed, their claims would have been satisfied in full, outside of bankruptcy, in the order in which their attachments had been made\u00e2\u0080\u0094until the foreign banks' assets were exhausted. If the foreign banks prevailed, then all of the U.S. banks would be required to participate in the foreign liquidation plan in which creditors would receive pro rata distribution, most likely partial recoupment or \"pennies on the dollar.\" Decisions by the Southern District Court for New York and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit regarding this central issue, and others, would inform \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 303-306.", "The American and German parties in Herstatt settled, but the Second Circuit issued decisions in IBB and Finabank to (1) assert the 1898 Act's coverage over foreign banks holding assets, but not doing business, in the U.S., and (2) set a tone of comity, if not reciprocity, in concurrent international insolvency proceedings. In IBB , the Second Circuit viewed its role \"to be in aid of the order of the High Court [of England].\" In Finabank , the Second Circuit acknowledged the pending Swiss proceeding and noted the Swiss proceeding's stated objective to ensure an equitable outcome for all of Finabank's creditors. Congress incorporated these criteria\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Second Circuit's sense of comity and assurance of protection of U.S. creditors\u00e2\u0080\u0094in \u00c2\u00a7 304 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.", "In IBB , the English Receiver and Provisional Liquidator filed the voluntary bankruptcy petition in New York with the express intention of preserving IBB's U.S. assets for distribution among all of the bank's creditors. The Second Circuit not only relied on the High Court's order appointing New York counsel to file the petition, but also on the reciprocity that would exist if the situations were reversed. Under English law, an English court could void attachments made within six months prior to a petition for \"winding up.\"", "The Second Circuit reversed the lower courts' dismissal of Finabank's chapter 11 petition and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court. Finabank had filed the U.S. petition while a Swiss proceeding determined Finabank's prospects for rehabilitation. (A Swiss court ultimately ordered Finabank to be liquidated. ) The petition was incomplete because Swiss banking law prohibited Finabank from revealing the names and addresses of depositors and creditors. The Second Circuit held that Finabank's filing of the chapter 11 petition in order to frustrate the U.S. creditors' attachments was insufficient to prove that Finabank did not truly intend to seek rehabilitation, but failure to file a complete list of creditors was fatal because that requirement had never been waived for any debtor. \"Flexibility in the international context of course should not come at the expense of the orderly administration of the [Bankruptcy] Act.\" Nevertheless, the Second Circuit acknowledged that Finabank was atypical and opened the door to two options upon remand: (1) permitting assets in the U.S. to be administered by a Swiss proceeding, or (2) coordinating a full proceeding in the U.S. with a Swiss court.", "By the conclusion of these three cases in 1977, additional cross-border insolvency cases involving non-banks and complicated fact patterns were emerging. The circumstances were ripe for Congress to clarify procedures for administering cross-border insolvency cases.

Section 306 granted the foreign representative the right to make a limited appearance (i.e., not be subject to a court's jurisdiction for any proceeding unrelated to the\u00c2\u00a0bankruptcy).", "Section 303 responded directly to the three banking cases. In order to thwart the use of U.S. law to force a foreign bank into bankruptcy, \u00c2\u00a7 303(k) prohibited a foreign bank from being placed in bankruptcy in the U.S. unless a foreign proceeding was already pending against the bank.", "Before the enactment of \u00c2\u00a7 304, a foreign representative seeking relief involving assets located in the United States had two choices: \"resort to litigation in state or federal nonbankruptcy courts or subject the debtor's estate to a full bankruptcy case.\" Section 304(c) enumerated six factors that the court could consider to determine whether to grant relief in addition to formally recognizing \"principles of international comity and respect for the judgments and laws of other nations\":", "In determining whether to grant relief ... the court shall be guided by what will best assure an economical and expeditious administration of such estate, consistent with", "(1) just treatment of all holders of claims against or interests in such estate;", "(2) protection of claim holders in the United States against prejudice and inconvenience in the processing of claims in such foreign proceeding;", "(3) prevention of preferential or fraudulent dispositions of property of such estate;", "(4) distribution of proceeds of such estate substantially in accordance with the order prescribed by this title;", "(5) comity; and", "(6) if appropriate, the provision of an opportunity for a fresh start for the individual that such foreign proceeding concerns.", "\"The U.S. Bankruptcy Code [became] one of the few national bankruptcy laws in the world to deal directly with the effect of foreign bankruptcies, and specifically with the recognition to be given to the representative of a foreign bankruptcy in court.\" The role of the foreign representative would prove to be quite valuable, as illustrated by the Singer reorganization of 1999-2001. The Singer Company, N.V., successor in interest to the Singer Sewing Machine Company, and 46 affiliates filed chapter 11 petitions in 1999. The bankruptcy judge appointed two of Singer's lawyers to act as foreign representatives, pursuing \"the essential objective of ensuring that all creditors, wherever located, were treated equally.\"", "The lawyers were already familiar with Singer's situation. In their capacity as foreign representatives, they took steps to prevent local creditors from attaching Singer's assets and to negotiate a global agreement among Singer's creditors that leveraged the creditors' other business relationships in the U.S. \"[N]ot once did Singer actually need to seek bankruptcy court relief with respect to potential violations of the automatic stay.\" Upon filing in bankruptcy, the automatic stay immediately enjoins all entities from collection activities against a debtor or the debtor's property. To be effective in international insolvency, an automatic stay imposed by a court in one country must be recognized and enforced by courts in other countries.", "Despite these provisions in the 1978 Act, the original tensions remained between the principal objective of preserving assets wherever located and the territorial limitations on courts' jurisdiction. Lawyers, regulators, judges, and academics working in the field of bankruptcy called for improved multilateral cooperation.

Protocols were used successfully to coordinate multiple main proceedings for multinational bankruptcies, such as Maxwell Communication Corporation PLC. Yet, uncertainty remained regarding substantive cooperation in areas such as foreign recognition of U.S. judgments regarding chapter 11 reorganization plans and U.S. authority to pursue violations of the automatic stay. Other countries, such as England and Canada (two of the United States' largest trade and investment partners), did not recognize discharges of indebtedness as orders of U.S. courts. Thus, a final judgment rendered in one country might not settle the case in all jurisdictions. The following excerpt from a statement before a congressional subcommittee illustrates these problems.", "In a case known as Paolo Gucci , we, for example, discovered real estate, very valuable real estate in England held in a Liberian corporation.... We retained solicitors only to learn that the U.S. bankruptcy and the U.S. bankruptcy trustee was not entitled to recognition [in England], the law was not clear, and that we would have to commence litigation.... Also in this Paolo Gucci case, during the case, post-bankruptcy, in violation of our automatic stay, a party in Korea attached valuable Korean trademarks which belonged to the estate. We are now litigating that issue in the Korean courts. Our Korean counsel advised us that our automatic stay would not be recognized and that attachment is holding up a very large sum of money which we are due to receive under a sale of assets, but we need to clear up the attachment first.", "Harmonizing substantive bankruptcy law on a global, or even regional scale, would be very difficult. Although the Europeans did not implement the European Union Regulation on Insolvency until May 2002, their dual-approach of harmonizing international procedures while acknowledging differences in individual nation's substantive laws inspired three other multilateral initiatives to harmonize bankruptcy laws: (1) the American Law Institute (ALI)'s Transnational Insolvency Project, in conjunction with NAFTA; (2) the International Bar Association's Committee J Cross-Border Insolvency Concordat ; and (3) the United Nations Conference on International Trade and Investment's (UNCITRAL's) Model Law of Cross-Border Insolvency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of the Model Law", "paragraphs": ["The need for comity in international insolvency had long been acknowledged by the parties most directly involved in such proceedings, but practical considerations lay between conceptualization and implementation.

The Working Group opted for a model law rather than a convention because the former offers greater flexibility. A nation can incorporate sections of a model law and tailor it to complement its existing law, whereas ratifying and executing treaties tends to be a more formal and rigid process.", "The issue of automatic stays illustrates the difficulties encountered and compromises reached in harmonizing the ground rules.", "It was noted that the main purpose of the stay of individual action was to prevent the debtor's\u00c2\u00a0assets from being dispersed through enforcement measures ordered in individual actions.

On December 15, 1997, without a vote, the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 52/158 recommending that all members review their insolvency laws in light of the Model Law. To further its objective of providing a prototype for procedural cooperation between national governments, UNCITRAL subsequently released a legislative guide.
