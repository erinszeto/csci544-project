{"id": "R44242", "title": "The Effect of Base-Broadening Measures on Labor Supply and Investment: Considerations for Tax Reform", "released_date": "2015-10-22T00:00:00", "summary": ["One source of interest in a tax reform that broadens the base and lowers the rate is the potential increase in growth, as labor supply and investment respond to lower marginal tax rates. Yet, studies of a signature reform in the past, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, found little effect on growth. The act was revenue and distributionally neutral, which is a goal of some recent tax reform proposals. One reason advanced for the limited effects on growth is that the effects of provisions that broaden the base to finance lower statutory rates increase effective marginal tax rates for some taxpayers.", "This report shows how options to broaden the tax base by placing limitations on itemized deductions can potentially work counter to the growth effects of reducing marginal tax rates, primarily through reducing labor supply. It also shows how these effects\u2014along with other base-broadening provisions, such as slowing depreciation\u2014limit the effects on investment and savings and can eventually reduce the size of the capital stock in the economy. The effects on labor supply and the capital stock are considered in turn.", "To examine the potential effects of base broadening on effective tax rates facing labor, the analysis examines provisions to eliminate itemized deductions for state and local taxes, for charitable contributions, and for both. It also examines provisions to eliminate itemized deductions altogether or to impose dollar caps ($17,000 and $25,000). Eliminating itemized deductions would raise effective marginal tax rates by almost two percentage points on average and is estimated, using common behavioral responses, to reduce labor supply by 0.2% to 0.6%. These effects are significant compared to projected effects in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1, 113th Congress), where labor supply was projected to increase by 0.4% to 0.8%. More limited restrictions to itemized deductions result in smaller reductions in labor supply.", "Similar to the analysis for labor supply, the potential effects of base broadening on effective tax rates for capital investment are examined. The analysis includes two itemized deduction restrictions: disallowing the deduction for state and local taxes and disallowing all itemized deductions. Eliminating these provisions increases the effective marginal tax rate on business income, interest income, dividends, and capital gains. It also included the effects of three provisions that affect how quickly an investment is recovered. One is to move to the alternative depreciation system that forms the baseline for measuring the benefits of accelerated depreciation. The other two provisions are to depreciate two types of intangible investments, research and development and advertising, over a 10-year period. The analysis also considered repeal of the production activities deduction (which allows a 9% deduction from taxable income for certain domestic production, such as manufacturing) and indexation of interest deductions and payments for inflation.", "Moving to the alternative depreciation system had the greatest effect, reducing the long-run capital stock (using a range of behavioral responses) by 0.8% to 1.6%. It more than offset the effect of a 10 percentage point corporate rate reduction. Indexing interest deductions and payments for inflation had the next largest effect, 0.5% to 1.1%. Repealing itemized deductions for state and local taxes reduced the capital stock by 0.1% to 0.2%, and repealing all itemized deductions reduced it by 0.1% to 0.3%. Repealing all itemized deductions offset about a third of the effect of reducing the statutory corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points.", "An inevitable characteristic of a revenue-neutral tax reform is a tendency to balance out positive and negative effects on labor supply and growth. Revenue-neutral tax reform may have other virtues, but given the inevitable trade-off of such an approach, a major impact on growth may not be one of them."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T he federal tax system has the ability to influence the economy and decisions of individual taxpayers. This influence has engendered a healthy debate about the extent to which the current federal tax system promotes the socially optimal amounts of economic growth and income redistribution.", "This debate has played itself out in recent years in the context of tax reform. In these discussions, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86, P.L. 99-514 ) is often used to represent an example for tax reform. TRA86 lowered marginal tax rates by broadening the tax base for both individuals and corporations, while roughly maintaining revenue and distributional neutrality. ", "While there are many possible goals for tax reform, subsequent economic analysis of TRA86 did not find the significant supply-side effects some expected from the reductions in marginal tax rates that occurred as part of the act. Supply-side growth results from factors that reduce effective marginal tax rates . According to advocates of supply-side economics, high marginal tax rates strongly discourage income, output, and the efficiency of resource use.", "In a meta-analysis of the economic effects of TRA86, Auerbach and Slemrod suggest that large supply-side effects were not observed because the reduction in marginal tax rates overstates the overall reduction in effective marginal tax rates, once other provisions are taken into account. As the authors state,", "The constraints put on the tax reform\u2014revenue and distributional neutrality\u2014made large overall effective rate reductions ... unlikely or even logically impossible.", "As the Tax Reform Act of 2014 ( H.R. 1 , 113th Congress) and proposals put forward by various other bills, commissions, panels, and think tanks have followed a similar model as TRA86, an examination of how changes to provisions other than marginal tax rates affect effective marginal tax rates may be instructive.", "The potential for economic growth continues to motivate tax reform. This growth arises from four basic sources: labor employed in the economy, the stock of capital, land, and technological advance. Land is fixed, and most technological advance is generally treated as exogenous and not influenced by policy, although tax policy can affect investments, for example, in research and development which create intangible assets. Thus the basic sources of inputs affected by tax policy are labor and capital. ", "This report attempts to show how options to broaden the tax base by placing limitations on itemized deductions can potentially work against the expansionary effects of reducing marginal tax rates. After base-broadening tax reform taxpayers may face lower statutory marginal rates but some taxpayers\u2014those who itemize\u2014may have more of their income subject to tax, effectively increasing their marginal tax rates. The report also addresses other common base-broadening provisions that increase the effective marginal tax rate on the return to capital.", "The report considers the effects on labor supply and savings (which affects the stock of capital) in turn. The primary effect of the increase in marginal tax rates arising from itemized deductions is to labor supply as taxpayers respond to higher marginal tax rates. The capital stock is also affected through changes in savings and investment, but this change takes place slowly. The report also analyzes the eventual effects of restricting itemized deductions, along with other base-broadening provisions, such as slowing depreciation, on the capital stock.", "This report does not attempt to model a full-scale tax reform with multiple policy levels moving simultaneously. Instead it models, in the case of labor supply, the principal driver of output effects in the budget window, a simplified version of current law applied to a sample of 2008 tax filers in which the only policy changes made are new limits on itemized deductions.

According to economic theory, the substitution effect predicts that an increase in taxes on labor will decrease the amount of labor supplied because lower after-tax wages make the alternative use of time, leisure, less expensive. The magnitude of this reduction depends upon two factors, the change in effective marginal tax rates and the responsiveness of workers to the change in effective marginal tax rates (what economists refer to as the elasticity).", "The analysis in this section examines the effects of several base-broadening proposals that have appeared in tax reform proposals. In particular, all of the proposals examined would limit itemized deductions. The resulting changes in effective marginal tax rates are then multiplied by commonly used labor supply elasticities of substitution to arrive at the estimated effects on labor supply.

As a result, the tax rate faced by taxpayers in the top decile receives a weight of just over one-third for all estimates weighted by labor income.", "To estimate the effects of the policy options on the effective marginal tax rates of itemizers as calculated in this report, one can subtract the effective marginal tax rate in the current law column from the columns representing the policy options. While the resulting differences reflect the effect of the policy option on itemizers, they cannot be correctly applied to economy-wide estimates of labor supply\u2014as this difference does not account for the income earned by taxpayers that do not itemize.", " Table 2 presents the effects of the policy options after adjustment for non-itemizers. Regardless of the type of income used to weight the change in effective marginal tax rates across deciles, the option to eliminate itemized deductions for charitable contributions yields the smallest effect\u2014well less than one percentage point. Conversely, the option to eliminate all itemized deductions results in the largest effect in all cases.", "Finally, in order to calculate the labor supply effects, the estimated percentage point changes presented in Table 2 need to be converted into the percentage changes in the after-tax share (the change in the tax rate divided by one minus the tax rate).

As noted earlier, the substitution effect between leisure and consumption causes the labor supply to increase in response to increases in the marginal wage. The elasticities discussed in this subsection are estimates of the labor supply response to a permanent wage change (such as one that would arise from a permanent tax cut or increase) for the labor force. That type of supply response is incorporated in dynamic models with supply-side effects. The labor supply response to a change in wage is uncertain in direction because it is the result of a positive elasticity of substitution and a negative elasticity of income (i.e., as wages increase, consumption of both goods and leisure increases). Previous analyses have accounted for income effects as well as the substitution effects from changing tax rates, and this analysis considers only the additional marginal (substitution) effects from base-broadening.", "Recent surveys of labor supply responses of men indicated that labor supply was largely inelastic. A working paper by researchers at the Congressional Budget Office reviewed recent research and indicated a substitution elasticity for men from 0.1 to 0.3; married women had substitution elasticities from 0.2 to 0.4. For the work force as a whole, a substitution elasticity of 0.1 to 0.3 was indicated and is reported in Table 4 .

Estimates of this aggregate labor supply response are presented in Table 5 . ", "In tax reform proposals, these negative effects on labor supply from base broadening would partly offset the positive effects on labor supply from lower marginal tax rates. To put the results presented in Table 5 in perspective, the Joint Committee on Taxation (2014) analysis of a comprehensive tax reform proposal, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 ( H.R. 1 , 113 th Congress), found labor supply increases ranging from 0.4% to 0.8% for FY2014-FY2023. This estimate was for a complex proposal with many elements. Depending on how changes in effective marginal tax rates are incorporated in macroeconomic models, including these effects could reduce estimated growth effects of tax reform. It appears, however, that incorporating the supply reductions from using the high elasticity estimates associated with eliminating itemized deductions for state and local income taxes (a provision included in that proposal) could offset a significant share of the gains in labor supply estimated in an analysis of the growth effects of tax reform."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Capital Stock", "paragraphs": ["The effects of many base-broadening provisions, such as slowing depreciation, have frequently been included in calculations of how tax reform affects savings and investment. Increases in individual income rates through base broadening, however, also affect the return on savings and investment, through effects on the tax rate for unincorporated businesses, as well as taxes on passive investment returns (interest, dividends, and capital gains). These effects have generally been excluded from calculations of tax reforms' effects on economic growth. This section examines the effect of both individual base-broadening provisions as discussed in the previous section and of other base-broadening changes that have been widely considered in analyzing the macroeconomic effects of tax reform. These effects are estimated for the returns on investment in equipment, structures, and intangible business assets. ", "In the 10-year budget horizon, the effect of base broadening on the capital stock is likely to be smaller than the effect on labor because capital changes accrue gradually while labor participation can change more quickly. And, as in the case of labor supply, the response is likely to be modest. Capital could also be attracted from abroad for some changes, but these effects are also likely small. In addition, with base-broadening effects, a revenue-neutral tax reform accompanied by rate reduction can have no effect or even a negative effect on the cost of capital. ", "The effective marginal tax rates for investment income are the same measure as the marginal tax rates for labor income: they estimate the share of the earnings from investments that are paid in taxes. Many features of the tax code outside of statutory rates affect this share, which depends on the amount and timing of tax payments, deductions, and credits. The effective marginal tax rates on earnings from investment are calculated by first determining a required after-tax rate of return and an expected rate of decline in productivity of the asset due to economic depreciation. Economic depreciation measures the change in the value of the asset as it is used up over time, and in an infinitely lived investment the rate of decline in this value is equal to the rate of decline in productivity. The analysis then determines how much the investment must initially produce in order for the sum of after-tax profits over time, discounted by the after-tax rate of return, to equal the investment outlay (i.e., to break even). Then all of the tax payments and deductions are eliminated, and the before-tax profit flows are used to determine what pre-tax discount rate would match the flows to the original cost. The effective tax rate is the pre-tax rate of return minus the after-tax rate of return, divided by the pre-tax rate. This discounted cash flow method produces a formula termed the user cost of capital or the rental price of capital, which can be used to derive an effective tax rate. The formula accounts for the major tax provisions that affect tax burdens, including tax rates and the speed with which the investment cost is deducted (tax depreciation rates). ", "The analysis begins with the tax rates under current law. These estimates do not include the effects of \"extender\" provisions: bonus depreciation and the tax credit for research and development. They include all business assets (and thus exclude owner-occupied housing) except for land (where taxes are likely to be capitalized) and inventories (which are expected to be relatively unresponsive to rates of return).

These rates capture the effects of accelerated depreciation (deducting the cost of investments faster than their decline in economic value), as well as the production activities deduction. The rates in this table can be compared with the statutory corporate tax rate of 35% and the estimated statutory tax rate for noncorporate firms of 27% (as determined by the analysis of the Public Use Files as discussed in the previous section on labor). ", "As this table indicates, most assets are taxed at effective rates below the statutory rate. Most equipment assets, along with public utility structures (treated as equipment in the tax code), are taxed at rates well below the statutory rate, even after considering the effects of the production activity deduction (which decreases the corporate statutory rate by about a percentage point and the noncorporate rate by less than 0.2 percentage points). These lower rates are due to generous tax depreciation rules that allow costs to be recovered faster than the estimated economic decline in the value of capital. Tax rates on intangibles are zero because these costs are expensed (deducted in full when acquired), and tax rates on mining structures (primarily oil and gas) are also low because much of the cost is expensed. Commercial and industrial structures, such as office buildings and plants, tend to be taxed at a higher rate because of the much longer recovery period (39 years), although farm buildings and residential rental structures are favored relative to other buildings due to shorter depreciation periods.", " Table 7 provides some aggregated tax rates, combining equipment and nonresidential structures other than public utility structures into groups. Equipment overall and public utility structures are taxed at about two-thirds of the statutory rate for corporations and about 77% of the rate for noncorporate businesses. Intangibles have a zero tax rate.", "Note that the tax rates may be understated because they do not incorporate the effects of bonus depreciation, which allows half of investment in equipment to be expensed (deducted when acquired). Bonus depreciation further accelerates deductions and reduces the effective tax rate on equipment by about 40%, so that the rate for equipment would be around 14%. It also does not include the effects of the research and experimentation tax credit, which would produce a negative tax rate for R&D intangibles.

(This system uses a straight line method that allows deductions in equal amounts in each year rather than an accelerated method.) It affects both equipment and structures, but not intangibles. The table also shows the effects of recovering investments in research and development and in advertising over a 10-year period using the straight line method. ", "Focusing on assets affected by the alternative depreciation system, a number of assets (equipment, including public utility structures, and farm structures) that currently have tax rates about a third below the statutory rate are now much closer or even above the statutory tax rate. Nonresidential structures, excluding public utilities and farm structures, are not affected, although residential structures are.

They are presented, along with the capital cost recovery provisions, for the overall tax system. In addition to firm-level taxes on equity investment that can be compared to the statutory rate, these numbers also provide an overall tax rate that includes the effects of other elements in the tax system: shareholder-level taxes (dividends and capital gains) on corporate equity investments, as well as the tax benefits of borrowing and deducting nominal interest at the firm's rate while only part of this interest is taxed to the creditor. Because of this effect, debt-financed investment tends to be taxed at negative rates or very low rates for many assets and the overall tax rate is lower than the firm-level rate on equity. ", " Table 10 shows current effective tax rates and the effects of various base-broadening provisions. Accounting for taxes paid by stockholders, the deductibility of interest by the firm, and the taxation of interest by the creditors reduces the current effective tax rate from 22.3% to 12.8% for the corporate sector and from 20.8% to 11.9% for the noncorporate sector. This is a reduction in the tax rate of 43%. The relatively low total tax rate under current law is due to two factors: the rapid cost recovery allowed for many types of investments, and the benefit of deducting nominal interest at the firm's tax rate, while most of that interest (80%) is not taxed to the creditors. This effect is more pronounced because the nominal interest rate includes inflation.", "It may also be of interest to compare the effective tax rates in Table 10 with the rates that would exist without the benefits that lower effective rates.

The rates are calculated assuming economic depreciation and no production activities deduction (which makes effective firm-level taxes equal to the statutory rate). They also assume all passive income (interest, capital gains, and dividends) are taxed, but retain the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends. With these changes, the overall tax rate for the corporate sector would be 39.7%. This number reflects a share of income taxed at the creditor's rate of 22.0%, the rate on equity of 35.0% at the corporate level, and additional taxes on capital gains and dividends that result in a combined 44.5% tax rate for corporate equity. For the noncorporate sector, the rate would be 25.6%, between the creditor's rate of 22.0% and the firm's rate of 27.0%. These rates are reduced to 30.0% and 21.6% if the exclusions of most interest, capital gains, and dividends are taken into account.

Table 12 reports results with two-factor substitution elasticities: a value of one, which is commonly used, and a value that appears more consistent with recent empirical studies. Estimates are done with values of E ranging from 0.2 to 0.4, which reflects the range of estimates used by the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Treasury Department.

Even repealing the most important provision, alternative depreciation, only reduces the capital stock by around 1%. The effects of limiting itemized deductions that are generally not taken into account, nevertheless, have effects (outside of infinite elasticities) up to 0.25%. By comparison, the five-percentage-point decrease in the corporate rate (discussed earlier to compare with the effects of itemized deduction restrictions) would be estimated to increase the capital stock under the unitary factor substitution elasticity by 0.28% under the 0.2 savings elasticity and by 0.43% under the 0.4 elasticity. For a factor substitution elasticity of 0.5, the effects of a five percentage point decrease are 0.21% and 0.29%. (For infinite elasticities they are 0.89% and 0.45%.)

Even the larger rate cut would be more than offset by a move to the alternative depreciation system, a contraction in the capital stock from 0.8% to 1.7%.

For example, an important goal of tax reform is to reduce the distortions differential tax treatment causes (such as favoring investment in equipment compared to structures, or encouraging too much spending on housing). These distortions cause the economy to use its resources in a less than optimal way. This efficiency gain is different from growth and unlikely to have more than a negligible effect on measured output. Another potential goal of revenue-neutral tax reform is to simplify the tax system, which may reduce the costs of taxpayer compliance as well as direct costs of tax administration.

The Public Use File is a nationally representative sample of tax returns for the 2008 tax year. To protect the identity of individual taxpayers while preserving the character of the data, the IRS made changes to the data. Consequently, while reliable aggregate information can be obtained, individual taxpayer records in the data may or may not contain information from just one tax return. The unit of analysis is the tax return for a taxpayer, and IRS-provided sample weights are used throughout the analysis. The analysis sample contains information for 139,651 taxpayers (representing 142.6 million taxpayers). ", "The measure of taxable income used in this analysis departs from that used in the 2014 tax code. Specifically, above-the-line deductions (that have the effect of lowering taxable income) are not included in this analysis. Thus the measure of taxable income is total income minus personal exemptions and the value of itemized deductions.", "Current law tax parameters were adjusted to 2008 levels using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and are reported for married filing jointly in Table A-1 .

The resulting tax liabilities generated do not take into account the Alternative Minimum Tax, phase in/outs, or any tax credits. As the focus of the analysis is on limitations on itemized deductions, all non-itemizers are dropped from the analysis, although non-itemizers are subsequently added back to compute the overall effects.", "Effective marginal tax rates for taxpayers that choose to itemize deductions are calculated by first calculating an initial tax liability. Second, an additional $1,000 in ordinary income is allocated to each taxpayer. In addition to increasing taxable income, this additional income can increase the value of itemized deductions for state and local taxes and charitable giving (based on observed shares of income). A second tax liability is calculated using these figures. These calculations reflect the rate structure and other tax aspects depending on filing status. The difference between the second and first tax liabilities is then divided by $1,000 to arrive at the effective marginal tax rate. This effective marginal tax rate is then weighted by the shares of income realized by itemizers (versus non-itemizers) and the distribution of income within itemizers. These individual marginal tax rates are then averaged across modified taxable income deciles. Break points for the deciles are listed in Table A-2 .", "Using these deciles, average effective marginal tax rates are calculated for a base case and for each option to limit itemized deductions examined. These rates are displayed in Table A-3 .", "A composite marginal effective tax rate is created to simplify the analysis. In this composite, the share of income earned by each decile is used to allocate each decile's effective marginal tax rate to the composite number according to the amount of ownership.

", "Combining the information in Table A-3 and Table A-4 results in a single estimate of the effective marginal tax rate weighted by source of income. The resulting estimates are presented in Table 1 . Differencing the current law effective marginal tax rate from the effective marginal tax rate for each policy option yields the difference in effective marginal tax rates faced by taxpayers that itemize. This, however, overstates the effective change for all taxpayers, as only taxpayers who chose to itemize can have limits placed on their itemized deductions. To account for this effect, the interim estimates are multiplied by the share of each income source earned by taxpayers who itemize.

The discount rates differ between corporate and noncorporate firms given the assumption that the noncorporate investor's opportunity cost is investment in the corporate sector, net of shareholder taxes. Thus the R for the noncorporate sector is the corporate discount rate reduced by the taxes on capital gains and dividends. These shares are subject to special tax rates and are adjusted for the extent of earnings that are not subject to tax in an overall economy-wide portfolio because some capital gains are not realized and some earnings on corporate stock are exempt because they are held in pension funds and retirement accounts. ", "The effective tax rate is determined in part by the effective statutory rate and in part by how quickly costs are recovered (the value of z) and any credits. Without the production activities deduction, the tax rate is equal to the statutory rate when z equals the present value of economic depreciation (d/(R+d)). More rapid depreciation decreases the effective tax rate. ", "The formula in (1) is applied to obtain firm-level tax rates in Table 6 through Table 9 .

The other is a credit of 14% in excess of 50% of the past three years of research expenditures. Because each dollar of research today increases the base in each of three future years (by 50 cents divided by 3) it reduces future credits, this offset must be taken into account.
