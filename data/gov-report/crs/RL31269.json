During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with Secretary of Homeland Security, was tasked with reviewing refugee admissions procedures. On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, pending the resolution of ongoing litigation concerning the lawfulness of the March 2017 executive order, the provisions establishing the FY2017 50,000 refugee admissions limit and the 120-day refugee program suspension could take effect for all individuals except for those \"who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\" The 120-day suspension was in effect from June 26, 2017, until its expiration on October 24, 2017.

In October 2008, the U.S. refugee program stopped accepting applications under Priority 3.
