Arguments for postponing the transition date, possibly by several months, were sparked by an announcement from NTIA on January 5, 2009, that the funding ceiling for converter box coupons had been reached, that all new requests would be put on a waiting list, and that growing numbers of households would not receive their coupons in time for the deadline of February 17.

A few additional months, they argued, would enable Congress to adequately fund the coupon program and ensure that all requesting households would receive coupons in advance of the transition date. A delay would also allow more resources to be directed towards public outreach and education efforts (including enhanced call centers), and provide consumers and broadcasters with more time to address local DT V signal reception issues. On January 16, 2009, Democratic FCC Commissioners wrote a letter to Congressional leaders supporting a delay, arguing that FCC efforts to prepare for the digital transition have been inadequate, and that factors such as coordination, consumer education, reception issues, and call center support might be ameliorated with the extra time offered by a delay.", "Opponents of delaying the transition argued that changing the date would sow confusion throughout the American public, who had been long exposed to a wide variety of outreach efforts (public service announcements, flyers, billboards, etc.) reiterating the February 17 transition date.

Digital television uses radio frequency spectrum more efficiently than traditional analog television, thereby \"freeing up\" bandwidth. The goal of the FCC and Congress has been to complete the transition to DTV as quickly as is possible and feasible, so that analog spectrum could be reclaimed and subsequently reallocated for other purposes. Some of the analog spectrum has been auctioned for commercial wireless services (including wireless broadband), and some will be used for new public safety communications services. Additionally, it is mandated that some of the revenue raised in the spectrum auction will be returned to the U.S. Treasury, thereby contributing toward federal deficit reduction.", "Another rationale often cited for the digital transition is that\u2014aside from offering a superior television viewing experience to consumers\u2014DTV will give over-the-air broadcasters the capability to offer more channels of programming (via multicasting, if they so choose) as well as the ability to offer similar digitally-based services (such as pay-per-view or other interactive services) offered by cable and satellite television providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Is Likely to be Most Affected by the Transition?", "paragraphs": ["Households using analog televisions for viewing over-the-air television broadcasts are likely to be most affected by the digital transition.

Unlike analog signals, which when weak or obstructed may be received with fuzzy yet watchable reception, digital signals are received either perfectly or not at all. Viewers experiencing the \"digital cliff effect\" will likely require an antenna modification. The FCC has estimated that about 5% of over-the-air viewers may need a new antenna due to the \"digital cliff effect,\" equivalent to about 1% of all TV households. According to the FCC, the Wilmington data suggest a similar estimate.", "The second DTV digital reception issue stems from the fact that some digital stations will have a reduced service contour compared with their current analog service contour. In other words, their digital broadcasts may not reach all the households that these stations previously served. In Wilmington, a reduced service contour of the NBC affiliate was the leading single cause of consumer complaints to the FCC. On December 23, 2008, the FCC released data and maps showing digital and analog coverage areas for each of the 1,749 full-power television stations in the United States. The FCC found that 89% of stations (1,553 stations) will experience an overall net gain in the population that can receive their signals, while 11% of stations (196 stations) will experience a net loss. On June 5, 2009, the FCC released updated coverage maps and lists of stations with 2% or greater service loss. The updated list includes 55 stations that were not on the previous list, and excludes 19 stations previously included. In total, the list includes 401 stations whose digital service is not expected to cover 2% or more of the population covered by their analog service.", "In addition to its data gathering efforts, the FCC has taken various steps to address DTV signal reception issues. On November 3, 2008, the FCC approved an order which permits stations to deploy distributed transmission systems (small antennas that would fill gaps in coverage areas). On May 8, 2009, the FCC adopted a final rule which allows broadcasters, if they choose, to implement \"replacement\" digital translators to provide digital signals to areas which would otherwise lose service.", "On March 13, 2009, the FCC adopted and released a report and order requiring broadcasters to provide ample notification to viewers on three digital reception issues:", "Signal loss: Stations must provide on-air and other notifications of potential signal loss if 2%or more of their analog viewers are predicted to lose service, regardless of whether stations gain viewers in other areas; Antennas: All stations must include information about the use of antennas as part of their consumer education campaigns, including additional information if they are changing from the VHF to UHF bands and viewers may need additional or different equipment to avoid loss of service; and Scanning: Stations must inform and remind viewers about the importance of periodically using the rescan function of their digital televisions and digital converter boxes. During the time surrounding the conclusion of the transition, many stations will be changing the service areas and the broadcast frequencies of their digital transmissions. As a result, viewers will need to periodically rescan during this period in order to ensure that they are correctly receiving all the digital broadcast services available to them.", "In the aftermath of the June 12 transition, viewer concerns over digital signal reception are a primary issue raised in calls to the FCC consumer help line. A particular and persistent problem involves viewers losing the ability to receive channels that switched on June 12 from UHF to VHF channels.", "Addressing concerns that adequate digital TV signals may be unavailable in some parts of a television market area, S. 25 / H.R. 2867 , the Digital TV Transition Fairness Act, would authorize the Secretary of Commerce to provide a coupon to consumers valued at up to $80 which can be applied towards the cost of purchasing or installing an antenna in order to receive digital signals (the \"Digital Viewership Coupon Program\"). The legislation would also require multichannel video providers to provide basic broadcast television service for $10 per month to anyone who loses one or more channels due to the digital transition. S. 25 / H.R. 2867 would authorize to be appropriated $600 million to carry out the Digital Viewership Coupon Program.

First, are public education and outreach efforts sufficient, and is the federal government playing a sufficient role in leading that effort? With limited funding, both the FCC and the NTIA have relied heavily on a strategy of leveraging private sector efforts. On the one hand, private sector groups have a market incentive to ensure that the public is ready for the digital transition: for example, the consumer electronics industry wants to sell DTV products, and broadcasters want their viewers to be able to continue watching their local broadcasts. Accordingly, industry groups have launched multifaceted public outreach campaigns. On the other hand, critics question whether market forces will ensure that public outreach efforts are sufficiently targeted to those segments of American society (the elderly, non-English speakers, rural areas, disabled citizens, minorities, the economically disadvantaged) that may be more at risk of being adversely affected by the digital switch-over.", "A second major question is the extent to which NTIA's converter box program will meet the needs of analog television households, and the extent to which coupon and converter box supply problems, equipment and installation problems, and reception issues may surface for consumers. Will retail outlets\u2014whether large or small stores, whether in urban, suburban, or rural areas\u2014stock sufficient numbers of boxes to meet the demand of consumers seeking to redeem the $40 coupons? Will NTIA, manufacturers, and retailers be prepared and able to meet the spike in demand for coupons and boxes as the transition date nears? And finally, will anticipated consumer problems with converter box set-up, antennas, and digital signal reception be adequately addressed?", "With the June 12 transition having taken place, Congress, the FCC, and the NTIA will be closely monitoring ongoing DTV transition problems, particularly issues related to the reception of digital television signals.", "Appendix A. DTV Test Pilot Program in Wilmington, North Carolina", "On September 8, 2008, most broadcast television stations in Wilmington, NC, permanently ceased transmitting programs with their analog signal and went digital-only in response to an FCC pilot program announced on May 8, 2008. Wilmington is the 135 th largest television market in the United States (about 180,000 households) and about 8% of Wilmington's television households (approximately 14,000) are reliant on over-the-air broadcasting. In preparation for the early transition, the FCC coordinated with local officials and community groups in the Wilmington, NC, area to accelerate and broaden consumer education outreach efforts. The early DTV transition is intended to give the FCC, the NTIA, and broadcasters a \"test case\" that will supply valuable data and experiences that can be applied to the nationwide.", "The FCC and the broadcasters collected feedback and data on the results of the test pilot program. After the cut-off at noon on September 8, analog programming was replaced with a screen telling consumers about the digital transition and how to get help. Over the first five days following the cut-off, the FCC received 1,828 calls to its DTV help line (about 1% of the total number of TV households in Wilmington). Of the total number of calls, 5% were from consumers who were unaware of the transition, 18% from consumers who had problems with their converter boxes, 22.9% from consumers who had antenna and reception issues, and 30% from households in out of market communities (as far south as Myrtle Beach, SC, and as far north as Raleigh, NC) who could no longer receive the Wilmington NBC affiliate (whose digital coverage area no longer extends to these out of market areas).", "A general consensus has emerged that while the Wilmington test proceeded relatively smoothly, the experience has raised a number of challenges that must be met in order to ensure the most successful transition possible. While consumer awareness of the DTV transition in Wilmington was at a very high level, a much greater problem was consumers experiencing technical problems involving converter boxes, antennas, and/or signal reception. Former FCC Chairman Kevin Martin testified before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that \"though our consumer education efforts appear to have been effective, our focus now turns to resolving technical challenges.\" FCC Commissioner Michael Copps recommended that the FCC take a number of steps, including conduct additional field testing, dedicate a special FCC team to the needs of at-risk communities, ramp up the FCC call center, prepare comprehensive DTV contingency plans, create an online DTV consumer forum, educate consumers on DTV trouble-shooting (including antenna issues and the need to \"re-scan\" converter boxes and sets), ensure that broadcasters meet their construction deadlines, encourage the rapid deployment of small battery-powered DTV sets, and find a way to broadcast an analog message to consumers following the transition. Meanwhile, on November 7, 2008, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce sent letters to the FCC, NTIA, NAB, and the major television networks asking how they will specifically address the issues of consumer education with respect to the need to re-scan converter boxes, antenna issues, and signal contour issues.", "In response to the Wilmington test, both the FCC and NTIA refocused their outreach and public education efforts on consumer preparedness in addition to consumer awareness. Specifically, consumers are being encouraged to apply for coupons as early as possible, and to try out converter boxes in advance of the transition date in order to proactively address equipment issues (such as re-scanning the converter box, or repositioning or upgrading antennas). Meanwhile, many television stations across the nation conducted \"soft\" analog cutoffs in which the analog signals were temporarily discontinued and replaced by an educational message on the DTV transition.", "Appendix B.

Consumers who had not upgraded their analog televisions were still able to receive a screen explaining what was happening and providing telephone numbers and websites for more information and assistance. Under current law, full-power television stations are prohibited from broadcasting anything on their analog channels after the transition deadline.

In designing the program and determining broadcaster eligibility, the FCC would be required to take into consideration such factors as market-by-market needs such as channel and transmitter availability, avoiding harmful interference with digital television signals, prohibiting analog service on spectrum already designated for auction or for public safety use, and other factors.

Stations must also broadcast between channels 2 through 51. Continued analog service cannot prevent the auction or public safety use of recovered spectrum, cannot interfere with any channel reserved for public safety use, and cannot interfere with any digital station.", "Opposition to S. 2507 has been expressed by many English-language television stations along the U.S.-Mexico border. These stations argue that prolonging the analog option for some stations would create a confusing transition, that a future transition in four or five years for the border region will be problematic in the absence of a national DTV transition effort, and that stations planning to go all-digital on the transition date, may be compelled by competitive pressures to continue their analog signals, thereby adding additional and otherwise unnecessary expense. On the other hand, supporters of S. 2507 (including Spanish-language stations) argue that Hispanic households in the border region are significantly more reliant on over-the-air television than the general population, and are likely to be less prepared for the digital transition, especially given that they can continue to watch analog over-the-air broadcasts from Mexican television stations. The legislation is particularly necessary, they argue, to ensure that these groups continue to receive important information over their televisions during an emergency or natural disaster.", "Appendix D. Low-Power Television and the Digital Transition", "Unlike full-power television stations, low-power television (LPTV) stations, along with Class A stations and translator television stations, are not required to convert to digital broadcasting by the national transition date. With a later deadline for LPTV digital conversion (possibly in 2012) still to be set by the FCC, most LPTV stations will continue to broadcast analog signals after the transition date for full-power stations. A growing issue of concern to LPTV, Class A, and translator stations is the capability of digital-to-analog converter boxes to either pass through or receive broadcasted analog signals in addition to receiving and converting digital signals. A household that receives both full-power and LPTV broadcast signals, and that installs a converter box in order to receive the full-power station's digital signal, will not be able to receive the LPTV station's analog signal unless the converter box is equipped with an analog signal pass-through capability or an analog tuner. NTIA permitted but did not require manufacturers to install an analog signal pass-through capability in certified converter boxes, arguing that such a requirement could raise the cost of the boxes and pose possible interference problems for the digital signal. Coupon-eligible converter boxes (CECBs) that receive an analog signal (with tuners capable of receiving both digital and analog signals) are not eligible under the coupon program.", "The Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), representing LPTV and Class A stations, argues that the widespread use of converter boxes without an analog reception or pass-through capability would effectively cause many of these stations to go out of business. The CBA has filed a complaint at the FCC asserting that the NTIA-certified converter boxes violate the All-Channel Receiver Act of 1962 if they block reception of analog over-the-air television broadcast signals. On February 12, 2008, FCC Chairman Martin wrote a letter to the broadcasting, cable, satellite, consumer electronics, and consumer electronics retailing industries, asking each to voluntarily take specific steps to lessen the adverse effects of the digital transition on LPTV, Class A, and translator stations. On March 26, 2008, the CBA petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to direct the FCC to immediately enforce the All-Channel Receiver Act and to stop the marketing and distribution of all converter boxes that do not receive an analog signal (e.g., all CECBs). However, on May 7, 2008, the Court dismissed the CBA lawsuit.", "The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established two grant programs administered by the NTIA designed to assist low-power television stations with the digital transition.
