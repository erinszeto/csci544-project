The President signed the bill into law on December 26. Congress's agreement to provide $70 billion for overseas military operations resolved a dispute over war funding that had led the Defense Department to announce plans to shut down all but essential Army and Marine Corps operations early in 2008. In the absence of supplemental appropriations, officials warned that money for Army operations would run out by the end of February and for the Marine Corps in March, even after a transfer of $4.1 billion to the Army. On November 15, 2007, Secretary of Defense Gates said that the Defense Department would \"cease operations at all Army bases by mid-February next year,\" which would result in furloughs of 100,000 civilian and another 100,000 contractor personnel.", "The consolidated appropriations bill averted the need for such steps. It provided $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operation and maintenance accounts. These amounts are in addition to $27.4 billion for the Army and $4.8 billion for the Marine Corps in the regular FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-116). The supplemental funding, added to regular appropriations, provided enough money to sustain Army operations until the end of June or early July, 2008, and Marine Corps operations until the end of August at planned rates of obligation.", "While Congress's agreement to provide funds resolves the debate for the present, it did not settle the underlying controversy. A recurring issue for Congress has been how much flexibility the Defense Department has to delay, if not to avoid entirely, shutting down operations when Congress does not provide full-year defense appropriations. In the absence of supplemental appropriations, the Defense Department relied on funds in the regular FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act to finance both day-to-day peacetime activities and war-related operations abroad. CRS calculated that these funds would be exhausted by February for the Army and by early April for the Marine Corps, which is about what the Defense Department projected. DOD's proposed transfer of $4.1 billion to the Army would have extend its operations for another two to three weeks.", "Without supplemental appropriations, the Defense Department could have extended operations for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts to the Army and Marine Corps and by slowing down spending through measures such as those the Army began to implement in April 2007. Such measures would reduce remaining financial flexibility and might disrupt day-to-day operations. The Defense Department might have been able to sustain operations longer by invoking the Feed and Forage Act or by using novel, unprecedented measures, such as assigning the Navy and Air Force to pay costs of Army support operations abroad. Such measures might weaken congressional war powers and erode congressional controls on the use of funds.

The O&M accounts finance a broad range of activities, including recruitment, training, transportation, clothing, subsistence, fuel, facility operation and repair, and equipment maintenance. Funding for Army and Marine Corps O&M supports both peacetime activities and war-related operations.", "For the first few months of the fiscal year, the Army appeared to be planning obligations of about $6.5 billion per month and the Marine Corps of about $800 million per month. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act, P.L. 110-116 , provided $27.4 billion in O&M for the Army and $4.8 billion for the Marine Corps. At planned monthly obligation rates, therefore, the Army could operate with baseline appropriations for about four months of the fiscal year (which began on October\u00a01, 2007) or until the beginning of February, and the Marine Corps could operate for about six months, or until the end of March or the beginning of April, which is generally consistent with Defense Department estimates.

In a presentation at the Brookings Institution on December 4, Army Chief of Staff George Casey complained that any measures that would make the flow of money unstable or uncertain were disruptive to the Army and discouraging to military personnel:", "In general, as Chief of Staff of the Army, not having predictable, timely funding makes it harder for me to do my job: to organize, train and equip the Army. Every time you put something off or delay it or take some measures to get another week's worth of funding for the operations and maintenance account, it has second and third order effects that ricochet all through the organization, that you don't find the results for two or three months, and it just makes it harder.", "The second thing is I think what's going on right now sends a terrible signal to soldiers and families. We have nine brigades that are redeploying from Iraq and Afghanistan right now after being gone for 15 months. They started in September. They'll come in through January. The notion that people are even discussing closing down or warm-basing their installations just minimum essential tasks at a time when they're coming home from being gone for 15 months is very difficult for them.", "These objections are not new. On the contrary, the Army and the other military services have consistently been critical of measures to manipulate budgets to stretch out funding, including Administration steps to use money from later in the year to finance operations at the start of the year, a practice known as \"cash flowing.\" Disputes over the use of cash flowing for the Iraq war began as early as January, 2004. At that time, the Administration decided not to request FY2005 supplemental appropriations until after the start of calendar year 2005, and instead to rely on cash flowing to sustain operations until well into the spring. When senior service leaders expressed concern about that decision in congressional hearings, DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim called a press conference to defend the practice. Subsequently Congress initiated the practice of providing part-of-the year bridge funding when it added $25 billion in unrequested funds for war related expenses to the FY2005 Defense Appropriations Act. Later, Congress provided an unrequested bridge fund of $50 billion in FY2006.

The $3.7 billion transfer from the Air Force and the Navy would exhaust the total amount of General Transfer Authority provided by Section 8005 of the FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act. Additional funds were available for transfer, however, in cash balances of working capital funds, and the Defense Department might have extended operations longer by using these amounts.", "The transfer of excess cash balances in working capital funds is permitted by Section 8008 of the FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act. Working capital funds are business-like activities of the Defense Department that are funded primarily through revenues from sales to the military services. Some working capital fund activities maintain inventories of products that they sell to military units. Others provide industrial services, such as depot maintenance of equipment. The military services use appropriated funds, mostly in the operation and maintenance accounts, to make the purchases. Section 8008 allows the funds to maintain sufficient cash balances to meet projected requirements for disbursements. Excess cash balances may then be available for transfer to other accounts, including service operation and maintenance accounts.", "Amounts of excess cash balances vary from fund to fund and from year to year. As of the beginning of December, 2007, the Defense Department had tapped FY2008 excess cash balances twice. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act used $628 million to offset Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense-Wide operation and maintenance accounts.

By tapping all of the remaining funds to finance Army and Marine Corps O&M accounts, the Defense Department could have extend operations for a week or two. This would have further reduced DOD's remaining financial flexibility to respond to future developments, though perhaps only temporarily. In its November 20 transfer request, DOD asked Congress to restore the $3.7 billion in transfers to the Air Force and Navy, and Congress has, in the past, agreed to forgive amounts transferred because of delays in making supplemental appropriations.

In April, 2007, when Congress was considering FY2007 supplemental funding, the Army planned a series of increasingly restrictive limits on activities to be implemented if supplemental appropriations were further delayed. The Army projected that these measures could reduce obligations by as much as $3.6 billion over three months out of FY2007 obligations of about $6 billion per month. The Army and Marine Corps might also have been able to defer some other funding by, for example, delaying orders for depot maintenance of equipment, for which the Army planned average obligations of about $400 million per month in FY2008\u00a0\u2013 i.e., about $1.6 billion over the first four months of the year or $2.0 billion over five months."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pros and Cons", "paragraphs": ["If implemented over four months, slowing operations and delaying depot maintenance orders might have reduce obligations by as much as $5 billion ($3.6 billion from measures like those identified last April, plus $1.6 billion from deferring depot maintenance), though less if they were pursued selectively.

Some of these measures might have been less disruptive to the day-to-day operations of the force than others, particularly if undertaken on only a temporary basis. The Army reportedly had a depot maintenance backlog of about 7 \u00bd months, so there might have been some room to defer new orders without disrupting depot work flows. It is uncertain how reduced obligations of funds would affect military readiness or how disruptive cuts would be to facilities management, civilian and contractor employment, materiel inventories, equipment orders to industry, DOD travel, or depot maintenance workloads. Congress may wish to consider these matters more fully through hearings and other means.", "Defense Department officials said that cuts such as those planned last spring were not sufficient in the present circumstances because of greater uncertainty about supplemental funding. In his November 20 press briefing, DOD spokesman Geoff Morrell insisted that the issue was not simply how to free up money to extend operations, but, rather, what steps the Defense Department would have to take to shut down operations almost completely in the absence of funding. \"All that will happen on the [military] bases,\" he said, \"is that the most basic security and safety personnel \u2013 fire, police, and so forth \u2013 will be operating. Day care centers, libraries, all of the additional benefits that are there for families living on the base will cease to operate, because we will not have the funds to keep them going.\" The steps taken in April, 2007, he explained, were designed to extend operations on the assumption that Congress would provide additional appropriations quite soon.

The \"transportation\" category, for example, has been interpreted to allow operation of weapons engaged in combat, including aircraft carrying out bombing missions in Southeast Asia, and funding of repairs of equipment, including purchases of spare parts. The law does not, however, permit pay of uniformed personnel or purchases of munitions or other weapons.", "When queried about the use of the Feed and Forage Act, Pentagon spokesperson Geoff Morrell all but dismissed its potential use except in extraordinary circumstances \u2013", "we have extraordinary measures that can be taken in the eventuality that we find ourselves in a situation where we have no money \u2013 and no ability to move funds and we find ourselves with our men and women in uniform in the theater potentially unfunded.

We are not talking about invoking that yet.", "The Feed and Forage Act has been used in the past in circumstances quite similar to those facing the Defense Department in FY2008. It has been used, for instance, to sustain major military operations, including combat operations in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and transportation of personnel to the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, when appropriated funds were not sufficient. Table 2 summarizes uses of the Feed and Forage Act since 1960. As the table shows, when amounts are adjusted to today's prices, the Feed and Forage Act has been invoked to finance quite substantial obligations of funds\u2013 in FY1968, for example, during the Vietnam War, when, in FY2008 prices, $7.4 billion was used and in FY1991, for Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, when $2.6 billion was used."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pros and Cons", "paragraphs": ["The Feed and Forage Act gives the Department of Defense considerable flexibility to marshal funding for military operations in the event of unexpected developments. The potential use of substantial amounts to carry on combat operations, particularly if Congress has denied or refused to act on funding for a war, may be of concern to Congress because of its implications for congressional war powers, including the power of the purse. During the Vietnam war, use of the Feed and Forage Act ignited a vigorous debate over war powers issues. In 1973 Senators Mathias and Church sponsored hearings on the law, and in 1974 and 1975, Senator Abourezk proposed repealing the act because, he argued, it eroded congressional authority. Use of the Feed and Forage Act under current circumstances may warrant similar concerns. Unless Congress were to enact language restricting funding for Iraq \"in this or any other act,\" use of funding under the Feed and Forage Act would not appear to be subject to any limitations.", "The act has other has limitations as well. Significantly, while the act permits the Defense Department to obligate funds (i.e., sign contracts or hire civilian personnel), in DOD's interpretation, it does not permit actual expenditures (i.e., outlays) of funds without congressional appropriations. This would require contractors to agree, likely at some cost to the government, to contracts that might defer actual payments. In effect, the law allows the Defense Department to obligate Congress to provide what are known as \"deficiency appropriations,\" which were quite frequently enacted up until the 1950s, but have not been used often since then.

The Secretary also has authority to detail civilian personnel from one service to another as part of his general responsibility for managing the Department, so Army personnel currently managing these contracts could be detailed to another service to ensure continuity.", "Since Air Force and Navy O&M budgets were less limited than Army and Marine Corps budgets, this would further extend the amount of time the Army and Marine Corps could operate without FY2008 supplemental funding. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act provided $32.2 billion for Air Force O&M and $33.1 billion for Navy O&M. If the Air Force and Navy were each assigned responsibility for $5 billion of activities currently handled by the Army, it would extend Army operations by a month-and-a-half, while funding for Air Force and Navy operations would be reduced by about two months.", "Since the use of this provision is unprecedented, it is not apparent whether a shift of responsibilities could quickly and efficiently be implemented. Use of this authority might also be a matter of considerable concern to Congress, since it would appear to undermine congressional limitations on the use of funds.

Tapping these funds would, however, reduce DOD's remaining flexibility to respond to unexpected developments. The Army projected that measures it planned to slow down operations in April, 2007, might, at the upper limit, avoid $3.6 billion or so of obligations over three months. Some of these measures, however, may disrupt day-to-day Army operations. Deferring new orders for depot maintenance might reduce planned obligations by $400 million or so per month, or about $1.6 billion over four months or $2.0 billion over five months. CRS cannot, however, assess how this would affect depot work planning.", "Taken together, all of these measures might temporarily reduce or offset Army and Marine Corps funding requirements by as much as $2.1 billion (use remaining excess cash balances in working capital funds) + $3.6 billion (slow operations) + $1.6 billion (defer new depot maintenance orders) = $7.3 billion, or a bit more than one month's worth of funding at the then-current obligation rates, which would allow the Army to extend operations until about the end of March, 2008 (see Table 2 ).", "A potentially more significant source of funds might have been to invoke the Feed and Forage Act.

Operations might be sustained longer if larger amounts were used. There may be some problems negotiating contracts, however. And use of the Feed and Forage Act raises significant war powers issues. For Congress to recommend use of the Feed and Forage Act appears particularly ironic \u2013 it is, in a sense, to write the script for the Executive Branch to evade legislative restrictions on the use of funds to carry on the war in Iraq.", "The potential for DOD to use unprecedented measures, such as the flexibility given to the Secretary of Defense to reassign responsibility for support activities to other services, is particularly hard to assess.
