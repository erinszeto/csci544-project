Nonimmigrants on H-1 visas had to maintain a foreign residence. Over the years, Congress made a series of revisions to the H-1 visa category and in 1989, split the H-1 visa into (a) and (b).", "The Immigration Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-649 ) established the main features of H-1B visa as it is known today. Foremost, \u00a7205 of P.L. 101-649 replaced \"distinguished merit and ability\" with the \"specialty occupation\" definition. It added labor attestation requirements and the numerical limit of 65,000 on H-1B visas issued annually. It also dropped the foreign residence requirement and allowed for \"dual intent\" (i.e., an exception to the INA for H-1B aliens to obtain an H-1B visa simultaneous with seeking LPR status).", "American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act", "Enacted as the 105 th Congress drew to a close, Title IV of the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-277 ) raised the H-1B ceiling by 142,500 over three years and contained provisions aimed at correcting some of the perceived abuses. Most importantly, the 1998 law added new attestation requirements for recruitment and lay-off protections, but only requires them of firms that are \"H-1B dependent\" (generally at least 15% of the workforce are H-1Bs). All firms now have to offer H-1Bs benefits as well as wages comparable to their U.S. workers. Education and training for U.S. workers was to be funded by a $500 fee paid by the employer for each H-1B worker hired. The ceiling set by the new law was 115,000 in both FY1999 and FY2000, 107,500 in FY2001, and would revert back to 65,000 in FY2002.", "The House ( H.R. 3736 ) and the Senate ( S. 1723 ) had offered proposals to raise the H-1B ceiling for the next few years, though each bill approached the increase differently. Each bill would have added whistle blower protections for individuals who report violations of the H-1B program and would have increased the penalties for willful violations of the H-1B program. Many considered the provisions aimed at protecting U.S. workers as the most controversial in H.R. 3736 as it was reported by the House Judiciary Committee. While S. 1723 as passed by the Senate did add provisions penalizing firms that lay off U.S. workers and replace them with H-1B workers if the firms have violated other attestation requirements, amendments that would have required prospective H-1B employers to attest that they were not laying off U.S. workers and that they tried to recruit U.S. workers failed on the Senate floor. H.R. 3736 as reported included lay-off protection and recruiting requirement provisions similar to those that the Senate rejected. On the other hand, S. 1723 included language that would have expanded the education and training of U.S. students and workers in the math, science, engineering and information technology fields.", "Pre-conference discussions between Senate and House Republicans late in July 1998 yielded a compromise on key points of difference, but it did not address all the Clinton Administration's concerns regarding the education and training of U.S. workers and reform of the existing program. After a presidential veto threat of the Republican compromise, Republicans began working out a compromise with the White House, and this language passed as the substitute when H.R. 3736 came to the House floor on September 24, 1998.

The Senate had debated the legislation for several days, though much of the debate centered on procedural issues\u2014specifically whether amendments that would legalize certain aliens (mostly Central Americans and Liberians) would be permitted. The House passed S. 2045 under a suspension of the rules shortly after the Senate passed it.", "The language that passed was a substitute version offered by Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch with bipartisan support. It includes many of the same features as the version of the bill reported earlier by the Senate Judiciary Committee. It raises the number of H-1B visas by 297,500 over three years, FY2000-FY2002. Specifically, it adds 80,000 new H-1B visas for FY2000, 87,500 visas for FY2001, and 130,000 visas for FY2002. It also authorizes additional H-1B visas for FY1999 to compensate for the excess inadvertently approved that year. In addition, P.L. 106-313 excludes from the new ceiling all H-1B nonimmigrants who work for universities and nonprofit research facilities. A provision that would have exempted H-1B nonimmigrants with at least a master's degree from the numerical limits was dropped from the final bill. The new law also makes a major change in the law governing the permanent admission of immigrants by eliminating the per-country ceilings for employment-based immigrants. It also has provisions that facilitate the portability of H-1B status for those already here lawfully and requires a study of the \"digital divide\" on access to information technology.", "The new law makes changes in the use of the H-1B fees for education and training, notably earmarking a portion of DOL training funds for skills that are in information technology shortage areas and adding to the NSF portion a K-12 math, science and technology education grant program. Because S. 2045 originated in the Senate, it did not contain revenue provisions. Separate legislation to increase the H-1B fee from $500 to $1,000 ( P.L. 106-311 , H.R. 5362 ) passed the House on October 6, the Senate on October 10, and was signed by President Clinton on October 17. The conference agreement on the FY2001 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill ( H.R. 4942 , H.Rept. 106-1005 ) includes a provision that would authorize another H-1B fee that employers would pay for expedited servicing of the petitions.", "Prior to passage of S. 2045 , the House Judiciary Committee had been taking a somewhat different approach to the H-1B issue. After mark-up considerations for several days, the House Judiciary Committee had ordered Chairman Lamar Smith's bill, the Technology Worker Temporary Relief Act ( H.R. 4227 ), reported with amendments on May 17, 2000. H.R. 4227 would have eliminated the numerical limit on H-1B visas for FY2000 and would have allowed for temporary increases (i.e., enabling employers to hire H-1B workers outside of the numerical ceilings) in FY2001 and FY2002 if certain conditions were met. These conditions included demonstrating that there was a net increase from the previous year in the median wages (including cash bonuses and similar compensation) paid to the U.S. workers on the payroll. H.R. 4227 also would have revised the requirements employers of H-1B workers must meet, notably adding a $40,000 minimum salary and new reporting requirements. Like S. 2045 , universities, elementary and secondary schools, and nonprofit research facilities would have been exempt from most of these new requirements. H.R. 4227 would have required all H-1B employers to file W-2 forms and add anti-fraud provisions (including the requirement that the H-1B have full-time employment) funded by a $100 fee. An additional $200 processing fee would also have been collected and allocated to INS and DOL to expedite the processing of H-1B petitions and attestations. Like S. 2045 , H.R. 4227 included provisions that would facilitate the portability of H-1B status for those already here lawfully.

H.R. 4200 would have allocated 40% of the H-1B visas in FY2000 to nonimmigrants who have at least attained master's degrees and would have increased that allocation to 50% in FY2001 and 60% in FY2002 (with 10,000 set aside each year for persons with Ph.D. degrees). The bill also provided additional visas retroactively for those inadvertently issued in excess of the FY1999 ceiling. It would have added a sliding fee scale based upon the size of the firm seeking H-1B workers and would have revised the uses of the fees collected for education and training programs, including programs for children.

Emerging concerns of a shortage of nurses and other health care workers, however, prompted interest in the use of H-1Bs among health care professionals.

The exemption for H-1Bs employed by nonprofit research institutions would have been broadened to include all nonprofit institutions, and the exemption for H-1Bs employed by governmental organizations would have included \"Federal, State, or local\" governmental research organizations.", "S. 2611 was among those bills that would have eased opportunities for temporary workers to ultimately adjust to LPR status. More specifically, S. 2611 would have exempted aliens who had worked in the United States for three years and who had earned an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering, or math from the numerical limits on permanent admissions. S. 2611 also would have created visa categories (e.g., F-4) for advanced degree candidates studying in the fields of math, engineering, technology or the physical sciences at the end of their course of study. The proposed visa would have allowed eligible students to either return to their country of origin or remain in the United States for up to one year and seek employment in their relevant field of study. In S. 2611 , the proposed foreign students would then have been able to adjust to LPR status outside of the statutory numerical limits on employment-based LPRs.", "H-1B Reform", "On July 18, 2005, Representative Nancy Johnson introduced the USA Jobs Protection Act of 2005 ( H.R. 3322 ), which would have made several changes to current law on H-1B visas, as well as revised the L visa category. In H.R. 3322 , the lay-off protection provisions in current law pertaining to H-1B-dependent employers would have been broadened to cover all employers hiring H-1B workers. In addition, the lay-off protection period would have been expanded from 90 days before and after hiring H-1B workers to 180 days. The bill also would have given DOL the authority to initiate investigations of H-1B employers if there was reasonable cause.", "As introduced by Representative Bill Pascrell on November 17, 2005, the Defend the American Dream Act of 2005 ( H.R. 4378 ) would have made substantial changes to the H-1B visa. Among other reforms, it would have : required employers of H-1B nonimmigrants to use one of three specified methods (whichever results in the highest wages) to determine wages for purposes of required wage attestations; required employers to actively engage in recruitment efforts and, required employers who previously employed one or more H-1B nonimmigrants to submit with their labor condition application (LCA) a copy of the W-2 Wage and Tax Statement filed with respect to those nonimmigrants. It also would have extended to 180 days the period during which certain H-1B employers must show nondisplacement of U.S. workers. It further would have prohibited employers from outsourcing or otherwise contracting for the placement of an H-1B nonimmigrant with another employer, regardless of whether the other employer is H-1B dependent employer. It would have reduced the period of H-1B authorized admission from six to three years and would have eliminated the exemption from H-1B numerical admission limitations aliens with a U.S. master's or higher degree. It would have required the Secretary of Labor to be responsible for investigations of wage complaints and allegations of fraud in the filing of LCAs and would have created a private right of action for persons harmed by an employer's violation of labor condition requirements.", "H-1B Repeal", "On March 15, 2005, Representative Tom Tancredo introduced H.R. 1325 , which would have repealed the authority for H-1B nonimmigrants in the INA."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
