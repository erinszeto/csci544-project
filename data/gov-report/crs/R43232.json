Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Lantos-Hyde Act). The Leadership Act authorized $15 billion to be spent from FY2004 through FY2008 on fighting HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The Lantos-Hyde Act amended the Leadership Act to authorize $48 billion for fighting the three diseases from FY2009 through FY2013.", "The Leadership Act (and the legislation that it amends) is the primary vehicle through which U.S. global assistance for fighting these diseases is authorized.

The Leadership Act and the Lantos-Hyde Act (primarily through amendments to the Leadership Act) created frameworks for how the funds should be spent, established program goals and targets, and established coordinating offices for managing government-wide responses.", "The Leadership Act required the President to establish the Coordinator of the United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally (known as the Global AIDS Coordinator) at the Department of State. Congress appropriates the bulk of global HIV/AIDS funds to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, which leads the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The Global AIDS Coordinator distributes the majority of these funds to U.S. federal agencies and departments and multilateral groups like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Lantos-Hyde Act amended the Leadership Act to establish the Coordinator of the United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally (known as the Malaria Coordinator) at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to oversee implementation of related efforts by USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "Some authorities within these Acts are enduring, such as those that created the Global AIDS and Malaria Coordinator positions (Leadership Act, as amended) and permitted U.S. participation in advance market commitments for vaccine development (Lantos-Hyde Act).

Later that year, Congress enacted the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act), P.L. 108-25 , which authorized $15 billion to be spent from FY2004 to FY2008 on bilateral and multilateral HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria programs. The Act included language that instructed how the funds should be spent, listed several goals and targets, and required the President to establish the Coordinator of the United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally (known as the Global AIDS Coordinator) at the Department of State.

It does not appear some of the contentious issues that dominated debate when crafting the Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts (such as family planning) will be revisited at this time. S. 1545 , the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act and its House companion ( H.R. 3177 ) do not offer a comprehensive extension of the Leadership Act, as amended. Instead, it focuses on key priorities related to strengthening oversight, extending funding authorities for the Global Fund, orphans and vulnerable children, and HIV/AIDS treatments and care programs.

Other expiring authorities enhance congressional oversight capacity, promote research, and direct how funds are to be spent. The discussion below summarizes authorizing language in the Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts that includes a precise end date. The subsections are discussed sequentially."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Performance Targets/Strategy", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts, Congress included language that shaped the scope and breadth of PEPFAR. Section 101 of the Leadership Act, for example, required the President to develop a five-year strategy for combatting HIV/AIDS worldwide from FY2004 through FY2008. The section also set several program targets for HIV/AIDS programs. Section 101 of the Lantos-Hyde Act amended the Leadership Act to require the President to develop another five year strategy for FY2009 through FY2013. The law mandates that the strategy describe how the Administration would reach new targets by the end of FY2013. These are: ", "prevent 12 million new HIV infections; care for 12 million people affected by HIV/AIDS, including 5 million orphans; treat at least 2 million more people; ensure at least 80% of target populations have access to counseling, testing, and treatment; and train at least 140,000 health care professionals and paraprofessionals.", "Congress also used the Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts to set targets for combatting TB worldwide. Section 302 of the Leadership Act amended section 104B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) to authorize U.S. participation in several multilateral anti-TB efforts and specified treatment targets. Section 302 of the Lantos-Hyde Act amended section 104B(b) of the FAA to direct the President to establish a five-year strategy for expanding and improving U.S. TB programs and achieving the following targets by 2013:", "treat 4.5 million new sputum smear TB patients under Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) programs; and diagnose and treat 90,000 new multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases.", "There is growing discussion about the utility of setting treatment and other numeric targets. On the one hand, such targets can be effective tools in demonstrating congressional intent and motivating an expansive and swift response. On the other hand, it could be argued that other indicators, such as changes in disease prevalence or survival rates, are better measures of program effectiveness. It can be difficult, however, to link these broader outcomes to particular project activities. ", "Efforts to attribute results to a particular activity have become complicated by the growing cadre of actors who often collaborate to address these diseases. The Global Fund and the United States, for example, frequently provide various elements of support to the same population. For instance, grantees of the Global Fund may purchase treatments for any of the three diseases but use U.S.-funded supply chain networks to distribute the medication.", "PEPFAR has undergone tremendous expansion and transformation since its early years. Some question whether numerical targets are the appropriate measure of its impact at this current stage. During the first phase of PEPFAR, the United States and other stakeholders rushed to expand access to treatment and care for people affected by HIV/AIDS in low-resource countries. Numerical targets helped to leverage support for addressing HIV/AIDS both within the United States and in the global arena. As the program progressed, it became increasingly evident that the poor state of health systems in recipient countries encumbered efforts to rapidly implement treatment and care programs. Health system strengthening has become an increasingly important part of PEPFAR and has become a critical strategy for advancing country ownership. Some groups are calling for more qualitative studies that measure impact (declines in transmission rates, for example) rather than a count of beneficiaries.", "Section 204 of the Leadership Act as amended made the strengthening of health policies and health systems a policy of the United States. The section requires the Global AIDS Coordinator, in collaboration with USAID, to develop and implement a plan to combat HIV/AIDS by strengthening health policies and health systems of partner countries. The section also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide assistance for the improvement of public finance management systems in recipient countries. The section authorizes such sums as necessary to carry out these activities for each of FY2009 through FY2013. It remains to be seen whether the Administration will continue to aim for achieving ambitious prevention, care, and treatment goals without congressional directives. The strategy for strengthening health systems and health policy worldwide, however, will likely remain a priority, evidenced in part by the creation of the Office of Health Systems at USAID in 2012.
