Agent Orange (named for the orange-colored identifying stripes on the barrels) was by far the most widely used herbicide during the Vietnam War. Many Vietnam-era veterans believe that their exposure to Agent Orange caused them to contract several diseases and caused certain disabilities, including birth defects in their children, and now their grandchildren.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the first claims asserting conditions related to Agent Orange in 1977. Since then, Vietnam-era veterans have sought relief from Congress and through the judicial system. Beginning in 1979, Congress enacted several laws to determine whether exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam was associated with possible long-term health effects and certain disabilities. The Veterans' Health Care, Training and Small Business Loan Act (P.L. 97-72) elevated Vietnam veterans' priority status for health care at VA facilities by recognizing a veteran's own report of exposure as sufficient proof to receive medical care, absent evidence to the contrary. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-262) completely restructured the VA medical care eligibility requirements for all veterans. Under P.L. 104-262, a veteran does not have to demonstrate a link between a certain health condition and exposure to Agent Orange; instead, medical care is provided unless the VA determines that the condition did not result from exposure to Agent Orange. This authority was permanently authorized by the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-163).", "Likewise, Congress passed several measures to address disability compensation issues affecting Vietnam veterans. The Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-542) required the VA to develop regulations for disability compensation to Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. In 1991, the Agent Orange Act (P.L. 102-4) established a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with herbicide exposure. P.L. 102-4 authorized the VA to contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct scientific reviews of the evidence linking certain medical conditions to herbicide exposure. Under this law, the VA is required to review the reports of the IOM and issue regulations, establishing a presumption of service connection for any disease for which there is scientific evidence of a positive association with herbicide exposure. Based on these IOM reports, currently 15 health conditions are presumptively service-connected.", "Under current regulations, a servicemember must have actually set foot on Vietnamese soil or served on a craft in its rivers (also known as \"brown water\" veterans) to be entitled to the presumption of exposure to Agent Orange. Those who served aboard deep-water naval vessels (commonly referred to as \"Blue Water Navy\" veterans) do not qualify for presumption of service connections for herbicide-related conditions unless they can prove that the veteran's service included duty or visitation within the country of Vietnam itself, or on its inland waterways.", "Recently, Vietnam-era veterans have increasingly expressed concerns about all types of medical issues occurring in their children, regardless of age, and in successive generations.

Since then, Vietnam-era veterans have made efforts to obtain disability compensation and health care from Congress and through the judicial system. In response to issues raised by Vietnam-era veterans, Congress has passed legislation to research the long-term health effects of Agent Orange on Vietnam veterans and to provide benefits and services to those who may have been exposed to it.

The U.S. Air Force sprayed nearly 19 million gallons of herbicides in Vietnam, of which at least 11 million gallons were Agent Orange\u2014making it the most widely used herbicide in the war. \"Agent Orange (so named because of orange color stripes on the barrels used to store and ship the chemical) was a 50-50 mixture of the herbicides 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.\" This mixture was contaminated with varying concentrations of numerous dioxins, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin (TCDD) during the manufacturing process. This contaminant was shown to be highly toxic in animals, and it was implicated in birth defects seen in mice. However, its effects on humans have not been fully understood.

However, following the publication of a 1979 General Accounting Office (GAO, now called Government Accountability Office) report documenting ground troop exposure, DOD acknowledged that ground troops were also exposed to Agent Orange. Likewise, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) consistently took the position that because the long-term exposure to Agent Orange was unclear, and because of scientific uncertainty of the evidence linking Agent Orange to specific illnesses, it could not compensate veterans who alleged that exposure to Agent Orange had caused their diseases. In testifying before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the then Administrator of Veterans Affairs stated: ", "Unless or until some such latent effects of Agent Orange or its derivative components are scientifically documented there are intrinsic limitations to VA's authority to allow these [Agent Orange] claims under current law. Though I cannot emphasize enough our policy to resolve reasonable doubt as to service incurrence of disabilities in favor of claimants, there is currently no medical basis upon which adverse health effects of late-post-exposure onset can be reasonably tied to Agent Orange. ", "In December 1979, Congress passed the Veterans Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979 ( P.L. 96-151 ) and directed the VA to investigate the long-term effects of dioxin exposure during the Vietnam War. In 1981, Congress passed the Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-72 ) and required the VA to include the study of other environmental exposures that may have occurred during the Vietnam conflict. However, the VA never designed a protocol for conducting the study, and responsibility for conducting the study was transferred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 1987, the CDC ceased attempts to produce a study and never released any findings. Although Vietnam-era veterans continued to urge Congress to establish policies for health care and disability compensation (see text box \"Eligibility for Health Care and Disability Compensation\") for Agent Orange exposure, a lack of a substantial, scientific consensus on the potential health effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam veterans and their offspring impeded those efforts.

Since the enactment of P.L. 97-72 , Congress has from time to time passed legislation to provide medical care to veterans\u2014and to some of their offspring\u2014who may have been exposed to Agent Orange. In particular, Congress has addressed specific health care concerns of male and female Vietnam-era veterans. These concerns typically involve adverse reproductive effects. For instance, for male veterans, service in Vietnam has been associated with one particular adverse reproductive outcome: spina bifida. However, among female veterans, Vietnam service has been associated with the risk of having children with a wide range of birth defects.

Veterans seeking compensation for a condition they thought to be related to herbicide exposure had to provide proof of a service connection that established the link between herbicide exposure and disease onset. P.L. 98-542 authorized disability compensation payments to Vietnam veterans for the skin condition chloracne, which is associated with herbicide exposure. ", "In 1991, the Agent Orange Act ( P.L. 102-4 ) established a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with herbicide exposure (see text box \"What is Presumption of Service Connection ?\"). The act directed the VA to \"prescribe regulations providing that a presumption of service connection is warranted for [a] disease\" when a positive statistical association exists between Agent Orange exposure and the occurrence of that disease in humans. In making this determination, P.L. 102-4 authorized the VA to contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review and summarize the scientific evidence concerning the association between exposure to herbicides used in support of military operations in Vietnam during the Vietnam era and each disease suspected to be associated with such exposure. P.L. 102-4 mandated that IOM determine, to the extent possible, (1) whether there is a statistical association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking into account the strength of the scientific evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association; (2) the increased risk of disease among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era; and (3) whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship between herbicide exposure and the health outcome. ", "The law requires the VA, within 60 days of receiving a report from IOM regarding the relationship between exposure to herbicides used in Vietnam during the Vietnam War and certain diseases, to consider whether a presumption of service connection is warranted for any of the diseases discussed in the report, as well as all other available sound medical and scientific information. Within 60 days of making such a determination, the VA is required to issue proposed regulations setting forth that determination. Within 90 days of issuing the proposed regulations, the VA must issue final regulations establishing a presumption of service connection for any disease for which there is scientific evidence of a positive association with herbicide exposure. Once the VA has established a presumption of service connection for a certain disease or medical condition, a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam (or its inland waterways) during the Vietnam era shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to Agent Orange, and a service connection for that disease or condition will be granted. Those who did not serve in in the Republic of Vietnam or its inland waterways could still establish service connection on a direct basis. Based on the most recent IOM report, \"Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2012,\" the VA decided not to establish any new presumptions.

At the time, the VA had promulgated a rule that found only one disease, chloracne, associated with exposure to Agent Orange. When promulgating this rule under the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act, the VA had used a stringent \"cause and effect\" test for determining which diseases would be associated with Agent Orange exposure. The veterans argued that the \"cause and effect\" standard was too stringent and contrary to the legislative intent of Congress. In 1989, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California agreed and declared that the VA was required to use a more lenient \"significant statistical association\" standard when determining whether a disease is associated with Agent Orange exposure. The court invalidated the VA regulations and voided all benefit denials made under those regulations. In response to this court decision, Congress enacted the Agent Orange Act of 1991 in February of that year.", "After the enactment of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, the parties from Nehmer entered into a Final Stipulation and Order (Final Stipulation) that established the actions that the VA would take in response to the 1989 court decision. Most notably, the VA was required to issue new regulations regarding which diseases are associated with exposure to dioxin under the Agent Orange Act of 1991 and then readjudicate the claims that were previously denied by the VA under the invalid regulations. The Final Stipulation also stated that any benefits awarded upon such readjudication or adjudication shall be paid retroactively.
