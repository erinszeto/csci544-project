Although specific force mix recommendations can be nuanced, policy advocates generally divide between those who favor a stronger AC emphasis and those who favor a stronger RC emphasis. In the contemporary debate, those who favor a stronger RC emphasis believe that RC units, if properly trained and equipped, are as capable as their AC counterparts while costing less. Thus, they argue that RC units can replace a portion of AC force structure while saving money. Those who favor a stronger AC emphasis believe that certain RC forces\u2014particularly larger direct combat units and higher echelon headquarters\u2014are not as capable as AC forces without substantial additional preparation; cannot respond to a crisis as rapidly as AC forces; and cannot be used with the same frequency and duration as AC forces due to policy limitations. Those who take this perspective believe that replacing too many or certain types of AC units with RC units could reduce the Army's ability to respond rapidly to an overseas crisis and sustain operations over time, or could require too much additional RC funding and training time to make such an approach cost-effective.", "Given the nation's current fiscal situation, the contemporary debate has shifted somewhat in favor of a higher ratio of RC forces. For example, in its FY2015 budget request, the Administration proposes that RC forces make up 54.1% of the Army by FY2017, in comparison to 53.6% just before the September 11 attacks and 49.1% when the Army was at its peak size during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (2010).

Of these, utilization, readiness, effectiveness, cost, and risk are generally considered the major elements in developing the AC/RC force mix. Each of these factors is described in some detail in this report, along with questions for further investigation. As Congress considers the future AC/RC mix for the Army, it may wish to consider several approaches, including supporting Administration proposals on AC/RC mix; gathering additional information on key factors which contribute to AC/RC mix decisions; directly altering AC/RC mix; and influencing AC/RC mix by adjusting factors that contribute to mix decisions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Issue Overview", "paragraphs": ["The Army is composed of both an Active Component (AC) and a Reserve Component (RC).

Congress is also responsible for ensuring the AC and RC are properly equipped and supplied, determining pay and benefits, establishing personnel policies, and exercising oversight of Executive Branch management of the Department of Defense (DOD). If it so chooses, it can also allocate roles and missions for the Services and their reserve components, adjust reserve activation authorities, determine training regimens, establish or disestablish units, specify unit composition, and designate the number and types of units within each component.", "In recent years, several factors have coincided to stimulate interest in the AC/RC mix, particularly for the Army. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan included large-scale and continuing mobilizations of RC forces, and defense officials and other observers have generally expressed satisfaction with the operational performance of these units. Additionally, concerns about federal spending, coupled with the constraints of the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ), have led many to look for ways to cut costs within the DOD. As a result, some policy makers have begun considering whether part-time RC forces might provide a more cost-effective alternative to some portion of the AC force structure, particularly for the Army, which has the largest reserve component of all the Services. ", "In its FY2015 budget request, the Administration envisions shifting the AC/RC mix somewhat more toward the RC. It proposes that RC forces make up 54.1% of the Army by FY2017, in comparison to 53.6% just before the September 11 attacks and 49.1% when the Army was at its peak size during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (2010). This proposal would also include a shift of the relative proportion of brigade combat teams (BCTs) towards the ARNG, although the Army's Aviation Restructuring Initiative proposes moving attack helicopters (AH-64 Apaches) from the USAR and ARNG to the AC to replace retiring armed reconnaissance helicopters (OH-58D). In return, the USAR and ARNG would receive utility helicopters (UH-60 Blackhawk). Others have advocated a greater shift towards the RC. For example, one proposal put forward by the National Guard Association of the United States recommends the Army be realigned so that RC forces make up 58% of the Army, with 420,000 AC, 385,000 ARNG and 195,000 USAR. This discussion is not purely academic, as various groups favoring the RC or the AC attempt to persuade the Administration and Congress of the importance and relevance of their respective components in relation to what they believe will be the future strategic environment facing the United States. ", "The House Armed Services Committee Oversight Plan for the 113 th Congress summarized the importance of this issue to Congress, and the difficult choices it poses, noting:", "The debate that began during the 112 th Congress about the most appropriate force structure mix of active and reserve components, about the proper roles and missions of the reserve components\u2014be they an operational or strategic reserve\u2014and about the affordability of the required force to meet national security requirements will intensify in the 113 th Congress. Competition among the active and reserve components for diminishing resources will serve as a catalyst for that debate. As evidenced by the debate about the Air Force's active and reserve component force structure recommendations submitted with the Fiscal Year 2013 President's budget and subsequent Congressional action, reaching a consensus will be most challenging."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Brief History of Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) Force Mix", "paragraphs": ["The ratio of AC and RC forces has shifted dramatically over time, and Congress has played a central role in these shifts. From the founding of the nation to the Cold War era, the bulk of force structure was maintained in the reserve component (especially the militia/National Guard), except in times of major conflicts. When major conflicts arose\u2014such as the Civil War, World War I, and World War II\u2014the comparatively small active component was expanded through the activation of militia and federal reserves, recruitment of additional volunteers for the AC, and the use of conscription. At the end of the conflict, active force levels were dramatically reduced. For example, in 1939, there were fewer than 350,000 active duty personnel in all branches of the U.S. armed forces. During World War II, this number grew enormously, reaching over 12 million servicemembers on duty by 1945. With the end of World War II, the United States radically reduced the size of its active armed forces to about 1.5 million in 1947-1950.", "This approach changed with the onset of the Cold War. With the advent of the Korean War in 1950, the United States doubled the size of its active forces by 1951 to approximately 3.2 million. This increase included a major reserve mobilization, with over 850,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves called to active duty. However, with the end of the war in 1953, the size of the active component did not decrease nearly as much as it would have in earlier eras. For the next decade, it remained roughly between 2.5 million and 3 million for all services, while the size of the reserve component hovered around 1 million. In response to the Vietnam War, the size of the active component was increased again to about 3.5 million (1968), but there was no major reserve mobilization. Thus, since the Korean War and continuing to the present, the United States has maintained most of its force structure in the AC. (Although, it should be pointed out that starting in 1989 and continuing to the present, a slight majority of Army force structure has been RC.) In 2003, author Richard A. Lacquement Jr. noted:", "Nevertheless, active duty forces dominate the military. This is unlike the peacetime history of the U.S. armed forces before World War II when militia and other reserve forces far outnumbered the much smaller standing elements of the armed forces ... Although there has been a shift in relative emphasis to the ready reserves since the end of the Cold War, the current American military posture is still dominated by the standing forces of the four military services. ", "This shift to an AC-centric force structure model in the aftermath of World War II began to ebb somewhat starting in the 1970s. The downsizing that followed the Vietnam War, the end of the comparatively inexpensive manpower provided by conscription, budgetary pressures, and dissatisfaction with the negative consequences of not using reserve forces more extensively during Vietnam led to a renewed focus on using RC forces to supplement the AC. The Total Force Policy, established in 1973 by Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger on the basis of the 1970 Total Force Concept developed by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, sought to integrate \"the Active, Guard and Reserve forces into a homogenous whole\" and emphasized that, instead of draftees, \"Guard and Reserve forces will be used as the initial and primary augmentation of active forces.\" ", "General Creighton Abrams, the Chief of Staff of the Army from 1972-74, implemented this policy for the Army by instituting changes which deeply integrated reserve forces into the active force structure. This deeper integration helped General Abrams rebuild the Army to 16 divisions while staying within budgetary limits; it also effectively ensured that the Army could not be sent to war again without the Guard and Reserve, as had occurred in Vietnam. The most notable manifestation of this increased active-reserve integration was the roundout brigade program, which involved restructuring of certain AC divisions to include an RC brigade. Normally, an AC division would have three AC brigades assigned to it. At Abrams' direction, some AC divisions were assigned two AC brigades, along with a \"roundout\" National Guard brigade; other AC divisions kept three AC brigades but had some of their AC battalions replaced with \"roundout\" RC battalions. Congress passed a new law to allow in 1976 to make it easier for the President to activate RC personnel and units. Other initiatives to improve active-reserve integration in the 1970s and 1980s included more modernized equipment for the RC, greater overseas training opportunities, and rotations at the newly established National Training Center. ", "The first major test of this greater active-reserve integration came during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, which saw the activation of over 238,000 RC personnel, including about 60,000 members of the Army National Guard and some 88,000 members of the Army Reserve. In many respects, RC performance in this conflict strengthened support for the Total Force Policy among defense policy makers. However, there were areas of RC readiness identified as needing improvement. This was most apparent with respect to the roundout brigades. Three ARNG roundout brigades were mobilized, somewhat belatedly, and deployed to the National Training Center for post-mobilization training. Amid claims of serious readiness deficiencies, however, they were not certified as combat ready until the war was over. A contemporary report by the Congressional Research Service summarized this experience as follows:", "In late 1990, three Army National Guard combat maneuver brigades were mobilized for Operation Desert Shield (later Desert Storm), the U.S. military effort against Iraq. All three brigades were \"roundout\" units, designated to bring an active Army division to full strength upon mobilization. However, the brigades were not activated until four months after Desert Shield began; the two whose parent divisions fought in the war did not deploy with those divisions; none of the brigades left the U.S.; and the only one to be \"validated\" as combat ready was so judged on the day of the cease-fire. The brigades' experience generated much controversy about the viability of the roundout concept and the active Army's relationships with the National Guard ... The major criticism of the roundout brigades is that they were not ready to deploy with their parent divisions. However, roundout brigades were never intended to deploy without some postmobilization training, and it was never envisioned that they could deploy immediately in response to a no-notice crisis. Unfortunately, a combination of excessive optimism, overreliance on numerical readiness ratings, and high-level inattention to the actual readiness levels of the roundout brigades before Desert Shield/Storm led many to assume that they were as ready as similar active Army brigades. Although the brigades had major readiness problems when first called up, they were able to be validated for deployment to the theater of war three months after activation. This was an unprecedented achievement compared with past call ups of similar reserve component units. ", "The Persian Gulf War experience led Congress to address identified readiness shortcomings through passage of the Army National Guard Combat Readiness Reform Act of 1992 (also known as \"Title XI,\" in reference to its location within the 1993 National Defense Authorization Act ). The reforms focused primarily, though not exclusively, on ARNG combat units. Title XI contained 19 provisions which sought to improve the readiness of Army Guard units and their compatibility with AC units by: increasing experience and leadership levels in the ARNG by recruiting more prior-service personnel, Service Academy graduates, and ROTC graduates; revising the training focus for combat units; providing for a more robust medical and dental evaluation process; ensuring the compatibility of personnel, supply, maintenance and finance systems across the AC, ARNG, and USAR; reforming the Army's readiness system for USAR and ARNG units; directing the Secretary of the Army to conduct inspections to ensure that ARNG units meet deployability standards; and mandating that the Army provide greater funding to early deploying ARNG and USAR units.", "Although the Department of Defense effectively ended the roundout brigade program in 1993, the disintegration of the Soviet Union gave further impetus to the ongoing integration of the AC and RC. With the demise of the United States' main military competitor, the requirement for large numbers of ground forces at a high state of readiness was considered less critical for national security. Subsequently, AC force structure was substantially reduced in the 1990s. During this time, the Army also adjusted the roles of its reserve components. The Army's 1993 \"Offsite Agreement\" guided the realignment of force structure between the ARNG and USAR, and stipulated that", "The ARNG would retain a balanced mix of combat and support units; The USAR would be divested of nearly all its combat structure and would focus on providing support units; it would also provide the bulk of the RC's Echelon Above Division (EAD) and Echelon Above Corps (EAC) units; and The USAR and ARNG would swap approximately 12,000 spaces to facilitate this agreement. ", "The post-Cold War drawdown was followed by the increased employment of RC forces in Iraq (low-intensity conflict with Iraq, 1998-2003), Bosnia (1995-2004), Kosovo (1999-present), and Haiti (1994-1996). As the use of RC units increased and they gained experience through repetitive deployments, the distinction between components faded somewhat, and RC units began to be more seriously considered as suitable substitutes for AC units\u2014provided they received necessary personnel, equipment, training and preparation time prior to being deployed. This perspective was further reinforced by the large-scale and continuing mobilizations of RC forces for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which led many public officials and policy analysts to conclude that the performance of the RC in these conflicts largely validated the Total Force Policy. Some Army officials have argued, however, that AC and RC units are not interchangeable, with one senior Army officer indicating that this was the reason RC BCTs were used for less complex missions in Iraq and Afghanistan than their AC counterparts. RC advocates counter that they had no control over the missions they were assigned in Iraq and Afghanistan, that they were effective in all the missions they were given, and that they could have successfully completed combined arms maneuver missions if they had been given the opportunity.", "In addition to the large scale mobilization of RC units during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress authorized significant expansions of the active Army and Marine Corps. This led to an increase in the ratio of AC to RC forces in those Services. However, with the end of the war in Iraq and the ongoing reduction of forces in Afghanistan, a multi-year drawdown of AC forces is underway in these Services. This drawdown has rolled back the war-time increases in AC strength and will likely end at a level lower than existed prior to the war. As such, the proportion of AC to RC forces will also likely decline in those Services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Active-Reserve Mix", "paragraphs": ["The Army determines the distribution of units between the AC, ARNG, and USAR within the end strengths mandated annually by Congress by a process it calls Total Army Analysis (TAA).

", "In addition to strategic guidance, budgetary considerations play a major role in determining the size of the Army as well as, to an extent, the AC/RC force mix. Historically, during times of conflict or national emergency, resources are made available to expand the Army as well as provide necessary equipment and training. After conflicts or during periods of protracted peace, traditionally fewer resources have been provided to the Army, often resulting in a drawdown of forces as well as the rebalancing of the AC/RC mix based on the premise that RC forces are less costly to maintain during peacetime. These decreases in resources can also adversely affect the readiness of available forces as well as impact Army modernization efforts.", "As previously noted, the Army determines much of the AC/RC force mix by the Total Army Analysis (TAA) process.

However, some observers argue AC and RC units are not identical in terms of availability and, at least in some circumstances, are not identical in terms of capability; hence, they are not always interchangeable for mission planning purposes. For example, AC Army units are usually considered better positioned to respond to crises requiring immediate action because they are more readily available; that is, they typically require less notification, preparation and train up time prior to deployment than similar RC units. RC Army units tend to be preferred for missions that permit a substantial train up period; for example, as reinforcements for an initial response force or as part of a periodic rotation for a long term mission.

In 1976, a new authority, now known as Presidential Reserve Callup Authority, allowed the President to activate reservists for missions without a declaration of emergency, though the duration of this type of activation was limited, as was the number of reservists who could be activated at any given time. Subsequent amendments expanded the scope of this authority significantly. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act added two new activation authorities: one to permit activation of reservists for up to 120 days to respond to disasters, and another to permit activation of reservists for up to one year for \"preplanned mission in support of a combatant command.\" This latter authority opens the door for activations in support of more routine military missions, rather than the crisis or \"contingency\" focus of the other authorities.

This method used the number of deployments as its output metric. The second method calculated AC and RC personnel costs over the course of the year, and used days of duty performed as its output metric. ", "According to the authors, the life-cycle cost method estimated the lifetime cost of an AC servicemember at nearly $2.4 million, and the RC servicemember at about $790,000. \"In terms of 'usage,' this works out to $336,000 per deployment 'opportunity' for the active member and $198,000 for a member of the reserves.\" In this analysis, reserve personnel cost about 60% of what active personnel cost per deployment. The authors' concluded that \"In essence, this analysis shows that reserves are a good deal because the military services only have to pay for them when they are needed. Because their retirement is deferred\u2014not paid out until age 60\u2014it is much less expensive than for active members ... However, there are limitations to this assessment too.

It then estimated the compensation that each of these three servicemember types would receive over the course of the year, and divided that by days of duty performing. The result was an estimated \"cost per duty day\" in FY2005 of $261.52 for AC personnel, $284.35 for statutory reservists and $237.30 for busy reservists. Using this method then, reserve personnel cost between 91% (busy reservists) and 109% (statutory reservists) of what active personnel cost per day of duty performed. The authors state, \"The bottom line of this analysis is that the more days reservists serve, the less costly they are to use ... in other words, a busy reservist is cheaper than a statutory one.

The costing models developed for this \"deployed unit cost approach\" included two variables that profoundly affected comparative cost calculations: the deployment-to-dwell ratio for AC and RC forces and, for RC forces, the amount of time devoted to pre-deployment training.", "This approach appears to have been developed first by Jacob Klerman and published in Rethinking the Reserves . In chapter 5 of this monograph, the author reviews several previously published works and identifies the comparative cost of the RC when not activated at 20-30% of AC forces, and 100% of AC forces when activated. The author then estimates the number of RC units and AC units required, according to various deployment-dwell ratios, to maintain one unit \"boots on the ground (BOG)\" continuously in a given deployment location. The estimate is three for AC units and eight for RC units, assuming that AC units deploy 12 months out of 36 and that RC units train for three months and deploy for nine months out of 72. \"Thus, according to policy guidance, we need 3.0 (=36/12) AC units in the force to keep one unit BOG ... and 8.0 (=72/9) units in the [reserve] force to keep one unit BOG. Thus, the ratio of RC to AC units is slightly less than 3 (2.7 = 8.0/3.0).\" These rotation estimates are based on DOD guidelines established in 2007 and still in effect today.

Under the DOD rotation policy guidelines (12:36 for AC; (9+3)/72 for RC), he concludes that in peacetime, the relative cost of RC units is 67% of AC units. In wartime, the relative cost of RC units is 101%. Subsequently, the author manipulates some of the key variables\u2014deployment-to-dwell ratios, the proportion of the reserve component involved in deployments, and the relative cost of RC units when not deployed\u2014to generate a table illustrating a range of potential relative costs.

In the colonial and founding eras, \"standing armies\" and a naval establishment were considered by many to be the principal threat to democratic sovereignty and individual liberty. In the event of military crisis, the preferred solution was to call on \"citizen-soldiers\"\u2014members of the militia\u2014to augment a relatively small professional force. This distrust of professional forces declined substantially in the aftermath of World War II, and some may find it anachronistic today, but such sentiments continue to undergird support for a robust reserve component vis-\u00e0-vis the active component. Additionally, since the advent of the All-Volunteer Force in 1973, policy makers have periodically raised concerns that the military was not adequately reflective of the U.S. population at large and was at risk of becoming isolated from it. The reserve components, while suffering from some of the same representational issues, are more geographically dispersed throughout the country, and its members normally live and work in the civilian world, thus providing a bridge of connection between the two worlds.

As previously discussed, AC BCTs are trained up to the brigade level during the ARFORGEN process while ARNG BCTs are only trained up to the platoon and company level. The implication of this current policy is that, upon completion of the ARFORGEN process, only the platoons and companies of an ARNG BCT are fully ready to deploy and conduct their assigned missions. General Raymond Odierno, the Army Chief of Staff, highlighted this issue in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee: ", "What the Guard is able to do is do individual proficiency and small unit proficiency. So they get good at their individual MOS [Military Occupational Specialty]. They can do some small unit, platoon level capability, maybe at home station. But without having CTC [Combat Training Centers] rotations, it's much more difficult to get to company, battalion, and brigade. And the more complex the organization, the more difficult it is. The complex organizations are brigade combat teams, aviation brigades. Less complex organizations, such as transportation units and maintenance units, they can do a lot of it at home station. But the impact is really on the more complex, integrated, collective training that has to be done, that they're simply not able to do, where in an active unit you can do it at your home station because you have the ground and air space and facilities to do it and you're collocated together, where the Guard is spread out and they don't have that. So they need the training center in order to build that readiness.", "This testimony suggests that the Army believes there are significant differences between AC and ARNG BCTs, and that the cause of this distinction is differences in training, including inherent differences in the time available between AC and RC forces. Specifically, General Odierno notes the comparative lack of CTC rotations for ARNG BCTs and the training limits caused by geographic dispersion of their subordinate elements. To address the first factor, Congress could elect to provide for additional CTC rotations for ARNG BCTs. General Mark Milley, the commander of U.S. Army Forces Command, has recently advocated this approach. This option would likely require additional funding for the rotations and may require statutory changes to mandate additional training days for the BCT members; it would also require increased ARNG access to CTCs, either by displacing AC units, expanding the capacity of the existing CTCs, or establishing one or more new CTCs. Addressing the second factor might be more difficult, given that the geographic dispersion of RC units is considered a positive factor in other ways, but it could include statutory or funding changes to facilitate or mandate greater battalion and brigade level training opportunities.

Current Legislation Related to Army AC-RC Mix", "H.R. 4435 , National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015 ", "From H.Rept. 113-446 (pp. 199-200)", "Army Force Structure", "The committee believes the Army's current requirement to further reduce planned end strength and force structure by fiscal year 2019 is a direct consequence of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112\u201325). The committee notes the Army's current plan would reduce the Active Component end strength from a wartime high of 570,000 soldiers to 450,000 soldiers with a potential further reduction to 420,000 soldiers absent repeal of sequestration-level budget caps in fiscal year 2016.", "As a result, the committee understands the Army is also reducing active brigade combat teams from 45 to 32 and divesting almost 700 aircraft, as well as eliminating 3 combat aviation brigades. The Army's plan would also reduce Army National Guard end strength from 358,000 soldiers to 335,000 soldiers with a potential further reduction to 315,000 soldiers absent repeal of sequestration-level budget caps. The committee understands the Army National Guard would be required to divest its AH\u201364 Apache attack helicopters, effectively transferring these assets to the Active Component, as well as divest its OH\u201358 Kiowa Warriors Scout Reconnaissance helicopters. However, the committee understands the Army National Guard would receive 111 UH\u201360 Black Hawk L and M model utility helicopters from the Active Component to improve the Guard's capabilities to perform title 32 crisis response and defense support to civil authority missions. Therefore, the committee expects that those units that transfer AH\u201364 Apache attack helicopters to the active Army will receive priority for modernized Black Hawks which should be at a minimum in the UH\u2013 60 Black Hawk L model utility helicopter configuration. ", "In testimony before the committee, the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff of the Army officially stated their concerns regarding the potential inability of the U.S. Army to meet the requirements of the current National Military Strategy and execute operational plans absent a repeal of sequestration-level budget caps in fiscal year 2016. The committee remains concerned by this testimony and believes that in order to mitigate the increased strategic risk generated by the Budget Control Act of 2011, the Army is being forced to reduce end strength to preserve near-term readiness through the Future Years Defense Program. The committee is concerned with the planned reductions and realignments the Army has proposed, specifically the greater reductions in Active Component end strength and brigade combat teams, as well as the proposed aviation realignment of combat aviation aircraft. Therefore, elsewhere in this Act, the committee includes a provision that would require a Comptroller General of the United States review of the methods the Army and the Department of Defense Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation used to determine the future force structure of the Army, to include the appropriate mix between Active, Guard, and Reserve Component forces. The committee also recommends increases in funding for procurement and operation and maintenance accounts to accelerate the conversions of UH\u201360A to UH\u201360L Black Hawk helicopters, and also recommends additional funding to procure six additional UH\u201360M Black Hawk helicopters to address Army National Guard modernization shortfalls.

The commissioners stated in their report that, ''As the Commission proceeded with its work, it became increasingly clear that the DOD's interpretation of FACA's purpose would have a significant, and frequently negative, impact on the Commission's work.'' It is apparent from the views of the commissioners that the Department's interpretation of the oversight safeguards intended by the FACA may have unnecessarily complicated the conduct of their study. The committee expects the Secretary of Defense to support the National Commission on the Future of the Army in a balanced manner and in a spirit consistent with congressional intent and appropriate FACA oversight while avoiding the negative impacts that were experienced by the Air Force Commission.", "The committee is also aware that certain aspects of the Army's ''1993 Offsite Agreement'' pertaining to reserve component core competencies has, in part, for the last 20 years, guided its analysis and decision making with respect to reserve component force structure. This agreement, between senior leadership of the regular Army, ARNG, USAR, and the associations representing their members, guided the realignment of combat arms, combat support, and combat service support force structure between the ARNG and USAR. The agreement provides that the ARNG should retain a mix of combat arms and support structure while the USAR would divest its combat arms and retain combat support and combat service support capabilities. In this manner the core competencies of the Army's reserve components are established: for the ARNG a balance of combat and supporting arms, and for the USAR combat support and service support. By and since this agreement, therefore, the ARNG has been and remains the reserve component within which the Army places those combat arms capabilities to reinforce, supplement, or compliment the combat capabilities of the active Army. The committee notes that, as appropriate and necessary to address the national security and support for civil authorities requirements of the United States, there are several examples of units and capabilities in the regular Army that are not in the reserves, as well as units and capabilities in the reserves that are not in the regular Army.", "This system for the alignment of core capabilities among the Army's reserve components has served the Nation, the Army, and the domestic support and public safety needs of the states very well ever since. The committee recognizes the success of this agreement, as evident by the successful partnerships in combat, security, and support missions by active and reserve servicemembers in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The Committee understands that the Army made this proposal primarily for affordability reasons. The Committee approves the proposal, with the exception of the transfer of Apache aircraft from the Army National Guard, as discussed in title VIII of this Act. With respect to the retirement of TH\u201367 aircraft, the Committee is extremely concerned about the impact on the rotary wing industrial base of placing such a large amount of excess airframes on the market. Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act on the aircraft being retired as part of the Army proposal. This report should include the number of airframes being divested; the number of airframes being transferred to other government agencies, the number of airframes being offered for sale to other nations, the cost of divesting these aircraft, and the impact the divestiture of these airframes will have on the domestic rotary wing industrial base. Further, the Secretary of the Army is prohibited from divesting any aircraft until the report is submitted by the Secretary of Defense.", "Appendix C. Historical Rationales for Reserve\u00a0Forces", "At the end of FY2013, there were slightly more than 1.4 million members of the active components of the U.S. armed forces and roughly 842,000 members of the Selected Reserve. If one looks only at the Army, the active component is slightly smaller than its combined reserve components (530,000 active component personnel versus 555,000 reserve component). While this may seem remarkable, it is not particularly unusual from an historical perspective. In fact, for most of the nation's history, active component forces have been quite small and the reserve components have been comparatively large. This situation was reversed after World War II, with active forces predominating, but the balance shifted back somewhat in the aftermath of the Cold War. Still, regardless of historical era, the United States has always maintained a substantial proportion of its military force structure in the reserve components. There have been four principal reasons for this, each of which is described below.", "Ideological", "The long U.S. tradition of a keeping a substantial military force structure in the reserve components can be traced to the ideological underpinnings of the nation's founding, which included a powerful aversion to professional military forces. In the colonial and founding eras, \"standing armies\" and a naval establishment were considered by many to be the principal threat to democratic sovereignty and individual liberty. In the event of military crisis, the preferred solution was to call on \"citizen-soldiers\"\u2014members of the militia\u2014to augment a relatively small professional force. The Constitution gives Congress the authority \"to raise and support Armies\" and \"to provide and maintain a Navy,\" while simultaneously recognizing the existence of the militia and granting the federal government a certain amount of control over it. The intent of this arrangement, as articulated by Alexander Hamilton in in The Federalist Papers , was for the militia to augment the professional forces in time of need and to serve as a check upon their power:", "it is a matter of utmost importance that a well digested plan should, as soon as possible, be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a select corps of moderate size, upon such principles as will fit it for service in case of need. By thus circumscribing the plan, it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require it. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow citizens. This appears to me to be the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.", "This distrust of professional forces declined substantially in the 20 th century, particularly in the aftermath of World War II, and some may find it anachronistic today. However, such sentiments continue to undergird support for a robust reserve component vis-a-vis the active component, for legal restrictions on domestic military activities such as the Posse Comitatus Act, and for military policies such as the prohibition on military personnel engaging in political activity while in uniform.", "Military", "Maintaining a substantial reserve component has also long been justified on military grounds as a mechanism for providing strategic depth. From this perspective, a major reason to maintain reserve forces is to provide a supply of trained individuals and units to augment active forces in the event of a crisis. Examples of this abound in U.S. history: reserve forces have been called into service for every major U.S. conflict, and several less significant ones. The strategic depth provided by reserve forces allows the armed forces to rapidly expand in size. For example, during major wars such as World War II, Korea, and Desert Storm, large numbers of reserve units were activated to expand the overall capacity of the armed forces to perform combat and supporting missions. Additionally, the availability of a wide array of reserve unit types enhances the Services' capacity to conduct specific types of missions, providing flexibility across a wide range of situations. For example, during the intervention in Haiti, reserve activations were more narrowly targeted to provide increased capacity in specialized skills such as military police, transportation, and civil affairs.", "Economic", "Another long standing justification for reserve component forces has been cost. When not activated, reserve forces cost much less than active component forces. Based on the traditional model for non-activated reservists\u2014training one weekend per month and two weeks per year\u2014most reserve personnel receive about 1/6 of the pay that their active component peers receive. Historically, reserve personnel costs have also been kept down by intentionally manning many units at less than 100%. Operations and maintenance costs in this paradigm are also much lower, as vehicles and equipment are used less, and less work-related travel occurs. However, new research and cost models have shed a different light on this topic. See the section entitled \" Cost \" in the main body of this report.", "Sociopolitical", "Unlike the World War II era, and for several decades thereafter, the active component military today is comparatively small, composed entirely of volunteers, and has fairly low turnover. This has raised periodic concerns that the military is not adequately reflective of the American population at large and is at risk of becoming isolated from it. The reserve component, while suffering from some of the same representational issues, is more geographically dispersed throughout the country, and its members normally live and work in the civilian world. From this perspective, the reserve component provides a critical link between the armed forces and the civilian population and help ensure that the American public views the armed forces as a part of the community, not as a separate class.", "Appendix D.

These units are prepared for operational deployment in support of Combatant Commanders' or civil authorities' requirements. Units are task organized in modular expeditionary forces, tailored for mission requirements. Operational requirements drive the ARFORGEN training and readiness process. These same requirements support the prioritization and synchronization of resourcing, recruiting, organizing, manning, equipping, training, sustaining, sourcing, mobilizing, and deploying cohesive units more effectively and efficiently. This rotational model, which maximizes total force utilization, replaces the Army's linear, tiered readiness strategic construct for force generation. The Army builds the readiness of units as they move through three force pools as described below.", "1. Reset Pool .

During this time the institutional Army focuses on manning and equipping the unit so it can conduct collective training.", "2. Train/ Ready Pool .

Reservists may be mobilized under this provision of law without approval from Congress. This authority was used to mobilize reservists during the latter part of the Persian Gulf War (1991) when the Presidential Reserve Call-up (PRC) authority was no longer sufficient to activate the number of reservists needed.

These are summarized below. The order in which they are presented does not suggest any sort of prioritization by CRS.", "Cost", "When considering AC/RC force mix, some studies noted that while cost is a very important planning factor, it is not the only or the most important factor. The cost elements used in comparisons varied widely, and wide variations existed on whether and how to allocate certain costs that do not lend themselves easily to division between the AC and the RC. Reports note that cost estimating tools for different types of missions, operating profiles, and accounting systems vary greatly between services, although there is a limited degree of commonality in personnel costing methodologies. Non-activated RC personnel are less expensive than AC personnel because they spend much less time training per year and thus receive much less in pay and benefits; this lower training level also results in lower associated operations and maintenance costs. Even when activated, lower RC costs for retired pay and retiree health care benefits make RC forces less costly as far as compensation costs \"per day of duty\" are concerned. However, compensation costs are not the only costs to consider, nor is \"per duty day\" the only way to measure output. Using RC forces reduces, and may even eliminate, their cost advantage. In part, this is due to the increase in compensation costs when activated (that is, the government begins to pay the activated RC personnel in the same manner as it does AC personnel). Additionally, if one considers costs in relationship to an output such as \"days deployed\" (also called \"boots on the ground\"), RC costs increase significantly in comparison to the AC for two reasons. First, DOD rotation policy puts stricter limits on how frequently a reserve unit can be mobilized in comparison to an active unit. This results in the need for more RC units to sustain the equivalent \"boots on the ground\" output of a single AC unit. Second, when RC forces are activated, they typically undergo post-activation training, which may be several weeks or several months, depending on the type of unit. This reduces the amount of \"boots on the ground\" time in each deployment cycle. Taken together, these factors increase the cost per \"day deployed\" of RC units in comparison to AC units. While dependent on rotational variables, units with high-cost equipment or extensive training needs appeared to have a cost advantage in the AC, while units with less expensive equipment and lower training needs appeared to have a cost advantage in the RC. The cost savings estimates provided in these reports were limited in scope, and therefore may be of limited utility for policy makers as they examine affordability and force-mix issues. This could possibly be attributed to the previously-cited lack of a common cost methodology. The RC provides additional value not captured in cost data. For example, the RC provides the opportunity to serve for those who do not wish to serve full time, RC members have civilian expertise and perspective that AC personnel might not have, and using the RC provides a link between operational use of the Army and the public at large, thereby potentially strengthening public support for the operation.", "Roles and Utilization:", "Some studies suggested that the RC perform roles along the lines of \"missions and tasks that are predictable, relatively consistent, and benefit from long-term personnel and geographic relationships.\" While this might be a valid finding or recommendation based on analysis, it also raises issues for potential consideration by policy makers. If the RC is truly part of the Total Force, then why the RC should be relegated only to \"tasks that are predictable, relatively consistent?\" While this recommendation was likely based on an observation that unpredictable and frequent deployments tend to be aligned with the AC, in theory, a RC unit in the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model \"Ready Pool\" should be as capable in this arena as an AC unit. With respect to the perceived benefits provided by the RC when long-term personnel and geographical relationships are an essential part of a mission, this is attributed to the comparative long-term stability in many RC units. AC units tend to turn over most of their personnel every two to three years while reservists and National Guardsmen may spend their entire career in just a few units. More specifically, there is a belief held by some that Combatant Commander Theater Security Cooperation and Building Partner Capacity activities benefit from long-term personal relationships that would be more likely if RC units were involved. Several reports also suggest RC forces are particularly well-suited to Homeland Defense or Defense Support to Civil Authorities missions. The RC as a provider of \"strategic depth\" was a common theme in many reports. For example, the Army noted \"it would take five to seven years to build a new Combat Aviation Brigade in the AC\" when a similar unit in the RC could be ready for deployment within a few months, depending on its personnel, equipment, and training status. The strategic depth argument is one counter to the criticism that RC brigade combat teams (BCTs) and combat aviation brigades (CABs) are more expensive and less effective than their AC counterparts. To put it another way, some would argue that it worth keeping a number of these equipment and training-intensive combat formations in the RC\u2014even if they cost more than their AC counterparts when used for operational purposes\u2014as a means of quickly reconstituting or \"surging\" force structure in the event of a crisis.", "Force Mix", "A common theme relating to force mix is that of mission requirements. If a mission requires a rapid response or a high state of readiness, it is often seen as a mission best suited to the AC. If the mission is of a more enduring nature, allowing for predictable deployments, it is thought to be a more appropriate mission for the RC. Another theme repeated in a number of reports is that of requiring multiple RC units to match the rotational output of a single AC unit. It should be noted, however, this requirement is more pertinent to an \"operationalized\" RC\u2014i.e., an RC that is to be included in the Army's routine deployment of units on operations\u2014rather than an RC serving as a \"strategic reserve.\" In the case of an \"operationalized RC,\" the current one year deployed every six years (the 1:5 deploy-to-dwell ratio) rule makes it necessary to have multiple RC units to match the one AC unit that deploys for one out of every three years (the 1:2 deploy-to-dwell ratio). Changing the deployment-to-dwell ratios, whether for the AC or RC, changes the requirements for the number of units needed. Some reports suggested that there are advantages in placing some types of support units in the RC. Lower echelon and support/sustainment units without extensive or complicated equipment (such as a Medium Truck Company), which typically require less post-activation training before deployment, are often cited as examples. Comparatively shorter post-mobilization training periods increase the number of days deployed, and therefore decreases the cost per day deployed ratio.", "Effectiveness", "One theme noticeably absent from reports focusing on cost and force mix is that of comparative military effectiveness between AC and RC units. ", "While there were anecdotal examples\u2014such as RC Military Police and Civil Affairs units being more effective than their AC counterparts because many RC soldiers in these units perform their military specialties daily in their civilian lives\u2014there was not a comprehensive examination of military effectiveness as it relates to force mix. Perhaps a quote from a RAND report explains why military effectiveness was not examined in detail:", "A unit-for-unit cost comparison implicitly assumes that, once trained-up, RC units are as effective as AC units. In many military forums, it is considered impolite to raise this issue, so such discussion appears to go on only in private and with little direct evidence.", "Appendix G. Individual Study Examinations", "A. The New Guard and Reserves (Chapter 10: Cost of the Reserves).", "Executive Summary:", "This chapter, written by a Jennifer Buck, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, \"explores several different ways to look at active and reserve costs.\" It outlines three methods:", "\"The first is a traditional, simple method that compares the total guard and reserve budget with the portion of the total force it supports. This was the method used by the Commission on the Guard and Reserves in reaching its conclusion that 'the cost of the reserve components is approximately 23% of the amount needed to man, train, equip and sustain the active component.'\" \"The second approach is based on estimating the cost of individual members of the reserve components ... [which determines] the cost of reserves vis-a-vis their 'use'. Use is defined in a number of ways. One is availability for deployment over the course of a career. Another is the number of duty days served within a given year.\" \"The final method examines the cost of guard and reserve units based on an analysis of brigade combat teams. This assessment evaluates the cost of units under different deployment scenarios.\"", "Findings:", "\"Differences in active and reserve component costs relate primarily to three factors. First, the guard and reserve have lower operating and training tempo. Second, they received part-time pay and benefits [when not activated]. Third, the guard and reserve incur smaller infrastructure costs\u2014such as, for example, in family housing.\" \"It is obvious that the more the guard and reserve are used, the more they 'cost'.\" Traditional method Using this method and FY2005 figures, \"the guard and reserve require 8.6% of the budget to support 38.4% of the force, which, on the surface, appears to be a great bargain. But this admittedly simplistic approach does not incorporate costs such as research and development, paid by the military services, with benefit to both the active and reserve components. Further, it does not factor in the value of equipment that is transferred to the guard and reserve from the active forces, or the guard and reserve 'share' of institutional support provided by the services, such as schools or training ranges.\" If supplemental war funding is factored in, the guard and reserve share of the budget rises to 9.4%. The traditional method \"is perhaps more relevant for a reserve component used primarily as a force in reserve\u2014as a strategic reserve that serves as an 'insurance policy' for national defense\u2014rather than a reserve that is called on to support operational missions ... this very simple approach is no longer sufficient to answer the question of the relative cost of the guard and reserve.\" Individual members method The focus of this method \"was to develop a means to compare the use of active versus guard and reserve forces per dollar spent.\" Two alternative approaches were developed: the first was based on projected AC and RC personnel costs over a full career, including deployments, and into retirement (a \"life-cycle\" cost approach); the second calculated cost per day of duty in FY2004 and FY2005. Life Cycle Variant The \"life-cycle\" variant estimates the lifetime cost of an AC servicemember at nearly $2.4 million, and the RC servicemember at about $790,000. \"In terms of 'usage,' this works out to $336,000 per deployment 'opportunity' for the active member and $198,000 for a member of the reserves.\" \"In essence, this analysis shows that reserves are a good deal because the military services only have to pay for them when they are needed. Because their retirement is deferred\u2014not paid out until age 60\u2014it is much less expensive than for active members ... However, there are limitations to this assessment too. Utilization of the force is more encompassing than simply being deployed.\" \"Duty Days\" Variant The \"duty day\" variant estimates AC personnel will perform 275 days of duty per year, that \"statutory\" reservists will perform 39 per year, and that \"busy\" reservists will perform about 120 per year. It estimates \"cost per duty day\" in FY2005 as $261.52 for AC personnel, $284.35 for statutory reservists and $237.30 for busy reservists. \"The bottom line of this analysis is that the more days reservists serve, the less costly they are to use ... in other words, a busy reservist is cheaper than a statutory one. However, this analysis reveals an unanticipated result. The more full-time benefits added to the cost of a reservist, such as TRICARE for Life health care accrual, the more expensive a part-time reservist is relative to his or her availability.\" Unit method This approach is based on a 2007 unpublished briefing by Jacob Alex Klerman (whose 2008 report Rethinking the Reserves is covered later in this appendix). It compares costs of an active duty unit to its reserve component counterpart based on models that consider costs of both deployed and non-deployed units, and which also factor in the expected deployment-to-dwell ratios. \"Taking into account pay and benefits, as well as training and support costs, reserve brigade combat units are much cheaper than active duty units\u2014on the order of 28% of costs during peacetime ... When activated, reserve units costs about the same as active duty units. Thus, if both an active and reserve unit could accomplish the same task, assigning it to a reserve unit would realize considerable cost savings. It was assumed, in the past, that activations would be rare.\" \"But this comparison is fundamentally different when reserve units are used as part of a rotational force. Thus, the second question posed in the analysis becomes critically important\u2014the relative cost of a reserve brigade combat team for one-year of 'boots-on-the-ground'.... For a six year rotation cycle, nine reserve combat teams were needed to sustain continuous operations, versus three active duty teams. Using the reserve in this fashion increases their relative costs to 84% when not activated, and as high as 120% when they are.\" [Note: It is unclear how the report derives these figures; see comment in \"Potentially Contentious Issues\"]. \"The results show that for use as part of a rotational force, cost does not clearly favor reserve units, as it does under simpler cost calculations ... the less we expect to use the reserves, the lower their relative cost. Further, the more quickly reserve units can be ready for operational missions, the lower their relative cost.\"", "Study Methodology:", "As described above, this study used three separate approaches\u2014one of which has two variants\u2014to estimate the comparative costs of AC and RC forces. The cost data used for the first two methods appears to be taken primarily from FY2004 and FY2005 budget documents; changes in compensation since then might generate different results. It is unclear precisely which costs are included in the individual member variants, but it appears they both include pay and allowances, retired pay, and retiree health care; inclusion of other elements might change the results. The duty day variant also appears to include \"money spent for training, medical and dental readiness, equipment, and operations and maintenance\" but those costs are not specified. The life cycle model makes some important assumptions about career length, eligibility for retirement, and deployment/dwell ratios (AC deployed one year out of every three; RC deployed one year out of every six); deviations from these assumptions might generate different results. Also, it is unclear how the cost for the entire life-cycle (initial entry into military service through death) is generated. Cost elements used in the analysis are not fully described (although the rough contours are). The unit cost model section appears to rely on a predecessor to Klerman's 2008 study, whose methodology is discussed later in this report.", "Potentially Contentious Issues:", "This paper describes several costing alternatives, without endorsing one specific approach; however, it largely rejects the \"traditional method\": \"Merely looking at gross budget share does not address the true cost of the reserves, because it ignores important differences in how each component is used.\" (p. 184) Those who stress the cost advantage of the reserves may still consider this approach to have value, especially in the context of strategic reserve forces. It is unclear how figures used for the retired pay accrual rate under the \"duty days\" variant was calculated. The daily rate for a \"busy reservist\" was higher than that for an active component servicemember ($31.66 vs. $28.77 in FY2004), which seems unlikely given reservists have a lower retired pay accrual rate as they normally cannot draw retired pay immediately upon retirement as active component personnel can. For the unit cost model approach, the report states \"using the reserve in this fashion increases their relative costs to 84% when not activated, and as high as 120% when they are.\" It is unclear how the report derives these figures, as they are based on an unpublished briefing by Jacob Klerman. Klerman's figures accompanying his published 2008 report estimated the relative cost of RC units to range from 58% to 141% of AC units. The range of values was related to the values of key variables (deployment-to-dwell ratios, the proportion of the reserve component involved in deployments, and the relative cost of RC units when not deployed). ", "B. Rethinking the Reserves.", "Executive Summary:", "A changed threat environment and different utilization patterns suggest the need to re-think various aspects of the RC, particularly the reserve components of the Army. Reserve personnel are distinguished by the part-time nature of their service, which means that they have competing civilian obligations, are less expensive when not mobilized, and have limited training opportunities when compared to the AC. Traditional costing methods suggest that RC units, when not mobilized, cost about one-fifth to one-third as much as AC forces. However, \"the relevant cost computation, and the implied relevant cost changes radically when forces are expected to be used with rotation, which is the reality of stability operations conducted as part of the ongoing Global War on Terrorism.\" (p. xiv) Under current usage, RC cost computation needs to consider both \"peacetime\" (non-activated) and \"wartime\" (activated) costs. Additionally, \"with rotation, the appropriate cost is not per unit but per unit \"Boots on the Ground\" (BOG) (i.e., actually serving in the conflict versus at the rotational base at home).\" (p. xiv). Rotation policy is a critical factor in determining the relative costs of AC versus RC BOG. \"It seems clear that the relative cost of the RC rises sharply when the projected use involves rotation. What was without rotation a striking cost advantage is nearly cost parity; that is, cost considerations no longer overwhelmingly favor the RC.\" (p. xv) Some suggestions for modifying reserve compensation and other models of reserve service are also presented.", "Findings:", "\"Because they are part-time, reservists simply spend less time in uniform. Therefore, in years in which they are not mobilized, they can be paid less. For the Army National Guard, a very rough estimate is that a drilling reservist is paid for only about one-sixth as many days as an equivalent active-duty force soldier. Relative costs are slightly higher, perhaps one-fifth to one-third those of the actives, but still much, much less than the cost of the actives. Thus, in peacetime, reserves are much less expensive ... The in peacetime caveat is crucial ... the relative cost of reservists in wartime is subtler and likely to vary with the frequency of use and rotation policy.\" \"Because reservists are part-time, they may be less capable than AC forces. During peacetime, they train much less than AC forces (perhaps one-sixth as much). Thus, at mobilization, they are often capable of doing only a more limited range of mission-essential tasks. Rather than training intensively during peacetime, after mobilization reservists often need more time (often several months) to sharpen their existing skills and to learn new skills related to their specific anticipated mission. Despite this intensive post-mobilization training, for some tasks, the skill level (or capability) of reservists and the reserve unit may remain lower than that of AC forces, who had the benefit of more intensive training in the years before deployment. This discussion assumes that military skills atrophy when not training. That assumption seems plausible for military-specific skills (e.g., infantry). Alternatively, when a reservist uses his/her civilian career (perhaps a chaplain, civilian affairs, construction, military police), it seems plausible that the reservists is as skilled as (or even better skilled than) his/her AC counterpart.\" \"A unit-for-unit cost comparison implicitly assumes that, once trained-up, RC units are as effective as AC units. In many military forums, it is considered impolite to raise this issue, so such discussion appears to go on only in private and with little direct evidence.\" \" ... It seems likely that there are several different types of military jobs. For some jobs, civilians actually get more repetitions than uniformed individuals ... For these tasks we would expect the RC to perform better than the AC. For activities in which deterioration of skills is slow, older RC member might perform better than younger AC members (this has been claimed for pilots and flying hours). However, for military specific activities for which the skills deteriorate (perhaps physical condition or reaction times in combat simulations), one might expect more-intensive and longer-term AC training to yield higher proficiency than we would expect from a short-term train-up immediately post-mobilization. Whether these conjectures are correct is unclear. We are unaware of any high-quality empirical evidence.\" \"Any evidence of differential combat effectiveness should be used to adjust the earlier unit-for-unit cost estimates. Thus, for example, if it would take five RC units to do the work of four AC units, then the RC costs should be adjusted up by a quarter. Note also that each unit\u2014AC and RC\u2014would require equipment, so equipment costs would need to enter into this analysis.\" \"When forces are used with rotation, the crucial comparison is no longer the cost of an RC unit peacetime compared with the cost of an AC unit in peacetime. Instead, the crucial comparison is: What does it cost to maintain one RC unit BOG compared to the cost to maintain on AC unit BOG.\" \" ... What is the ratio of RC units in the force to AC units in the force to maintain one unit continuously BOG? For Army BCTs ... [g]iven current rotation policy, those calculations suggest that the ratio is slightly less than three RC units in the force for every AC unit in the force in order to maintain one unit BOG. Given recent [2007-08] actual rotation practice, the ratio is slightly less than four.\" \"Again using plausible parameters, Appendix A of \"Rethinking the Reserves\" then proceeds to convert these estimates of units required in the force into relative costs. Those computations suggest that, for wars fought with rotation, much\u2014but not all\u2014of the RC's cost advantage disappears. Remaining cost differences are sufficiently small that some might argue that they are not commensurate with the RC's lower combat effectiveness.\" \" ... this analysis suggests that the shift to a rotational scenario has substantially increased the relevant cost of the reserves. The standard economic argument would suggest the appropriate reaction would be twofold. First, decrease demand for the solution whose relative cost has risen sharply; that is, use the RC in fewer roles (e.g., only as a deeper reserve). Second, decrease supply (i.e., cut reserve force structure) by decreasing cost (e.g., reserve enlistment bonuses) until the remaining forces are closer to cost-effective. Further study is needed.\"", "Study Methodology:", "The methodology varies depending on the subject matter being discussed. Chapters 2 and 3 are based on historical data and interpretation of reserve policy and utilization from the 1970s onward. Chapter 4 discusses the implications of the part-time nature of reserve service. Chapter 5 considers costs of the reserves relative to active forces, Chapter 6 proposes three alternative reserve organizations, and Chapter 7 looks at changes in reserve compensation to support more intensive use of the reserves. The methodology with regard to Chapter 5 deserves additional description.", "Chapter 5 reviews several previously published works and identifies the relative cost of the RC as falling within the range of 20-30% of AC forces, when not activated, and 100% of AC forces when activated. The author then estimates the number of RC units and AC units required, according to various deployment-dwell ratios, to maintain one unit \"boots on the ground\" continuously in a given deployment location. The estimate is three for AC units and eight for RC units, assuming that AC units deploy 12 months out of 36 and that RC trains for three months and deploys for nine months out of 72. \"Thus, according to policy guidance, we need 3.0 (=36/12) AC units in the force to keep one unit BOG ... and 8.0 (=72/9) units in the [reserve] force to keep one unit BOG. Thus, the ratio of RC to AC units is slightly less than 3 (2.7 = 8.0/3.0).\" These rotation estimates are based on DOD guidelines established in 2007 and still in effect today. If actual rotation practice from 2007-2008 is used instead\u2014AC units deploy 15 months out of 27 and RC unit train for three months and deploy for nine months out of 60\u2014the resulting quotient is 1.8 for AC and 6.7 for RC.", "Combining the average costs of AC and RC units when deployed and non-deployed, with the number of units required to sustain one unit \"boots on the ground,\" the author generates a \"cost per unit of BOG\" metric. Under the DOD rotation policy guidelines (12:36 for AC; (9+3)/72 for RC) , he concludes that in peacetime, the relative cost of RC units is 67% of AC units. In wartime, the relative cost of RC units is 101%. Subsequently, the author manipulates some of the key variables\u2014deployment-to-dwell ratios, the proportion of the reserve component involved in deployments, and the relative cost of RC units when not deployed\u2014to generate a table illustrating a range of potential relative costs. These range from a low of 58% to a high of 141%. The more favorable cases for the reserves generally involve activating them less frequently; when activated, lengthening their deployments (one year BOG instead of nine months BOG) while holding AC rotation policy stable; reducing the amount of RC train up time from three months to two (hence, generating 10 months BOG for the RC unit); or using lower estimates of RC relative costs in peacetime. The less favorable cases for the reserves generally involve activating them more frequently coupled with intensifying the rotation of AC units (for example, one year deployed out of every two) in comparison to the RC units.", "Potentially Contentious Issues:", "As the author notes, his rotational cost estimates are quite sensitive to assumptions about the proportion of the RC conducting operational missions, BOG/dwell ratios, RC post-mobilization training time, and the relative cost of the RC when not activated. Modest changes in these factors can cause significant changes in the comparative cost of AC and RC units. The author also notes that \"The discussion here is deliberately exploratory. A more complete discussion would require a much more thorough analysis.\" Below are some areas where more the generality of the analysis might lead to disputes about the validity of the results. It is not clear which cost elements are involved in the calculation of AC or RC costs, but it appears to be linked primarily to basic pay (see Appendix 1 of the report, particularly those calculations performed in the footnotes). This may limit the accuracy of the relative costs, as noted in the Reserve Forces Policy Board work discussed earlier, and thereby call into question the output of this report's relative cost model. This work is based on Army BCTs, and includes assumptions about their train up times and rotation rates. These are not necessarily applicable to other types of units. For example, a military police company might need only a month of post-mobilization train up, in contrast to the three months estimated for an Army BCT. In such a case, the ratio of AC to RC units needed to sustain one unit BOG would change significantly, as would the calculation of relative costs. Some might argue that the conclusion to cut reserve force structure does not appear to flow from the report's logic, particularly the suggestion to \"decrease demand for the solution whose relative cost has risen sharply.\" From this perspective, the increase in the relative cost of the reserves under a rotational deployment policy is not the critical consideration; more important is the actual relative cost. Another conclusion\u2014to lower the costs of the RC through reduced compensation\u2014could create imbalances in the force. For example, cutting reserve enlistment bonuses as suggested could impact the number of new accessions, reducing the supply of entry level personnel, but not necessarily the number of more senior personnel, potentially creating a top-heavy reserve.", "C. Independent Panel Review of Reserve Component Employment in an Era of Persistent Conflict.", "Executive Summary:", "This report was intended to provide recommendations to the senior leadership of the Army \"to guide development of Army and RC policies and programs for the institutionalization of the RC as part of the operational force, and for employment of the force over the next decade.\" It looks at AC/RC mix from several perspectives, including balancing capabilities between the AC and RC, between the operating force and the generating force, and between deployments and dwell. It generally supports ARFORGEN as a model for resourcing and sourcing Army requirements, but argues that it needs to be more automated and better synchronized. The authors develop and analyze three AC/RC mix alternatives, and provide summary data on cost drawn from other works.", "Findings:", "\"Maintaining this careful balance of accomplishing daily missions, ensuring readiness for unplanned contingencies, protecting the All-Volunteer Force, and improving future capabilities will require the Army to institutionalize a cultural change from viewing the RC solely as a reinforcing force to viewing RC units as an operational component of the Total Army that complements AC units by providing capability packages.\" \"For the RC to perform its role and achieve even higher levels of readiness with lesser periods of pre-deployment training, it must be structured, trained, and manned accordingly. The structure should, in addition to building necessary complementary capability packages for conflict, build those capabilities that can be sustained at higher readiness levels in an inactive duty status and deployed with a minimum of pre-deployment training. Largely, the panel views the current structure of the RC as healthy and about right. But more can be done.\" \"Some have argued that the Army's dependence on the RC over the past 20 years somehow violates the RC's purpose and highlights a weakness in the Army. The Panel rejects this argument.\" \"A short 9 years ago the RC was largely viewed as a force of second choice for Army missions. Today, the RC has proven its worth and necessity to current operations and demonstrated a strong capability to contribute further in the future. The experience and adaptability of the RC make it fully capable of operational employment at costs comparable to the AC, yet maintained at much lower expense when not mobilized during periods of reduced operational tempo.\" Proposes 3 alternatives to supplying the forces needed under an ARFORGEN scenario necessitating rotational availability of 1 corps, 4 divisions, 15 brigades and 72,000 enablers. Alternative 1: An all AC sourcing solution (i.e., no RC used). Alternative 2: An AC and RC sourcing solution that is roughly based on current practice. \"Requirements are filled with AC forces first, and the delta of about 37,000 [personnel] is filled with RC forces resourced at a high level or readiness as they leave the Ready pool and enter pre-deployment training in the Available pool.\" Alternative 3: A \"hybrid\" solution which provides about 37,000 RC personnel, but allocates AC and RC forces into two Deployed Expeditionary Force (DEF) \"bands\" and three Contingency Expeditionary Force (CEF) bands. The bands would have different purposes, resourcing levels, and training readiness goals throughout the ARFORGEN cycle. Analysis of these 3 alternatives led to the following conclusions: \"Alternative 1 (all AC) is not feasible because it causes too much turbulence in realigning operational and support skills and probably is not affordable given the cost of increased end strength necessary to embed those skills in the AC.\" \"Alternative 2 is doable\u2014it is essentially the current model\u2014but is high cost.\" \"Alternative 3 represents a hybrid approach that, we believe, best leverages the considerable investment that has been made in RC readiness, is cost-effective, and provides flexibility.\" \"The Panel strongly believes that both the business and operational cases provided for continued use of the RC but at a lower and more predictable level. Putting these capabilities 'on the shelf' and not using them unit the next 'big war' will not only ensure that they atrophy, but also will reduce the return on the considerable investment the Nation has made. More importantly, the AC will most likely be unable to meet these demands without a considerable redistribution of operational and sustainment skill sets.\" \" ... our assessment is that the RC is affordable and sustainable as an integral member of the operational force. Providing this assessment in terms of a detailed cost-benefit analysis is a challenge beyond the scope of this report.\" Provides a table outlining four studies on cost of the RC, comparing RC costs to AC costs broken out by costs when not activated, when deployed, and when used as part of the ARFORGEN cycle. According to the table, the RC costs between 24-33% of the AC when not activated; 95-100% of the AC when deployed; and 77-104% of the AC as part of the ARFORGEN cycle.", "Study Methodology:", "This study was directed by the Secretary of the Army, John McHugh, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Casey, in June 2010. The report was completed in November 2010. The purpose was to provide for \"a review of the principles, policies, and assumptions governing the employment of U.S. Army Reserve Components (Army National Guard and Army Reserve) in an era of persistent conflict where sustained commitment of U.S. ground forces is the norm.\" (p. 64) The review was conducted by a panel composed of three retired general officers: General Dennis Reimer (former Army Chief of Staff), Lieutenant General Roger Schultz (former Director of the Army National Guard), and Lieutenant General James Helmly (former Chief of the Army Reserve). The methodology was essentially interviews and a literature review: \"To achieve the aims of this review, the Panel conducted numerous personal interviews with key civilian and military leaders inside and outside the Army ... The Panel also reviewed recent and ongoing studies related to operationalizing the RC.\"", "Potentially Contentious Issues:", "The report essentially accepts current (2010) Army structure, including RC structure, as a given. It does not assess any large scale changes in AC or RC structure and asserts that, at least with respect to transferring RC structure to the AC, such changes would be disruptive. This might be contentious for those who advocate substantial changes in AC/RC force mix (including both those who advocate increasing the ratio of AC forces and those who advocate increasing the ratio of RC forces). The recommendation to restructure the RC to build capabilities that can be sustained at higher readiness levels in an inactive duty status implies a focus on lower echelon and support-type units, rather than higher echelon combat forces. This could be controversial for the ARNG, which has a substantial amount of higher echelon, combat structure. With regards to AC/RC mix, the report focused primarily on the question of increasing the ratio of AC forces. While this might have been the dominant concern in 2010, there has been greater focus recently on increasing the ratio of RC forces, potentially limiting the value of its AC/RC mix conclusions. The report assumed that \"Zero real growth will occur in the Army's top-line total obligating authority.\" Changes in Army obligating authority that diverge from this assumption could call into question certain conclusions. The cost table in Chapter 5 provides little detail on the methodological underpinnings of the four studies cited. CRS did not have copies of three of these reports (the Army PA&E report is discussed below). Thus, it is difficult to evaluate the utility of this table. For example, for these three reports, it is not clear precisely which costs elements were included or whether pre-deployment training was included in the costing for rotational deployments under ARFORGEN.", "D. Comprehensive Review of the Future Role of the Reserve Component, Volume I: Executive Summary and Main Report", "Executive Summary:", "This study examines all services, not just the Army. From the report:", "During a decade of sustained engagement in combat operations, the Reserve Components of our Armed Forces have been transformed, both practically and philosophically, from a strategic force of last resort to an operational reserve that provides full-spectrum capability to the Nation. Repeated combat deployments, as well as peacekeeping and humanitarian relief missions, have produced an operationally savvy and resilient force that fully expects to be employed on a periodic basis. This new force represents a ten-year investment in resourcing commitments and the personal sacrifice of service members and their families. That investment can reliably provide the Department of Defense with essential operational capabilities and strategic agility. Good stewardship demands that we continue to capitalize on this investment. This report provides background and recommendations to inform decisions regarding the future role of the Reserve Component that are consistent with the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Report. (p. 1).", "Findings:", "The study contains 20 pages of detailed findings and recommendations. A summary of these findings and recommendations includes", "Importance of the Reserve Component (RC) : The RC provides cost-effective operational forces that can be used on a regular basis and to ensure strategic depth for mid to large-scale contingencies or other unanticipated national crises. When rebalancing the force, the National Guard and Reserve should be a \"force of first choice\" for those tasks for which they are particularly well-suited, owing to their cost-effectiveness and skill sets. Missions that follow a predictable, operational schedule meet this criterion. Establishing a Common DOD Costing Methodology for the Total Force : Services use cost methodologies that are in line with their respective business models. Services do use some common cost-estimating methodologies (personnel composite rates and the Contingency Operations Support Tool (COST)) but cost estimating tools for different types of missions, operating profiles, and accounting systems vary greatly. In view of these findings, the report recommends that DOD make the following adjustments: Refine existing methodologies to accommodate a long-term view beyond the current Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) and better compare full-time and part-time personnel, operating, and life-cycle costs, both on an individual and unit basis. Update existing methodologies to reflect emerging operational parameters and as assumptions on how the force will be used change. In conjunction with the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), develop methods to compare costs of similar capabilities across different services. Develop methods to identify and allocate overhead costs equitably for full and part-time forces and estimate costs for supporting remote and distributed reach back centers, such as the Joint Reserve Intelligence Centers. Using the Guard and Reserve to Best Advantage : RC is best suited for missions and tasks that are predictable, relatively consistent, and benefit from long-term personnel and geographic relationships. Force generation processes should consider providing predictability to RC units for those missions requiring regional expertise, as well as Homeland Defense or Defense Support to Civil Authorities missions. Roles for Which the Guard and Reserve are Well Suited : The RC is well suited to provide strategic depth in the following mission areas: Rotational units for Combatant Commander needs and service requirements. As units or teams to support Combatant Commander Theater Security Cooperation and Building Partner Capacity activities world-wide. Individual augmentees. Units or teams to support Homeland Defense or Defense Support to Civil Authorities, missions as well as to support Governors in state security missions. Units, teams, and individuals assigned to support DOD or service institutional needs. Options for Rebalancing the Total Force: As the services manage their Active and Reserve Components as part of a Total Force, they might wish to consider: Using RC to build force structure in cases where Reserves are particularly well-suited and cost is a consideration. Assigning some recurring operational missions to the RC when these assignments are more cost-effective than using an AC unit. Establishing habitual relationships between specific Guard and Reserve units with Combatant Commands and other DOD service components to develop long-term planning and training relationships. Establishing national or regional RC units staffed with personnel willing to serve on Active Duty more frequently or for longer duration than typically expected of Reservists. Fulfilling demands imposed by emerging needs such as cyber defense; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); countering weapons of mass destruction (WMD), regional engagement, and Homeland Defense or Defense Support to Civil Authorities missions. Increasing integration of AC and RC forces into \"blended units\" with some units being predominately AC and others being predominantly RC. Assigning some institutional support tasks that are the responsibilities of the secretaries of the military departments to RC units, teams, and individuals. Providing for a Trained, Equipped, Available, and Ready Guard and Reserve. DOD needs to change the way it recruits, equips, trains, employs, and cares for its RC personnel.

Analytical support for the study was provided by the U.S. Army War College, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA). It was a six-month collaborative effort of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, and the military services. The study does not address the absolute cost of each Service's Reserve Component but it \"makes clear the value of those organizations.\"", "Potentially Contentious Issues:", "The report strongly argues for using the reserves as a \"force of first choice\" in certain circumstances: ", "When rebalancing the force to meet future national security challenges, the Guard and Reserve should be a \"force of first choice\" for those tasks for which they are particularly well suited, owing to their overall cost-effectiveness and the skill sets that they can provide. Missions that follow a predictable, operational schedule fall clearly into this category. (p. 5)", "While using the RC \"for those tasks for which they are particularly well suited\" can be viewed as a prudent recommendation, attributing this to their \"overall cost-effectiveness\" appears problematic as the report does not establish RC cost-effectiveness relative to the AC. This report essentially takes it as a given that the RC is more cost-effective in many unspecified circumstances and uses this assertion as a major argument to support many of its recommendations.", "Using RC forces for missions that follow a predictable operational schedule is also a central theme of the report. The implication here is that RC forces are not as useful for immediate or quick action combat roles (for example, the initial attacks on Afghanistan in 2001 or a response to an attack on South Korea). This is distinct from using the RC to conduct combat operations if sufficient time were available to adequately train and resource the units.", "E. Reshaping the Army's Active and Reserve Components, 2011.", "Executive Summary:", "During the Cold War, the RC was viewed as a strategic reserve\u2014\"an expansion force and a repository for capabilities that might be needed in support of major combat operations.\" As a result of operational demands for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the RC was reorganized as an operational reserve, with an expected activation time of one year every six (1 to 5 dwell time). Because of the new demands placed on the RC, the Army made changes to AC and RC forces, adjusting and rebalancing authorizations within and across components. This study's goal was to assess the Army's utilization of AC and RC units and to analyze policy options to adjust the balance and mix of forces.", "The study looked at three underlying questions: (1) are some soldiers being deployed/mobilized more than others and which occupational categories are most heavily and least heavily deployed/mobilized?; (2) do these rates of utilization exceed the planning objectives set by DOD?; and, (3) how much could high utilization rates be decreased if the Army rebalanced its forces from low utilization forces to high utilization forces?", "The study also identifies cost as a factor in assignment of missions and capabilities to the AC and RC. The study suggests if AC and RC units are equally effective in performing a mission, the mission should be assigned to the most cost-effective component. However, the study recognizes there are differences in capabilities and task efficiency between AC and RC units and this should also be considered along with cost. Noting that there are several different ways for analysts to measure relative cost of the RC, the study suggests these different approaches can lead to different conclusions. Relative cost is also sensitive to assumptions made by the analyst.", "Using the \"traditional approach\" of comparing component end strength to appropriations, the report suggests that the cost advantages of the RC are most prominent for strategic depth achieved by placing capabilities in the RC. These capabilities serve as an \"insurance policy\" for unanticipated missions and the cost of this insurance is lower if these capabilities are in the RC instead of the AC. The report also suggests that cost-effectiveness for the AC and RC is maximized when capabilities are actually used. In the AC, full-time services are cost-effective when used on a full-time basis, while the fixed-costs of part-time RC personnel are spread out over more days if RC personnel are \"busy.\" On the other hand, the approach detailed by Klerman \"suggest[s] that, for brigade combat teams, there are unlikely to be significant cost savings from placing operational capabilities in the RC instead of the AC. Rather, the baseline estimates suggest that the costs are roughly identical ... the implication is that any rebalancing of operational units should be done for reasons other than cost.\"", "Finally, the study points out that the RC provides additional value not captured in traditional cost data. For example, the RC provides the opportunity to serve for those who do not wish to serve full time. In addition, RC members have civilian expertise and perspective not available to AC personnel. Finally, using the RC provides a link between otherwise distant Army operations and the public at large, perhaps bolstering public support for the operation\u2014the supposed intent of the so-called Abrams Doctrine.", "Findings:", "This study poses four questions to policy makers considering any reshaping of the Army's AC and RC:", "Are high-utilization skills likely to be in high demand in the future? If high utilization skills are likely to be in high demand in the future, they are candidates for rebalancing. If not, current demand is temporary and analysis suggests that the force as currently configured can sustain above-average utilization. Are there significant risks associated with too little strategic depth in high-utilization skills? Even if high-utilization skills are not likely to be in high demand in the future, policy makers might determine that the risk of too little strategic depth is significant enough to warrant rebalancing. Will converting billets from low-utilization skills result in a significant decrease in the ability to meet the demand for those skills? If converting billets from low-utilization skills results in a significant decrease in the Army's ability to meet demand, policy makers might wish to identify other options. Are there significant risks associated with less strategic depth in low-utilization skills? Policy makers need to identify if there is risk associated with less strategic depth in low-utilization skills. If not, these skill areas are candidates for rebalancing. More generally, policy makers should determine if risks associated with less strategic depth in low-utilization skills are fewer or greater than risks associated with too little strategic depth in high-utilization skills.", "There are additional insights offered in this study. The report finds that despite RAND-developed data on deployment, activation, utilization, and dwell times, DOD does not have a well-developed predictive model for deployment and utilization of individuals. It also concludes that any decisions about reshaping the Army should be based, in part, on future demands; but that any predictions of the future are inherently speculative and entail a degree of risk. Analysis also suggests the Army Reserve is the most unbalanced of the components, based on the extent to which its members in high-utilization career fields are mobilized. Also noted in the study, servicemembers in low-utilization career fields are still performing necessary duties. Converting all of these personnel into a higher-utilization career field may result in a skills shortage if utilization patterns shift.", "Study Methodology:", "This study, conducted by RAND, was sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE). The study measured the utilization for each career field in the Active Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve. In addition, the study identified high-utilization and low-utilization career fields for all three Army components and suggested how these career fields might be rebalanced.", "Potentially Contentious Issues:", "RAND's findings were based on Army data from September 2001 and the study completion date in 2011. It can be argued the Army's missions during this time period were somewhat atypical and ran the gamut from brief force-on-force combat, to security assistance, to counterinsurgency. The data collected and analyzed by RAND, while useful, is directly relevant only in predicting utilization of forces should these types of operations be conducted on a similar scale and scope in the future. In the case of a protracted major regional conflict, the rebalancing insights offered by RAND could prove irrelevant and, therefore, represent an element of risk. This observation reinforces the RAND-identified need for \"a well-developed predictive model for deployment and utilization of individuals\" that includes data from a full spectrum of Army operations, not just the recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Given the aforementioned caveat about data drawn from deployments and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, RAND's analysis of high-utilization and low-utilization career fields in the Active Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserves suggests that chemical operations and medical and health care career fields are low-utilization career fields in each of the three components. While the lack of utilization of nuclear, biological and chemical defense specialists is understandable, given the nature of the two conflicts, the low utilization of medical and health care personnel could warrant additional detailed study.", "F.

Personnel, O&S, and equipment reset costs for an ARFORGEN-equivalent cycle for units that will be deployed compare the AC at $1.00 to the RC at a range of $0.71 to $1.02, depending on unit type. Cost differential is greatest in units with lower equipment operating costs. The 12-month limit on RC unit mobilization can, when demand is high, cause the RC to provide more units over time at increased cost. Cost to operationalize the RC relative to personnel and O&S costs is small\u2014about 2%-3% of the total ARFORGEN cycle cost for any given unit type. With regards to equipment value and costs: Equipment recapitalization costs can be a significant factor for equipment-intensive units. For the Army National Guard (ARNG), the benefit of Critical Dual Use (CDU) equipment for Title 32 has an additional advantage as the percentage of CDU in ARNG is 25%-94% as a cost of unit equipment. High cost and complex units such as Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and Combat Aviation Brigades (CABs) have more expensive pipeline costs for the RC, especially if demand is low. However, the RC remains a cost-effective measure to preserve strategic depth as an RC unit can be available in months vice years (e.g., it takes five to seven years to build a new active duty CAB).", "Study Methodology:", "In addition to Army PA&E, study participants included the Army National Guard and Army Reserve, the Army G-3/5/7 and the G-8 Quadrennial Review (QDR) office.

As a result, it is not clear how various figures are determined. It also appears that the study assumed two months of post-mobilization training for deploying reserve units. While this might be appropriate for battalion and smaller units, some might question this for brigade combat teams. It is not entirely clear from the slides, but it appears that the cost ratios cited are for one active and one reserve unit over the course of an entire ARFORGEN cycle, rather than the cost to sustain one active and one unit \"boots on the ground\" in a deployed location. If this is the case, it may understate the cost of reserve units by omitting the cost factors associated with limits on reserve rotation policy (that is, a reserve unit which is activated for a year can typically spend 9 or 10 months \"boots on the ground,\" thus necessitating more than one reserve unit to equal the output of an active unit which serves 12 months \"boots on the ground\").", "G.

Yet, in order to sustain U.S. military pre-eminence in an emerging strategic environment characterized by new threats and constrained resources, the Department of Defense (DOD) will need to organize and operate America's armed forces in new ways.", "In early 2012, DOD released new strategic guidance and a corresponding budget reflecting $487 billion in cuts over 10 years as imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act. The guidance directs the U.S. military to prioritize the Asia-Pacific and greater Middle East.", "However, the Pentagon still has not enacted the types of reforms that we believe are necessary to sustain U.S. military pre-eminence into the future. Too many DOD structures, processes, programs and operational concepts are legacies of the past, which create unnecessary redundancies, waste valuable resources and encourage unproductive competition among the services rather than cooperation. These practices are no longer acceptable in the current fiscal environment.", "Regarding the AC/RC mix:", "To accommodate budget cuts and the end of two major ground wars, the Army should shrink to about 480,000 active-duty troops and continue its plans to reset the force after wartime operations. It should transfer up to one-quarter of its active component armored brigades to the reserve component, and mandate more lateral personnel assignments between the active and reserve components.", "Findings:", "The primary Army force structure-related recommendation of this report is to \"shrink to 480,000 active- duty troops, transfer up to one quarter of its AC armored brigades [ABCTs] to the RC, and mandate more lateral personnel assignments between the AC and RC.\" To support this recommendation, the study notes:", "DOD has announced that the planned end strength of the Army will decrease from 520,000 to 490,000 active-duty soldiers by 2017. DOD should further reduce Army end strength, to about 480,000, by downsizing redundant headquarters and overhead support and shifting some capabilities to the Guard and Reserve. These changes will incur minimal risk to the force and the capabilities of the nation. A force of about 480,000 would replicate the size of the Army before the attacks of September 11, 2001, but would possess much greater capabilities. The Army-wide reorganization of combat forces into highly capable brigade combat teams (BCTs), now robustly outfitted with combat-proven weaponry and equipment, makes today's Army substantially more capable than its predecessors. Furthermore, since DOD will have to accept risk in certain areas to reduce its budget, it should accept the risks that result from trimming ground forces because they can be reconstituted more rapidly than either air or naval forces in the event of a crisis.", "The Army should adjust the balance between its active and reserve components, relying more on the reserves for key roles and missions. Reserve formations are highly capable and are significantly less expensive to maintain than active forces. Their costs only rise to the level of active forces when activated for full-time duties. The Army should migrate as many as one-quarter of armored brigades found in the active component today to the National Guard. After all, the invasion of Iraq\u2014which still had a sizable army in 2003\u2014only required three U.S. Army armored or mechanized brigades alongside their U.S. Marine and British counterparts. Today, the U.S. Army has 17 of those brigades in the active force alone. Moving four of those brigades to the Army National Guard would save considerable resources, assuming they are employed sustainably, while still enabling the Army to react quickly and effectively to any threats that require those capabilities.", "The Army should develop a robust program of lateral personnel assignments between the active and reserve components to ensure continued readiness. Regularly exchanging officers and NCOs between active and reserve would strengthen the readiness of reserve formations to move rapidly into active operations if required. Army National Guard officers should be able to move onto active duty to command companies or serve on staff, and active officers should be permitted to shift to reserve status and serve as staff officers or commanders in reserve units\u2014perhaps as part of a broader professional development program.

Similarly, data that demonstrate the capabilities of reserve formations are not provided, particularly in comparison to active forces. This is significant, because the report recommends moving four ABCTs from the AC to the RC, and some would argue that National Guard ABCTs are significantly less effective than AC ABCTs due to the highly sophisticated weapon systems in an ABCT and the limited training time National Guard units have to master the employment of these systems for combat. ", "H. Eliminating Gaps in DOD Data on the Fully-Burdened and Life-Cycle Cost of Military Personnel: Cost Elements Should be Mandated by Policy.", "Executive Summary:", "The Reserve Forces Policy Board (RFPB) \"found that the Department does not know, use, or track the fully-burdened and life-cycle costs of its most expensive resource\u2014its military personnel. Thus, major military manpower decisions are uninformed by the real present and future costs.\" According to the report, this data is important for decisions regarding the optimal mix of Active and Reserve forces, but previous Active-Reserve costing studies varied widely in the cost elements used to make comparisons. The RFPB report presents a methodology which, it argues captures the \"fully-burdened\" costs of AC and RC forces on a \"per-capita\" basis so that senior leaders can \"make more fully-informed decisions about the long-term sustainability of the All-Volunteer Force and the future mix of Active and Reserve Component Forces.\" Although \"life-cycle\" costs are mentioned, no specific life-cycle cost methodology is proposed; rather, the report proposes that DOD develop such a model in light of previous work done by the Air Force Reserve and Jennifer Buck, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs.", "Findings:", "\"The Department of Defense has no policy in place to define or require complete analytical data for the comparison of Active and Reserve Component cost to determine Total Force mix options. As a result, senior leaders within DOD do not have complete or uniform data on the total costs associated with such forces. Therefore, decisions about the optimal mix of future Active and Reserve Component forces are not fully informed, and an 'apples to apples' comparison is not possible.\" \" ... the services were neither complete nor consistent in the use and consideration of the various cost factors in determining Reserve Component costs. All components (predictably) used personnel costs such as Basic Pay and Housing Allowances in their costs analysis, but there was wide variance in the use of many other costs factors. No component consistently took into consideration the military-related costs borne by other federal agencies such as the Departments of Education, Treasury, Labor or Veterans Affairs.\" (p. 12) The DOD Deputy Comptroller's \"Composite Rates\" for full-time manpower includes a limited number of cost elements, but \"The annual cost memo includes a statement that says, 'the composite standard pay rates will be used when determining the costs of military personnel for budget/management studies.' This guidance is in clear conflict with [Directive Type Memorandum] 09-007 (draft DOD Instruction 7041.dd) which states 'the DOD composite rates, as published by the [DOD Comptroller], used to calculate manpower costs for program and budget submissions do not account for the full costs of military or DOD civilian personnel ... For this reason, composite rates should not be the only source of data used when answering questions about the cost of the defense workforce, making workforce-mix decisions, or determining the cost impact of manpower conversions.'\" \"The current DOD Directive (DTM 09-007), and the DODI to replace it (DODI 7041.dd) does NOT include all relevant cost factors.\" \"The retirement and health care costs for RC forces as compared to their AC counterparts are far lower. The RFBP believes that DOD needs to have improved visibility on these costs over the long term. To assist the Department with the development of a life-cycle model, the Board provides two specific examples that already exist where life-cycle costs are examined and modeled.\" The costs which should always be included in \"any study conducted or contracted by the Services or other DOD component for the purposes or comparing the costs of active and reserve component personnel or forces\" are: basic pay, retired pay accrual, allowances, special and incentive pay, PCS costs, and Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Fund contribution, DOD healthcare costs, DOD and Department of Education dependent education costs, DOD and Service family housing costs, DOD commissary costs, Treasury contributions for concurrent receipt, and base operations support costs. The costs that should be considered for inclusion in such studies are: Treasury contribution to MERHCF [the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Fund ] and military retirement fund, the budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Labor's Veterans Education and Training Service, and \"service-level non-compensation costs such as Other Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, Military Construction, Research and Development, and training costs.... \" The fully-burdened, per-capita, cost to the U.S. government in FY2013 was $384,622 for Active Component personnel and $123,351 for Reserve Component personnel. These figures include not only costs associated with compensation\u2014funded by DOD and other federal agencies\u2014but also DOD procurement, operations and maintenance, military construction, and RDT&E. If only DOD compensation costs are included, the cost is $108,307 for AC personnel and $34,272 for RC personnel. Adding the compensation related costs from other federal agencies (e.g., Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Labor, and Education) to the DOD compensation costs increases the figure to $162,586 for AC personnel and $57,242 for RC personnel.", "Study Methodology:", "Costing experts from all the services and components \"reviewed previous costing studies, then identified the various fully-burdened and life-cycle individual cost elements and developed options and recommendations for use.\"(p. 10) This work was vetted by active duty and reserve leaders from each of the military services, key decision makers in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and subject matter experts within and outside the Department of Defense (p. 10, slide 15). The result of this process was a list of costs that should always be included in manpower cost studies and others that should be considered for inclusion.", "Potentially Contentious Issues:", "The report mainly focuses on average annual costs associated with \"traditional\" reserve duty (i.e., drilling reservists and AGRs) to the costs of active component forces. It does not address differential costs by community (e.g., those reserve unit with higher training demands) nor does it regularly factor in reserve costs associated with periodic mobilization. Slide 37 does contain a \"Notional AC/RC Fully Burdened / Life Cycle Cost Illustration based on work by Jennifer Buck\" which, assuming a notional reservist is mobilized four times over a career, estimates a life-cycle cost of an AC member at $10.3 million and an RC member at $4.8 million. However, the relationship between these costs and an output such as \"days deployed\" is unclear.", "The report also suggests inclusion of some costs that have not historically been linked to personnel costs\u2014procurement, RDT&E, military construction, and large parts of O&M\u2014and allocates those costs between the AC and the RC in ways to which some may object. For example, it allocates procurement costs almost exclusively to the AC and does not appear to factor in each Service's provision of equipment to their respective reserve components. Allocation of certain O&M and military construction costs could also be criticized as inadequately reflecting the comparative consumption of these resources by AC and RC forces.", "Some might object to the way in which the costs of veterans' benefits are determined. The average cost of veterans' benefits is determined by taking the total VA budget and the veterans education and training budget of the Department of Labor (about $140.5 billion) and dividing by the total number of veterans (22.2 million), to generate a cost per veteran of $6,200 per year. It adds this figure equally to its cost estimate for active and reserve personnel. This methodology may incorrectly estimate the cost of veterans' benefits for currently serving personnel, who may be entitled to different benefits than previous generations of veterans (for example, in the area of educational benefits). Additionally, as the report notes, there may be differences in the consumption of veterans' benefits by active and reserve personnel which, if true, would argue against allocating these costs equally to active and reserve personnel.", "Some elements of \"fully burdened and life cycle costs\" may be less sensitive to changes in force mix than others. For example, changes in AC manning levels may result in changes to health program costs that are proportionately lower than changes in cash compensation costs, due to the overhead and infrastructure associated with the former. This can generate a differential between cost projections based on the cost estimate used and actual costs when modifying the force mix.", "I. National Defense in a Time of Change, February 2013.", "Executive Summary:", "From the paper:", "The current international order provides an opportunity for U.S. policy makers to put the defense budget in order, and the long-term federal budget outlook makes seizing this opportunity essential. Defense spending has come under scrutiny during budget negotiations; most recently, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) calls for reductions of $500 billion in defense spending over the next ten years. Although defense can and should contribute to spending reductions, the BCA's across-the-board cuts would significantly impair the U.S. military's ability to execute its duties. Instead, responsible reductions in defense spending should be spread more practically across a ten-year period and be designed to strategically focus on the threats we are likely to face and to address internal pressures in the defense budget. Certain internal cost pressures in the defense budget make reductions in spending especially difficult, but unless these areas of cost growth are addressed, they will crowd out spending in other areas and begin to remove military capacity and capability.", "This paper lays out a strategy to address these challenges in three parts:", "(1) Design a force better aligned to face future challenges,", "(2) Improve the efficiency and efficacy of the acquisition system, and", "(3) Control rising personnel costs.", "(4) Together, these reforms set the stage for a sustainable defense budget\u2014one that preserves our capability both to face challenges in the near future and to rebuild as new challenges arise.", "Findings:", "Army force structure-related recommendations from the paper:", "The active duty Army would be reduced by 200,000 soldiers from the 490,000 planned in the FY2013 budget, with an increase of 100,000 reservists and National Guardsmen closely entwined in the regular rotation whose principal mission would be arriving in a mature theater for sustained combat. Putting more of the responsibilities for ground combat into the combat-proven reserve component is both consistent with the new demands of the evolving international order and justified by the superb performance of National Guard and reserve units in our recent wars.", "Study Methodology:", "From the paper:", "This discussion paper is a proposal from the authors. As emphasized in The Hamilton Project's original strategy paper, the Project was designed in part to provide a forum for leading thinkers across the nation to put forward innovative and potentially important economic policy ideas that share the Project's broad goals of promoting economic growth, broad-based participation in growth, and economic security. The authors are invited to express their own ideas in discussion papers, whether or not the Project's staff or advisory council agrees with the specific proposals. This discussion paper is offered in that spirit.", "Potentially Contentious Issues:", "This paper is billed as a \"discussion paper\" and, in that regard, can be viewed as simply a collection of creative ideas as opposed to an analytical undertaking. In this regard, the recommendations in this paper can be viewed as contentious due to the lack of strong analytical underpinnings. With regard to Army force structure recommendations, this paper recommends a wide scale change\u2014decreasing the Active Army by 200,000 soldiers and increasing the RC by 100,000 soldiers. Issues such as comparative costs, availability for surge deployments, as well as capabilities are not examined. Because of the magnitude of these proposed changes, it can be inferred that such changes would carry a relatively high degree of risk, but this paper does not discuss associated risks in any degree of detail."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
