Currently, federal regulation of environmental marketing claims consists primarily of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) case-by-case enforcement approach under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce. The commission has issued nonbinding guidelines that explain how it might enforce Section 5 in the environmental marketing context. The FTC and other federal agencies also enforce federal laws and regulations that address specific types of environmental claims such as \"dolphin-safe\" or \"organic\" claims. Finally, in some cases, the federal government has required manufacturers to disclose certain information about the environmental attributes of their products. The EnergyGuide labeling program administered by the FTC and Department of Energy (DOE) serves as one example.", "Federal regulation of environmental marketing claims raises certain legal issues including questions involving the First Amendment, international trade law, and federal preemption of state law. For example, legislation that regulates how manufacturers or sellers make certain claims about their products in advertisements or on labels may raise questions about the constitutional limits of regulating commercial speech. Requiring manufacturers to disclose certain information relating to the environmental characteristics of their products in advertisements and on labels may raise questions about the constitutionality of legislation that compels speech.", "In addition, laws regulating environmental marketing claims that appear on product labels could potentially raise issues concerning the United States' obligations under international trade law. For example, such measures could potentially be subject to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement), which generally requires WTO Members preparing, adopting, and applying a measure to adhere to obligations concerning nondiscrimination; trade-restrictiveness; transparency; and reliance on international standards as a basis for regulation. However, the extent to which the TBT Agreement applies to measures that regulate claims made on labels that address so-called \"non-product-related processes and production methods\" (e.g., the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during manufacture of a product) is unclear.", "Another issue that might arise is the degree to which federal laws and regulations governing environmental marketing claims should expressly preempt state laws."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["During the last few decades, consumers in the United States have shown a significant interest in purchasing consumer products and packaging that appear to be beneficial\u2014or at least not harmful\u2014to the natural environment.

Such legislation could regulate how manufacturers or sellers make certain claims about their products in advertisements or on labels. For example, standards governing the use of terms such as \"recyclable\" or \"biodegradable\" may raise questions about the constitutional limits of regulating commercial speech.

Commercial speech is \"speech that proposes a commercial transaction.\" The Court has further noted that the combination of speech in an advertising format, that references a specific product, and for which the speaker has an underlying economic motivation is \"strong support\" for characterizing such speech as commercial speech.", "Commercial speech is subject to a more relaxed level of scrutiny, often described as intermediate scrutiny, than other forms of protected speech. Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation v. Public Service Commission of New York provides the four-part test used to analyze whether a regulation of commercial speech is permissible under the First Amendment. The first prong of the test examines whether the speech at issue is protected. For commercial speech to be protected, it must at least concern a lawful activity and not be misleading. The government has authority to ban commercial messages which are \"more likely to deceive the public than to inform it\" without running afoul of the First Amendment. Second, there must be a substantial government interest behind the regulation. Third, the regulation must \"directly advance\" that substantial interest. The Court has noted that \"in the commercial context, the speech-restrictive means chosen [must] provide more than 'ineffective or remote support' for a legitimate governmental policy goal.\" Finally, the restriction must be no more extensive than necessary to further the government interest. This fourth prong was further clarified by the Court in a case decided nine years after Central Hudson . The Court explained in Board of Trustees of the State University of New York v. Fox that the fourth prong did not amount to a least restrictive means requirement, but rather necessitated a less rigorous test. The fit between the regulation and the interest need not be perfect, but simply reasonable. While restrictions on commercial speech are subject to intermediate scrutiny, if a restriction applies where commercial and noncommercial speech are inseparable, strict scrutiny analysis is required.", "How is this commercial speech test applied in the context of restrictions on speech relating to environmental marketing? A 1994 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit provides a sample case for a First Amendment challenge to environmental marketing restrictions imposed at the state level. In 1990, California adopted a law prohibiting a manufacturer or distributor of consumer goods from representing their products as \"ozone friendly,\" \"biodegradable,\" \"photodegradable,\" \"recyclable,\" or \"recycled\" unless the products satisfied the statutory definition of each term. The law was enacted following the efforts of an interstate task force, which found that there were disparities in the way these terms were used, and was concerned that the resulting confusion \"creat[ed] a fertile ground for abusive business practices.\" In Association of National Advertisers, et al. v. Lungren , several trade associations challenged the law as impermissibly restricting commercial and noncommercial speech.", "The court began by addressing the plaintiffs' claim that the law regulated not just commercial speech but also noncommercial speech. The court rejected this argument, concluding that by the statute's own terms, the only speech being restricted were claims about specific consumer goods in advertisements and product labels. Therefore, the speech met the three criteria used by the Supreme Court to find evidence of commercial speech: it was in an advertising format, it referenced a specific product, and the speaker had an underlying economic motive. Additionally, the plaintiffs failed to provide any examples in which \"political, editorial, or otherwise non-commercial representation[s]\" would fall within the scope of the statute's restrictions.", "Since the court determined that the restriction applied to commercial speech, it was appropriate to analyze its constitutionality under the intermediate scrutiny test articulated in Central Hudson . First, the court determined that the speech at issue should be afforded First Amendment protection because it concerned a lawful activity and was not outright misleading. Instead, the court concluded that the use of terms like \"recyclable\" and \"biodegradable\" was only potentially misleading because whether a specific product bought by a specific consumer could be recycled or would biodegrade depends on factors such as access to recycling facilities and composting techniques in local landfills. The parties agreed that California satisfied the second prong of the Central Hudson test since it had a substantial interest in \"ensuring truthful environmental advertising and encouraging recycling.\" Moving to the third prong of the Central Hudson test, the court determined that the statute directly advanced California's interests. The case's record had \"abundant support\" for the idea that environmental marketing increased consumer demand for environmentally friendly products. Without standardized terms, such marketing could present \"potentially specious claims or ecological puffery[,]\" leading to an increase in sales of \"products with minimal environmental attributes.\" Therefore, it was reasonable to believe that uniform standards for environmental marketing terms would promote the state's interest in truthful advertising and consumer protection. Finally, the court addressed the fourth prong, which is described as \"a more deferential 'far-less-restrictive means test' for commercial speech.\" The court determined that there were no less restrictive and more precise alternatives available that achieved California's stated interests. The two alternatives offered by the plaintiffs were rejected because they were less precise than the existing statute, and required more speech by forcing manufacturers to qualify or explain their use of nonconforming terms, respectively.", "Restrictions on commercial speech must withstand Central Hudson 's intermediate scrutiny in order to be upheld when faced with a First Amendment challenge. In accordance with this test, regulation of environmental marketing claims in advertisements and labels must be consistent with the government's interest in regulating such commercial speech, and must directly advance that interest."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Compelled Speech", "paragraphs": ["Legislation that compels commercial speech, such as requiring the disclosure of environmental characteristics on product advertisements and labels, may be subject to a different standard of review based on how a reviewing court interprets the nature of the compelled speech.

Office of Disciplinary Counsel . First, the compelled disclosure must concern \"purely factual and uncontroversial information.\" Second, the disclosure must be \"reasonably related\" to a legitimate government interest. While Zauderer addressed a disclosure requirement that was aimed at preventing deception to customers, later circuit courts have applied its reasoning to other governmental interests. Lastly, the disclosure requirement must not be \"unjustified or unduly burdensome\" such that it chills protected commercial speech.", "Consequently, environmental marketing requirements mandating the disclosure of purely factual and uncontroversial information would be governed by the \"reasonable relationship\" standard articulated in Zauderer . However, a heightened standard of scrutiny is likely to apply to laws that require manufacturers to espouse a particular opinion; perform ideological speech; or disclose nonpurely factual statements, which may for instance be designed to evoke a particular emotional response."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "World Trade Organization Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade", "paragraphs": ["Laws regulating environmental marketing claims made on product labels could potentially raise issues concerning the United States' trade obligations under the World Trade Organization agreements, specifically the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). The GATT generally prohibits WTO Members from enacting measures that discriminate against imported products in favor of like domestic products or like products from other countries unless an exception applies. However, WTO jurisprudence concerning labeling measures has focused on the TBT Agreement, which seeks to ensure that standards-related measures, including labeling requirements or standards, do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade while at the same time allowing WTO Members to take actions necessary, for example, to protect human health and the environment.", "As a WTO Member, the United States has an obligation to comply with the disciplines of the TBT Agreement. If a WTO Member believes that an environmental labeling measure promulgated by the United States, one of its state or local governments, or a nongovernmental body within U.S. territory is not in compliance with the disciplines of the TBT Agreement, the Member may challenge the measure using procedures in the WTO agreements.

As noted above, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act of 1990 (DPCIA) regulates representations that a tuna product exported from, or offered for sale in, the United States is harvested in a manner that does not harm dolphins. In 2008, various WTO Members requested consultations with the United States with respect to the DPCIA, its implementing regulations, and a related federal court of appeals decision. In 2012, the Appellate Body found that the U.S. \"dolphin-safe\" labeling measure violated the TBT Agreement by discriminating against tuna products imported from Mexico. Subsequently, the United States modified its regulations implementing the DPCIA in an effort to bring them into conformity with the Appellate Body's ruling. However, in November 2013, Mexico requested the establishment of a compliance panel to determine whether the United States' changes to its regulations brought them into conformity with the United States' WTO obligations.

If a WTO panel were to find that a measure promulgated by the United States federal government meets one of these definitions, then the United States would have to comply with several trade obligations with respect to that measure, including obligations concerning nondiscrimination; trade-restrictiveness; transparency; and reliance on international standards as a basis for regulation. In addition, if a private standardizing body or state or local government within United States territory were to promulgate a labeling measure that qualified as a \"standard,\" the United States would generally have to take reasonable measures to ensure that this entity complied with the Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards in Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement. Because WTO jurisprudence under the TBT Agreement has focused almost exclusively on obligations related to \"technical regulations,\" this section examines when an environmental labeling measure would potentially qualify as a \"technical regulation,\" and discusses the obligations that the United States would have with respect to such a measure under the TBT Agreement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Environmental Labeling Measures as \"Technical Regulations\"", "paragraphs": ["Criteria for marking or labeling products may fall within the definition of a \"technical regulation\" under Annex 1.1 to the TBT Agreement. According to the Appellate Body's interpretation of Annex 1.1, a technical regulation is a measure (1) that is applicable to an identifiable product or group of products, although the measure does not have to identify these products expressly; (2) that lays down product characteristics, including packaging, marking, or labeling requirements, in either positive or negative form \"or their related processes and production methods\"; and (3) with which compliance is mandatory.", "An environmental labeling measure seems likely to satisfy factor (1) because it would arguably apply to a group of products that share a particular characteristic regulated by the measure, such as \"consumer products that claim to be biodegradable.\" Under factors (2) and (3), a measure stating that products must be labeled with certain information would appear to lay down mandatory product characteristics within the meaning of the TBT Agreement. In addition, WTO case law suggests that a measure permitting a product to carry a certain label only if the product possesses certain characteristics is a \"technical regulation\" that lays down mandatory product characteristics. In United States\u2014Measures Concerning the Importation, Marketing and Sale of Tuna and Tuna Products , the Appellate Body held that a U.S. law, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA), laid down product characteristics when the law provided that an entity would violate Section 5 of the FTC Act if the entity voluntarily labeled a tuna product as \"dolphin-safe\" when the product's harvesting methods failed to meet certain dolphin safety criteria. The Appellate Body emphasized that the DPCIA provided penalties for the voluntary use of the government-designed \"dolphin-safe\" label, as well as any other \"dolphin safety\" label or statement on a product when the product's harvesting methods did not meet certain criteria. Thus, when a measure subjects a company to government enforcement proceedings or penalties for voluntarily using a label on a product that possesses or lacks certain characteristics, the labeling measure could potentially constitute a \"technical regulation\" under the TBT Agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labels Pertaining to Processes and Production Methods", "paragraphs": ["Some environmental labeling measures might regulate claims made on labels concerning product characteristics that are not physical characteristics. For example, some labeling measures might regulate claims addressing the environmental impacts of a product during all or part of its life cycle, such as the effect on the environment of the product's manufacture, distribution, use, or disposal. These characteristics of a product may be considered non-product-related processes and production methods (NPR PPMs). NPR PPMs are those processes and production methods that do not leave a trace in the final product. An example of an environmental labeling measure based on NPR PPMs is a law stating that a piece of furniture may carry a certain label only if it is made with \"sustainably managed wood.\"", "It remains unclear whether the TBT Agreement applies to a measure that requires a product label to provide information regarding the product's NPR PPMs, or permits a product to carry a label concerning NPR PPMs only if the product's PPMs meet certain criteria. In a recent case not involving a labeling measure, the Appellate Body confirmed that the TBT Agreement may cover product-related PPMs, but declined to address the extent of the relationship that the PPM must have with the product in order for the TBT Agreement to apply. Commentators have noted that because of lingering ambiguity in the text of the TBT Agreement, it is unclear whether the agreement covers labeling of NPR PPMs.", "If outside the scope of the TBT Agreement, a U.S. labeling measure might be subject to the GATT, including Article I:1, which sets forth most-favored nation treatment obligations, or Article III:4, which contains national treatment obligations pertaining to a WTO Member's internal regulations, if there is sufficient government involvement in its formulation, adoption, or application. However, it is unclear whether these GATT provisions allow a WTO Member to treat an imported product less favorably than a domestic product (or product from another country) solely because the imported product's NPR PPMs differ from those of the domestic product in a way that the regulating Member deems undesirable. If a WTO panel were to determine that a labeling measure was inconsistent with the GATT, then the United States might raise defenses under one or more of the exceptions in GATT Article XX pertaining to protection of \"human, animal, or plant life or health\" or \"conservation of exhaustible natural resources.\" It is important to note, however, that it is unclear to what extent the United States may assert these exceptions when the measure at issue seeks to protect solely those persons or resources outside of U.S. territory."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Obligations with Respect to Technical Regulations", "paragraphs": ["If a WTO panel were to find that an environmental labeling measure was a \"technical regulation\" under the TBT Agreement, the United States would have WTO obligations pertaining to the preparation, adoption, and application of the measure, including obligations concerning nondiscrimination; trade-restrictiveness; transparency; and reliance on international standards as a basis for regulation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nondiscrimination", "paragraphs": ["Under TBT Agreement Article 2.1, the United States has an obligation to ensure that a labeling measure that is a \"technical regulation\" does not treat imported products less favorably than like domestic products or like products imported from other countries. To decide whether products are \"like,\" a panel generally seeks to determine whether a competitive relationship exists between the products by considering several factors. In the past, the Appellate Body has suggested that a product which presents greater health concerns might not be \"like\" a substitute safer product, at least insofar as these concerns \"have an impact on the competitive relationship between and among the products\" at issue. It is possible that a panel would extend this reasoning to imported products that present greater environmental concerns. Thus, it is possible that a U.S. environmental labeling measure could treat an imported WTO Member product less favorably than a domestic product or product from another country based on the fact that the domestic product (or product of another country) was better for the environment or health when compared to the imported WTO Member product that possessed the same physical characteristics.", "If a measure applies to \"like products,\" then a panel would probably next consider whether the measure discriminates against the imported products by granting these products less favorable treatment than the like domestic products or products of another country. The Appellate Body has held that a measure grants an imported product less favorable treatment when it (1) modifies the conditions of competition to the detriment of the imported product as compared to the like domestic product or like product of another WTO Member; and (2) this detrimental impact \"reflects discrimination\" against the imported product.", "Because access to an environmental label may provide an advantage to a product in the marketplace, a WTO panel might determine that the de jure or de facto denial of access to the label for like imported products treats these products less favorably. For a complainant to establish a violation, it must demonstrate a genuine relationship between the labeling measure and the detrimental impact on competitive opportunities for the imported products. Such a relationship may exist, for example, when the government creates \"incentives for market participants to behave in certain ways, and thereby treat[s] imported products less favorably.\" For instance, less favorable treatment may result from a labeling measure that \"entails higher costs\" for handling imported products than domestic products.", "A measure that is discriminatory may be consistent with the TBT if the discrimination stems from a legitimate regulatory distinction. To stem from such a distinction and avoid violating TBT Agreement Article 2.1, a labeling measure that appears to discriminate de facto against like imported products must be \"even-handed.\" One example of a lack of evenhandedness is when \"informational requirements imposed on upstream producers under [a measure] are disproportionate as compared to the level of information communicated to consumers through mandatory retail labels.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Relevant International Standards as a Basis for Domestic Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Under Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement, a WTO Member must use relevant international standards or parts thereof as a basis for their technical regulations except when the standards would not effectively or appropriately assist the Member in fulfilling its legitimate objectives. One international standard that could potentially serve as the basis for an environmental labeling measure is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14020 series of standards for environmental labels and declarations. This standard would appear to meet the definition of \"standard\" in Annex 1.2 of the TBT Agreement, and the ISO would appear to qualify as an \"international body\" under Annex 1.4.", "For the United States to have an obligation to use a standard as a basis for regulation, the standard must be \"relevant,\" which means that it deals with the same product as the domestic regulation and covers similar characteristics of that product, or at least regulates the same subject matter. Thus, a WTO panel's determination of relevance would likely involve a comparison between the U.S. labeling measure and the potentially relevant international standard. For an international standard to be \"used as a basis\" for a U.S. labeling measure, the measure need not conform to the standard in all respects; rather, the standard or its relevant parts must serve as the \"principal constituent or fundamental principle\" of the measure. In addition, the measure and standard cannot be contradictory. Notably, the United States would not have to use a relevant international standard as a basis for a labeling measure when that standard would not effectively or appropriately assist it in fulfilling the United States' legitimate objectives.
