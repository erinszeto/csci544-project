Arrangement is chronological according to the order of original enactment, with divisions into three periods. The first period begins with the Civil War era and includes the creation of national banks and the Federal Reserve System. The second period encompasses the New Deal and its aftermath, during which a wall was erected and reinforced between commerce and banking. The third or current period is characterized by statutes designed to modernize the financial services industry and, consistent with safety and soundness, eliminate barriers to the provision of nationwide integrated financial services. In the interest of national security, criminal law enforcement, and protecting personal privacy, the current period is also marked by increased federal regulation of customer information maintained by financial institutions.", "For CRS reports on current topics, consult the \"Financial Sector\" subheading under \"Issues in Focus\" on the CRS home page: http://www.crs.gov/."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background1", "paragraphs": ["The history of federal legislation significantly affecting banking, securities, capital markets, and financial services in general, may conveniently be divided into three chronological periods: Civil War to New Deal; New Deal Era; and 1956 to the present. Examination of these laws reveals that the increasing role of the federal government in overseeing and protecting financial services has been primarily in response to turmoil or financial distress in the economy. For example, landmark legislation brought a greater federal presence into the financial arena to moderate the financial stress and adversity of the Civil War, the financial Panic of 1907, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. Much of this legislation persists, albeit in amended form, and can be viewed as the foundation of the structure under which the financial services industry operates today.", "Pre-New Deal legislation set up basic, continuing, entities, including the national banking system; the Federal Reserve System; and, in 1932, the Federal Home Loan Bank System. New Deal era legislation is probably most striking for its rigid separation of banking, securities, and insurance businesses, and for setting up major parts of the federal financial safety net, particularly deposit insurance. More recent legislation has permitted reintegration of these functions, allowing firms to compete across political boundaries, and in nontraditional businesses. The overall aim has been to produce a more level competitive \"playing field\" and continue to maintain safety. The effect has been generally to produce an increasingly more uniform structure of U.S. financial providers. Especially in the last two decades, laws have progressively \"deregulated\" New Deal or earlier controls over geography, pricing, and products of banking and financial services providers. The growing complexities of financial transactions have prompted financial services companies to maintain data bases containing large amounts of information on their individual customers, raising a potential for improper use. This has prompted increasing federal regulation of customer financial information to protect customer privacy, deter criminal activity, and in the interest of national security.", "The laws cited are those chosen for their historical significance, their present importance in the federal scheme of regulating financial services businesses, or their recent enactment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pre-New Deal Legislation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Bank Act", "paragraphs": ["12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21-215b.

It was originally enacted during the Civil War by the National Bank Act of 1863 (Currency Act) (12 Stat. 665), and was significantly amended by the National Bank Act of 1864 (13 Stat. 99). Congress enacted the original measure to assist the Government in paying Civil War debts, to provide for chartering banks by the Federal Government, and to provide a more uniform national currency (as bank notes) and safer banks based on their holding U.S. Government bonds. The 1864 legislation included major amendments, among them requiring that national banks be incorporated and initiating a system of examining national banks.

To prevent recurrence of another financial panic such as that of 1907, Congress designed \"the Fed\" to provide a better national payments system, including a national currency through its issuance of Federal Reserve notes. Another vital component of this payment system is the Federal Reserve's services to its member banks. These include clearing checks and other payments and lending to cash-short banks.
