The most recent staff compensation report was issued in 2010, which, like previous compensation reports, relied on anonymous, self-reported survey data. Pay information in this report is based on the House Statement of Disbursements (SOD), published quarterly by the Chief Administrative Officer, as collated by LegiStorm, a private entity that provides some congressional data by subscription. Data in this report are based on official House reports, which afford the opportunity to use consistently collected data from a single source. Additionally, this report provides annual data, which allows for observations about the nature of House Member staff compensation over time.", "This report provides pay data for 12 staff position titles that are typically used in House Members' offices.

For each year, the SOD reports pay data for five time periods: January 1 and 2; January 3-March 31; April 1-June 30; July 1-September 30; and October 1-December 31. The aggregate pay of those five periods equals the annual pay of a congressional staff member.", "For each year, 2001-2015, a random sample of 45 staff for each position, and who did not receive pay from any other congressional employing authority, was taken. Every recorded payment ascribed to those staff for the calendar year is included. Data collected for this report may differ from an employee's stated annual salary due to the inclusion of overtime, bonuses, or other payments in addition to base salary paid in the course of a year. For some positions, it was not possible to identify 45 employees who held that title for the entire year.

Authority to use the Member Representational Allowance (MRA) for the previous year expires January 2, and new MRA authority begins on January 3. As a consequence, no data are available for first-term Members of the House in the first session of a Congress. Pay data provide no insight into the education, work experience, position tenure, full- or part-time status of staff, or other potential explanations for levels of compensation. Data do not differentiate between staff based in Washington, DC, district offices, or both. Member offices that do not utilize any of the 12 job position titles or their variants, or whose pay data were not reported consistently, are excluded. Potential differences could exist in the job duties of positions with the same title. Aggregation of pay by job title rests on the assumption that staff with the same title carry out similar tasks. Given the wide discretion congressional employing authorities have in setting the terms and conditions of employment, there may be differences in the duties of similarly titled staff that could have effects on their levels of pay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Tables and Visualizations", "paragraphs": ["Tables in this section provide background information on House pay practices, comparative data for each position, and detailed pay data and visualizations for each position.
