When a sitting Member dies, the House and Senate carry out a number of actions based on chamber rules, statutes, and long-standing practices. Some congressional practices related to the death of a sitting Member predate the national legislature established by the Constitution. On October 23, 1775, the Continental Congress, sitting in Philadelphia, was informed that Peyton Randolph, a Delegate from Virginia and president of the Continental Congress, \"suddenly departed this life\" the day before, and resolved that its members would \"attend his funeral as mourners, with a crape round their left arm,\" and \"continue in Mourning for the space of one month.\" A committee of three Delegates was appointed to \"superintend the funeral,\" and the Reverend Jacob Duch\u00e9, rector of St. Peter's Episcopal and Christ Churches was requested to \"prepare a proper discourse to be delivered at the funeral.\"", "During the First Congress (1789-1791), the first instances of the death of a sitting Senator and Representative occurred. Senator William Grayson of Virginia died on March 12, 1790. No direct mention of the event is recorded in the Senate Journal or the Annals of Congress . On June 1, 1790, the House was informed of the death of Representative Theodorick Bland of Virginia. The House ordered the Virginia delegation to \"be a committee to superintend the funeral, and that the House attend the same.\" The next day, it was ordered that the House Members go into mourning for one month, \"by the usual method of wearing crape around the left arm.\"", "In the 19 th century, Congress adopted the practice of paying some of the expenses of funeral services for sitting Members. Services were sometimes held in the House or Senate chamber. On February 27, 1838, for example, funeral services for Representative Jonathan Cilley of Maine were held in the Hall of the House, with the House and Senate in attendance. When services or interment were not held in Washington, DC, it was the practice of both chambers to appoint a committee of Members to escort the remains of a deceased colleague to their final destination. On June 28, 1847, the House and Senate each voted to accompany the remains of Senator John Fairfield of Maine \"from his house to the depot, where they were to be delivered to\" Representative Franklin Clark, who accompanied them to Maine. By the 41 st Congress (1869-1871), it had \"for a long time been a custom to appoint a joint committee to attend the remains of a deceased Senator or Member to his home, as in the instance of Senator Daniel S. Morton, of Minnesota, on July 14, 1870.\"", "In contemporary times, chamber rules and statutes set out some of the congressional response to the death of a sitting Member, and former Members who served as Speaker. Evidence from the Senate Journal , House precedents, and other historical documents shows that some long-standing observances, such as adjourning briefly as a mark of respect to the deceased, appointing Member delegations to attend funerals of deceased colleagues, or paying the costs of a funeral from public funds, may be employed. Other customs, such as wearing crape, holding services in the House or Senate chambers, or appointing Members to escort the body back to the home state, have not been observed for at least several decades. In addition to some evolutionary changes in institutional patterns, it appears that contemporary congressional response is affected by a number of external factors including the following:", "circumstances of the Member's death; preferences of the deceased Member, or the Member's family, regarding funeral services; whether Congress is in session when the Member dies; pending congressional business at the time of the Member's death; and events external to Congress.", "Consequently, it appears that congressional response to the death of a sitting Member could be characterized as a set of actions that are determined in detail at or around the time of the death, in response to an array of factors.

Depending on floor business, the House may continue with pending matters, suspend business for special order speeches and other memorials to the deceased Member, or immediately adjourn for the day in honor of the decedent.", "The death of Representative Julia May Carson of Indiana, who died on December 15, 2007, was acknowledged when the House met on December 17. In his opening prayer, the Reverend Daniel P. Coughlin, chaplain of the House, noted Representative Carson's demise. A short time later, Representative Dan Burton, dean of the Indiana delegation, was recognized to speak, and yielded to Representative Peter Visclosky of Indiana, who informed the House of Representative Carson's passing, and announced a special order for tributes to her. Following brief remarks by Representative Burton, Representative Visclosky asked for and was granted a moment of silence in Representative Carson's memory.", "Other contemporary examples of the House acknowledging the death of a sitting Member include the following:", "No formal announcement regarding the death of Representative Jo Ann Davis of Virginia, who died Saturday, October 6, 2007, was made in the House when the chamber next met on October 9, and no moment of silence was observed. During the prayer at the beginning of the session, the chaplain mentioned Representative Davis, and some Members commented through one minute speeches. A resolution of condolence was considered and adopted later in the day. Following the death of Representative Paul E. Gillmor of Ohio on September 5, 2007, Representative John Boehner, the Republican leader, received unanimous consent to speak out of order to inform the chamber. Later in the day, Representative Ralph Regula of Ohio rose to announce his intention to introduce a \"resolution of bereavement\" and asked that the House rise for a moment of silence. The death of Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald of California, on April 22, 2007, was announced the next day by Representative Pete Stark of California, who asked for a moment of silence. Following brief consideration of other matters, the House moved to consideration and adoption of a resolution of condolence before adjourning. An announcement of the death of Representative Charles W. Norwood Jr. of Georgia, who died on February 13, 2007, after a long illness, was made to the House in the middle of debate on H.Con.Res. 63 , regarding President George W. Bush's decision to send additional military personnel to Iraq. On February 13, debate on the concurrent resolution was briefly interrupted twice to acknowledge Representative Norwood's death. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who was recognized to speak on the pending resolution, announced Representative Norwood's death. A short time later, Representative John Nathan Deal of Georgia came to the floor on behalf of the Georgia delegation to announce Representative Norwood's death and to ask for a moment of silence.", "Pursuant to House Rule XX, clause 5(d), the Speaker or Speaker pro tempore typically announces a revised whole number of the House in light of the passing of a Representative soon after the House acknowledges the Member's passing.", "When a Member of the House dies during an extended period of congressional recess or adjournment, it has been the practice of the House since at least 1826 to make an announcement on the next day the chamber convened. This approach was taken when Representative Floyd Spence of South Carolina died on August 16, 2001. When the House reconvened on September 5, Speaker Dennis Hastert addressed the House to announce Representative Spence's death, that a funeral had been held, that Representative John Spratt would later offer a resolution of condolence, and that a special order in tribute to Representative Spence would be held in the future."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Representatives-Elect", "paragraphs": ["Representatives-elect who died between their election and the convening of Congress have been acknowledged by the House.

Pinckney of South Carolina, noting that while Mr. Singleton had not appeared and qualified, \"it was fitting, and according to the usages of the House, to pay him the usual observances of respect.\" Following the adoption of a resolution of condolence, Representative Pinckney \"moved an adjournment of the House, saying that he believed such to be the custom in these cases.\"", "According to House precedents and more recent practice, recognizing deceased Representatives-elect in a manner similar to that of sitting Members also occurred in the 20 th century. On the first day of the 98 th Congress (1983-1984), the House took official notice of the death of Representative-elect Jack Swigert through an announcement of his passing by the Sergeant at Arms. Later in the day, the House adopted a resolution of condolence and appointed five Members to attend Mr. Swigert's funeral.", "In addition to a resolution of condolence, discussed below, there may be other tributes to the deceased Member offered on the floor of the House.

Consequently, a formal floor announcement is generally not made. The death of a sitting Senator is typically acknowledged on the Senate floor in prayers offered by the chaplain, through tributes offered by other Senators, and consideration of a resolution of condolence. The Senate may continue with other business, or adjourn after acknowledging a Senator's demise. When it does adjourn, the chamber typically does so as a mark of further respect to the late Senator. Exceptions to this practice arise when news of the death of a Senator reaches the Senate while it is meeting. In those circumstances, including the deaths of Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia on July 18, 2000, and Senator Quentin Burdick of North Dakota on September 8, 1992, the majority leader made an announcement.", "Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming died on June 4, 2007.

When the Senate met on September 8, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, asked for a moment of silence in honor of Senator Kennedy.

House precedents and the Senate Journal typically refer to resolutions designating the use of crape or other badges of mourning, and authorizing Members to attend funeral services. In the House it was typical to adjourn as a mark of respect for the deceased Member.

When Delegate Narsworthy Hunter of Mississippi Territory died on March 11, 1802, a week after the Seventh Congress (1801-1803) convened, the practice of providing a funeral at public expense was first adopted by the House. On June 5, 1809, the Senate adopted a resolution \"that a sum not exceeding one hundred and fifty dollars be applied out of the contingent fund for placing a neat slab or monument with a suitable inscription\" over the tomb of Senator Francis Malbone of Rhode Island, who died on March 4.
