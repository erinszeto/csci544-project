Pages must be high school juniors and at least 16 years of age. Several incumbent and former Members of Congress as well as other prominent Americans have served as congressional pages.", "Senator Daniel Webster appointed the first Senate page in 1829. The first House pages began their service in 1842. Women were first appointed as pages in 1971.", "In August 2011, House leaders announced the termination of that chamber's page program.", "Senate pages are appointed and sponsored by Senators for one academic semester of the school year, or for a summer session. The right to appoint pages rotates among Senators pursuant to criteria set by the Senate's leadership. Academic standing is one of the most important criteria used in the final selection of pages. Selection criteria for House pages was similar when the page program operated in that chamber.", "Prospective Senate pages are advised to contact their Senators to request consideration for a page appointment."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History and Background", "paragraphs": ["The United States Congress is served by a group of young adults known as pages. Pages have been employed since the early Congresses, and some Members of Congress have served as pages. Today, congressional pages include students who are juniors in high school and who may come from all areas of the United States and its territories.", "The page system is formally provided for in law, although the rationale for the page service or for using high school students is not. Since the earliest accounts of pages, it has been widely noted in debates and writings within Congress that pages provide needed messenger services:", "From the origin of the present government, in 1789, to the present time, they [messengers] have been under the orders and resolutions of the House, and experience has attested to the necessity of their services. The use of boys or pages, was introduced at a later period; but from the first session of Congress held at the city of Washington [1800], they have continued to be employed by the House, with the approbation of the House.", "Being a page provides a unique educational opportunity, affording young adults an opportunity to learn about Congress, the legislative process, and to develop workplace and leadership skills.", "Over the years, there has been concern about having young pages serve Congress. In the 1800s and early 1900s, some House pages were as young as 10 and Senate pages as young as 13. Later, they were as old as 18. At various times, congressional actions related to employing pages have addressed the lack of supervised housing as well as pages' ages, tenure, selection, education, and management. Far-reaching reforms in the page system were implemented in 1982 and 1983, following press reports of insufficient supervision, alleged sexual misconduct, and involvement in the trafficking of drugs on Capitol Hill. Most reports of misbehavior were later found to be unsubstantiated.", "As a consequence of the allegations, however, both the House and Senate for the first time provided supervised housing for their pages; established separate page schools and took over the education of the pages, which had been provided under contract by the District of Columbia school system; and developed more educational and recreational opportunities for their pages.", "In the 110 th Congress (2007-2008), at the request of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Leader John Boehner, the House inspector general (IG) conducted an inquiry into the supervision and operation of the House Page Residence Hall, and subsequently issued a confidential report recommending changes. In 2008, an independent study, conducted by consultants to the House, was conducted. In response to the findings of those efforts, the House implemented new policies to enhance the safety and supervision of the pages and oversight of the page program. These changes followed investigations of allegations related to the page program participants, including the exchange of inappropriate communications between a Member of the House and former pages, and of misbehavior by a few pages in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses.", "A follow up review of the page program was carried out in the summer of 2010 by the same independent consultants. According to House leaders, concerns raised in 2008, including costs and the need for the program, remained. In August 2011, Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced the termination of the House page program effective August 31. In a Dear Colleague Letter, the leaders cited both changes in technology obviating the need for most page services, and the program's costs as reasons to discontinue the program.", "In the 112 th Congress, (2011-2012), H.Res. 397 , entitled Reestablishing the House of Representatives Page Program, was introduced by Representative Dan Boren. The resolution would have created an advisory panel to make recommendations for the operation of a reestablished page program. The House page program would have been reestablished in the first school semester after the advisory panel submitted its recommendations to the Committee on House Administration. Membership of the nine-person advisory body would have been composed of three Members of the House from the majority party of the House, three Members of the House from the minority party, and three individuals who were not Members and who had served as House pages.
