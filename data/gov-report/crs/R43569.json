No supplementals were part of the FY2011 foreign affairs budget. In FY2012, the Administration requested foreign affairs OCO funds for the first time. That year the Administration requested $8.7 billion for OCO for the frontline states of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress appropriated $11.2 billion, however, for frontline states, as well as for other uses, such as Peacekeeping Operations in Somalia, Economic Support Funds (ESF) for Somalia and Yemen, and Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) for Kenya. The FY2015 request for OCO was about 95% of what Congress enacted in FY2012.

In each of the last three years, Congress appropriated more OCO funding for foreign affairs than was requested, and for a broader range of countries and activities. Within the foreign affairs budget in FY2012, the Obama Administration requested $8.7 billion for OCO, and Congress enacted $11.2 billion. In FY2013, the Administration requested $8.2 billion for OCO, but Congress enacted $10.8 billion (net rescissions). The FY2014 request continued this pattern; the Administration requested $3.8 billion of OCO funds for foreign affairs, while Congress appropriated $6.5 billion (net rescissions).

While total foreign affairs funding declined from FY2012-FY2014, the enduring funds decreased because of the FY2013 sequestration, but increased slightly in FY2014. The decline in total foreign affairs funds after FY2012 suggests that even as the enduring funds increase there is a trade-off between enduring and OCO money in order to reduce the overall total.

In the past few years, to address these gaps as well as the need to better train its employees, the State Department, with the support of Congress, increased hiring, growing the Foreign Service by almost 20% since the end of FY2008 and the Civil Service by 7%; however, hiring slowed significantly since FY2011-FY2012 due to budget constraints.

While the Administration's FY2015 request indicates that it planned 206 new positions at the Department of State altogether, 153 of these would have been funded by consular fees and devoted to work such as meeting increasing visa demand. The request for the remaining 53 new positions for which State sought appropriated funding was described by department officials as a much more modest personnel request than in recent years.

By comparison, the department requested 29 new positions focused on the Asia-Pacific in its FY2014 budget proposal.", "Among other personnel-related issues, the department's request notably did not include additional funding for Overseas Comparability Pay (OCP), as it has in previous years. OCP adjustment is intended to bring the base pay of Foreign Service personnel posted overseas to levels comparable to their Foreign Service colleagues serving in Washington, DC, who receive locality pay. OCP has long been a priority of the Foreign Service rank-and-file, who argue that the discrepancy affects morale, retention of FSOs, and acts as a financial disincentive to serve overseas, including by its cumulative impact on retirement pay. The department sought $81.4 million in FY2014 funding to provide the third portion of a three-phase adjustment, the first two tranches of which were supported by Congress in previous years. The third OCP phase was not supported by Congress in FY2013 or FY2014 appropriations.", "Neither the House nor the Senate committee measures would have fully met the Administration's request for Human Resources funding.

Although the request appeared to include a significant boost over current year funding for USAID Operating Expenses, the Administration explained that the increase was intended to offset anticipated decreases in other funding sources, including recoveries, reimbursement, and trust funds, and would have allowed for continued operations at the current level rather than growth. While the Administration originally proposed reductions in bilateral economic aid, largely driven by a 27.8% cut in International Disaster Assistance (IDA) and a 33.1% cut in Migration and Refugee Assistance (for which the Administration explained that actual available resources would not be reduced because of anticipated carry-over funding from previous years), supplemental requests have since brought the FY2015 bilateral economic aid request to 7% above FY2014. Much of the increase was in the IDA and USAID Global Health accounts for funds to address the Ebola crisis. Security Assistance also would have been reduced under the original request, but would have increased 8% with the additional FMF and Counterterrorism Partnership Fund spending proposed in the July 2014 amended OCO request and the November 2014 OCO amendment requesting additional FMF to counter IS. Multilateral aid would have increased as a result of an International Monetary Fund quota increase (+$315 million), partly offset by a proposed cut to the International Development Association (-4.8%) and no request for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program ($133 million in FY2014).", "House appropriators stayed close to current year spending levels for most types of aid, with the exception of multilateral assistance, which they would have cut significantly (-17.6%). Senate appropriators would have increased USAID administrative funding (+16.8%), similar to the Administration's proposal, provided slightly less than current year funding for bilateral economic aid (-2.8%), and more than the current funding levels for multilateral aid (+8.1%). The Senate committee-approved bill also included significantly more security assistance (+17.0%) under Foreign Operations than the current budget, but this in large part reflected the bill's shift of assessed contributions to peacekeeping activities from the State Operations to Foreign Operations section of the bill. Peacekeeping funds (including both assessed and voluntary contributions) recommended by Senate appropriators totaled $2.86 billion, compared to $2.25 billion proposed by House appropriators, the Administration's amended request of $3.35 billion, and FY2014 funding of $2.20 billion. Both the House and Senate legislation were approved by committee before the Administration made multiple amendments to its request in response to world events, so comparisons between the congressional proposals and the Administration's request are of questionable value.", "The enacted appropriation, P.L. 113-235 , included an 8.6% increase from FY2014 levels for Administration of Foreign Assistance, but 10.5% less than requested. Bilateral economic programs increased 12.2% from FY2014, driven largely by emergency funding to address the Ebola crisis. Security assistance declined by 0.7%, and multilateral assistance declined by 7.3% from FY2014 funding.", "Aid by Country and Region. Under the original FY2015 request, bilateral aid allocated by region (excluding humanitarian aid and the Millennium Challenge Corporation) would have varied in some instances from current year funding. Aid to South and Central Asia would have increased by 13.2% compared to FY2014, while East Asia Pacific and the Near East would have seen modest increases of about 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Funding for Africa would have been reduced by about 1.6%. Europe and Eurasia would have seen a decrease of 6.3% under the original request, but the amended request for European security assistance would have provided an increase of 7.6%. Only the Western Hemisphere would have seen significant reductions (-10.1%) from current year regional spending under the request. The proportional allocation of aid among regions would not have changed significantly ( Figure 6 ). Nevertheless, these portions would change with the inclusion in the amended request of a $1 billion Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, nearly $3 billion to fight the Ebola virus, and additional funds to fight IS. Regional and country allocations for these proposed funds have not been specified.", "The House and Senate appropriators did not provide comprehensive information on country and regional allocation in their pending bills. However, the House committee report notably rejected the Administration's proposed cuts to Western Hemisphere countries and increased aid to the region by no less than $120 million above the Administration request to address needs related to the surge of undocumented migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. House appropriators also included funding above the original request to support democracy in the Ukraine and former countries of the Soviet Union. Senate appropriators included an additional $100 million to address the migrant surge.", "P.L. 113-235 and the accompanying report did not provide comprehensive data on regional or country allocations, but did provide some details. Notably, Israel was allocated $3.1 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF); Egypt was allocated $1.3 million from FMF; the report noted that $120 million above the request was provided to implement a migration prevention and response strategy for Central America; and $139.28 million was provided for bilateral assistance to Ukraine.

As in FY2014 and recent years, the top recipient list for FY2015 includes long-standing strategic partners such as Israel, Egypt, and Jordan; frontline states in the war against terrorism, such as Pakistan; and global health focus countries. One notable change under the original request was the ranking of Iraq, which had been a top recipient since the 2003 U.S. invasion, but fell just under the top 15 in FY2015 with the requested allocation of $309 million. However, the request was made before the security situation in Iraq deteriorated in the midst of an IS insurgency, and a large portion of the additional funds requested and enacted for activities to fight IS would likely support activities in Iraq.
