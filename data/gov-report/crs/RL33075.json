Ritaappears to have done most of its damage to energy infrastructure off-shore in contrast to Katrinawhich devastated large swaths of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This report examines theimpact of these hurricanes on three important factors affecting the U.S. agricultural sector: marketinginfrastructure based on the Mississippi River waterway and Gulf ports; production losses for majorcrop and livestock producers in the affected region; and potential consequences for agriculturalproduction as a result of high energy costs. It also discusses the federal government response toagricultural concerns.", "Agricultural producers from the states directly impacted by Katrina have suffered economiclosses, although this varies greatly by crop and locality. Preliminary estimates by USDA is thatHurricane Katrina contributed to $882 million in total crop, livestock, and aquaculture losses. Thoseactivities most affected were aquaculture ($151 million), sugar cane ($50 million), and cotton ($40million). The damage estimate does not include losses in timber and nursery and greenhouseproducts. No preliminary estimate has been released by USDA concerning agricultural damage fromHurricane Rita.", "Hurricane Katrina temporarily halted the flow of agricultural trade through New Orleans --a major gateway for U.S. oil imports and agricultural exports -- causing commodity prices to declinein interior markets along the Mississippi River waterway. Although partial recovery of marketinginfrastructure occurred soon following Katrina's passage (with a brief shutdown in late Septemberdue to Hurricane Rita), substantial congestion and high costs continue to plague the MississippiRiver grain transport network. This traffic bottleneck and its depressive effect on farm commodityprices could persist into the spring of 2006.", "Energy prices jumped substantially in early September 2005, as a significant portion of U.S.petroleum and natural gas production, import, and refining facilities were damaged and shut down. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the permanency of energy price rises and theirpotential impact on the U.S. economy in general, and U.S. agriculture in particular. By raising theoverall price structure of production agriculture, sustained high energy prices could result insignificantly lower farm and rural incomes in 2006.", "Certain ongoing federal programs, primarily crop insurance and disaster loans, are availableto eligible producers.

Fortunately, Hurricane Rita dissipated in intensity prior to landfall and dealtonly a glancing blow to most Gulf coast transport infrastructure. As a result, MississippiRiver-based agricultural transportation has again resumed its post-Katrina recovery; however, graintraffic flows are still well below last year's pace.

Price changes atany point along the chain can result in shifts to alternate transport modes or routes as grain marketerssearch for the lowest-cost method of moving grain between buyer and seller.", "A hurricane such as Katrina or any similar weather or catastrophic event that dramaticallyslows or severely limits barge traffic will usually have the effect of raising barge freight rates as thedemand for barge services exceeds their supply. Higher barge freight rates for corn and soybeanswill in turn shift these commodities to alternate uses (feed, food, industrial, or storage), to alternatetransport modes (rail or truck), or to alternate trade routes (e.g., to the Atlantic via the St. LawrenceSeaway, or overland to Canada, Mexico, or alternate ports along the Gulf coast or as far away as thePacific Northwest). The degree of shifting depends, in part, on the perceived permanency of theprice change. Because truck and rail are significantly more costly than barge transport, shifting bulkcommodities to truck- or rail-based routes can substantially raise the cost of moving grain.", "Hurricane Damage to Barge Transportation. When Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf coast region, an estimated 400 barges (out of over 11,000barges that ply the Mississippi River) were destroyed or damaged, and a substantial number of bargesand vessels in the area surrounding New Orleans were displaced. Although this physical damagewas costly, it is not the major factor limiting the quick reprise of barge transportation.

Waterwaysand rail lines are backed up and congested with barges and trains arriving to deliver their goods toboats that are berthed in port slots awaiting delivery for goods other than those being delivered.", "In addition to an \"out-of-sync\" transportation network, approximately 140 barges containinghurricane-damaged corn (primarily water damage) were left in the New Orleans region. Thesebarges needed to be off-loaded and the barges moved back up-river to elevators eagerly awaitingbarge transport to ship their grain down river. However, because of the water damage, the corn wasno longer acceptable for contract delivery and could not be off-loaded at any of the export-servicinggrain elevators in the New Orleans vicinity.

The problemhas been made more acute by the approaching harvest when producers will likely need all of theiron-farm storage capacity to store their new crop harvests. As a result, many producers have beenlooking to sell the remaining supplies from last year's harvest to clear space.", "It is expected that this situation will be remedied and elevator bids will strengthen whenbarge traffic returns to more normal levels. However, USDA officials have expressed concern thatthe price decline resulting from the temporary delay in the Mississippi barge-based export flow ofagricultural products could persist for at least three months and possibly into the spring dependingon several factors including how quickly barge traffic resumes; how early the winter freeze andshut-down of the upper Mississippi River occurs; and whether the low water levels of the Missouriand Upper Mississippi Rivers are replenished by rainfall.", "Harvest-time Concerns. Harvest time generallysignals the busiest period of export movement for agricultural products for several reasons. First,supplies are generally most abundant at harvest time and can often exceed on-farm or local storagecapacity. As a result, both producers and marketers are eager to move surplus production throughthe marketing channels. Second, the more northerly inland waterways -- the Upper Mississippi Riverwaterway and the St. Lawrence Seaway -- shut down during the winter months due to freezingconditions. This limits export opportunities and increases the urgency for moving excess productioninto marketing channels ahead of the winter.

USDA reportsthat the greatest agricultural losses caused by Katrina, in terms of value of production, were toaquaculture ($151 million), sugarcane ($50 million), and cotton ($40 million). Other crops such assoybeans and rice were also prone to some wind damage. The $882 million loss estimate does notinclude Gulf state losses of timber (which USDA says could be in the billions of dollars dependingon its salvage value -- see the following section for more details), or losses of nursery andgreenhouse products and facilities in Florida, for which a Florida trade association projects $370million in structural damage and plant losses.

Some analysts report that much of the crop that was downed by the storm wasnot destroyed and can still be harvested. USDA estimates that Louisiana's sugarcane production willbe 9% below pre-hurricane estimates, which translates into an estimated processed value loss of $50million. Katrina also caused two Louisiana sugar refineries to temporarily halt operations, whichexacerbated what was already a tight supply of sugar. In response, USDA increased available sugarsupplies by increasing the quantity of domestic sugar that may enter the market under the sugar pricesupport program. (19) ", "According to USDA, the largest cotton production areas (east and west of the storm track)were spared significant crop losses. Mississippi and Alabama, which account for 10% and 3% ofexpected U.S. cotton production, respectively, experienced some damage. Cotton production isestimated by USDA to be down 2.4% in Alabama and 4.3% in Mississippi following HurricaneKatrina. Total cotton losses in the Gulf region are expected to be about $40 million. Some of thedamage to the crop might be quality losses rather than production losses. Similarly, minor rice losseswere experienced, since the storm track was east of the major rice growing areas and most of theLouisiana rice acreage already had been harvested before Katrina struck. ", "The corn and soybean crops were also affected by the hurricane, but the region normally accounts for less than 3% of national production of these two crops. The most serious market effectsattributable to corn and soybeans are more transportation related (as discussed above). Accordingto USDA, estimated regional losses are $14 million for corn and $17 million for soybeans. ", "Industry analysts also report that the Gulf region's dairy industry experienced production andprocessing losses. USDA reports that 60,000 dairy cows were located in counties that experiencedhurricane-strength winds. Some of these cows were lost, but no estimates are available. The region'sdairy industry was hampered by the loss of production caused by power outages in milking facilities,and the inability to transport milk because of damaged roads and bridges, as well as the loss ofrefrigeration and metropolitan retail dairy markets. Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi combinedaccount for less than 1% of U.S. milk production; hence, market effects are expected to be limitedto the region.

Poultry is a significant enterprise in the region: Alabama and Mississippirank third and fifth, respectively, among all states in broiler production. Most of the broiler losseswere concentrated in Mississippi where facilities were either damaged or without power for anextended period. According to USDA, an estimated 6 million chickens were killed and 2,400poultry barns were damaged in Mississippi alone, and another 200,000 chickens were lost inAlabama. The broiler losses are valued by USDA at approximately $15 million. Some analystsestimate that large area broiler losses could cause an increase in market broiler prices in the shortterm (1-2 months).

Longer-term impacts are less clear. Rebuilding will increase the demand for additional woodproducts, although demand depends greatly on interest rates. The dead and damaged trees mightprovide a significant boost to wood product supplies, as salvage and mill operations convert the treesto usable products. However, salvage operations are hampered by the increasingly fragmentedownership of forest land and by rising fuel costs, and some mills may have been damaged by thehurricane.

Natural gasaccounts for a substantial portion (75% to 90%) of nitrogen fertilizer production costs, either directlyas a feedstock or indirectly as a fuel to generate the electricity needed in production. Because U.S.fertilizer manufacturers are at a competitive disadvantage with foreign producers when U.S. naturalgas prices rise, the high prices of recent years have contributed to a substantial reduction in its U.S.nitrogen fertilizer production capacity -- over a 25% decline since 1999.

Once unloaded, the barges can return to duty moving new-crop commodities. Second,USDA was providing incentives for alternative grain storage. (30) Under this activity, theCCC would provide special, one-time assistance to operators to help with the costs associated withstoring corn and wheat in alternative storage facilities. Up to 50 million bushels of corn or wheatcould be eligible for this activity. Third, USDA was encouraging alternative shipping patternsthrough regions other than the central Gulf by providing for a transportation differential incentiveon the movement of up to 200,000 metric tons of corn, wheat or soybeans. Fourth, for thoseproducers with farm-stored commodities under loan to USDA whose loans mature at the end ofSeptember and October and who would otherwise forfeit those commodities to USDA, USDA wouldallow such producers to buy back the grain at the posted county price.

However, much of that coverageis at the catastrophic level, which provides an indemnity payment only on losses in excess of 50%of normal production. For example, 90 to 95 percent of the cotton acreage in the three Gulf statesis enrolled in the federal crop insurance program. However, in Louisiana and Mississippi, just overone-half of that acreage is enrolled only at the catastrophic level.
