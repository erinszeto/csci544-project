CBO estimates that the national unemployment rate will not recede to the 5% level until 2014.

By running short-run deficits, governments can avoid raising taxes during economic downturns, helping households to smooth consumption over time. Running deficits can stimulate aggregate demand in the economy, giving policy makers a valuable fiscal policy tool that can help support macroeconomic stability. Long-run deficits allow transfers of economic resources from younger to older generations, enabling older generations to enjoy anticipated benefits of future economic growth, but also may be used to impose large burdens on future generations.", "Deficits can seriously harm national economies. Governments can spend more than they collect in revenues by printing money, which can cause inflation, or by borrowing. In the short run, fiscal overstimulation leads to inflation. In the long term, deficits either reduce capital investment, which retards economic growth, or increase foreign borrowing, which swells the share of national income going abroad.

In particular, changes in the expected path of the U.S. economy would affect future revisions of CBO baseline estimates of federal outlays and revenues.

Estimates for the fourth quarter of 2009, which put annualized GDP growth at 5.0%, seemed to signal an end of the economic recession.

According to Commerce Department estimates, the economy grew at an annualized real rate of 3.7% in the first quarter of 2010 and only 1.6% in the second quarter. Given that in past years population growth has been about 1% per year, higher rates of economic growth would be necessary to reduce unemployment and raise living standards significantly.

Unemployment rates have remained at high levels, with the national unemployment rate standing at 9.5% in July 2010. Unemployment rates are typically a lagging indicator, meaning that unemployment rates during recessions have stayed high even as other indicators of economic activity have showed signs of recovery. CBO estimates that the national unemployment rate will not recede to the 5% level until 2014.", "Many economic forecasters remain concerned about the medium-term strength of the economy for several reasons. State and local governments still face daunting fiscal problems, and many have exhausted rainy-day funds that cushioned them at the beginning of the recession. Interest-sensitive industries such as housing construction and automobile manufacturing that have helped spark past economic recoveries are considered unlikely to help economic recovery much in the near future. Many households are carrying high debt loads relative to historical levels and have suffered significant capital losses in housing and other investment, which may dampen private consumption for some time. Foreclosure rates are expected to continue at high levels, and concerns about the commercial real estate sector lead some to worry about the solvency of banks with substantial exposure to that sector. Finally, the financial services sector may face continuing challenges in coming years. For these reasons, many economists expect recovery from this recession to be more gradual than the economic rebound after shallower recessions in the past two decades.

The economy is starting to recover from a painful recession that differs from recent downturns in important ways. The economy could emerge from the recession transformed in ways that may take time to understand fully. Continuing turmoil in financial markets makes forecasting interest rates, which affect the costs of many federal programs and debt servicing, difficult. Forecasting economic recoveries, even for milder downturns, is difficult. The Obama Administration has proposed major program initiatives in many policy areas. Estimating the budgetary effects of major changes is more difficult than estimating effects of incremental changes.

Small changes in economic conditions, such as GDP growth, can produce large changes in the budget estimates.

Most forecasters, as far as possible, strive to make projections that are both unbiased and accurate.", "Presidential budget requests in recent years have included measures that can be used to assess the accuracy and statistical bias of previous forecasts. Forecasts diverge from actual results because of legislative changes, unforeseen economic factors, and other factors. Current-law baseline projections will diverge from actual results when laws change, either expanding, constricting, or eliminating current programs, or by creating new programs. Projections that presume a president's policy proposals are enacted diverge from actual results if those policies are not enacted as proposed. ", "Since FY1982, OMB February deficit projections for the upcoming budget year underestimated the total deficit by $55 billion. Changes in legislation accounted for most of that divergence. The standard deviation of Administration budget year deficit/surplus estimates was $233 billion for the same period FY1982-FY2009. A standard deviation measures the average size of forecast errors. The standard deviation for the corresponding four-years-ahead forecast was $343 billion. The accuracy of forecasts generally declines as the forecast window extends to later years because more policy and economic changes can occur in the interim.", "OMB used its standard deviation estimate to compute upper and lower bounds for deficit projections. In the FY2011 budget submission, OMB estimated the FY2015 federal deficit would be 3.9% of GDP, with an upper bound of 10.4% of GDP and a lower bound of a 2.6% surplus. If the statistical assumptions underlying that calculation were valid, the actual FY2015 deficit should fall within the upper and lower bounds with a 90% probability. The spread between the upper and lower bounds indicates the estimated precision of the five-years-ahead deficit forecast."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
