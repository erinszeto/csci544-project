This case law has not, however, considered CRP payments received by individuals who were not previously engaged in farming and who have purchased property and immediately enrolled it in the CRP (or agreed to continue the enrollment begun by the previous owner/operator). Neither have courts considered CRP payments to those who hire third parties to perform activities required by the CRP contract.", "The possibility that the payments may not constitute self-employment income even if they do not qualify as excludible rent has not been considered by either the courts or the IRS.

The payments were treated by the IRS as rental income when received by non-farmers.", "Over the years, the IRS has expanded its position regarding CRP payments and self-employment taxes.

The taxpayers had reported the CRP payments on Schedule F and, after deducting expenses, claimed a loss from farming.

The CRP statute and regulations repeatedly and consistently refer to the annual payments as rent or rentals.\" The court noted that \"rent\" generally referred to compensation for either the occupancy or use of land. The CRP contract placed restrictions on the taxpayer's use of the land, which the court apparently viewed as another sort of use. The court found that the primary purpose of the CRP contract was to achieve environmental benefits by restricting usage and that the services required from the taxpayer \"were not substantial and were incidental to the primary purpose of the contract.\" Therefore, the payments qualified as rent that was excludible from self-employment income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Court of Appeals Reverses Wuebker", "paragraphs": ["The court of appeals did not agree.

The IRS had argued that the nature of the payments rather than the label placed on them should lead to a conclusion that they were not excludible rent and the court agreed.

Although in 1997, the taxpayer's material participation in the farm operations was cited in IRS publications as determining whether the CRP payments were subject to self-employment tax, the IRS seems to now take the position that material participation in providing required services under the CRP is irrelevant in determining whether the payments are subject to self-employment tax. In 2006, the IRS proposed a revenue ruling that indicates an intent to treat CRP payments as self-employment income even if the participant's only \"farming activity\" was being a participant in the Conservation Reserve Program, even if the participant hired a third party to perform all required activities.", "A 2003 Chief Counsel Advice (CCA) came to conclusions about CRP payments and self-employment tax that are similar to those in the proposed revenue ruling, though they do not extend to include payments received by those who do not materially participate. The CCA relied on two revenue rulings and an announcement to support its position that CRP payments are includible in self-employment income whether or not the recipient was otherwise engaged in the trade or business of farming. Each of the cited sources was released before the inception of the Conservation Reserve Program. They each addressed payments received under a different government program. The two revenue rulings are discussed later in this report.

The first two questions address estate tax issues, and in doing so, the answer to the first states that participation in the \"program will be treated as material participation in the operation of a farm with respect to the diverted acres.\" The third question addresses self-employment tax. The answer states, \"A farmer who receives cash or payment in kind from the Department of Agriculture for participation in a land diversion program is liable for self-employment tax on the cash or payment in kind received.\"", "Generally, IRS Announcements carry very little authority. They are not published in the Cumulative Bulletin (CB), but appear only in the weekly Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB).

The announcement predates the CRP statute, but was not used as a basis for the IRS's position on CRP payments until the 2003 CCA. Additionally, although the announcement is compatible with the IRS's early treatment of CRP payments, it does not clearly support the position that all who receive CRP payments are subject to self-employment tax on the payments. Instead, it refers to \"[a] farmer who receives [payments].\"", "The CCA admitted that there are hazards of litigation in asserting that receipt of CRP payments denotes operation of a trade or business. The facts of an individual case could lead a court to determine that the taxpayer was not engaged in a trade or business. Hazards exist both when the required activities under the CRP contract are minimal as well as when the participants were not farmers before enrolling land in the CRP. The IRS acknowledged that \"[t]here is no case law or guidance that has held that an individual is considered to have entered into the trade or business of farming by merely entering into a CRP contract....\" There is case law that holds that a factual determination is required in every case to determine whether a taxpayer is engaged in a trade or business.

The new revenue ruling proposed by the IRS refers to these services saying that the circuit court \"noted that the taxpayers were required under the CRP contract to perform tasks intrinsic to the farming trade or business (e.g. tilling, seeding, fertilizing, and weed control) that required the use of their farming equipment.\" If it is pertinent that the tasks involved are intrinsic to the farming trade and pertinent that the equipment used is also used in the farming trade, could it also follow that an owner of residential property that is rented out might have to include the rent as part of income from self-employment if that owner were a plumber, electrician, or carpenter and provided routine maintenance that involved tasks intrinsic to the owner's trade, particularly if using the same equipment used in that trade? If not, why are the tasks or equipment pertinent in determining that CRP payments are income from self-employment?", "A further consideration is the extent to which the annual rental payments actually include payment for services. The Farm Service Agency (FSA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), establishes a maximum rental rate for each offer. Participants may offer their land for enrollment at that rate or at a lower rate. The FSA website states that it \"bases rental rates on the relative productivity of the soils within each county and the average dry land cash rent or cash-rent equivalent.\" The average annual rental for all CRP land in February 2008 was $50.63 per acre; however, allowed rental rates ranged from $44.16 per acre to $125.44 per acre. CRP annual payments vary depending upon the type of land and the location of that land, not on services provided. The payments do not exceed the fair market rental for the land.

The doctrine is one that is generally used when the taxpayer was able to influence the form of a transaction, choosing one with favorable tax consequences rather than another with less favorable ones even though that form might better reflect the real substance of the transaction. In the case of CRP payments, participants have no influence over the form of the transaction. Instead it is the government that chose the form of the transaction.

Termination may occur if the participant violates a term or condition of the contract. Termination also occurs if owner/operators transfer their rights and interests in the contracted land unless the transferee agrees to assume the contract.

In this situation, a taxpayer may be allowed to deduct the amount repaid in the year it is repaid. If the amount is over $3,000, the IRC allows taxpayers to compare the income tax savings from the deduction to the income tax savings that would have occurred had the amount not been included in income in the year it was received, and recoup the larger tax savings.

If the participant's net income from farming is equal to or greater than the amount repaid, it appears that the self-employment tax might be reduced in the repayment year to the same degree that it was increased in the years in which the CRP payments were included in income. If, however, the participant had no self-employment income other than the CRP payments, the self-employment tax for the year of repayment would be zero, but this would not recapture self-employment tax paid in earlier years. Thus, though some participants who must repay CRP annual payments may be able to recoup some or all of the self-employment taxes paid in previous years, such recoupment is not certain for all participants.", "Amending prior years' tax returns to remove the CRP payments does not provide a way to recoup either income or self-employment tax.

As such, the payments cannot be removed from income for the tax year in which they were received, even if they are later repaid.", "The requirement to repay all CRP payments that were received raises at least two issues. First is the equitable issue regarding imposing self-employment tax on the annual payments but providing no sure means for that self-employment tax to be recouped if the money must be returned.

Further, it would eliminate any arguable need to examine whether the participant was engaged in the trade or business of farming.

If Congress now chooses to examine the possibility of explicitly excluding some or all CRP payments from self-employment income, it may want to look at the services required under the CRP contracts and conservation plans.

Of course, Congress could decide to exclude the CRP payments from self-employment income in all years even if the services required in the first year were disproportionate to the services required in later years. Similarly, if Congress determined that some types of land or conservation plans required more ongoing services, it could designate that all CRP payments for those lands or plans would be includible in self-employment income.
