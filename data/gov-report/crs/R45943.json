USDA energy programs incentivize research, development, and adoption of renewable energy projects, including solar, wind, and anaerobic digesters. However, the primary focus of USDA energy programs has been to promote U.S. biofuels production and use\u00e2\u0080\u0094including corn starch-based ethanol (the predominant biofuel produced and consumed in the United States), cellulosic biofuels, and soybean-based biodiesel. The USDA energy programs via the farm bill are separate from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and tax incentives contained in separate energy and tax legislation.", "Four farm bills have contained an energy title: 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2018. For all four farm bills, the majority of the energy programs expire and lack baseline funding. Many of the energy title programs are authorized to receive both mandatory and discretionary funding. Historically, mandatory funding has been the primary support for these programs, as appropriators have not provided funding for most of the discretionary authorizations. The programs that have received discretionary authorizations under the 2018 farm bill are the Rural Energy for America Program, the Rural Energy Savings Program, and the Sun Grant Program.", "The 2018 farm bill extended most of the energy provisions of the 2014 farm bill with new funding authority. There are two exceptions, as the 2018 farm bill repealed both the Repowering Assistance Program and the Rural Energy Self-Sufficiency Initiative. Additionally, the 2018 farm bill established one new program\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Carbon Utilization and Biogas Education Program.", "The 2018 farm bill contains initiatives that address noncorn feedstocks (e.g., cellulosic feedstocks). The most important programs to this end are the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, which pays producers for production of eligible advanced biofuels; the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program (formerly the Biorefinery Assistance Program), which assists in the development of new and emerging technologies for advanced biofuels; and the Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP), which has funded a variety of biofuels-related projects.", "Over the five-year reauthorization period (FY2019-FY2023), the 2018 farm bill contains a total of $375 million in new mandatory funding and authorizes discretionary funding (i.e., subject to annual appropriations) of $1.7 billion for the various farm bill energy programs. This discretionary total includes discretionary authorizations for the Sun Grant Program and the Rural Energy Savings Program. The mandatory funding provided for the energy programs under the 2018 farm bill is approximately 46% less than what was provided in the 2014 farm bill, which had authorized $694 million in mandatory funding over the five-year period of FY2014-FY2018. Conversely, the 2018 farm bill provides discretionary authorizations that are approximately 13% more than what was provided in the 2014 farm bill ($1.5 billion) for the energy programs (although, as noted above, farm bill energy programs generally have not received discretionary appropriations).", "At issue for Congress is oversight of the energy programs and the future of annual funding for these programs. This report provides an overview and funding summary of the various energy titles contained in the farm bills from 2002 to the present, and provides a description of the 2018 farm bill energy programs including their funding levels, program implementation status, and any changes made to the programs by the 2018 farm bill."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview and History", "paragraphs": ["Agriculture-based renewable energy can take several forms, including biofuels such as corn-based ethanol or soy-based biodiesel, wind-driven turbines located on farmland or in rural areas, anaerobic digesters that convert animal waste into methane and electric power, or biomass harvested for burning as a processing fuel or to generate heat as part of an industrial activity. ", "Since the late 1970s, U.S. policymakers at both the federal and state levels have adopted a variety of incentives, regulations, and programs to encourage the production and use of agriculture-based renewable energy (mostly biofuels). Over the years, the two most widely used biofuels\u00e2\u0080\u0094ethanol produced primarily from corn starch and biodiesel produced primarily from soybean oil\u00e2\u0080\u0094have received significant federal support in the form of tax incentives, loans and grants, and regulatory programs. Many of these support programs originate in legislation outside of the farm bill. For instance, the Energy Tax Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-618 ) provided an exemption for ethanol from the excise tax on motor fuels. By executive order the Bioenergy Program was established in 1999 and in FY2001 began making payments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to eligible producers of ethanol and biodiesel based on year-to-year production increases in these fuels. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-224 ) directed USDA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to cooperate and coordinate research and development activities for biobased industrial products, including biofuels. The 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) authorized several new biofuel programs and added an energy title, Title IX. The 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) subsequently extended and expanded the programs promoting renewable energy, emphasizing particularly those utilizing biomass feedstock. The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) extended the programs through FY2018. The 2018 farm bill, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-334 ), continues federal support for the programs through FY2023. Motivations cited for these legislative initiatives include energy security concerns, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and raising domestic demand for U.S.-produced farm products.", "Congress has enacted temporary tax incentives for biofuels, specifically tax credits for biodiesel and second generation (formerly cellulosic) biofuel and a tax credit for small producers. Some of these temporary tax incentives have been extended numerous times. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123 ) retroactively extended the tax incentive for biodiesel and renewable diesel of $1.00/gallon through the end of 2017. In addition to these types of tax incentives, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates a minimum level of renewable fuel usage.", "Historically, there has been a revenue cost associated with tax incentives for ethanol and biofuels. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) provided a tax credit of $0.45/gallon before it expired at the end of 2011. From FY1980 through FY2013, excise tax credits and incentives for ethanol reduced federal tax revenue by a cumulative estimated total of $46.9 billion. In FY2011, the fiscal year immediately preceding the VEETC's expiration, its cost was an estimated $6.5 billion. Excise tax incentives for biodiesel producers have reduced federal excise tax revenue by an estimated $17.3 billion between FY2008 and FY2018. In FY2018, excise tax receipts were reduced by $3.4 billion due to biodiesel producer credits (the reduction in FY2018 excise tax receipts is associated with tax credit claims made for biodiesel production in calendar year 2017). ", "Title IX of the 2018 farm bill continues long-standing congressional support for the production of renewable energy from agriculturally sourced materials. This report focuses on those policies contained in the 2018 farm bill that support agriculture-based renewable energy. The introductory sections of this report briefly describe how USDA bioenergy policies evolved and how they fit into the larger context of U.S. biofuels policy. Then, each of the bioenergy provisions of the 2018 farm bill are defined in terms of their function, goals, administration, funding, and implementation status. ", "In an appendix at the end of this report, Table A-1 presents data on 2018 farm bill budgetary authority for energy provisions, while Table A-2 , Table A-3 , and Table A-4 present the original budget authority for Title IX programs under the previous 2014 farm bill, the 2008 farm bill, and the 2002 farm bill, respectively.

As a result, many of the federal programs that support renewable energy production in general, and agriculture-based energy production in particular, are outside the purview of USDA and have origins outside of omnibus farm bill legislation. For example, the three principal federal biofuels policies of the past decade were all established outside of farm bills: ", "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates an increasing volume of biofuels use and has its origins in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ). The RFS was expanded in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-140 ) and divided into four distinct, but nested biofuel categories\u00e2\u0080\u0094total, advanced, cellulosic, and biodiesel\u00e2\u0080\u0094each with its own mandated volume. The VEETC, originally established in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ), provided a tax credit that varied in value over the years. It was $0.45 per gallon of pure ethanol blended with gasoline when it expired on December 31, 2011. The ethanol import tariff was intended to offset the ethanol tax incentives and was originally established by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-499 ). The ethanol import tariff also expired on December 31, 2011. ", "In addition to the RFS, VEETC, and the ethanol import tariff, several other tax credits that originated outside of farm bills were available for biodiesel production as well as for small producers (less than 60 million gallons per year per plant) of ethanol and biodiesel. A substantial number of federal programs also support renewable energy sources other than biofuels. In addition to federal programs, many states offer additional support to biofuels producers, blenders, and consumers. ", "An awareness of the non-USDA federal programs is important for appreciating the role envisioned for the energy title of both the 2018 farm bill and previous farm bills. The farm bill programs were designed to provide incentives for the research and development of new agriculture-based renewable fuels, especially second-generation biofuels (those based on non-food crop biomass such as cellulose and algae), and to expand their distribution and use. A summary of the evolution of these programs follows.

The energy title authorized grants, loans, and loan guarantees to foster research on agriculture-based renewable energy, to share development risk and to promote the adoption of renewable energy systems. Since enactment of the 2002 farm bill, interest in renewable energy has grown rapidly, due in large part to periods of steep increases in domestic and international petroleum prices and a dramatic acceleration in domestic biofuels production (primarily corn-based ethanol). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2008 Farm Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0094Refocus on Non-Corn-Based Biofuels", "paragraphs": ["Annual U.S. ethanol production expanded rapidly between 2002 and 2007, rising from approximately 2 billion gallons to over 6.5 billion gallons during that period. Similarly, corn use for ethanol grew from an 11% share of the U.S. corn crop in 2002 to an estimated 23% share of the 2007 corn crop. During the 2008 farm bill debate, government and industry projections had ethanol's corn-use share rising rapidly, sparking concerns about unintended consequences of the policy-driven expansion of U.S. corn ethanol production. Dedicating an increasing share of the U.S. corn harvest to ethanol production evoked fears of higher prices for all grains and oilseeds that compete for the same land, which could lead to higher livestock feed costs, higher food prices, and lower U.S. agricultural exports. In addition, several environmental concerns emerged regarding water impacts, and the expansion of corn production onto nontraditional lands, including native grass and prairie land, among other things. In response, policymakers sought to refocus biofuels policy initiatives in the 2008 farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; P.L. 110-246 ) in favor of non-corn starch feedstock, especially cellulosic-based feedstock, by introducing a number of programs aimed at facilitating the production and use of bioenergy from nonfood feedstock. ", "The 2008 farm bill became law six months after the enactment of the EISA. A key component of EISA was a significant expansion of the RFS, which in part mandates the increasing use of \"advanced biofuels\" (i.e., non-corn starch biofuels), whose minimum use was scheduled to increase from zero gallons in 2008 to 21 billion gallons by 2022. The energy provisions of the 2008 farm bill were intended to reinforce EISA's program goals via a further refocusing of federal incentives toward non-corn-based sources of renewable energy.
