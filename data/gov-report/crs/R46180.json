The 2019 average national PPL payment rate for all crops was $224.04 per acre. Payment rates varied by crop and ranged from a low of $50 per acre for millet to a high of $1,432 per acre for dark air cured tobacco.", "The unusually wet spring conditions that produced the record PPL acres in 2019 were heavily concentrated in Corn Belt states but were also reported in significant numbers in Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee, New York, and Oklahoma. However, South Dakota's 3.9 million acres of PPL were more than double second-place Ohio's 1.4 million of PPL acres. South Dakota's PPL acres accounted for over 20% of the national total in 2019, while its PPL indemnity payments of over $925 million accounted for 21.9% of national PPL indemnity payments. During the previous 19-year period from 2000 to 2018, national PPL averaged 4.1 million acres annually with average indemnities of $680 million per year. Of these national totals, South Dakota accounted for an average of 10% of PPL acres (406 million acres) and 11.2% of PPL indemnities ($76.4 million).", "Farmers that were unable to plant a crop during the spring of 2019 due to natural causes were potentially eligible for multiple payments under federal farm programs. First, federal crop insurance provides PPL coverage under a standard policy that covers pre-planting cost and potential revenue loss. Second, the FY2019 supplemental authorized disaster assistance payments for PPL (referred to as \"top up\") in addition to crop insurance indemnities. Third, the Administration's 2019 MFP payments, although based on planted acres, also included payments for eligible cover crops planted on PPL acres.", "In addition to the unplanted acres, a sizeable portion of the U.S. corn and soybean crops was planted later than usual. Such late planting meant that initial crop development would be behind normal across much of the major growing regions and that eventual yields would depend on beneficial weather extending late into the fall to achieve full crop maturity. Widespread wet conditions continued into the fall, especially in the northern plains and western Corn Belt. Ultimately, much of the corn crop was harvested under wet conditions with high moisture content that required drying. Due to the high costs of propane for drying, many farmers chose to leave their corn in the field until more beneficial market conditions emerged. As of December 16, 2019, USDA estimated that 8% (or 7.2 million acres) of the U.S. corn crop had yet to be harvested, adding further to the uncertainty of yields and harvested acreage for the 2019 corn crop.", "Saturated soil conditions heading into the winter months suggests a continuation of wet conditions into the 2020 planting season and the potential for a repeat of planting difficulties in the year ahead. Should wet conditions persist in 2020 and create a situation where farmers are again confronted with delayed or prevented planting, many producers may also bump up against a limit on the continued use of crop insurance PPL.

Together, they account for 54% of land planted to major field crops since 2010. They are critical inputs for several sectors, including the livestock, biofuels, food processing, and export sectors. As a result, any delay or reduction from expected output for either of these crops can have important implications for market prices and the broader U.S. farm economy.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasted an increased role of federal support for farm incomes in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094including $22.4 billion in direct support payments and $10.3 billion in federal crop insurance indemnity payments. Together, the forecast of USDA farm support plus crop insurance indemnities of $32.7 billion represents a 35.3% share of U.S. net farm income $92.5 billion. Since 2010, the federal crop insurance program has emerged as the largest component of the farm safety net in terms of taxpayer outlays, averaging $7.8 billion annually in premium subsidies. While USDA implements the federal crop insurance program, Congress is responsible for authorizing and funding it. The federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-365 ), as amended (7 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a71501 et seq. ) and receives mandatory funding.

Traditionally, 96% of the U.S. corn crop is planted by June 2, but in 2019 by that date 67% of the crop had been planted ( Figure 1 ). Similarly, the U.S. soybean crop was planted with substantial delays.

In addition, maximizing yield potential will likely depend on beneficial weather extending into the fall to achieve full crop maturity. This would potentially make crop growth vulnerable to an early freeze in the fall that would terminate further yield growth. ", "Also, planting delays increase the complexity of producer decisionmaking. When the planting occurs after a crop insurance policy's \"final planting date\" (FPD), the \"late planting period\" clause in the policy comes into play, and insurance coverage starts to decline with each successive day of delay ( Figure 3 ). ", "Insured acres planted on or before the FPD receive the full yield or revenue coverage that was purchased. However, if the crop is planted after the FPD, insurance coverage is reduced by 1% per day throughout the late-planting period (which begins the day after the FPD and extends for 25 days for both corn and soybeans). During the late-planting period, producers must decide whether to opt for a PPL indemnity payment or try to plant the crop under reduced insurance coverage with a heightened risk of reduced yields.", "Despite the risks associated with this choice, large portions of both the corn and soybean crops were planted after the FPD ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). The choice of planting versus not planting was complicated in 2019 by Secretary of Agriculture Perdue's announcement on May 23 that only producers with planted acres would be eligible for \"trade damage\" assistance payments in 2019 under the Market Facilitation Program (MFP). The Secretary's announcement, which came in the middle of the planting period, could have encouraged greater planting than would have otherwise occurred as farmers sought to ensure eligibility for the 2019 MFP payment.", "During 2018, U.S. soybean and corn producers had received MFP payments based on their farms' harvested output, including $1.65 per bushel for soybean and $0.01 per bushel for corn. For 2019, the Secretary of Agriculture was offering higher payment rates of $2.05 per bushel for soybeans and $0.14 for corn. However, the MFP payment formula would use planted acres\u00e2\u0080\u0094not harvested production\u00e2\u0080\u0094and combine the commodity-specific payment rates of major program crops (referred to as \"non-specialty crops\") at the county level (weighted by historical county planted acres and yields) to derive a single county-level MFP payment rate. The potential for 2019 MFP payments could have provided sufficient incentive for some producers to plant their corn and soybean crops under conditions they would not have otherwise (e.g., to plant their crops in wet fields where potential yield-reducing problems associated with seed germination and soil compaction are increased). If such planting did occur, it likely prevented even larger PPL acres from being reported.", "Additionally, overarching uncertainty remained in 2019 associated with the then-ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China. The dispute had reduced U.S. agricultural exports in 2018 and dampened prospects for both commodity prices and export volumes in 2019. These factors further complicated producers' evaluations of market payoffs under different planting and crop insurance choices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Record PPL Acres in 2019", "paragraphs": ["The two principal sources for data on PPL acres within USDA\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Risk Management Agency (RMA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide similar but not identical estimates of PPL ( Figure 4 ).

In their analysis of historical PPL indemnity rates, the PPL payment rate was almost always higher for corn than soybeans. In 2019, corn's average PPL payment rate of $270.13 per acre was about $70 per acre (34.7%) higher than soybean's average PPL payment rate ( Table 1 ).
