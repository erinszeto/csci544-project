Shortly thereafter, testing of a cow in Mabton, Washington, indicated the presenceof the BSE agent.

The Texas animal initially had beensampled for BSE in November 2004. Screening tests at that time came back inconclusive (i.e.,possibly positive) for the disease, but follow-up testing failed to confirm it, USDA said inannouncing a negative result. However, at OIG's urging, department scientists re-tested samples inJune 2005, and the results were positive for BSE. In Japan, the regulatory process along withcontinued consumer resistance there delayed the border opening until December, when some U.S.beef imports began to be accepted again.", "In Congress, mounting frustration led to the introduction of several measures aimed atcoercing Japan into moving more quickly to reopen its border.

U.S. beef exportswere expected to arrive there starting in August.

However, several of the animals had been born after Canada's 1997 ban on feedingmammalian protein to ruminants, raising concerns about the effectiveness and enforcement of theban. Critics urged USDA to reconsider its proposed rules (now being reviewed prior to formalpublication in the Federal Register ) to permit the importation of older Canadian cattle and/or otherruminant products.", "Meanwhile, USDA officials announced in July that the Department would soon scale backits massive BSE testing program, reverting to a lower level of ongoing surveillance, afterdetermining that the potential level of the disease in the U.S. cattle herd is very low."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Postscript", "paragraphs": ["At the time of this report, the Administration and many Members of Congress werecontinuing to focus on efforts to reopen more major foreign markets to U.S. beef, most notablyKorea.

Yetsome remain concerned about the disease and its potential threat to public health as well as trade,particularly in the wake of several additional findings of BSE in cattle. The age of several of theCanadian cattle -- that is, they were born after the implementation in 1997 of stronger cattle feedrules to protect against BSE -- has been cited as a worrisome development by some critics of NorthAmerican BSE safeguards.", "However, Canadian, USDA, and industry officials continue to argue that the overall NorthAmerican risk profile is unchanged. They have long warned that several additional BSE-positivecattle might be found, but should be no cause for alarm. These officials have repeatedly attemptedto reassure consumers and foreign buyers that U.S. cattle and beef are safe and pose no risk to animalhealth or to human food safety (although research into the numerous unknown aspects of the diseaseand of the TSE family of diseases, and consideration of additional regulatory safeguards, continues).", "Few observers had expected the trade and economic issues to be resolved quickly. Nonetheless, frustrations continue to mount over the length of time it has taken to regain entry intothe Japanese and Korean markets.
