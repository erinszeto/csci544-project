{"id": "RL32817", "title": "Child Care Issues in the 109th Congress", "released_date": "2007-01-09T00:00:00", "summary": ["Federal support for child care comes in many forms, ranging from grant programs to tax provisions. Some programs serve as specifically dedicated funding sources for child care services (e.g., the Child Care and Development Block Grant, or CCDBG), while for others (e.g., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF), child care is just one of many purposes for which funds may be used. In many cases, federal programs target low-income families in need of child care assistance, but in the case of certain tax provisions, the benefits reach middle- and upper-income families as well. This report provides an overview of federal child care and related programs as they were addressed by the 109 th Congress.", "The 109 th Congress inherited several child care-related agenda items from the previous Congress(es), but resolved only a few. Efforts to reauthorize the CCDBG and TANF block grants, as well as the Head Start program, had started in the 108 th Congress, and ultimately, in February 2006, after 12 temporary extensions, the TANF block grant and the mandatory portion of child care funding was reauthorized for a five-year period via the Deficit Reduction Act ( P.L. 109-171 ). Whereas bills to reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant itself ( H.R. 240 and S. 525 ) and the Head Start Program ( H.R. 2123 and S. 2206 ) failed to make their way to enactment in law, and remain on the agenda for the 110 th Congress.", "Funding for many child care and related programs is provided each year as part of the annual appropriations process for the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education (ED). Fiscal Year 2007 appropriations bills for those departments (among most others) did not receive floor action in the House or Senate during the 109 th Congress, although the 2007 fiscal year began on October 1, 2006. The process extended into the 110 th Congress, with a third continuing resolution ( P.L. 109-383 ) temporarily funding government operations (through February 15, 2007) at rates based on the FY2006 funding levels. The FY2006 appropriations ( P.L. 109-149 ) included funding slightly below FY2005 amounts for most child care and related programs, as a result of an across-the-board rescission of 1% applied to most discretionary programs. Additional targeted funding for Head Start and the Social Services Block Grant\u00e2\u0080\u0094supplemental funding targeted specifically in response to needs arising from the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005\u00e2\u0080\u0094was included in the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-148 ).", "The President's FY2007 budget proposals in areas related to child care and early childhood development were framed in the context of the Administration's Early Childhood Initiative\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"Good Start, Grow Smart\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094which was initially launched in April 2002. The initiative emphasized the importance of promoting school readiness, a key focus of the President's Head Start reauthorization proposals. In efforts to promote school readiness among pre-school children, there has also been a growing emphasis on better coordination of early childhood programs, including most of the federal programs described in this report, as well as state pre-kindergarten programs and other state-funded efforts.", "This is the final update of this report; the 109 th Congress has adjourned."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Final Developments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Third Continuing Resolution Extends Funding into FY2007 (and into the 110th Congress)", "paragraphs": ["The 109 th Congress adjourned with the FY2007 appropriations process still under way.

(See the \" Legislative Activity in the 109 th Congress \" section of this report for more on the unsuccessful reauthorization efforts.) The CCDBG is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and provides formula block grants to states, which use the grants to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under age 13, if the parents are working or in school and family income is less than 85% of the state median. (In practice, many states establish income eligibility levels that are lower than this federal threshold.) Child care services are provided on a sliding fee scale basis, and parents may choose to receive assistance through vouchers or certificates, which can be used with a provider of the parents' choice, including sectarian providers and relatives.", "States receiving CCDBG funds must establish child care licensing standards, although federal law does not dictate what these standards should be or what types of providers must be covered. In addition, states must have health and safety requirements applicable to all providers receiving CCDBG subsidies that address prevention and control of infectious diseases, building and physical premises safety, and health and safety training for care givers. However, federal law does not dictate the specific contents of these requirements.", "The CCDBG is funded through both discretionary and capped entitlement grants (referred to in combination as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)), and state maintenance-of-effort (MOE) and matching requirements apply to part of the entitlement funds. States must use at least 4% of their total funds to improve the quality and availability of child care, and according to statute, must target 70% of entitlement funds on welfare recipients working toward self-sufficiency or families at risk of welfare dependency. However, because all families falling below the 85% of state median income requirement can be categorized as \"at risk,\" the 70% targeting of the welfare or at-risk population does not necessarily mean welfare families must be served. In theory, all funds may be used for low-income, non-welfare, working families. However, state plans indicate that many states guarantee child care to welfare families. No more than 5% of state allotments may be used for state administrative costs.", "The FY2006 Appropriations Act for the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education ( P.L. 109-149 ) included roughly $2.1 billion in discretionary funding for the CCDBG. (An across-the-board rescission of 1% brought the precise total to $2.062 billion.) For FY2005, the Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 108-447 ) provided $2.083 billion. Mandatory (or \"entitlement\") CCDBG funding beginning in FY2003 through FY2005 was provided at the FY2002 rate ($2.717 billion for the year), under a series of funding extensions. Ultimately, funding for a longer, five-year period (FY2006-FY2010) was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, a budget spending reconciliation bill ( S. 1932 ), which was signed into law ( P.L. 109-171 ) on February 8, 2006.

The law maintains the TANF block grant at $16.5 billion for FY2006-2010. Child care is one of many services for which states may use TANF funding. In FY2005, HHS reports that states spent $1.3 billion in federal TANF funds for child care within the TANF program, and $1.92 billion in state TANF and separate state program (SSP) MOE funds. (Of that $1.92 billion in state spending, approximately $858 million could be \"double counted\" as state spending toward the CCDF MOE requirement.) In addition, states may transfer up to 30% of their TANF allotments to the CCDBG (CCDF), to be spent according to the rules of that program (as opposed to TANF rules).

Title XX is a capped entitlement, and state allocations are based on relative population size. It should be noted that although the SSBG has an entitlement ceiling, appropriations may not always abide by it. For example, the ceiling in FY2001 was $1.7 billion; however, Congress appropriated $1.725 billion for that year, despite the ceiling. The FY2006 Appropriations Act for the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education ( P.L. 109-149 ) included identical provisions to the FY2005 appropriations: $1.7 billion for the SSBG and states' authority to transfer up to 10% of their TANF block grants to the SSBG.

In the President's FY2004 budget, he proposed to transfer the Head Start program to the Department of Education, as well as to provide states with the option to administer the program. The Head Start reauthorization bill passed by the House during the 108 th Congress ( H.R. 2210 ) did not include the proposal to transfer the program to ED, but did include provisions to allow a maximum of eight states to administer the program (provided they meet designated requirements). The Head Start reauthorization bills of this (109 th ) Congress ( H.R. 2123 and S. 2206 ) emphasized increased coordination among early childhood programs, but neither proposed either a departmental transfer of the program or state demonstration projects.", "The Administration has moved ahead with two other efforts that are in keeping with the Good Start, Grow Smart initiative, but that did not require legislative changes to the Head Start Act. One is the Strategic Teacher Education Program, also known as Project STEP, described by the Head Start Bureau as \"a comprehensive, multi-faceted, sequential professional development endeavor to ensure teachers use research-based strategies to implement early and emergent literacy.\" As part of this development, during summer and fall 2002, 3,000 Head Start staff and 100 state child care administrators received 32 hours of training in strategies to support children's emerging literacy. Those who were trained are expected to serve as \"mentor coaches\" for staff within their respective Head Start programs.", "The second effort is the development and implementation of a national reporting system that can be used to assess the effectiveness of Head Start programs in achieving successful outcomes for children in terms of school readiness\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly the areas of literacy and number knowledge. This national reporting system was implemented starting in the fall 2003, and assesses Head Start 4- and 5-year-olds twice a year on educational performance measures\u00e2\u0080\u0094using indicators that were included in legislation as part of the 1998 reauthorization of Head Start."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Activity in the 109th Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Child Care and Welfare Reauthorizations20", "paragraphs": ["Both the CCDBG and TANF were due to be reauthorized at the end of FY2002, and on February 8, 2006, following 12 temporary extensions, the Deficit Reduction Act was signed into law ( P.L. 109-171 ), finally reauthorizing TANF and the mandatory portion of child care funding for FY2006-2010.
