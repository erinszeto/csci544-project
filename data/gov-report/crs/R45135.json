The attack prompted utilities across the country to reevaluate and restructure their physical security programs. It also set in motion proceedings in Congress and at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) which resulted in a new mandatory Physical Security Reliability Standard (CIP-014) for bulk power asset owners promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in 2015. In the three years since FERC approved this new standard, security risks to the power grid have become an even greater concern in the electric utility industry. Reflecting these ongoing security concerns, legislative proposals in the 115th Congress include provisions directed at power grid physical security. Congress also continues its oversight of grid security and implementation of NERC's security standards.", "Three entities play key roles in standards oversight and support of implementation for bulk power physical security. NERC and FERC oversee implementation of the CIP-014 standards, while the Department of Energy plays a supporting role in helping bulk power asset owners to protect their critical infrastructure. The detailed findings of NERC's compliance activities are not publicly disclosed due to their confidential nature. However, NERC has stated that the utility industry is making progress towards effective implementation of the CIP-014 standard and NERC has been \"encouraged\" by grid security measures put in place so far. NERC compliance audits as of February 2018 have uncovered no major failures to date.", "In addition to compliance with NERC's standards, there have been other observable changes within the electricity sector reflecting greater emphasis on bulk power physical security. These changes include realignment in corporate structure to support physical security, incorporating physical security in transmission planning, new security products and services, utility capital investment in physical security, and utility participation in voluntary security programs. While public information about such changes is limited, it suggests they may be significant and widespread.", "Although the electric power sector seems to be moving in the overall direction of greater physical security for critical assets, many measures have yet to be implemented and the process of corporate realignment around physical security is still underway. NERC's CIP-014 standards have been promulgated recently, and bulk power asset owners have largely begun enhancing physical security under the standard over the last two years. Therefore, although it is probably accurate to conclude that, based on the objectives of the CIP-014 standards, the U.S. electric grid is more physically secure than it was five years ago, it has not necessarily reached the level of physical security needed based on the sector's own assessments of risk. Bulk power security remains a work in progress.", "Congress continues to be concerned about the current state of electric grid physical security. Among many specific issues of potential interest, Congress may focus on several with policy significance: security implementation oversight, cost recovery, hardening vs. resilience, and the quality of threat information. As CIP-014 implementation and other physical security initiatives proceed, Congress also may seek to maintain its focus on the power sector's overall progress, not only on short term compliance with NERC's security standards, but also on structural changes supporting physical security as a priority far into the future."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Securing the electric power grid is among the highest priorities for critical infrastructure protection in the United States. In the past, power grid facilities have had varying degrees of access control and surveillance depending upon the facility type and location.

More recently, federal agencies, Congress, and the utility industry have focused greater attention on the vulnerability of the power grid, especially the high voltage transmission (bulk power) system, to terrorist attacks which could cause widespread, extended blackouts.", "Until 2013, the emphasis of analysts and policymakers was on power grid cybersecurity\u2014protecting the computer controls and communication systems used to operate the grid. However, a 2013 rifle attack on an electric transmission substation in Metcalf, CA, shifted more attention to the physical security of power grid critical assets. In response to the Metcalf attack, as well as other grid incidents and findings from utility security exercises, Congress passed new legislation to strengthen power grid physical security and to facilitate recovery in the event of a successful attack. Congress also sought stronger physical security standards from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the commission's existing statutory authority to regulate the reliability of the bulk power system. FERC, in turn, ordered the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)\u2014the not-for-profit organization responsible for ensuring grid reliability\u2014to promulgate new requirements for the physical security of bulk power critical infrastructure. After consultation within the utility industry, NERC proposed new physical security standards in May 2014. FERC approved them, with minor changes, the following November.", "Since 2014, security risks to the power grid have become an even greater concern in the electric utility industry. Addressing them has remained a concern of Congress. An emphasis on physical risk to the power grid was underscored in September 2016 by another successful rifle attack on a transformer substation\u2014in Utah. Reflecting ongoing security concerns, legislative proposals in the 115 th Congress include provisions directed at power grid physical security.

The September 2016 rifle attack on a 69 kV transformer substation in Utah\u2014which reportedly left 13,000 rural customers without power for up to eight hours\u2014showed that similar incidents could occur almost anywhere on the grid. A successful cyberattack on Ukraine's power grid in 2015, which was reportedly attributed to Russian hackers, showed that foreign entities could view power grids as attractive targets.

First and foremost, information about physical security measures is inherently sensitive and there are both statutory and regulatory restrictions on its disclosure. Therefore, the level of security-related information that utilities are willing or able to provide outside the CIP-014 third-party review process or NERC compliance audits is more limited than reports about, say, general reliability or safety.", "NERC is not compiling a centralized database of critical assets or security measures implemented by the utilities subject to its physical security standard. Moreover, while NERC may provide security information to FERC, the security-related information NERC can provide in public reports is limited and typically redacted. Therefore, although information about CIP-014 implementation exists among the utilities and independent third parties (operating within the standard), and is provided at some level of specificity to NERC, that information may not be as useful or visible as it could be to Congress or other outside entities.", "Another oversight challenge arises because NERC's CIP-014 standards are not prescriptive; bulk power asset owners have considerable discretion in the nature and timing of the physical security measures they may include in their physical security plans. NERC viewed such flexibility as necessary for its standard due to the unique characteristics of each utility's bulk power system and the risks it faces. However, this flexibility also may make it more difficult to develop useful metrics for CIP-014 implementation and comparing implementation among asset owners. NERC's standards for power grid physical security may ensure considerable consistency in the process utilities must undertake to identify critical substations and develop plans to secure them. However, they may not ensure consistency among the various security plans nor in the specific measures the individual asset owners will choose to implement to reduce the risk of intentional attacks. For example, ballistic shielding at critical substations may be an appropriate and sufficient protective measure for some utility assets, say, in open and rural areas, but not necessarily in more urban areas.", "Even when detailed company-specific information about physical security measures is available, it might be difficult to develop reliable metrics to evaluate it. Metrics are an important tool NERC uses to evaluate utility performance in the context of power grid reliability. However, officials at EEI have stated that measuring the adequacy of grid security for a diverse set of asset owners under changing risk circumstances poses significant problems. \"Security metrics (for both cyber and physical security) have consistently been a challenge due evolving threats and vulnerabilities. If you build an eight-foot fence, the attacker just needs to bring a nine-foot ladder.\" NERC is actively engaged in efforts to develop bulk power system security metrics in which it has likewise encountered \"challenges associated with developing relevant and useful security metrics that rely on data willingly and ably provided by individual entities.\"", "Congress may judge the effectiveness of the CIP-014 physical security standards as best it can based on reports and testimony from NERC and FERC as well as information from the assets owners themselves. However, due to the issues above, if Congress decides the information as currently structured is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions about the status of bulk power physical security as a whole, it may revisit how the responsible agencies collect, measure, and report it. Congress may also consider additional avenues for reviewing this information, for example, through classified briefings or specifically requested studies or reports. Also, as FERC continues to implement its policy of regulating physical security of the power grid, Congress may examine whether company-specific security initiatives appropriately reflect the risk profiles of their particular assets, and whether additional security measures across the grid overall uniformly reflect terrorism risk from a national perspective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Requirements and Cost Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Two of the barriers to physical security investment among utilities prior to the Metcalf attack were competition for limited capital investment resources and justifying security spending to corporate boards and utility rate regulators. NERC regulatory requirements for physical security make it easier for security managers to justify related operating and capital expenditures to corporate leadership, and to seek cost recovery for such expenditures through regulated rates. However, even where regulators have been supportive of cost recovery for physical security investments in general, they have faced challenges gauging the prudence of specific security investments because they are hard to evaluate on a traditional benefit-cost basis. As a 2006 report from the Electric Power Research Institute states, ", "Security measures, in themselves, are cost items, with no direct monetary return. The benefits are in the avoided costs of potential attacks whose probability is generally not known. This makes cost-justification very difficult.", "Note that cost-justification requires not only the approval of utility management, but also of FERC and potentially state public utility commissions which regulate the rates grid owners may charge for electric transmission and distribution service. Regulators are responsible for ensuring that electricity rates are just and reasonable. They must be convinced that any new grid security capital costs and expenses are necessary and prudent before they will allow them to be passed through to ratepayers. However, corporate financial processes differ from utility to utility, and utility rate regulation differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so investment and cost recovery for physical security is not uniform across the electricity sector and remains a work in progress. As implementation of new physical security plans under CIP-014 continues, Congress may examine whether the overall level of investment appropriately reflects the level of security risk facing the bulk power system, and whether any cost-recovery barriers are preventing assets owners from making investments necessary to secure the grid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hardening vs. Resilience", "paragraphs": ["There are two fundamental approaches to reducing the risk of a successful physical attack on the electric grid. The first approach, which is the principal approach of NERC's CIP-014 standards, is to prevent attacks by monitoring critical facilities to identify would-be attackers before they attempt an attack, preventing attacker access to critical assets, and otherwise hardening facilities to make them more physically secure to protect against attack and equipment failure. The second approach is to make the broader power system more \"resilient\" to a successful attack on particular assets through an enhanced ability to manage loads, reroute power flows, and access other sources of generation to reduce the potential of blackouts even if critical assets are disabled. Initiatives such as the spare transformer program administered by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI, the electric utility trade association), and a proposed federal Strategic Transformer Reserve, which can accelerate replacement of critical transformers if they are damaged, may contribute to the power grid's ability to sustain a terrorist attack without widespread grid failure. Thus, while hardening is aimed more at reducing the likelihood of a successful attack, resilience aims at reducing potential consequence; doing either reduces overall security risk.", "Measures to harden critical facilities and measures to increase system resilience are not exclusive of one another. In fact, they can be complementary in reducing overall security risk. However, they may involve different approaches to power grid operation and design, and they may involve different, competing types of investment (e.g., transformer shielding vs. transmission network sensors). Balancing the two approaches to most efficiently achieve a desired level of physical security is a challenge for utilities with limited capital budgets. The CPUC stated that \"determining appropriate security measures or approaches to ensuring resiliency\" was one of three \"major issues\" in its power grid physical security proceedings. As Congress continues its oversight of bulk power physical security regulation, it may consider whether the electric power sector as a whole is striking an appropriate balance between these two approaches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Threat Information", "paragraphs": ["The utility industry's physical security risk assessments rely upon threat information from the federal government, among other sources. The quality of this threat information is a key determinant of what bulk power asset owners need to be protecting against and what security measures to take. Incomplete or ambiguous threat information may lead to inconsistency in physical security among grid owners, inefficient spending of limited security resources at facilities (e.g., that may not really be under threat), or deployment of security measures against the wrong threat.", "As discussed earlier in this report, the E-ISAC plays a valuable role in identifying and analyzing physical security risk, and disseminating information about those risks to bulk power asset owners. Independent third-party verification of risk assessments under the CIP-014 standards, together with NERC compliance audits, are two additional means of helping to ensure greater consistency of threat information among utilities. Nonetheless, a changing threat environment continues to pose challenges for physical security planning and investment. As NERC stated in a recent compliance report, \"the security threat landscape is constantly changing and requires adaptation and information sharing on how best to address these issues in an effective and efficient manner.\"", "Concerns about the quality and specificity of federal threat information have long been an issue across all critical infrastructure sectors. Threat information continues to be an uncertainty in the case of power grid physical security. For example, although there is wide consensus that the Metcalf attack was extremely alarming, some industry analysts have opined that FERC's physical security order nonetheless may have been an \"overreaction\" to Metcalf. By contrast, former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff has predicted that \"the sophistication and resulting damage of the Metcalf attack will ... be exceeded\" in a future attack. Still others have expressed concern that FERC's physical security concerns may be too heavily focused on another Metcalf-type scenario\u2014the last threat\u2014rather than a wider range of potential future threats.", "As discussed earlier, there is widespread belief that bulk power critical assets are vulnerable to physical attack, that such an attack potentially could have catastrophic consequences, and that the risks of such attacks are growing. But the exact nature of such potential attacks and the capability of perpetrators to successfully execute them are uncertain. Consequently, despite the technical arguments, with limited information about potential targets and attacker capabilities, the true vulnerability of the grid remains an open\u2014and evolving\u2014question. As Congress seeks to establish the best policies to address bulk power physical security, it may examine how federal and electric sector threat information is developed and used by critical asset owners, and how limitations and uncertainty of this information may affect physical security of the electric grid."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The 2013 attack on the Metcalf transformer substation marked a turning point for the U.S. electric power sector. The attack prompted utilities across the country to reevaluate and restructure their physical security programs. It also set in motion proceedings in Congress and at FERC which resulted in the promulgation of NERC's CIP-014 mandatory physical security standards in 2015. Based on discussions with FERC and NERC staff about utility compliance, as well as a review of public information about the activities of bulk power asset owners (and the vendors supplying them), there appear to be physical security improvements underway among owners of bulk power critical assets. The public record is too anecdotal to assert conclusively that these changes are occurring uniformly and at every relevant utility, but NERC's summary compliance reports so far have been positive, especially for such a new standard. As NERC concluded in its State of Reliability 2017 report ", "What NERC can measure is that no major cyber- and few physical-related load losses have happened to date; that extremely low numbers of incidents have occurred on the operating side, and that attention to security performance has been excellent on the corporate side.", "Although the electric power sector seems to be moving in the direction of more extensive physical security, many measures have yet to be implemented and the process of corporate realignment around physical security is still underway. As the CPUC has stated, ", "It appears that the North American electric industry is in intermediate stages of fully harnessing the potential of security technologies and staff expertise, and integrating security and risk assessment values into the utility culture such that utility physical security ultimately is prioritized on par with safety and reliability.", "Therefore, although it is probably accurate to conclude that, based on the objectives of the CIP-014 standards, the U.S. electric grid is more physically secure than it was five years ago, it has not necessarily reached the level of physical security needed based on the sector's own assessments of risk. Bulk power physical security remains a work in progress. As CIP-014 implementation and other physical security initiatives proceed, Congress may seek to maintain its focus on the power sector's overall progress, not only on short term compliance with NERC's security standards, but also on structural changes supporting physical security as a priority far into the future."], "subsections": []}]}}
