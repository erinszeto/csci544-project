The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (hereafter, the \"Dodd-Frank Act,\" P.L. 111-203 , July 21, 2010) is a particularly noteworthy example of congressional delegation of rulemaking authority to federal agencies. A previous CRS report identified 330 provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require or permit the issuance of rules to implement the legislation. Nearly 80% of these 330 provisions assign rulemaking authorities or responsibilities to one of four agencies: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).", "The regulations that these and other agencies will issue pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to have a major effect on how the legislation is implemented. As one observer put it, the rules would \"turn reform into reality.\" Shortly after the legislation was enacted, another observer said, \"In most pieces of legislation like this, the real teeth is in the regulations.\" Another said that the Dodd-Frank Act \"is complicated and contains substantial ambiguities, many of which will not be resolved until regulations are adopted.\" An article in the New York Times stated that the legislation ", "is basically a 2,000-page missive to federal agencies, instructing regulators to address subjects ranging from derivatives trading to document retention.

Some of the 330 rulemaking provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act are quite specific, stipulating the substance of the rules, whether certain consultative or rulemaking procedures should be used, and deadlines for their issuance or implementation. However, more than half of the 330 rulemaking provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act appear to be discretionary in nature, stating that certain agencies \"may\" issue rules to implement particular provisions, or that the agencies shall issue such rules as they \"determine are necessary and appropriate.\" Therefore, the agencies may decide to promulgate rules regarding all, some, or none of these provisions, and often have broad discretion to decide what these rules will contain. ", "In addition, there are numerous other provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require regulatory agencies to take certain actions, but do not specifically mention \"regulations\" or \"rules.\" For example, Section 732 of the act amended Section 4d of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6d), and states that the CFTC ", "shall require that futures commission merchants and introducing brokers implement conflict-of-interest systems and procedures that (1) establish structural and institutional safeguards to ensure that the activities of any person within the firm relating to research or analysis of the price or market for any commodity are separated by appropriate informational partitions within the firm from the review, pressure, or oversight of persons whose involvement in trading or clearing activities might potentially bias the judgment or supervision of the persons; and (2) address such other issues as the Commission determines to be appropriate.", "It is possible that many of these kinds of provisions will, either by the agencies' choice or by legal necessity, be implemented through the rulemaking process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Oversight and the Unified Agenda", "paragraphs": ["In his book Building a Legislative-Centered Public Administration , David H.

The previously mentioned CRS report identifying the provisions in the act that require or permit rulemaking can be useful in this regard.

Congress, committees, and individual members can also request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluate the agencies' rulemaking activities. However, the act itself contains more than 40 provisions requiring GAO to conduct studies and write reports. For example, see the following:", "Section 412 of the act requires GAO to examine compliance costs associated with SEC rules regarding custody of funds or securities of clients by investment advisers, and any additional costs if a portion of a rule relating to operational independence is eliminated. GAO is required to submit a report on the results of the study to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services not later than three years after the date of enactment (i.e., by July 21, 2013). Section 939E requires GAO to study the feasibility and merits of creating an independent professional organization for rating analysts employed by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

", "Another option is the Congressional Review Act (CRA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7801-808), which was enacted in 1996 in an attempt to reestablish a measure of congressional authority over rulemaking \"without at the same time requiring Congress to become a super regulatory agency.\" The act generally requires federal agencies to submit all of their covered final rules to both houses of Congress and GAO before they can take effect. It also established expedited legislative procedures (primarily in the Senate) by which Congress may disapprove agencies' final rules by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. The definition of a covered rule in the CRA is quite broad, arguably including any type of document (e.g., legislative rules, policy statements, guidance, manuals, and memoranda) that the agency wishes to make binding on the affected public. After these rules are submitted, Congress can use the expedited procedures specified in the CRA to disapprove any of the rules. CRA resolutions of disapproval must be presented to the President for signature or veto.", "For a variety of reasons, however, the CRA has been used to disapprove only one rule in the 14 years since it was enacted. Perhaps most notably, it is likely that a President would veto a resolution of disapproval to protect rules developed under his own administration, and it may be difficult for Congress to muster the two-thirds vote in both houses needed to overturn the veto. Congress can also use regular (i.e., non-CRA) legislative procedures to disapprove agencies' rules, but such legislation may prove even more difficult to enact than a CRA resolution of disapproval (primarily because of the lack of expedited procedures in the Senate), and if enacted may also be vetoed by the President.", "Although the CRA has been used only once to overturn an agency rule, Congress has regularly included provisions in the text of agencies' appropriations bills directing or preventing the development of particular regulations. Such provisions include prohibitions on the finalization of particular proposed rules, restrictions on certain types of regulatory activity, and restrictions on implementation or enforcement of certain provisions. Appropriations provisions can also be used to prompt agencies to issue certain regulations, or to require that certain procedures be followed before or after their issuance. The inclusion of regulatory provisions in appropriations legislation as a matter of legislative strategy appears to arise from two factors: (1) Congress's ability via its \"power of the purse\" to control agency action, and (2) the fact that appropriations bills are considered \"must pass\" legislation. Congress's use of regulatory appropriations restrictions has fluctuated somewhat over time, and previous experience suggests that they may be somewhat less frequent when Congress and the President are of the same party."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
