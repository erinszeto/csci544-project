Two of these issues -- the transfer of immigration authorities and expeditednaturalization through military service -- relate directly to post-September 11, 2001 U.S. efforts toimprove national security. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, the 107th Congress establisheda new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L.107-296 ). DHS was tasked with preventing terrorist attacks in the United States and reducing thenation's vulnerability to terrorism, among other responsibilities. Effective March 1, 2003, P.L.107-296 abolished the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of the Department of Justice(DOJ), the agency which had administered and enforced the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), (1) and transferred most immigration-related functions to the newly created DHS. Lingering questionsremain, however, about the division of authorities between DOJ and DHS in some areas. Pendinglegislation would amend the INA to explicitly transfer certain authorities to DHS. Like theestablishment of DHS, Operation Iraqi Freedom had a goal of protecting U.S. national security. Thisoperation prompted congressional interest in legislation to expand the citizenship benefits of aliensserving in the military. The 108th Congress has enacted a measure ( P.L. 108-136 ) that amendsmilitary naturalization and posthumous citizenship statutes and provides immigration benefits forimmediate relatives of U.S. citizen servicemembers who die as a result of actual combat service.", "The 108th Congress is currently debating legislation that would implement recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11Commission). The 9/11 Commission's immigration-related recommendations focused primarily ontargeting terrorist travel through an intelligence and security strategy based on reliable identificationsystems and effective, integrated information-sharing. As Congress has considered theserecommendations, however, possible legislative responses have broadened to include significant andpossibly far-reaching changes in the substantive law governing immigration and how that law isenforced, both at the border and in the interior of the United States.", "Other measures before the 108th Congress -- such as those on temporary workers and business personnel, adjustment of status for unauthorized aliens, and noncitizen eligibility for public benefits-- concern more perennial immigration-related questions. These include how to use the immigrationsystem to meet U.S. labor needs, how to address unauthorized immigration to the United States, andwhat types of benefits to provide to noncitizens. Of course, today's heightened security concernshave likewise added new dimensions to these old questions. In the current debate over consularidentification cards, for example, issues of unauthorized immigration and security have been raised. This report discusses these and other immigration-related issues that have seen legislative action orare of significant congressional interest.

The most general statement of this power was found in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd103(a)(1) of the INA, thefundamental statute regulating the entry and stay of aliens. With some exceptions, immigrationfunctions were delegated to INS, which was headed by a Commissioner who reported to the AttorneyGeneral.", "On March 1, 2003, primary responsibility for securing our borders and managing the immigration process shifted to DHS. This transfer was effectuated through general language in theHomeland Security Act (HSA; P.L. 107-296 ): Congress did not amend every affected section of theINA to change all references to the Attorney General that were effectively superceded by the generaltransfer of authority. However, Congress did amend the language of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd103(a) of the INA, first in\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1102 of the HSA and later in Division L, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd105, of the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of2003 ( P.L. 108-7 ). This section now states:", "The Secretary of Homeland Security shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of [the INA] and all other laws relating to the immigrationand naturalization of aliens, except insofar as this chapter or such laws relate to the powers,functions, and duties conferred upon the President, Attorney General, the Secretary of State .... Provided, however , That determination and ruling by the Attorney General with respect to allquestions of law shall be controlling.", "The revised language reflects the transfer of general authority, but may leave certain issues unresolved. First, exactly what immigration powers and functions are to be retained by the AttorneyGeneral? Laws to date make clear that the Attorney General is to remain responsible foradministrative adjudications by immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals, and thatdeterminations and rulings by the Attorney General on questions of law are to be controlling. However, the intended extent of these and possible other retained powers may not be altogether clearat the operational level. Second, to the degree that authority over immigration is now fragmentedor overlapping, how are the respective authorities of DHS and the Attorney General to becoordinated and reconciled?", "It has been argued that only a section-by-section revision of the INA, replacing references to the Attorney General with references to the Secretary of Homeland Security where appropriate, willtruly clarify the allocation of authorities between the two departments. (3) A bill to replace certain INAreferences to the Attorney General with references to the Secretary of Homeland Security( H.R. 1416 ) was adopted by the House on June 24, 2003, and reported by the SenateGovernmental Affairs Committee on November 25, 2003. As passed by the House and reported bythe Senate Committee, this bill, the \"Homeland Security Technical Corrections Act of 2003,\" wouldremove specified references to the Attorney General, INS, and the INS Commissioner in INA \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd103(leaving intact the controlling nature of the Attorney General's determinations of law) and in INA\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd287(g), which concerns acceptance of state services to carry out immigration enforcement. According to the House Select Committee on Homeland Security report on H.R. 1416 ( H.Rept. 108-104 ), the bill \"improves the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and honors the originalintentions of the drafters by making grammatical and technical corrections.\" Nonetheless, questionsmay remain as to how far this provision would fully clarify and resolve outstanding issues ofauthority.

Additionally, the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary's designee within the DHS Bureau ofCitizenship and Immigration Services is authorized to request posthumous citizenship immediatelyupon obtaining permission from the next-of-kin.", "P.L. 108-136 expands immigration benefits available to the immediate relatives (spouses, children, and parents) of citizens, including posthumous citizens, who die from injuries or illnessesresulting from or aggravated by serving in combat. Such relatives would remain classified asimmediate relatives of a U.S. citizen for immigration purposes, notwithstanding the death of theservicemember, and could self-petition for immigrant status.

A primary response was to increase thesupply of foreign temporary professional (H-1B) workers through FY2003. The 108th Congress nowweighs whether to renew these increased H-1B visa ceilings or keep the statutory limit of 65,000.

It also made changes in the use of H-1B fees for the educationand training of U.S. residents, notably earmarking a portion of training funds for skills that are ininformation technology shortage areas and adding a math, science, and technology education grantprogram. Separate legislation ( P.L. 106-311 ) increased the H-1B fee, authorized through FY2003,from $500 to $1,000. The 107th Congress enacted provisions that allow H-1B workers to remainbeyond the six-year statutory limit if their employers have petitioned for them to become legalpermanent residents.

They argue further that the education of U.S. students and training of U.S. workers should begiven priority over fostering a reliance on foreign workers.", "Proponents of maintaining current H-1B levels assert that the education of students and the retraining of the current workforce are long-term responses to potential labor shortages, and thatH-1B workers are essential if the United States is to remain globally competitive.
