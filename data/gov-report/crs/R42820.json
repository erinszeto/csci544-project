An opposing group that also includes prominent casino owners, the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, supports the Restoration of America's Wire Act (S. 2159 and H.R. 4301), which would expressly prohibit all online gambling in the United States.

For example, tribes in states that permit \"Las Vegas\" nights for charitable purposes may seek to negotiate a compact with a state that allows for class III casino gaming.

Among other findings, the study said \"the literature cannot support a claim that Internet poker will cause people to become problem or pathological gamblers; however, researchers have asserted that Internet gambling has the potential to contribute to problem gambling.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gambling as a Government Revenue Source", "paragraphs": ["Revenues from lotteries, taxes on commercial casinos, and other gambling represented an average of 2.4% of own-source general revenue raised by state governments in FY2012, according to the most recent numbers complied by the Rockefeller Institute of Government. State gambling revenues rose from $15 billion in 2000 to $25.8 billion in 2012, in good part because more casinos, racinos, and lottery products came into the market (see Figure 5 ). ", "Although minor on a national scale, gambling taxes are extremely important for certain states. In some instances, the state or local tax on casino winnings may be less than 10%, while in others, it can exceed 20%. In Nevada, gaming taxes made up about 24% of the state's general fund revenue in 2013, compared with 31% from sales and use taxes. In Delaware, in FY2013, the lottery's contribution to the state's general fund was $235.3 million, which makes it the fourth-largest source of revenue for the state, ahead of corporate income and gross receipts taxes. In Indiana, gaming revenue came to $752 million during FY2013, constituting around 5% of the state's general fund revenues. In Rhode Island, casino revenue represents the third-largest source of income, behind income and sales taxes, with the state receiving more than $300 million in revenue from its two gaming facilities in FY2011. Even though Las Vegas is the nation's number one gambling venue, Pennsylvania collected more commercial casino tax revenue ($1.5 billion) than Nevada ($869 million). Tax rates may partly explain the difference. Pennsylvania taxes at a rate of 55% of gross slot machine revenue and 16% of table games revenues, whereas Nevada's rate tops out at 6.75% on gross gaming revenue, with additional county fees and levies.", "Nationwide, gambling revenues that shrank during the 2007-2009 recession as a result of falling consumer income and state spending have largely recovered. However, the expansion of gambling is not leading to increased revenue for all state governments. The creation of new lottery games and construction of casinos in new locations may be leading to market saturation, especially in the Northeast, where casino revenue in New Jersey fell 6% in 2013. Harrah's in Tunica, MS, has shut its doors.

It awards online gaming licenses for poker only. By federal law, online poker games approved in Nevada can only be played within the state. Before any online system can go live, the licensees must \"prove their systems are capable of identifying players by location and that players are of legal age.\" Three of Nevada's 265 casinos currently offer online poker. From February to April 2014, Internet poker revenue totaled about $2.5 million. Analysts estimate that Nevada's online poker intrastate market will yield between $50 million and $60 million in annual revenue. Delaware became the first state to authorize full online casino-style gambling (poker, table games, and video lottery games), legalizing it in June 2012. Full-scale online gambling was launched in November 2013 at the state's three racetrack casinos. The Delaware Department of Finance estimated the law would generate at least $3.75 million in revenues for the state in FY2013. Delaware's authorized online casino and poker offerings are operated by a single provider, 888 Holdings. New Jersey's regulations governing online gambling took effect in October 2013, which allows licensed casinos to apply for online gambling permits and to offer poker, table games, and slots. Seven of the state's 12 casinos offer online gambling. Each authorized casino has partnered with an online gaming operator, such as Gibraltar-based Bwin.party Digital Entertainment and 888 Holdings, to run its website. New Jersey's virtual casinos generated $50.5 million in revenue from December 2013 to the end of April 2014. California has debated legislation over the last few years that would authorize Internet gambling within the state. The state's Native American tribes currently have the exclusive right to offer gaming on video devices, and their opposition in the past has led to withdrawal of Internet-related bills. It has been estimated that legal online poker in California could generate more than $260 million in revenue the first year. It is uncertain if, or when, California will vote on an online poker bill. Pennsylvania is considering a measure to allow Internet poker, slots, and table games, and also a bill that would prohibit them. A May 2014 study commissioned by the state's Joint Legislative Budget and Finance Committee concluded that Internet gambling would either have a small cannibalization effect on traditional offline casino gaming or possibly might complement the state's physical casino industry. New York is considering an Internet poker-only bill, which would require operators to purchase a gaming license at $10 million, and gross gaming revenue would be taxed at 15%. The state's Gaming Commission could issue up to 10 licenses for interactive gambling.", "In addition to these developments, about a dozen states expressly prohibit online gambling, including Illinois (except for lottery ticket sales over the Internet), Indiana, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon (save for pari-mutuel online horse race betting from licensed operators), South Dakota (does not apply to the state lottery), and Washington."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Action on Remote Gambling", "paragraphs": ["While states are moving forward on a piecemeal basis, recent Congresses, including the 113 th Congress, have considered various bills that would either legalize or regulate interstate Internet gambling nationwide or prohibit online gambling.

In 2012, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs discussed Internet gaming and how it might affect Indian tribes.", "The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation in 2010 estimated that licensing fees from the Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act, introduced as H.R. 2267 in the 111 th Congress, would have led to a net federal revenue increase of $283 million over a 10-year period. That legislation would have authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a system to license and regulate Internet wagering, subject to additional oversight and licensing investigations performed by recognized state gaming authorities, with operators paying fees to meet the cost of reviewing license applications and administering the act. The Joint Committee on Taxation also estimated that the federal government would collect an additional $42 billion over 10 years under H.R. 2230 , the Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act of 2011. That legislation would have imposed a license fee for online gambling operations equal to 2% of all funds deposited by customers into special accounts that could be used for online wagering, and it would have given states and tribes the option of accepting from licensees, on a monthly basis, an online gambling fee \"equal to 6 percent of all deposited funds deposited by customers residing in each State or area subject to the jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government.\" The revenue estimate was based on the assumption that no states opted out of the system.", "In the 112 th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senator Jon Kyle circulated draft legislation to restrict online gambling in most forms, except for poker, off-track horse race wagering, and certain state lottery sales. The draft called for the establishment of a new regulatory body, the Office of Online Poker Oversight in the Department of Commerce. The bill was never introduced.", "In the 113 th Congress, the Restoration of America's Wire Act ( S. 2159 and H.R. 4301 ), introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham and a companion bill by Representative Jason Chaffetz, would amend the Wire Act to prohibit all forms of Internet gambling in the United States, including in the three states where online gambling has already been licensed and regulated. This bill would not make online games themselves illegal, but rather would prohibit use of the communications network to play games like poker or bingo over the Internet, restoring the original interpretation of the Wire Act. The bill contains exemptions for online interstate horse race wagers and state-licensed computer-generated retail lottery sales.", "Representative Peter King introduced the Internet Gambling Regulation, Enforcement, and Consumer Protection Act of 2013 ( H.R. 2282 ), which would create an Office of Internet Gambling Oversight (OIGO) in the Department of the Treasury to oversee state and tribal agencies that license and regulate online gambling operators. Most forms of gambling, except sports betting, would be permitted. The bill includes an \"opt-out\" provision for any state or tribe that does not wish to participate in the federal licensing system, and would grandfather in any states with laws that permit some kind of online gambling before the passage of the bill. Representative Jim McDermott sponsored a companion bill, the Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act of 2013 ( H.R. 3491 ), that would impose a 12% tax on any licensed operator that offers Internet wagering. Of that, one-third would go to the federal government and two-thirds to states and tribes that participate in the national regime. A 50% tax would be imposed on all unlicensed operators.", "An online gambling measure under consideration in the 113 th Congress is the Internet Poker Freedom Act ( H.R. 2666 ), introduced by Representative Joe Barton. Adapted from similar bills in previous Congresses, the measure would allow a state or tribal gambling oversight commission approved by a new Office of Internet Poker Oversight in the Department of Commerce to license online poker sites only. Registered sites would be subject to regulation and inspection to, among other things, prevent minors from playing, stop money laundering, and identify problem gamblers.

A Short History of U.S. Gambling and Lotteries", "paragraphs": ["Government-supported gambling has been part of America's development since the earliest days of colonization, starting with a 1612 London lottery to raise money for the Virginia Colony. While gambling restrictions were imposed in some of the colonies, the Continental Congress used lotteries to raise funds for forces during the Revolutionary War. Lotteries were used to finance public works projects and establish universities, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Princeton. By 1832, there were more than 400 lotteries in eight states. Annual ticket sales came to 3% of national income and were several times larger than the federal budget.", "Public opinion began to sour due to high-profile scandals and graft in lotteries, and by the time of the Civil War legal lotteries basically had been halted. Some gambling and gamblers moved west with the Gold Rush. During Reconstruction, Louisiana created a special lottery to help rebuild the state, drawing players from around the nation. The Louisiana Lottery continued for years, despite evidence of mismanagement and theft. Congress intervened, passing legislation in 1876 banning the use of mail for lottery advertising. Congress approved a second bill in 1890 to ban the use of mail to sell lottery tickets, and in 1895 banned the transport of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.", "By 1910, U.S. legal gambling, with the exception of horse racing, was moribund. State-sanctioned gambling began a comeback during the Great Depression as a means to raise money for charity and government services. States began to legalize bingo games in the 1930s, and Nevada legalized casino gambling in 1931.", "Illegal gambling also proliferated, leading Congress in 1950 to investigate organized crime and gambling casinos. In 1951 lawmakers passed the Johnson Act, which barred transport of gambling machines in interstate commerce unless they were being moved to a legal jurisdiction. A second round of congressional investigations (from 1955 to 1960) resulted in a series of laws to combat gambling and racketeering.", "In 1964, New Hampshire became the first state to reinstate a lottery, and, in 1976, New Jersey voted to allow casinos in Atlantic City. In 1979, Indian gambling began on the Seminole reservation in Florida. In 1987, the Supreme Court upheld the right of Indian tribes to offer unregulated gambling on sovereign lands, so long as they did not violate state criminal laws. In response, Congress in 1988 passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) providing for Indian gambling to be regulated under compacts negotiated between state governments and tribes. In 1992, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) limiting states' ability to offer sports gambling. After viewing the success of Indian gaming, states began approving non-Indian casinos, riverboat gambling, and racinos, which are racetracks with other forms of gambling such as video slot machines. By 2012, 22 states had commercial casinos. State-licensed boat or barge casinos are now permitted in six states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, and Missouri. Online lottery sales are legal in six states, online gambling is allowed in three states, and explicitly outlawed in nine states, including Louisiana, Montana, and South Dakota."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
