In recent years, congressional appropriators have increased funding for FDA Foods program, more than doubling funding over the past decade. Largely, this increase has been in response to comprehensive food safety legislation enacted in the 111 th Congress, as part of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA, P.L. 111-353 ). FSMA was the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s.

This included a requested $25.3 million increase in budget authority to implement FSMA, partially offset by proposed reductions in other programs.

", "Funding amounts requested by the former Administration and amounts provided by congressional appropriators is considerably lower than funding levels recommended by the states, industry, and consumer advocacy groups. In particular, the states are concerned about the lack of resources to fully implement FSMA and for state and local authorities to support FDA and conduct inspections and risk analytics as well as provide technical assistance to regulated farms and food facilities. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) recommended that Congress provide $100 million annually. Additional funding for FSMA implementation and FDA food safety enforcement was also recommended by many food industry companies and organizations.", "Congressional appropriations are augmented by existing (currently authorized) user fees. Existing fees, as authorized under FSMA, include food and feed recall fees, food reinspection fees, and voluntary qualified importer program fees. In recent years these fees have generated less than $18 million per year. The Obama Administration's request included $193.2 million in user fees, covering existing user fees plus new proposed user fees of $105.3 million in new import fees and $61.3 million in food facility and registration fees. Enacted appropriations in the years since FSMA was signed into law have not approved any new user fees. Moreover, members of the House Appropriations Committee have repeatedly called on the Administration to stop requesting additional user fees but rather to \"request the resources [FDA] needs to fully implement\" FSMA.

Such byproducts are often used as animal feed. The Senate committee report also expresses concerns about FSMA regulations on cotton ginning and cottonseed for use as animal feed. Both committees also addressed a number of issues regarding fish and seafood, covering labeling and safety, disease research, and consumer fraud.
