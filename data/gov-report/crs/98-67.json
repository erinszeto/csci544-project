While the numbers of new broadband subscribers continue to grow, some areas of the nation\u2014particularly rural and low-income communities\u2014continue to lack sufficient access to high-speed broadband Internet service. In order to address this problem, the 109 th Congress considered, but did not pass, legislation to address the scope and effect of federal broadband financial assistance programs (including universal service), and the impact of regulatory policies and new technologies on broadband deployment. These issues are anticipated to continue to be a focus of the broadband policy debate in the 110 th Congress.", "Some policymakers, believing that disparities in broadband access across American society could have adverse economic and social consequences on those left behind, assert that the federal government should play a more active role to avoid a \"digital divide\" in broadband access. One approach is for the federal government to provide financial assistance to support broadband deployment in underserved areas. In the 109 th Congress, legislation was introduced, but not enacted, to provide financial assistance (including loans, grants, and tax incentives) to encourage broadband deployment. (For more information on federal assistance for broadband deployment, see CRS Report RL30719, Broadband Internet Access and the Digital Divide: Federal Assistance Programs , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].) Others, however, question the reality of the \"digital divide,\" and argue that federal intervention in the broadband marketplace would be premature and, in some cases, counterproductive.", "The debate over access to broadband services has prompted policymakers to examine a range of other issues to ensure that broadband will be available on a timely and equal basis to all U.S. citizens. One facet of this debate focuses on whether present laws and subsequent regulatory policies are needed to ensure the development of competition and its subsequent consumer benefits, or conversely, whether such laws and regulations are overly burdensome and discourage needed investment in and deployment of broadband services. The regulatory debate focuses on a number of issues including the extent to which legacy regulations should be applied to traditional providers as they enter new markets, the extent to which legacy regulations should be imposed on new entrants as they compete with traditional providers in their markets, and the treatment of new and converging technologies.", "For example, present law requires all incumbent local exchange (telephone) carriers (ILECs), such as Verizon or SBC, to open up their networks to enable competitors to lease out parts of the incumbent's network. These unbundling and resale requirements, which are detailed in Section 251 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, were enacted in an attempt to open up the local telephone network to competitors. Whether such \"open access\" regulations should be applied to ILECs when they offer new non-dominant services such as broadband connections, or to new market entrants such as cable television companies when they offer services (such as voice and broadband) remains under debate. Whether regulators should play a role to ensure that the Internet remains open to all, often referred to as \"net neutrality\" became a major part of and is expected to continue to be, a major focus of the ongoing Congressional debate. Equally contentious is the debate over whether legacy regulations, such as the requirement that cable television companies obtain a local franchise as a prerequisite for offering video service, be extended to other entrants, such as telephone companies, if they choose to enter the video market. A third and related debate surrounds the appropriate regulatory framework that should be imposed on new technologies such as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and other Internet Protocol services as well as bundled service offerings.", "The regulatory treatment of broadband technologies\u2014whether offered by traditional or emerging providers, or incumbent or new entrants\u2014remains a major focus of the policy debate. Cities, counties, and states have taken up the issue of whether to mandate open access requirements on local cable franchises. In June 1999, a federal judge ruled that the city of Portland, Oregon had the right to require open access to the Tele-Communications Incorporated (TCI) broadband network as a condition for transferring its local cable television franchise to AT&T. On March 14, 2002, the FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling which classified cable modem service as an \"interstate information service,\" subject to FCC jurisdiction and largely shielded from local regulation. After a series of conflicting court decisions the US Supreme Court in a June 27, 2005 action ( National Cable and Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services ), ruled that the FCC should be given deference in its decision that cable broadband service should be classified as an \"interstate information service.\" The classification of cable modem service as an \"interstate information service\" will result in FCC treatment under the less rigorous Title I of the 1934 Communications Act. Similarly, in an August 5, 2005 action, the FCC ruled that the regulatory treatment of wireline broadband services will be granted regulatory parity. The FCC ruled that, subject to a one-year transition period, which expired in August 2006, wireline broadband Internet access services (commonly delivered by DSL technology) are defined as information services, thereby placing telephone company DSL services on an equal regulatory footing with cable modem services. Regulatory parity was also granted to broadband over power line (BPL) service, when the FCC, in a November 2006 decision, determined that such service would also be classified as an \"interstate information service\" subject to Title I regulation.", "Finally, emerging broadband technologies\u2014such as fiber, wireless (including \"3G\", \"wi-fi\" and \"Wimax\"), and BPL\u2014continue to be developed and/or deployed, and have the potential to affect the regulatory and market landscape of broadband deployment. The 110 th Congress and the FCC will likely consider policies to address the emergence of these and other new broadband technologies. In addition, how and to what extent \"social regulations\" such as 911 requirements, disability access, law enforcement obligations, and universal service support, should be applied to emerging technologies is also under debate. A related issue, the emergence of municipal broadband networks (primarily wireless and fiber based) and the debate over whether such networks constitute unfair competition with the private sector has become a significant policy issue (for more information on municipal broadband, see CRS Report RS20993, Wireless Technology and Spectrum Demand: Advanced Wireless Services , by [author name scrubbed])."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Computer and Internet Security18", "paragraphs": ["On October 21, 2002, all 13 of the Internet's root Domain Name System servers were targeted by a distributed denial of service attack. While the attack had little overall effect on the performance of the Internet, a more sophisticated and sustainable attack might have had a more deleterious impact. As use of the Internet grows, so has concern about security of and security on the Internet. A long list of security-related incidents that have received wide-ranging media coverage (e.g. Melissa virus, the Love Bug, and the Code Red, Nimda, Slammer, and Blaster worms) represents the tip of the iceberg. More recently, hackers using Trojan horses and other techniques, were able to place keylogging software on the personal computers of people with online trading accounts to surreptitiously acquire their personal account information. The hackers used the information to access these personal accounts to buy little known stocks in which they (the hackers) had invested, driving up the price. The thieves then dumped their shares for a profit. Every day, persons gain access, or try to gain access, to someone else's computer without authorization to read, copy, modify, or destroy the information contained within. These persons range from juveniles to disgruntled (ex)employees, to criminals, to competitors, to politically or socially motivated groups, to agents of foreign governments.", "The extent of the problem is unknown. Much of what gets reported as computer \"attacks\" are probes, often conducted automatically with software widely available for even juveniles to use. But the number of instances where someone has actually gained unauthorized access is not known. Not every person or company whose computer system has been compromised reports it either to the media or to authorities. Sometimes the victim judges the incident not to be worth the trouble. Sometimes the victim may judge that the adverse publicity would be worse. Sometimes the affected parties do not even know their systems have been compromised. There is some evidence to suggest, however, that the number of incidents is increasing. According to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie-Mellon University, the number of incidents reported to it has grown just about every year since the team's establishment\u2014from 132 incidents in 1989 to over 137,000 incidents in 2003. Since many attacks are now coordinated and cascade throughout the Internet, CERT no longer tracks the number of incidents reported to them. While the total number of incidents may be rising exponentially, it is interesting to note that, according to the Computer Crime and Security Survey, the percentage of respondents that reported unauthorized use of their computer systems over the previous 12 months has declined since the year 2000.", "The impact on society from the unauthorized access or use of computers is also unknown. Again, some victims may choose not to report losses. In many cases, it is difficult or impossible to quantify the losses. But social losses are not zero. Trust in one's system may be reduced. Proprietary and/or customer information (including credit card numbers) may be compromised. Any unwanted code must be found and removed. The veracity of the system's data must be checked and restored if necessary. Money may be stolen from accounts or extorted from the victim. If disruptions occur, sales may be lost. If adverse publicity occurs, future sales may be lost and stock prices may be affected. Estimates of the overall financial losses due to unauthorized access vary and are largely speculative. Estimates typically range in the billions of dollars per major event like the Love Bug virus or the series of denial-of-service attacks of February 2000. Similar estimates have been made for the Code Red worms. Estimates of losses internationally range up to the tens of billions of dollars. In the 2005 Computer Crime and Security Survey, 687 responders (out of a total of 700) estimated financial losses totaling $130 million in the previous 12 months. According to the survey, viruses accounted for the most financial losses ($43 million), followed by loss of proprietary information. Denial of service attacks accounted for $7 million in losses. Two of the online brokers whose customers' accounts were used in the \"pump-and-dump\" scheme mentioned above reported spending $22 million to compensate their customers. For more discussion on the economic impact of attacks against computer systems, and the difficulties in measuring it, see CRS Report RL32331, The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attacks , by [author name scrubbed] et al. (pdf)", "Aside from the losses discussed above, there is also growing concern that unauthorized access to computer systems could pose an overall national security risk should it result in the disruption of the nation's critical infrastructures (e.g., transportation systems, banking and finance, electric power generation and distribution). These infrastructures rely increasingly on computer networks to operate, and are themselves linked by computer and communication networks. In February 2003, the President's Critical Infrastructure Board (established by President George W. Bush through E.O. 13231 but later dissolved by E.O. 13286) released a National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace . The Strategy assigned a number of responsibilities for coordinating the protection of the nation's information infrastructure to the Department of Homeland Security. Most of the Department's efforts in cybersercurity are managed by the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) within in the Preparedness Directorate. As part of the Strategy , the NCSD has assumed a major role in raising awareness of the risks associated with computer security among all users, from the home user to major corporations, and to facilitate information exchange between all parties. To this end numerous cooperative and coordinating groups and fora have been established. One such activity is U.S.-CERT, a cooperative effort by the National Cyber Security Division and Carnegie Mellon's CERT, which among other services and activities, produces alerts of new and existing attacks and guidelines for preventing or responding to them.", "Congress has shown, and continues to show, a strong interest in the security of computers and the Internet. Over the years this interest has been manifested in numerous hearings by a multitude of committees and subcommittees, in both the House and the Senate. Legislation has also been passed. The federal Computer Fraud and Abuse statute (18 U.S.C. 1030) was initially added as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 ( P.L. 98-473 ). This act, as amended, makes it a federal crime to gain unauthorized access to, damage, or use in an illegal manner, protected computer systems (including federal computers, bank computers, computers used in interstate and foreign commerce). Legislation specifically requiring system owners/operators to take actions to protect their computer systems has been confined to executive federal agencies (most recently, the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, P.L. 107-347 , Title III). Other legislation is primarily aimed at protecting privacy by protecting certain personal information held by government and private sector entities and affects computer security indirectly. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( P.L. 106-102 , Title V) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA, P.L. 104-191 , Title II, Subtitle F) require that entities have in place programs that protect the financial and health-related information, respectively, in their possession. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (P.P. 107-204) also indirectly affects private sector computers and networks, by requiring certain firms to certify the integrity of their financial control systems as part of their annual financial reporting requirements. To the extent that this information resides on computer systems, these requirements extend to those systems. Congress also supports a number of programs that help develop computer security education, training, and research at selected universities. For an overview of federal legislation and other federal documents associated with computer and internet security, see CRS Report RL32357, Computer Security: A Summary of Selected Federal Laws, Executive Orders, and Presidential Directives , by [author name scrubbed].", "It is not clear how these efforts have affected the overall security of the Internet. Given the perceived rise in security threats and attacks, there is a general sense that more must be done. Aside from the inherent vulnerabilities associated with highly interconnected information networks, two major sources of vulnerabilities exist: software, and network configuration and management. Operating systems and applications developers say they are paying greater attention to designing better security into their software products. But it is still common to have vulnerabilities found in products after they have been put on the market. In some cases, patches have had to be offered at the same time a new product is brought onto the market. Although patches typically are offered to fix these vulnerabilities, many system administrators do not keep their software/configurations current. Many intrusions take advantage of software vulnerabilities noted many months earlier, for which fixes have already been offered.", "There are as yet no agreed upon industry standards for determining how secure a firm's computer system should be or for assessing how secure it is in fact. Some observers speculate that it is only a matter of time before owners of computer systems are held responsible for damage done to a third-party computer as a result of inadequately protecting their own systems. Nor are there any agreed upon standards on how secure a vendor's software product should be. The federal government, in cooperation with a number of other countries, has developed a set of International Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, to allow certified laboratories to test security products and rate their level of security for government use. These criteria may evolve into industry standards for certifying security products. Some in the security community feel that security will not improve without some requirements imposed upon the private sector. However, both users and vendors of computer software suggest that the market is sufficient to address security in the most cost-effective manner. The Bush Administration, as the Clinton Administration before it, has chosen to use engagement and not regulation to encourage the private sector to improve security. However, both Administrations did not rule out the use of regulation if necessary. For a discussion of the difficulties associated with setting standards, see CRS Report RL32777, Creating a National Framework for Cybersecurity: An Analysis of Issues and Options , by [author name scrubbed] (pdf).", "During the 109 th Congress, legislation was introduced that, again, primarily addressed privacy issues with indirect impact on computer security. In light of large losses of personal information through fraud, lost records, and unauthorized access, a number of bills were introduced that extended the requirements to safeguard and protect personal information, similar to that found in Gramm-Leach-Bliley and HIPPA, to \"information brokers\" and/or required any organization engaged in interstate commerce holding personal information to inform consumers of any security breach that may have compromised their information. Bills commonly referred to as \"Spyware\" legislation were also introduced. These topics are discussed in the next section of this report. The theft of a laptop computer from the home of a employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs in May 2006, containing personal information of over 20 million military veterans, while not an Internet-related incident, renewed focus on the ability of federal agencies to enforce their own information security policies and procedures and to hold agency officials accountable. Such concern led the House to pass the Veterans Identity and Credit Security Act of 2006 ( H.R. 5835 ) that included amendments to the Federal Information Security Management Act. The Senate did not take up the bill. Similar activity is expected in the 110 th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internet Privacy", "paragraphs": ["Concerns related to Internet privacy encompass a wide range of issues. At the center of these issues is how networks can facilitate the collection and transfer of data inexpensively and on a large scale. While such data transfers can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services, they can also pose great risk if the information is not appropriately protected. One example is the surreptitious installation of software (\"spyware\") by website operators to collect personally identifiable information (PII) and share that information with third parties, usually without the knowledge or consent of the people concerned. Another example is identity theft, which is a form of fraud in which the personal identifying information of an individual, such as a Social Security number, name, or date of birth, is co-opted by another person to facilitate committing a criminal or fraudulent act by impersonating the victim."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spyware25", "paragraphs": ["Spyware is another focus of congressional concern. There is no firm definition of spyware, but the most common example is software products that include a method by which information is collected about the use of the computer on which the software is installed, and the user.

Typically, users have no knowledge that the software they obtained included spyware and that it is now resident on their computers. A central point of the debate is whether new laws are needed, or if industry self-regulation, coupled with enforcement actions under existing laws such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, is sufficient. Most recently, the 109 th Congress passed the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers beyond Borders Act of 2005 (US SAFE WEB ) ( P.L. 109-455 ).

Instead, identity theft is often committed as part of some other fraud or white-collar crime, such as illegally obtaining credit, taking over existing financial accounts, or establishing cellular phone service in the victim's name. An identity thief could also take other actions on behalf of the victim, such as establishing residency/citizenship, securing employment, obtaining government benefits, and committing other crimes in the victim's name. In addition, identity theft can play a facilitating role in potentially more violent crimes such as drug trafficking, people smuggling, and international terrorism.", "While identity theft is not solely an Internet issue, a number of high profile data breaches involving the personally identifiable information (PII) of citizens and consumers has drawn significant attention to the issue. Among the most recent incidents was the theft of a laptop containing the names, dates of birth, and other information of more than 26 million veterans. Although the laptop was eventually recovered and it is believed that the data was not accessed, the incident highlighted the ease with which the PII of large numbers of people could be taken at one time.", "Another way identity theft can happen is through \"phishing.\" Phishing refers to a practice where someone misrepresents their identity or authority in order to induce another person to provide PII over the Internet. Some common phishing scams involve e-mails that purport to be from a financial institution, ISP, or other trusted company claiming that a person's record has been lost. The e-mail directs the person to a website that mimics the legitimate business' website and asks the person to enter a credit card number and other PII so the record can be restored. In fact, the e-mail or website is controlled by a third party who is attempting to extract information that will be used in identity theft or other crimes.

Although consumers are most familiar with spam on their personal computers, it also is becoming an issue in text messaging on wireless telephones and personal digital assistants (PDAs).", "In 2003, Congress passed a federal anti-spam law, the CAN-SPAM Act ( P.L. 108-187 ), which became effective on January 1, 2004. The act preempts state laws that specifically address spam but not state laws that are not specific to e-mail, such as trespass, contract, or tort law, or other state laws to the extent they relate to fraud or computer crime. It does not ban unsolicited commercial e-mail. Rather, it allows marketers to send commercial e-mail as long as it conforms with the law, such as including a legitimate opportunity for consumers to \"opt-out\" of receiving future commercial e-mails from that sender. It does not require a centralized \"do not e-mail\" registry to be created by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), similar to the National Do Not Call registry for telemarketing. The law requires only that the FTC develop a plan and timetable for establishing a \"Do Not E-mail\" registry and to inform Congress of any concerns it has with regard to establishing it. The FTC reported to Congress in June 2004 that without a technical system to authenticate the origin of e-mail messages, a registry would not reduce the amount of spam, and, in fact, might increase it. Authentication is a technical approach that could be used to control spam that is under study by a number of groups, including ISPs, who are attempting to develop a single authentication standard for the industry. Additionally, the CAN-SPAM Act included a provision requiring the FCC to establish regulations to protect wireless consumers from spam.", "Many argue that technical approaches, such as authentication, and consumer education, are needed to solve the spam problem\u2014that legislation alone is insufficient. Nonetheless, there is considerable interest in assessing how effective the CAN-SPAM Act is in reducing spam. The effectiveness of the law may be difficult to determine, however, if for no other reason than there are various definitions of spam. Proponents of the law argue that consumers are most irritated by fraudulent e-mail, and that the law should reduce the volume of such e-mail because of the civil and criminal penalties included therein. Skeptics counter that consumers object to unsolicited commercial e-mail, and since the bill legitimizes commercial e-mail (as long as it conforms with the law's provisions), consumers actually may receive more, not fewer, unsolicited commercial e-mail messages. Thus, whether \"spam\" is reduced depends in part on how it is defined.", "In December 2005, the FTC submitted a report to Congress, as required under the CAN-SPAM Act, on the act's effectiveness and enforcement, and whether any changes are needed. Based on information from ISPs, the general public, e-marketers, law enforcers, and technologists, the report concluded that the act has been effective in two areas: legitimate online marketers have adopted the \"best practices\" mandated by the act, and the act provides an additional tool for law enforcement officials and ISPs to bring suits against spammers. However, it also concluded that some aspects of the spam problem have not changed, such as its international dimension. It also reported on a number of \"troubling\" changes in the e-mail landscape, such as the inclusion of malicious content (\"malware\") in spam messages. The report outlined three steps to further improve the effectiveness of the act: passage of legislation to improve the FTC's ability to trace spammers and sellers who operate outside U.S. borders; continued consumer education; and continued improvement in anti-spam technologies, especially domain-level authentication.", "Most recently, the 109 th Congress passed the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers beyond Borders Act of 2005 (US SAFE WEB ) ( P.L. 109-455 ).

In response to this concern, Congress has passed such laws as the 1996 Communications Decency Act (CDA), the 1998 Child Online Protection Act (COPA), and the 2000 Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), all of which dealt in some way with the content found on the Internet. More recently, however, additional attention has been given to protecting children from exploitation and predators on the Internet. For example, in the last few years, social networking sites, such as MySpace, have become popular with teenagers and young adults. Unfortunately, there have been a number of incidents recently in which children were abducted and/or lured to meet adults over these services. Because of these incidents, Congress began exploring ways to limit children's access to these sites, or at least to limit the ability of adults to contact children. During the 109 th Congress, H.R. 5319 , the Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006 (DOPA), would have amended the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit schools and libraries receiving \"E-Rate\" funding from providing access to these types of websites to minors. The proposal was controversial because the definition of social networking sites could potentially limit access to a wide range of websites, including many with harmless or educational material. Although this bill did not pass, this issue is likely to receive continued attention in the 110 th Congress.", "\"Data retention\" is another topic that is likely to receive continued attention from policymakers in the 110 th Congress. Data retention is the practice of ISPs maintaining electronic records of subscriber activity, regardless of whether those records have been identified as being needed for an ongoing investigation. At this time, ISPs typically discard records that log subscriber activity when those records are no longer required for business purposes (e.g., network monitoring, billing disputes). However, law enforcement agencies have expressed that they would like data to be retained for longer periods\u2014in general, the time periods suggested have ranged from one to two years\u2014to ensure they can successfully prosecute online child predators and individuals producing and downloading child pornography. Proposals that have been discussed range from simply maintaining records of what websites subscribers visit to requiring the storage of the contents of e-mail messages and individual web pages visited. ISPs have expressed a number of concerns, including the cost of retaining the data, web content being included in data retention legislation, and the privacy and security risks of having such a massive data warehouse available. Opponents of such legislation note that current law already allows law enforcement agencies to mandate data retention for 90-days; further, privacy advocates are concerned that police would potentially be able to obtain records of e-mail chatter, Web browsing, or chat room activity that normally are discarded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internet Domain Names35", "paragraphs": ["The 110 th Congress will continue to monitor issues related to the Internet domain name system (DNS).

Prior to 1993, NSF was responsible for registration of nonmilitary generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) such as .com, .org, and .net. In 1993, the NSF entered into a five-year cooperative agreement with Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) to operate Internet domain name registration services.

On November 25, 1998, DOC and ICANN signed an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), whereby DOC and ICANN agreed to jointly design, develop, and test the mechanisms, methods, and procedures necessary to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity.", "The White Paper also signaled DOC's intention to ramp down the government's Cooperative Agreement with NSI, with the objective of introducing competition into the domain name space while maintaining stability and ensuring an orderly transition. During this transition period, government obligations will be terminated as DNS responsibilities are transferred to ICANN. Specifically, NSI committed to a timetable for development of a Shared Registration System that permits multiple registrars to provide registration services within the .com, .net, and .org gTLDs. NSI (now VersiSign) will continue to administer the root server system until receiving further instruction from the government.", "Significant disagreements between NSI on the one hand, and ICANN and DOC on the other, arose over how a successful and equitable transition would be made from NSI's previous status as exclusive registrar of .com, .org, and .net domain names, to a system that allows multiple and competing registrars. On November 10, 1999, ICANN, NSI, and DOC formally signed an agreement which provided that NSI (now VeriSign) was required to sell its registrar operation by May 10, 2001 in order to retain control of the dot-com registry until 2007. In April 2001, arguing that the registrar business is now highly competitive, VeriSign reached a new agreement with ICANN whereby its registry and registrar businesses would not have to be separated. With DOC approval, ICANN and VeriSign signed the formal agreement on May 25, 2001. On September 17, 2003, ICANN and the Department of Commerce agreed to extend their MOU until September 30, 2006. The MOU specified transition tasks which ICANN has agreed to address, including implementing an objective process for selecting new Top Level Domains; implementing an effective strategy for multi-lingual communications and international outreach; and developing a contingency plan, consistent with the international nature of the Internet, to ensure continuity of operations in the event of a severe disruption of operations.", "On June 30, 2005, Michael Gallagher, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), stated the U.S. Government's principles on the Internet's domain name system.

Other issues include ongoing efforts to develop a federal enterprise architecture, which serves as a blueprint of the business functions of an organization, and the technology used to carry out these functions http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/egov/a-1-fea.html ; the recruitment and retention of IT managers, at both the chief information officer (CIO) and project manager levels; and balancing the sometimes competing demands of e-government and homeland security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Open Source Software46", "paragraphs": ["The use of open source software by the federal government has been gaining attention as organizations continue to search for opportunities to enhance their information technology (IT) operations while containing costs. A growing number of state and local governments have also been exploring the official adoption of open source software. Likewise, open source software may also play a role in the growth of regional health information organizations (RHIOs), as part of an effort to spread the use of e-health records. For the federal government and Congress, the debate over the use of open source software intersects several other issues, including, but not limited to, the development of homeland security and e-government initiatives, improving government information technology management practices, strengthening computer security, and protecting intellectual property rights. In the 110 th Congress, the debate over open source software is anticipated to revolve primarily around information security and intellectual property rights, including the possible development of a legal definition of open source software. However, issues related to cost and quality are likely to be raised as well.", "Open source software refers to a computer program whose source code, or programming instructions, is made available to the general public to be improved or modified as the user wishes. Some examples of open source software include the Linux operating system and Apache Web server software. In contrast, closed source , or proprietary, programs are those whose source code is not made available and can only be altered by the software manufacturer. In the case of closed source software, updates to a program are usually distributed in the form of a patch or as a new version of the program that the user can install but not alter. Some examples of closed source software include Microsoft Word and Corel WordPerfect. The majority of software products most commonly used, such as operating systems, word processing programs, and databases, are closed source programs.", "For proponents, open source software is often viewed as a means to reduce an organization's dependence on the software products of a few companies while possibly improving the security and stability of one's computing infrastructure. For critics, open source software is often viewed as a threat to intellectual property rights with unproven cost and quality benefits. So far there appear to be no systematic analyses available that have conclusively compared closed source to open source software on the issue of security. In practice, computer security is highly dependent on how an application is configured, maintained, and monitored. Similarly, the costs of implementing an open source solution are dependent upon factors such as the cost of acquiring the hardware/software, investments in training for IT personnel and end users, maintenance and support costs, and the resources required to convert data and applications to work in the new computing environment. Consequently, some computer experts suggest that it is not possible to conclude that either open source or closed source software is inherently more secure or more cost efficient.", "The official U.S. federal government policy regarding the use of open source software by government agencies is described in a July 2004 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum on software acquisition, M-04-16 Memoranda for Senior Procurement Executives, Chief Information Officers, Software Acquisition . The memorandum states that the policies guiding government information technology investment decisions are \"technology and vendor neutral\" and that agencies' technology choices \"must be consistent with the agency's enterprise architecture and the Federal Enterprise Architecture.\" Agencies are also instructed to take into account a number of other merit-based factors, including information security, licensing requirements, and total cost of ownership. Implicit in these requirements is an expectation that agencies will also make choices based on the quality of the product.", "The growing emphasis on improved information security and critical infrastructure protection overall, will likely be an influential factor in future decisions to implement open source solutions. The rapidly changing computer environment may also foster the use of a combination of open source and closed source applications, rather than creating a need to choose one option at the exclusion of another.", "Appendix A.
