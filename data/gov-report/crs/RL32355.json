The index showed that the annual across-the-boardincrease would be 2.5% in January 2005. The size of the locality payment is determined by thePresident, and is based on a comparison of non-federal and General Schedule (GS) salaries in 32 payareas nationwide. By law, the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries was to be graduallyreduced to 5% over the years 1994 through 2002; FEPCA requires that amounts payable may not beless than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5% in January 2005. The FederalSalary Council and the Pay Agent recommended that, to carry out FEPCA, the 2005 localitypayments range from 18.14% in the \"Rest of the United States\" (RUS) pay area to 47.96% in the SanJose-San Francisco pay area. The payment recommended for the Washington, DC, pay area was29.66%. Because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate, the change in locality ratesis derived by comparing 2004 locality payments with those recommended for 2005. Thiscomparison results in recommended net increases for 2005, if the ECI and locality-basedcomparability payments were granted as required by law, of 9.19% in the RUS pay area to 22.10%in the San Jose-San Francisco pay area, and 15.94% in the Washington, DC, pay area.

It provides that payments are to be made within each locality determined to have a non-federal/federal paydisparity greater than 5%. When uniformly applied to GS employees within a locality, theadjustment is intended to make their pay rates substantially equal, in the aggregate, to those ofnon-federal workers for the same levels of work in the same locality.", "FEPCA authorizes the President to fix an alternative level of locality-based comparability payments if, because of a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the generalwelfare, he considers the level that would otherwise be payable to be inappropriate. At least onemonth before these comparability payments would be payable (by November 30, 2004), he wouldhave to prepare, and transmit to Congress, a report describing the alternative level of payments heintended to provide, including the reasons why this alternative level would be necessary.

(16) (See the discussion under \"The President'sRecommendation,\" below.)", "Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Surveys. Under the law, the BLS conducts surveys that document non-federal rates of pay in each pay area. InJanuary 2005, there will be 32 pay areas nationwide. Until October 1996, the surveys wereconducted under the Occupational Compensation Survey Program (OCSP), which had beenapproved by the Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent. Since then, the surveys had beenconducted under the National Compensation Survey (NCS) program, which was not approved foruse with the January 2000, January 2001, January 2002, and January 2003 locality payments. Forthe January 2004 locality payments, a phase-in of NCS survey data was approved, and this phase-inwill continue for January 2005 by applying a weight of 75% to NCS results and a weight of 25% toOCSP results. The survey results are submitted to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),which serves as the staff to the Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent. OPM documents federalrates of pay in each of the pay areas and compares non-federal and GS salaries, by grade, for eachpay area. The average salaries at each grade, both federal and non-federal, are then aggregated andcompared to determine an overall average percentage pay gap for each area. By law, the disparitybetween non-federal and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5%. Therefore, the overall averagepercentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted to this level each year by OPM. This adjusted gapis called the target gap.", "FEPCA also stipulates that a certain percentage of the target gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries in each pay area is to be closed each year. Twenty percent of thegap was closed in 1994, the first year of locality pay, as authorized by FEPCA. An additional 10%of the gap was to be closed each year thereafter, meaning that 30% of the gap was to be closed in1995, 40% in 1996, 50% in 1997, 60% in 1998, 70% in 1999, 80% in 2000, and 90% in 2001. Ineach of these years, the locality pay increase has been implemented at a much lower percentage,reducing the gap slowly; 23.5% of the gap was closed in 1995, 25.9% in 1996, 28.3% in 1997,29.2% in 1998, 31% in 1999, 33.5% in 2000, 38.1% in 2001, 42.3% in 2002, 44% in 2003, and53.7% in 2004. These percentages represent the gap as recalculated after each adjustment. ByJanuary 2002, and continuing each year thereafter, FEPCA specified that amounts payable could notbe less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5%. Thispercentage is applied to the target gap in each pay area to determine the locality rates recommendedby the Pay Agent to the President, after receiving advice from the Federal Salary Council. (17)", "The pay gaps on which the locality payments are based are 22 months old by the effective date of the adjustment; thus, March 2003 gaps determine the January 2005 locality payments. Due to thefact that the NCS surveys were not approved for use in determining the January 2000, January 2001,January 2002, and January 2003 locality payments, that the NCS surveys were being phased in forthe January 2004 locality payments, and that the phase-in continues for the January 2005 localitypayments, the gaps were determined by the following means. The March 2003 gaps were determinedby using the most recent OCSP survey data and NCS survey data which ranged from December 2001through October 2002 for each pay area. Since the BLS had discontinued the OCSP program inOctober 1996, the OCSP pay survey data for some of the largest pay areas were about eight yearsold. Specifically, the New York data were as of July 1995; the Washington, DC, data were as ofOctober 1995; and the Los Angeles data were as of November 1995. Survey data for each of theother pay areas varied from January 1996 to November 1996. The data for the \"Rest of the UnitedStates\" pay area were as of November 1996. In its report on the 2005 locality payments, the PayAgent explained how the pay gaps were determined, stating that, \"To ensure that local pay disparitiesare measured as of one common date, it is necessary to 'age' the BLS survey data [using the ECIbased on wages and salaries for white-collar civilian workers, excluding those in sales] to a commonreference date [March 2003] before comparing [them] to GS pay data of the same date.\" (18)", "Report of the Federal Salary Council. The council reported the following results from the application of this methodology. As of March 2003,the overall gap between GS average salaries (excluding existing locality payments, special rates, andcertain other payments) and non-federal average salaries was 31.82%. The amount needed to reducethis disparity to 5%, as mandated by FEPCA, averages 25.54% for 2005. The calculation of the paygaps excludes existing locality payments. After considering the 12.12% average locality rate paidin 2003, the overall average pay gap in 2003 was 17.57%. (19)", "Locality Payments. In order to meet the target for closing the pay gap, the council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 18.14% in the \"Restof the United States\" (RUS) pay area to 47.96% in the San Jose-San Francisco pay area. Thepayment recommended for the Washington, DC, pay area is 29.66%. Because the new locality ratereplaces the existing locality rate, the change in locality rates is derived by comparing 2004 localitypayments with those recommended for 2005. This comparison results in recommended net increasesfor 2005, if the ECI and locality-based comparability payments were granted as required by law, of9.19% in the RUS pay area to 22.10% in the San Jose-San Francisco pay area, and 15.94% in theWashington, DC, pay area. The nationwide average net pay increase, if the ECI and locality-basedcomparability payments were granted as required by law, would have been 13.06% in 2005.", "Locality Pay Areas and Boundaries for 2005. The council recommended continuation of 29 of the 32 locality pay areas that existed in 2004. TheKansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis locality pay areas were recommended to become part of the\"Rest of the United States\" pay area, as discussed below under the section on locations with pay gapsbelow RUS. The council also recommended that the new Office of Management and Budget (OMB)definitions for metropolitan statistical areas be used to define locality pay area boundaries. Underthis recommendation, the largest defined areas, called Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) would beused; the new Micropolitan Statistical Areas would be used only when part of larger CSAs; and theOMB definitions for counties in New England would be used. (20)", "Locations with Pay Gaps Below the \"Rest of the United States\" Pay Area. In previous years, the council recommended that areas with pay gapsbelow the pay gap in RUS receive the same adjustment as RUS. Under the methodology which hasbeen used since locality pay was first implemented in 1994, areas with little data available in BLSsurveys and pay gaps that were two-tenths of a percentage point (0.2%) or more below RUS or belowthe RUS pay area for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas, and theresources used to conduct these surveys were to be redirected to survey new locations. Under theOCSP surveys, pay gaps in four areas -- Huntsville, Indianapolis, Kansas City, and Orlando -- arebelow RUS in 2003 and have been below or close to RUS for several years. Under the NCS surveys,pay gaps in five areas -- Columbus, Dayton, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis -- are below RUSin 2003.", "Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis are below RUS under the weighted averages of both the OCSP and NCS surveys. For 2005, the council recommended that salary surveys in these areas bediscontinued and that the three areas become part of RUS. The resources previously used to conductsurveys in Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis would be used to carry out surveys \"in as many ofthe following locations as possible\": Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ MSA; Memphis, TN-MS-ARMSA; Austin-Round Rock, TX MSA; Louisville-Elizabethtown-Scottsberg, KY-IN CSA;Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Tonawanda, NY MSA; and Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC CSA. These six areashave more than 2,500 General Schedule (GS) employees, a nonfarm workforce of more than375,000, and a BLS pay differential of greater than five percent when compared to the RUS paydifferential. The additional areas listed above are ranked by GS employment totals. The councilrecommended that the additional areas be surveyed in the order in which they are listed. (21)", "Evaluating Areas in the Vicinity of Locality Pay Areas. To evaluate areas currently in the \"Rest of the United States\" payarea for possible inclusion in adjacent locality pay areas, the council recommended the followingcriteria.", "For adjacent MSAs and CSAs : To be included in an adjacent locality pay area, an adjacent MSA or CSA currently in the RUS locality pay area must haveat least 1,500 GS employees and an employment interchange measure (22) of at least 7.5percent.", "For adjacent counties that are not part of a multi-county MSA or CSA : To be included in an adjacent locality pay area, an adjacent county thatis currently in the RUS locality pay area must have at least 400 GS employees and an employmentinterchange measure of at least 7.5 percent.", "For federal facilities that cross locality pay area boundaries : To be included in an adjacent locality pay area, that portion of a federal facility outsideof a higher-paying locality pay area must have at least 750 GS employees; the duty stations of themajority of these employees must be within 10 miles of the separate locality pay area; and asignificant number of these employees must commute to work from the higher-paying locality payarea. (23)", "For counties currently included in an MSA-based locality pay area that would be excluded under the new MSA and CSA definitions : To continueto be included in the locality pay area, any county (or portion of a county in the case of York County,ME, where the full county was never in the adjacent locality pay area), must have an employmentinterchange rate of at least 15% . (24)", "The council also recommended that \"areas already included in a locality pay area as a result of the new criteria should not be subject to further review.\" (25)", "Requests for Changes in Locality Pay Area Boundaries. Under another council recommendation, requests for changesin the boundaries of locality pay areas, to be considered by the council, would have to include thefollowing information.", "The credentials of the requesting group establishing how the group represents GS employees in the area.", "Identification of the geographic area covered by theproposal.", "The number of GS employees in the area by agency.", "A detailed explanation of why the area should be added to the adjacent localitypay area.", "Current job vacancy rates in the area for GS positions.", "Documentation of recruitment or retention problems for GS employees in thearea.", "Documentation that agencies have tried other pay flexibilities, includingrequests for special salary rates and use of recruitment, retention, and relocation payments, and thatthese flexibilities did not solve recruitment and retention problems.", "An indication that the headquarters of affected agencies know about andsupport the request.", "Distance measures by road between the requesting area and the locality payarea.", "A summary of transportation facilities linking the requesting area and thelocality pay area, including commuter rail or other mass transit facilities.", "Agency organizational relationships between activities covered by the proposaland activities in another locality pay area.

The council, in its memorandum to the Pay Agent on the 2001 locality payments (submitted on October 22, 1999),recommended that five improvements be made in the BLS National Compensation Survey program. The council provided a progress report on the improvements in its memorandum to the Pay Agenton the 2005 locality payments. The improvements and progress to date are the following.", "Use three factors, rather than nine, to assign the correct federal grade levels to the non-federal jobs surveyed, and provide grade level guides for occupational families. \"OPM hascompleted development of a four-factor evaluation system for use in the surveys, and BLS hassuccessfully used the new approach in field tests and has already begun to use the Knowledge FactorGuide.

After considering the council's recommendations, the Pay Agent endorsed them in its December 4, 2003, annual reportto the President on the 2005 locality payments. The Pay Agent stated that \"it would be unwise toallow the locality pay increases shown in [its] report to take effect in January 2005\" because of \"thecurrent national emergency.\" (28) The endorsementof the council's recommendations on defininglocality pay areas was tentatively approved. According to the Pay Agent, OPM, on the Agent'sbehalf, will publish a notice in the Federal Register in 2004 to explain the proposed changes to thelocality pay area boundaries and solicit public comments. The final rule will be published in timefor implementation in January 2005.

Thisproposal makes use of new criteria for evaluating areas adjacent to locality pay areas. The proposedregulations would retain all of the existing locality pay areas, which would be expanded to includea number of additional locations. (30)", "According to OPM, under the proposed changes, about 15,000 (31) General Schedule (GS)employees would move from the Rest of the United States pay area to metropolitan locality pay areasand \"about 16,000 GS employees [would be retained] in metropolitan locality pay areas that wouldhave been excluded if only the new MSA definitions were used.\" (32) OPM accepted comments on theproposed regulations through November 8, 2004.", "The final regulations were published in the Federal Register on December 17, 2004, and became effective immediately upon publication so as to be applicable for the January 2005 payadjustment. In its discussion accompanying the regulations, OPM noted that on October 21, 2004,the Federal Salary Council recommended to the Pay Agent that the York-Hanover-Gettysburg, PACSA, having met the criteria for inclusion, be added to the Washington-Baltimore locality pay area. The Pay Agent endorsed this recommendation and it was incorporated into the final rule. (33)", "The Pay Agent estimated that the cost of the January 2005 locality-based comparability payments would be about $8 billion if the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of thetarget gap to 5% were provided in January 2005 as required by FEPCA. (34) Table 1 shows thecouncil's and the Pay Agent's recommended locality payments for January 2005.", "As for the recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, the Pay Agent reiterated that those focused on matching federal and non-federal jobs, excludingrandomly selected non-federal jobs that would be classified above GS-15 in the government, andproblems associated with random selection of survey jobs, have been implemented. Improvementsfocused on assigning GS grades to randomly selected survey jobs and to randomly selected surveyjobs with supervisory duties will be phased-in beginning in 2004. (35)", "In endorsing the council's recommendation that Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis become part of the \"Rest of the United States\" pay area, the Pay Agent asked the BLS to discontinue salarysurveys in these three areas as soon as feasible and begin augmenting existing surveys in as manyof the six areas identified by the council as possible. (The six areas, as stated above, arePhoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ MSA; Memphis, TN-MS-AR MSA; Austin-Round Rock, TX MSA;Louisville-Elizabethtown-Scottsberg, KY-IN CSA; Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Tonawanda, NY MSA;and Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC CSA.) BLS is to formulate a survey plan and report to the Pay Agentin August 2004 \"on how many of the new areas could be surveyed for locality pay purposes andunder what timeline.\" (36)", "OPM's proposed regulations on locality pay area boundaries published in the Federal Register on September 22, 2004, state that further review revealed that \"it would be advisable to continue tomonitor the disparity between Federal and non-Federal pay levels in the Kansas City, Orlando, andSt. Louis areas before determining whether those areas should be discontinued.\" (37) The finalregulations note that the Federal Salary Council recommended to the Pay Agent on October 21,2004, that the Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis pay areas be discontinued in 2006. OPM, onbehalf of the Pay Agent, will publish proposed regulations to implement this recommendation in2005. (38)", "The Pay Agent stated that, while it supported updating the boundaries of locality pay areas, such changes were \"an interim measure, pending fundamental reforms in the Federal white-collar paysystem.\" The Agent has \"serious concerns about the utility of a process that requires a singlepercentage adjustment in the pay of all white-collar civilian Federal employees in each locality payarea without regard to the differing labor markets for major occupational groups or the performanceof individual employees.\" (39)", "The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment. In 1993, a draft memorandum from the Pay Agent to the Federal Salary Councilconcluded that \"the current methodology is flawed because the completeness of the data variesgreatly among survey areas, because the gaps are not credible in light of other labor marketindicators, and because the single percentage adjustment for all jobs in a locality is a poor reflectionof market realities.\" (40) Despite these concerns,OPM has never submitted a legislative proposal toCongress to amend FEPCA. A white paper on compensation issued by OPM in April 2002 reviewedcurrent policies and the need for more flexibility in setting General Schedule pay, but did not includeany recommendations. (41)", "In August 2004, the Coalition for Effective Change (42) released a paper which strongly endorsedimplementation of a pay-for-performance system in the federal government. Among the factors thegroup identified as essential to establishing such a system are that it be flexible, reviewable,periodically evaluated and adjusted, and adequately funded. (43) Reform of the federal government'spay and performance management systems is identified as a top priority in a report entitled \"OPM'sGuiding Principles for Civil Service Transformation,\" posted on the agency's website on October25, 2004. The report advocates government-wide legislation that provides personnel flexibilitiessimilar to those provided to the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense to other executivebranch agencies. Broad pay bands are one such flexibility. (44)", "Once both the annual and locality pay percentage amounts are determined, the actual pay rates are calculated as follows. First, the basic General Schedule (GS) is increased by the annualadjustment percentage, resulting in a new GS schedule. These new basic GS rates are then increasedby the locality payment. The resulting pay rates (annual + locality) are compared with the 2004 payrates (annual + locality) to derive the net increase in pay for 2005."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The President's Recommendation for FY2005", "paragraphs": ["President George W.

(45) The statutory annual pay adjustmentrequired in January 2005 is 2.5%. If the Presidentwanted to change the required rate of the annual adjustment, he would have had to submit analternative plan for the annual adjustment to Congress by September 1, 2004. He did not issue analternative plan. To change the amount of locality-based comparability payments, he had to submitan alternative plan for the locality payments to Congress by November 30, 2004; otherwise thedouble-digit percentages stated in the Pay Agent report for the locality payments would have becomeeffective.", "The President issued such an alternative plan on November 29, 2004, which stated that the locality pay percentages in effect for 2004 would continue for 2005.
