However, the program has come under scrutiny for slow expenditure of funds and for displacing poor families. Reflecting these criticisms, the Bush Administration requested no new funding for the program in each budget request from FY2004-FY2009, and the Obama Administration requested no new funding (proposing, instead, that Congress fund a new program) in the FY2010 and FY2011 budget requests. Congress responded by continuing to fund the program, but at less than a quarter of what it had been funded at in FY2003 and prior years. In FY2012, for the first time since the program's inception, Congress provided no new funding for HOPE VI.", "Created in 1992 and administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the HOPE VI program provides funds to renovate or demolish existing public housing and replace it with mixed-income housing. The local public housing authorities (PHAs) that administer public housing apply for grants and use the funds to leverage other private and public resources. The main component of the HOPE VI program is revitalization grants, which can be used for demolition, rehabilitation, and new construction of public housing, as well as land acquisition, relocation of residents, and community and supportive services for residents. HUD has also provided demolition-only grants that could be used\u2014often in conjunction with revitalization grants\u2014for the physical destruction of distressed public housing and the relocation of its residents, although no demolition grants have been issued for several years. A third type of grant, planning grants, are no longer awarded, but could be used for technical assistance in preparing a property to go through a demolition or revitalization. Another type of revitalization grant, Main Street Revitalization Grants, was created in 2003. They are available to local governments in small communities rather than PHAs for main street revitalization projects, which may be unrelated to public housing.", "Over the history of the program, 268 HOPE VI revitalization grants (incluing Main Street grants) have been made to PHAs in 41 states, districts, and territories. As of June 2009, the program had been responsible for the demolition of 93,295 units of public housing and the construction or substantial rehabilitation of 78,692 replacement units.", "The HOPE VI program has helped transform a number of severely distressed neighborhoods, which has made the program popular with many members of Congress from both parties. The program's authorization was set to expire at the end of FY2006, but Congress has extended the authorization for the program each year in the annual appropraitions acts.", "Beginning with its FY2010 budget request to Congress, the Obama Administration has requested that Congress replace the HOPE VI program with a new program, the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CNI), which would expand the scope of HOPE VI beyond public housing to other assisted housing, with a greater focus on neighborhood revitalization. The House Financial Services approved authorizing legislation in the 111th Congress, but it was not enacted before the end of the session. Congress did fund a demonstration of CNI in the FY2010-FY2012 HUD appropriations act. FY2012 was the first year since the HOPE VI program began that it received no new appropriations. However, the FY2012 appropriations law (P.L. 112-55) did extend the authorization for the program."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["HOPE VI is a public housing reform program. Through HOPE VI, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides funds to rehabilitate or demolish public housing and replace it with housing that serves both the poor as well as the middle class. In order to understand HOPE VI and its issues, it is important to first understand a brief history of the larger public housing program. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of Public Housing", "paragraphs": ["The Low-Rent Public Housing program was created as a part of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (P.L. 75-412). The Depression-era program was intended to stimulate construction activity, clear slums, and provide low-rent housing to poor families. As designed under the act, public housing is built and operated by local, quasi-governmental, public housing authorities (PHAs). Tenants who live in public housing typically pay 30% of their adjusted gross incomes toward rent, although they can opt for a market-based flat rent and PHAs can choose to institute minimum rents of up to $50 per month. PHAs are able to keep public housing rents low because local governments provide property tax reductions and the federal government provides both capital and operating subsidies to supplement the low rents paid by tenants.", "From its inception, public housing has faced a number of barriers to success. Many communities were resistant to accepting public housing. This opposition, paired with strict federal rules about how much could be spent to build a unit of public housing, led to the construction of public housing developments in undesirable areas, such as near railroad tracks, highways, and industrial zones. The housing that was constructed was often high-density, high-rise structures. This form of development has often been characterized as \"the projects.\" In addition to location and construction problems, many projects faced management problems. Although many public housing projects were run by effective and efficient PHAs, others had inexperienced PHAs, or in some cases, negligent PHAs, who were unable or unwilling to deal with problems as they arose.", "Furthermore, PHA budgets were often insufficient to maintain the properties. It was thought at the time the program was created that most tenants would be working adults whose incomes would increase until their economic situation improved enough that they could move out of public housing. This was the case in the early years of the program. However, policies that adopted rent levels based on incomes rather than operating costs and gave priority to the elderly and disabled, paired with changing demographics and a growth in single-mother-headed households, resulted in a population of public housing residents that was very different than originally envisioned. Today, about half of public housing residents are elderly or disabled and about half are non-elderly, non-disabled single-adult-headed households, the majority with children. Of those non-elderly, non-disabled households, only about half have income from work, while the other half either receive some form of cash assistance, such as welfare, or report no income. Today's public housing serves the very poor, who are only required to pay a percentage of their income toward rent. Since the rent that PHAs receive from tenants is so low, public housing is dependent on congressional appropriations, and the budget has not always kept up with need. Many units of public housing fell into disrepair, and some units had to be left vacant because they were no longer habitable. Public housing, over time, became known for terrible living conditions. Research has shown that communities with high concentrations of poverty often fall victim to myriad social ills. The often dense, high-rise structures of public housing became riddled with crime, drugs, and violence.", "Public housing was the primary government housing program for the poor until the late 1970s. However, out of growing concern about the problems with public housing, and other government-subsidized housing construction programs, President Nixon declared a moratorium on federal housing construction programs in 1973. In 1974, Congress authorized the Section 8 program, which provided subsidies to allow low-income families to live in private market housing. It was hoped that through partnerships with the private sector, the Section 8 program could avoid the problems faced by public housing. The Section 8 program also introduced tenant-based assistance, which subsidized tenants rather than units, giving tenants the option to move. Tenant-based assistance has grown in popularity, partially out of the hope that it can prevent concentrations of poverty in neighborhoods. Over time, Section 8 overtook public housing as the government's largest housing program for the poor; today, almost twice as many households are served by Section 8 than are housed in public housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Basis for HOPE VI", "paragraphs": ["Although new construction of public housing had ended by the early 1970s, over 1 million units of public housing were still occupied, and many were still plagued by problems. In order to determine how to deal with the existing stock of public housing, Congress created the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing ( P.L. 101-235 ) in 1989. The commission was mandated to identify those public housing projects that were in a severe state of distress; assess the most promising strategies for improvement; and develop a national action plan.", "In 1992, the commission issued its findings and recommendations on the state of the nation's public housing. The commission labeled 6% of the public housing stock as severely distressed, at the time, equal to 86,000 units.

Addressing management needs : recommendations included providing funding for security, further tying PHA funding to performance, and promoting income-mixing in public housing. Other strategies : recommendations included encouraging PHAs to pursue private and non-profit management opportunities, increasing and improving available data on public housing, creating a new office on severely distressed public housing at HUD, and encouraging Congress to authorize a new partnership program between PHAs, non-profits, the private sector, and residents to attract additional resources to public housing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "History of HOPE VI", "paragraphs": ["HOPE VI began as a demonstration program, created in reaction to the findings of the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing.

Under the demonstration, the Secretary of HUD was to choose 15 cities, based on need, to receive up to $50 million each to revitalize distressed public housing. Each city was required to spend 80% of its funds toward the capital costs of major reconstruction, rehabilitation and other physical improvements, the capital costs of replacement units and/or Section 8 certificates, management improvements for the reconstructed project, and for planning and technical assistance purposes. The remaining 20% was to be used for community and supportive services. PHAs were required to match 15% of all funds provided.", "From 1993 until 1998, the Urban Revitalization Demonstration, now commonly referred to as HOPE VI, continued to receive funding through annual appropriations bills; however, the program remained unauthorized. The law governing the program was contained within annual appropriations bills and the requirements for eligibility and funding changed from year to year. HUD administered the law not through regulation, but in the directions it issued along with each annual Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA), to which communities would apply for HOPE VI funding. Changes to the program, in addition to those mandated by annual appropriations laws, were included in these NOFAs.", "The FY1999 HUD appropriations bill ( P.L. 105-276 ) included a major public housing reform initiative, the Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (QHWRA), that authorized the HOPE VI program. QHWRA codified four purposes for the program:", "improving the living environment for public housing residents of severely distressed public housing projects through the demolition, rehabilitation, reconfiguration, or replacement of obsolete public housing projects (or portions thereof); revitalizing sites (including remaining public housing dwelling units) on which such public housing projects are located and contributing to the improvement of the surrounding neighborhood; providing housing that will avoid or decrease the concentration of very low-income families; and building sustainable communities.", "In the law, severely distressed public housing was defined as public housing that", "requires major redesign, reconstruction or redevelopment, or partial or total demolition; is a significant contributing factor to the physical decline of and disinvestment by public and private entities in the surrounding neighborhood; is occupied predominantly by families that are very low-income families with children, unemployed, and dependent on various forms of public assistance; or has high rates of vandalism and criminal activity (including drug-related criminal activity) in comparison to other housing in the area; cannot be revitalized through assistance under other programs because of cost constraints and inadequacy of available amounts; and is lacking in sufficient appropriate transportation, supportive services, economic opportunity, schools, civic and religious institutions, and public services, resulting in severe social distress in the project.", "QHWRA authorized funding for HOPE VI through the end of FY2002 and included a sunset clause which stated that no assistance could be provided to the program after September 30, 2002.

For example, PHAs must match 5% of their HOPE VI grant award with other resources and must match, dollar-for-dollar, any amount over 5% of the grant amount that is used for community and supportive services for residents. If a PHA is not successfully meeting its deadlines or requirements, HUD has the authority to penalize the PHA either by appointing some form of receiver or by rescinding grant funds.

To learn more about what has happened to displaced residents, the Urban Institute conducted a study that looked at the living conditions of former residents of eight HOPE VI sites that had been relocated either with vouchers or to other public housing units, several years after their initial relocation. Their study found that, overall, relocated tenants lived in safer, healthier communities and better housing after relocation.

This was especially true in 1996, when Congress set aside grants for a set of PHAs outside of any competitive process. A 2003 GAO report found that the majority of revitalization grantees had missed at least one of the deadlines established in their grant agreements.", "HUD has worked to address several of these problems. Over time, the process for selecting grantees has become more competitive, and HUD now uses a number of criteria to judge applicants' capacity for undertaking these complicated development projects. For example, recent revitalization NOFAs have included rating factors that reward applicant and developer capacity and deduct points from applicants with previous HOPE VI grants that are behind in development.", "There is reason to believe that more recent HOPE VI grantees have performed better than earlier grantees. HUD's FY2006 2 nd Quarter HOPE VI Progress Report to Congress included information demonstrating the improved performance of more recent cohorts of grantees on a number of administrative performance measures. For example, the number of days it took more recent grantees (those from FY2002 through FY2004) from the execution of their grant agreement to the approval of their revitalization plan averaged 177 days, compared to an average of over 600 days for older grantees (those from FY1993 through FY2001). Pre-2002 grantees took an average of over 1,100 days to get approval of their mixed finance proposals, compared to an average of about 356 days for FY2002 and later grantees. These improvements may be due, in part, to more robust selection criteria used by HUD in choosing grantees, greater PHA experience and familiarity with HOPE VI-like mixed finance developments, and more focus by HUD on interim performance measures.", "Another important change has come in the way that Congress provides funding to the HOPE VI program. Prior to FY2002, HOPE VI was provided with no-year funding, meaning that the funds provided by Congress remained available to the grantee until they were spent. Beginning in FY2002, Congress adopted a one-year obligation and a five-year expenditure deadline for HOPE VI funds. Any HOPE VI funds remaining unspent at the end of that period will expire and revert back to the Treasury. This change in funding should effectively solve the problem of future accumulations of unspent balances. The FY2002 cohort of grantees were the first to experience an expiration of funds; $13 million of FY2002 grant funds expired at the end of FY2008 before they could be used by grantees. FY2003 grantees had about $10 million expire in FY2009 and FY2004 grantees had less than $1 million expire in FY2010.", "At the end of FY2010, unspent balances in the HOPE VI fund had been reduced from their peak of $3.3 billion in FY2003 to under $700 million. As illustrated in Figure 2 , just about one-third of that amount (33%) is funding that will not expire. The remaining 67% of those funds will expire if not spent within six years of their award.", "Over time, the remaining balance of unspent, no-year funds (awarded pre-FY2002) has been declining. As shown in Figure 2 , of the $4.9 billion in no-year funding awarded to grantees prior to FY2002, just under $255 million remained at the end of FY2010. That balance has been reduced significantly in recent years; at the beginning of FY2002, the unspent balance of no-year funds was over $3 billion. Outlays among the pre-FY2002 grantees have been relatively constant in recent years, with pre-2002 grantees spending between 20%-30% of their remaining funding each year for the past five years. HUD has taken a number of steps to encourage these earlier grantees to spend their funds, including hiring grant expediters to provide technical assistance to grantees. Also, as noted earlier, HUD has also used poor performance on a HOPE VI grant as a factor in deciding to place a PHA in receivership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Over the history of federal housing programs, priorities have shifted from providing publicly constructed and owned housing for low-income families to providing subsidies, either to the private market to build low-cost, private housing, or to residents for use in the private market. One of the main reasons for this shift was the finding that it was more expensive to build and maintain publicly owned housing than it was to provide subsidies to the private market. As a result, the government has not funded the development of new public housing units for many years. Grantees can use HOPE VI funds, in conjunction with other public and private funds, to build replacement units of public housing. Given what is known about the past cost-effectiveness of the construction of public housing, questions can be raised as to whether this is an effective use of limited government dollars. HUD testified before Congress in 2003 that it is not an efficient method. According to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, the division that oversees the HOPE VI program:", "Moreover, it is evident to us that HOPE VI is not an efficient method for meeting the current and future capital needs of the public housing program. The average cost of building a unit under HOPE VI is $120,000, more than 33% greater than the average cost of building a similar unit using the HOME block grant program. Given overall budget constraints, it just doesn't make sense for us to continue funding for this program at the expense of more cost effective programs to serve the same ends.", "Taking a different look at the costs of HOPE VI, researchers at the Urban Institute attempted to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of HOPE VI redevelopment compared to maintaining the status quo in distressed public housing. Their study contrasted the up-front costs of undertaking a HOPE VI development (including HOPE VI and other government funding, but excluding equity generated by LIHTCs) to the savings to the government that could result from undertaking the redevelopment. They estimate savings from reduced housing subsidy needs (since new buildings require lower subsidies and are likely to be more energy efficient), improved family well-being (lower welfare, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, and criminal justice system costs), and improved neighborhoods (increased property tax revenue). The Urban Institute study estimates that a prototypical distressed public housing project, undergoing a HOPE VI mixed income redevelopment, could save the government more than $20 million over 20 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "One-for-One Replacement", "paragraphs": ["The loss of the nation's stock of publicly assisted housing, affordable to low-income families, has been a concern for a number of years.

As of March 2006, HOPE VI revitalization grantees planned to demolish 88,469 units of public housing, rehabilitate 10,993 units of existing public housing, and build 92,644 units of new housing\u2014only about half of which would be public housing units, a net loss of 41,000 public housing units. As of March 2006, 88% of the units planned for demolition had been demolished, and 54% of the public housing units slated for construction had been built, an interim net loss of over 50,000 units.", "Low-income housing advocates have expressed concern that HOPE VI is eroding the nation's stock of affordable housing, and many have argued that HUD should reinstate the one-for-one replacement requirement. They argue that, in many communities, there is simply a shortage of lower-cost housing and that the federal government has some responsibility to help increase, or at least maintain, the supply.", "The requirement that each unit of public housing destroyed be replaced with a new unit of public housing, called \"one-for-one replacement,\" was suspended in 1994 and fully repealed in 1996. Much of the impetus behind the suspension of the requirement was the argument put forward by PHAs that they were unable to deal with troubled public housing because the one-for-one replacement requirement, coupled with site standards, deconcentration requirements, limited funding, and other rules, made the demolition and revitalization process unworkable. At Congress's request, GAO investigated these issues and reported that PHAs were concerned that one-for-one replacement was resulting in developments becoming decrepit. In addition to development concerns, critics of one-for-one replacement argued that it promoted concentrations of poverty, did not appeal to investors, and that the low rents paid by public housing residents would not allow projects to remain financially viable.", "PHA groups have contended that reinstating traditional one-for-one replacement will again hamper their ability to undertake housing rehabilitation. Further, there are questions about how one-for-one replacement could affect efforts to deconcentrate poverty.

While Choice Neighborhood grant funding is to be primarily focused on the transformation of distressed housing, the funding could also be used, on a limited basis, for improvements to the surrounding community. HOPE VI funding can only be used for public housing demolition and development and related supportive services (including relocation). Choice Neighborhood grants are targeted to distressed neighborhoods with assisted housing and severely distressed public housing developments. HOPE VI grants are limited to severely distressed public housing developments. While the Choice Neighborhoods initiative has received some support for its concept of broadening the focus beyond public housing, it has also been met with concerns. Those concerns include whether the program will have the same displacement and loss of affordable housing stock effects as HOPE VI, and whether in a limited funding environment CNI, with its broader pool of eligible applicants, will lead to more entities competing for a limited pot of funds, resulting in less funding available for public housing.
