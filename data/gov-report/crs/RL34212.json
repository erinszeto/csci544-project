As lenders and borrowers work to resolve indebtedness issues, some transactions are resulting in cancellation of debt. Mortgage debt cancellation can occur when lenders restructure loans, reducing principal balances, or sell properties, either in advance, or as a result, of foreclosure proceedings. Historically, if a lender forgives or cancels such debt, tax law has treated it as cancellation of debt (COD) income subject to tax. Exceptions have been available for taxpayers who are insolvent or in bankruptcy, among others\u2014these taxpayers may exclude canceled mortgage debt income under existing law.", "The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-142) signed into law on December 20, 2007, temporarily excluded qualified COD income.

Policymakers have expressed concern that households experiencing hardship and that are in danger of losing their home, presumably as a result of financial distress, should not incur an additional hardship by being taxed on canceled debt income.

Specifically, the taxpayer must reduce certain beneficial tax attributes, including basis in property, that would otherwise decrease the taxpayer's income or tax liability in future years. The attributes are reduced until the reductions generally account for the excluded amount. As a result of the attribute reduction, the taxpayer may be subject to tax on the excluded COD income in years following the year of discharge\u2014in other words, the tax on the COD income is deferred.", "In addition to the IRC Section 108 exclusions, there are several other circumstances under which COD income may be excluded. For example, a taxpayer with nonrecourse, as opposed to recourse, debt will not realize COD income.

It also includes refinancing of this debt, to the extent that the refinancing does not exceed the amount of refinanced indebtedness. The taxpayer was required to reduce the basis in their principal residence by the amount of the excluded income.

By this definition, a forgiven loan is income: a canceled debt reduces a taxpayer's liabilities, and thus increases net worth.

Alternatively, the home could have been sold as a result of foreclosure with a sales price of $180,000 along with a lender agreement to cancel the remaining debt. The $20,000 discharge is income and, assuming no exclusion applies and the same tax rate, generates the same tax liability. This is in addition to any taxes the taxpayer may owe on the gain from the sale of the house.", "On the other hand, if the taxpayer is able to exclude the COD income, as is temporarily allowed in certain circumstances, then the $20,000 discharge is not included in gross income and the taxpayer does not owe the $5,600 tax liability. As previously mentioned, current law stipulates that the excluded COD income be accounted for through reducing the basis in the residence.", "The impact of such basis adjustment could differ, depending on whether the home is retained or lost, if the taxpayer owes taxes when the house is disposed. A taxpayer who retains the house and sells a later year, while accounting for the excluded COD income through basis adjustment, defers taxes owed on the disposition until the year of sale.", "In contrast, the tax consequences would depend on the timing of the basis adjustment for a taxpayer that loses a home. If basis is reduced in the year following discharge, as under IRC Section 1017, then the excluded COD income could not be accounted for because the taxpayer had already disposed of the home.

This is likely to occur because an exclusion of a given amount is more valuable to persons with higher marginal tax rates. This effect is magnified if homeownership is more concentrated among upper-income individuals.", "At this point, an example may be useful for illustrating the effect income tax exclusions can have on the tax system's progressivity. Consider two individual homeowners, both of whom incur $20,000 in COD income. The tax benefit differs when the taxpayers are in different tax brackets. The value of the exclusion for a homeowner with lower income, who may be in the 15% income tax bracket, is $3,000, while the value to another homeowner, with higher income and thus in the higher 28% bracket, is $5,600.

Three principal tax provisions for owner-occupied housing currently exist in the tax code: the deduction for mortgage interest, the exclusion of gain on the sales of homes, and the deduction of state and local real estate taxes. When combined these three provisions result in over $125 billion in reduced federal revenue annually. Some economists feel that this preferential tax treatment encourages households to overinvest in housing and less in business investments that might contribute more to increasing the nation's productivity and output.", "On the other hand, some analysts might argue that the provision should be permanent. A case could be made that a temporary provision is unfair because there is no difference between an individual experiencing canceled debt income in 2010, when foreclosure rates were relatively high compared to three or four years from now, when foreclosure rates may be lower.

The ownership test requires the taxpayer to have owned the house for two of the last five years, while the use test requires the owner to have lived in the house for at least two years out of the last five years. Limiting the exclusion of capital gains in this manner was designed to minimize the possibility that investors, rather than owner-occupants, would exclude capital gains from taxation.

One option is that there be no \"attribute reduction\" requirement. Alternatively, homeowners could be required to reduce specified tax attributes that include, but are not limited to, basis in the residence (e.g., taxpayers would be able to reduce basis in property other than the home subject to the discharged mortgage). A third option would be to require basis reduction in the taxpayer's residence. All taxpayers would benefit from the first option by not accounting for the excluded COD income. Taxpayer preference between the second option and the third option would depend on his or her circumstances (e.g., whether the taxpayer has basis in other property that would have to be reduced in the event of insufficient basis in the residence).

If basis is adjusted, one option could be to make the proposal consistent with current law, under which basis adjustment occurs in the year following discharge of the debt. Alternatively, basis adjustment could occur earlier (e.g., at the time of discharge or exclusion). If basis adjustment occurred in the year after discharge, homeowners losing their home at the time of debt cancellation would have already disposed of the property.", "The requirement that a basis adjustment in the amount of cancelled debt suggests a desire by policymakers for homeowners to account for the benefit of the cancelled debt.
