Section 215 enlarged the scope of materials that could be sought under FISA to include \"any tangible thing.\" It also lowered the standard required before a court order may be issued to compel their production.", "A third amendment to FISA was enacted in 2004, as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA). Section 6001(a) of the IRTPA changed the rules regarding the types of individuals who may be targets of FISA-authorized searches.

The applicable standard was changed to require \"a statement of facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things sought are relevant to a [foreign intelligence, international terrorism, or espionage investigation.]\" Under this standard, records are presumptively relevant if they pertain to:", "a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; the activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of such authorized investigation; or an individual in contact with, or known to, a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of such authorized investigation.", "Beginning in 2006, the government began to use orders of the FISC issued pursuant to Section 215 to collect large amounts of domestic telephone metadata in bulk with the goal of helping to detect and identify individuals who were part of terrorist networks. This program is frequently described as collecting telephone metadata \"in bulk\" to distinguish it from the narrower collection of metadata pertaining to an identified individual or group of individuals that is commonplace in both law enforcement and national security investigations. ", "Following the public disclosure of these bulk intelligence activities, Section 215 was amended by the USA FREEDOM Act to additionally require the use of a \"specific selection term\" (SST) to \"limit collection to the greatest extent reasonably practicable.\" An SST was defined as \"a term that specifically identifies a person, account, address, or personal device, or any other specific identifier.\" These amendments also expressly prohibited orders under Section 215 that are limited only by broad geographic terms (such as a state or zip code) or named communications service providers (such as Verizon or AT&T). ", "A slightly relaxed standard can be used under the amended Section 215 to obtain telephone metadata on an ongoing basis, but only for international terrorism investigations. Whereas a standard order under Section 215 would produce only those records that are responsive to an approved SST, an order seeking telephone records for an international terrorism investigation can also be used to produce a second set of telephone records that are not themselves responsive to an approved SST, but that are connected to one of the records that was directly produced by an SST. For example, if Alice called Bob, and Bob also called Charles, then a single Section 215 order that used Alice's phone number as an SST could obtain records of the call to Bob as well as records of the call from Bob to Charles. In order to take advantage of this increased scope of production, the government would need to demonstrate to the FISC that there was a \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" that the SST is associated with a foreign power, or an agent of a foreign power, who was engaged in international terrorism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nondisclosure and Judicial Review", "paragraphs": ["Orders issued under Section 215, as amended, are accompanied by nondisclosure orders prohibiting the recipients from disclosing that the FBI has sought or obtained any tangible things pursuant to a FISA order.

During the examination of the events leading up to the attacks, it was reported that investigations regarding Moussaoui's involvement were hampered by limitations in FISA authorities. Specifically, FBI agents investigating Moussaoui suspected that he had planned a terrorist attack involving piloting commercial airliners, and had detained him in August 2001 on an immigration charge. The FBI agents then sought a court order under FISA to examine the contents of Moussaoui's laptop computer. However, the agency apparently concluded that it had insufficient information at that time to demonstrate that Moussaoui was an agent of a foreign power as then required by FISA.", "Prior to its amendment, FISA authorized the FISC to approve, among other things, physical searches of a laptop only if probable cause existed to believe the laptop was owned or used by a foreign power or its agent. The definition of a \"foreign power\" included \"groups engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor.\" Individuals involved in international terrorism for or on behalf of those groups were considered \"agents of a foreign power.\" In the weeks leading up to the attacks, it appears that the FBI encountered an actual or perceived insufficiency of information demonstrating probable cause to believe that Moussaoui was acting for or on behalf of an identifiable group engaged in international terrorism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Responses", "paragraphs": ["Following these revelations, a number of legislative proposals were put forth to amend the definition of \"agents of a foreign power\" under FISA so that individuals engaged in international terrorism need not be linked to a specific foreign power.

Section 6001 of the legislation, known as the \"lone wolf\" provision, provides that persons, other than citizens or permanent residents of the United States, who are engaged in international terrorism are presumptively considered to be agents of a foreign power. The provision obviates any need to provide an evidentiary connection between an individual and a foreign government or terrorist group.", "Critics of the \"lone wolf\" provision argued that the laptop in the Moussaoui case could have been lawfully searched under FISA or the laws governing generic criminal warrants. Critics also expressed concern that the simplified \"lone wolf\" standard would lead to \"FISA serving as a substitute for some of our most important criminal laws.\"", "Proponents of the provision noted that the increased self-organization among terror networks has made proving connections to identifiable groups more difficult.

First, the location or facility that was the subject of surveillance had to be identified. Second, only identifiable third parties could be directed by the government to facilitate electronic surveillance. Conducting electronic surveillance frequently requires the assistance of telecommunications providers, landlords, or other third parties. Furthermore, telecommunications providers are generally prohibited from assisting in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, except as authorized by FISA. In cases where the location or facility was unknown, the identity of the person needed to assist the government could not be specified in the order. Therefore, limiting the class of persons that could be directed to assist the government by a FISA court order effectively limited the reach to known and identifiable locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 206 and \"Other Persons\"", "paragraphs": ["Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended Section 105(c)(2)(B) of FISA.

These modifications have the effect of permitting FISA orders to direct unspecified individuals to assist the government in performing electronic surveillance, thus permitting court orders to authorize surveillance of places or locations that are unknown at the time the order is issued.", "This section was further amended by the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 to require that the FISC be notified within 10 days after \"surveillance begins to be directed at any new facility or place.\" In addition, the FISC must be told the nature and location of each new facility or place, the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the new surveillance, a statement of any proposed minimization procedures (i.e., rules to limit the government's acquisition and dissemination of information involving United States citizens) that differ from those contained in the original application or order, and the total number of facilities or places subject to surveillance under the authority of the present order."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Particularity Requirement of the Fourth Amendment", "paragraphs": ["The Fourth Amendment imposes specific requirements upon the issuance of warrants authorizing searches of \"persons, houses, papers, and effects.\" One of the requirements, referred to as the particularity requirement, states that warrants shall \"particularly describ[e] the place to be searched.\" Under FISA, roving wiretaps are not required to identify the location that may be subject to surveillance. Therefore, some may argue that roving wiretaps do not comport with the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment. It is not clear that the Fourth Amendment would require that searches for foreign intelligence information be supported by a warrant, but prior legal challenges to similar provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act may be instructive in the event that challenges to Section 206 are brought alleging violations of the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment.", "Similar roving wiretaps have been permitted under Title III since 1986 in cases where the target of the surveillance takes actions to thwart such surveillance. The procedures under Title III are similar to those currently used under FISA, but two significant differences exist. First, a roving wiretap under Title III must definitively identify the target of the surveillance. Fixed wiretaps under Title III and all wiretaps under FISA need only identify the target if the target's identity is known. FISA permits roving wiretaps via court orders that only provide a specific description of the target. Second, Title III requires that the surveilled individuals be notified of the surveillance, generally 90 days after surveillance terminates. FISA contains no similar notification provision.", "In United States v. Petti , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was presented with a challenge to a roving wiretap under Title III alleging that roving wiretaps do not satisfy the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The court initially noted that", "the test for determining the sufficiency of the warrant description is whether the place to be searched is described with sufficient particularity to enable the executing officer to locate and identify the premises with reasonable effort, and whether there is any reasonable probability that another premise might be mistakenly searched.", "Applying this test, the Ninth Circuit held that roving wiretaps under Title III satisfied the particularity clause of the Fourth Amendment. The court in this case relied upon the fact that targets of roving wiretaps had to be identified and that they were only available where the target's actions indicated an intent to thwart electronic surveillance.", "Critics of roving wiretaps under FISA may argue that Section 206 increases the likelihood that innocent conversations will be the subject of electronic surveillance. They may further argue that the threat of these accidental searches of innocent persons is precisely the type of injury sought to be prevented by the particularity clause of the Fourth Amendment. Such a threat may be particularly acute in this case given the fact that there is no requirement under FISA that the target of a roving wiretap be identified, although the target must be specifically described."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Effect of Sunset Provisions", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, these three FISA amendments have been extended until December 15, 2019. If that date were to arrive without any extension, the amended FISA authorities would revert to their text as it appeared before the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act. For example, in the context of roving wiretaps, Section 105(c)(2) of FISA would read as it did on October 25, 2001, eliminating the authority for FISA court orders to direct other unspecified persons to assist with electronic surveillance. Likewise, regarding FISA orders for the production of documents, Sections 501 and 502 of FISA would read as they did on October 25, 2001, restricting the types of business records that are subject to FISA and reinstating the requirement for \"specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the person to whom the records pertain is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\"", "However, a grandfather clause applies to each of the three provisions. The grandfather clauses authorize the continued effect of the amendments with respect to investigations that began, or potential offenses that took place, before the provisions' sunset date. Thus, for example, if a non-U.S. person were engaged in international terrorism before the sunset date, he would still be considered a \"lone wolf\" for FISA court orders sought after the provision has expired. Similarly, if an individual is engaged in international terrorism before that date, he may be the target of a roving wiretap under FISA even if authority for new roving wiretaps expired."], "subsections": []}]}}
