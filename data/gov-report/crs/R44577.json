Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps.

The statutory formula stipulates that the increase in basic pay for 2017 will be 2.1% unless either (1) Congress passes a law to provide otherwise; or (2) the President specifies an alternative pay adjustment under subsection (e) of 37 U.S.C. \u00a71009.

For those living in the United States, the housing allowance is known as Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). BAH is based on three factors: paygrade (rank), geographic location, and whether the servicemember has dependents. Paygrade and dependency status are used to determine the type of accommodation\u2014or \"housing profile\"\u2014appropriate for the servicemember (for example, one-bedroom apartment, two-bedroom townhouse, or three-bedroom single family home). Geographic location is used to determine the average costs associated with each of these housing profiles. BAH rates are higher in some areas than others, but servicemembers of similar paygrade and dependent status should be able to pay for roughly comparable housing regardless of their duty location.", "Discussion: The Senate bill would have altered the way in which BAH was calculated in several ways. For covered servicemembers, BAH would be based only on geographic location and paygrade of recipient, eliminating dependents as a factor in the rate determination. The Senate bill would have based BAH on actual servicemember housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade, rather than the current specified rate. The provision would also have changed how BAH was paid to servicemembers who share the same living quarters, reducing it in relationship to the number of people sharing the quarters. That is, if two or more servicemembers were to occupy the same housing, the amount of the allowance could not exceed \"the amount of the allowance otherwise payable to such member ... divided by ... the total number of members occupying such housing.\" The new formula would have applied to certain members of the Armed Forces beginning on January 1, 2018. Members covered by the new provision would include servicemembers who first become entitled to basic pay on or after January 1, 2018, certain reserve and retired personnel ordered to active duty, and a servicemember entitled to the existing BAH on December 31, 2017, \"within a particular housing or overseas area\" and who \"after that date, loses uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing within an area of the United States or an area outside the United States, as applicable.\" The Senate provision also would have required the Secretary of Defense to submit the proposed regulations to implement this provision to the congressional defense committees by March 31, 2017. The House bill did not contain a similar provision.", "The enacted bill requires DOD to provide the House and Senate Armed Services Committee with a report\u2014by March 1, 2017\u2014on transitioning from the current pay structure to a new pay structure which would provide a \"single-salary pay system\" that is adequate to effectively recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force, but which eliminates Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The conference report contained the following language to describe the provision:", "The conferees note that the BAH, as an entitlement, and the perception of BAH among servicemembers, has evolved over the past 20 years. BAH, and the iterations of the benefit that came before, was intended to provide a housing benefit for servicemembers to offset the cost of housing in high cost housing areas where adequate government-provided quarters was not available and in recognition of the transient nature of military service and the impact it has on military members and their families. Indeed, that the housing allowance was and is intended as primarily a housing benefit is demonstrated by its tax-free nature, the differentiation based on dependency status, and the fact that junior enlisted personnel required to reside in barracks or on a ship are ineligible to receive BAH. Accordingly, the conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to begin planning for a transition to a salary system that better aligns the payment of the allowance with the Department's use of the housing allowance as compensation rather than its intended purpose as an allowance.", "Reference: CRS Report RL33446, Military Pay: Key Questions and Answers , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].

In the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 ( P.L. 114-92 ) a number of changes were enacted to modernize the reduce the retirement system by reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding 401k-type defined contribution element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment of retired pay, and adding continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will go into effect on January 1, 2018, for servicemembers entering on or after that date and those with 12 years or less of service on that date who are eligible and elect to enroll in the new system.", "Discussion : The military retirement system has historically been viewed as a significant incentive in retaining a career military force and any changes are closely followed by active duty military and veterans' groups. Reductions in the retired pay multiplier from 2.5% to 2.0% for those joining on or after January 1, 2018, under the new system created last year have raised concerns about the services' ability to retain certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point. The FY2016 NDAA ( P.L. 114-92 ) authorized DOD to provide continuation pay as a retention incentive at the completion of 12 years of service in return for an additional 4-year commitment to service. In conference, the House and Senate agreed on a provision (Section 633) that would authorize DOD the flexibility to pay continuation pay at any point between 8 to 12 years of service in return for an agreement for continued service of not less than 3 additional years. This provision will provide DOD more latitude in managing the personnel system through targeted continuation pay based on retention trends for specific military occupational specialties. ", "Section 633 of the enacted bill also adopts an amended House provision that amends 37 U.S.C. \u00a7356 procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members. It will allow members of a reserve component performing active Guard or Reserve duty when they accept continuation pay to receive the same minimum pay as active duty members. The calculation of maximum pay for active and reserve component members remains the same. ", "Section 635 of the Senate bill would have expressed the sense of Congress that default contributions to the TSP should be to a Roth plan. A Roth plan is taxable at the time of contribution but qualified distributions are not included in taxable income, allowing earnings to accrue tax-free. As such, a Roth plan is typically a better savings vehicle for young, low-income individuals who typically have a lower tax burden (e.g., junior officers and enlisted servicemembers) than they would expect to have in retirement. This provision was not adopted.", "Finally, Section 631 of the Senate bill was adopted and amends 10 U.S.C. \u00a71409 to allow cadets, midshipmen, and reservists who are in inactive duty status prior to January 1, 2018, a 30-day election period for the new retirement system following commissioning or transfer to active duty or active status.

Currently up to 50% of a servicemember's disposable military retired pay may be divisible by the court in a single divorce case. Both the House and Senate proposed similar provisions that would change the definition of disposable retired pay to use the pay grade and years of service at time of a divorce court order rather than at the time of retirement.

This is known as the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). When a servicemember dies, their survivor's payment through the SBP is usually 55% of the retired basic pay that the member would otherwise have been eligible to receive. Previously, for those servicemembers who died while on active duty, the base amount was calculated at 75% of their basic pay. For reservists who died during inactive-duty training (IADT), the base amount reflects their years of service, which causes the SBP payment to be less than if the member died on active duty.

Existing DOD policy defined maternity leave as, \"a convalescent period up to 6 weeks following pregnancy and childbirth.\" The new policy, as announced, extended the period of maternity leave up to 12 weeks. DOD also sought legislative action to extend parental leave up to 14 days. Parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth was first authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 ( P.L. 110-417 ) and is currently authorized for a maximum of 10 days. Since 2006 ( P.L. 109-163 ), a servicemember who adopts a child is eligible for up to 21 days of leave to be used in connection with an adoption. In dual-service married couples, only one servicemember is eligible to take this leave in connection with the adoption.

It also authorizes 6 weeks of leave for a primary caregiver in the case of an adoption of a child. Secondary caregivers could be awarded up to 21 days of leave in connection with a birth or adoption. This section requires the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations defining \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers for the purpose of this leave benefit. The leave taken in connection with the birth or adoption may only be in one increment and must be taken within a year of the event. To be eligible for this leave, the individual must be a member of the active component or a member of a reserve component performing active Guard and Reserve duty or subject to an active duty recall or mobilization order in excess of 12 months. Although parental leave authorized by this provision is in addition to any other leave a servicemember may have earned, this section also would allow the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations that would require a servicemember to extend their service obligation or to incur a reduction in their existing leave in their account when taking parental leave. ", "Section 521 of the final bill also adopted a Senate-proposed provision that adds Section 704a, Title 10 United States Code explicitly prohibiting any leave from being awarded to military servicemembers outside of what is authorized by statute.

Supporters of paid parental leave suggest that it encourages workforce recruitment and retention by making Armed Forces benefits more competitive with private sector benefits, and that additional leave helps support the well-being of military families.

The President's FY2017 budget request proposed $1.2 billion for commissaries, a reduction of $200 million in subsidies for stateside commissaries from FY2016. Authorized patrons currently include active duty military members, Guard and Reserve component members, retired personnel and their families, 100% disabled veterans, Medal of Honor recipients, and DOD civilians stationed at U.S. installations overseas.

The FY2016 NDAA specified that any changes to the commissary system must maintain current levels of patron savings and satisfaction. The report, Plan to Obtain Budget Neutrality for Commissary and Exchange System , was released by DOD on June 7, 2016. This report acknowledges that \"privatization would not be able to replicate the range of benefits, level of savings and geographic reach provided by DeCA while achieving budget neutrality.\" Some critics of privatization maintain that there are too many unknowns and that this report and others should be fully evaluated by DOD and Congress before initiating a pilot program.", "Furthermore Section 651, subpart (d), directed the Comptroller General to submit an assessment of DOD's June 2016 plan. This assessment, DOD Commissaries and Exchanges: Plan and Additional Information Needed on Cost Savings and Metrics for DOD Efforts to Achieve Budget Neutrality , was published on November 9, 2016. This assessment specified that DOD's report does not provide a plan for achieving budget neutrality in the commissary and exchange systems by October 2018, to operate without any taxpayer dollars and without negatively affecting commissary and exchange benefits. According to GAO, the DOD report addressed three of the seven mandated benchmarks (customer satisfaction, quality of products, and patron savings) but did not define specific metrics for each of the benchmarks, and only partially discussed the other four mandated elements (establishment of common business processes at DeCA and exchanges; privatization of commissaries and exchanges; description of the impact of closing commissaries; and the analysis of different pricing options at commissaries).", "In addition, Section 652 of the FY2016 NDAA required the Comptroller General of the United States to submit a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program of the Department of Defense.

The conference report notes that these reforms to the commissary system would preserve the benefit, while also making improvements to ensure continued savings for patrons, a good value for taxpayers, and ongoing support for morale, welfare, and recreational (MWR) activities. Reforms include regular congressional oversight of improvements, establishment of common business practices such as engaging expert commercial advice, and implementing private sector initiatives such as variable pricing and the development of private label products. ", "Under current law, DeCA is required to set prices at levels necessary to recover the actual cost of the merchandise plus any costs to replace damaged, deteriorated, or lost inventory. According to CBO, DeCA is expected to implement this provision by offering private label goods under a variable pricing program that would allow DeCA to add a markup to those private label goods and use the proceeds to offset its operating costs. CBO estimates that proceeds from the markup in prices would decrease direct spending by less than $500,000 over the next decade (2017-2026).

Commissaries could use flexible product pricing that would need to ensure the current level of savings is maintained. DOD will be allowed to convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if established benchmarks are met and savings are maintained for at least six months. If conversion to a non-appropriated fund entity occurs, the Defense Secretary would be required to ensure that no current DeCA employee would incur a loss or decrease in pay resulting from the conversion.

This amounts to a reduction of about 11% in the number of authorized positions; however, since only 889 of the 962 currently authorized positions are filled at present, the reduction in GFO personnel will be smaller than the reduction in positions.

The House bill addressed various aspects of military justice including, but not limited to, courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. For example, with respect to sentencing, the House bill would have granted the government the ability to appeal a sentence adjudged if the sentence violated the law or was plainly unreasonable; previously the right to appeal was only available to the servicemember. Among the most substantive revisions proposed in the House bill were changes to the punitive articles (i.e., the offenses for which a servicemember may be court-martialed). The House bill would have provided for many offenses addressed by Executive Order through the General Article to be identified by specific statutory sections as part of a general reorganization of the punitive articles. Additionally, the House bill would have created new offenses, including (1) Article 93a\u2014prohibited activities with military recruit and trainee by person in position of special trust; (2) Article 121a\u2014fraudulent use of credit cards, debit cards, and other access devices; (3) Article 123\u2014offenses concerning government computers; and (4) Article 132\u2014retaliation.", "The proposed Senate bill also addresse d various aspects of military justice including, but not limited to, courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. Although both the House and Senate proposals we re referred to as the \"Military Justice Act of 2016,\" differences exist ed between the House and Senate language. For example, as discussed above, the House language would have allowed the g overnment to appeal a sentence adjudged if the sentence violate d the law or wa s plainly unreasonable . T he Senate language , however, would have require d the creation of military-specific sentencing parameters and criteria and provided that an adjudged sentence that divert ed from the criteria and paramet ers would be appealable by the g overnment . While the Senate language also proposed to reorganize the punitive articles , it significant ly differe d from the House language in its proposed changes to offenses related to rape and sexual assault. Specifically, the Senate bill would have add ed the use of \"position, rank, or authority to coerce the acquiescence of the other person in the sexual act\" as a prohibited act punishable by court-martial to Article 120 . ", "Differences between the House and Senate bills were resolved in conference. Consistent with the House and Senate bills, the final bill includes a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ. However, some language was not included in the final bill, for example, (1) a provision that would have required interim guidance on sentencing parameters and criteria and would have been subject to sunset at a later time; (2) an increase in the minimum punishment for sex-related offenses; and (3) changes to Art. 120, which would have expanded the definition of committing a sexual act upon another person to include the wrongful use of position, rank, or authority to coerce the acquiescence of the other person in the sexual act.

The reluctance to retroactively award the MOH or to upgrade other awards is generally based on efforts to maintain the integrity of the award and the awards process. This reluctance has led many to believe that the system of awarding the MOH is overly restrictive and that certain individuals are denied earned medals. As a result, DOD periodically reviews inquiries by Members of Congress and reevaluates its historical records. On January 6, 2016, DOD announced the results of its year-long review of military awards and decorations. This included review of the timeliness of the MOH process and review by all the military departments of the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, and Silver Star Medal recommendations since September 11, 2001, for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The results of the Service Cross and Silver Star Review are due to the Secretary of Defense on September 30, 2017.", "Discussion: Sections 582, 583, and 596 of the conference report include provisions similar to the House-passed H.R. 4909 and Senate-passed S.2943.", "Section 582 of the final bill waives the time limitations prescribed in various sections of Title 10, United States Code, to authorize the President to award certain valor awards, including the Congressional Medal of Honor, to a member or former member of the Armed Forces during certain contingency operations: Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation New Dawn (OND), Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS), and Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), resulting from a review of valor award nominations directed by the Secretary of Defense on January 7, 2016. The time waiver expires on December 31, 2019, and no medal may be awarded after that date under the authority of this section. ", "Section 583 of the final bill waives the time limitations specified in Section 3744 of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the award of the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose and to James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during the Vietnam War. This section authorizes the President to award the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose for acts of valor from September 11 through 14, 1970, while a member of the United States Army, Military Assistance Command Vietnam-Studies and Observation Group (MACVSOG); and to James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during combat operations between May 13, 1969, and May 15, 1969, while serving as a combat medic with Company C, 3d Battalion, 21st Infantry, 196th Light Infantry Brigade, American Division, Republic of Vietnam. ", "Section 586 of the enacted bill requires the Secretary of each military department to conduct a review of the service records of certain eligible veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars who are of Asian American or Native American Pacific Island descent and were previously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, or the Air Force Cross. In those cases where the Secretary concerned determines that the service records of those veterans support the award of the Medal of Honor, this section would also waive the statutory time limitations for award of the Medal.
