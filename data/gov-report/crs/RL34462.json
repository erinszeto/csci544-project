Under House Rule XIII, clause 4(a), committee-reported legislation may not generally be considered on the House floor until the accompanying committee report has been available to Members for at least three calendar days.

Although a waiver motion is available for points of order under the Budget Act and similar requirements, the Senate standing rules must typically be waived by unanimous consent (that is, no Senator objects to a unanimous consent request to waive a rule). Senate Rule XLIV, however, incorporates a waiver motion similar to that used under the Budget Act, and allows any Senator to make a motion to waive any of these points of order. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of all Senators (60, if there are no vacancies) is required to adopt the motion. Senators may debate the motion for up to one hour, with the time equally divided and controlled by the Majority and Minority Leaders (or their designees). These points of order may also be waived if the Majority and Minority Leaders jointly agree that \"such a waiver is necessary as a result of a significant disruption to Senate facilities or to the availability of the Internet.\"", "The Senate rule places restrictions on consideration of appeals of the chair's rulings on these points of order.

Rule XXVIII provides that in cases in which one of the versions of the bill is an amendment in the nature of a substitute, which is typically the case, the conferees may include a germane modification of the subjects in disagreement. Under existing precedents, earmarks added to a conference report are often considered germane modifications.
