The provisions were enacted through two laws: the Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act, enacted as Division O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, commonly referred to as the FY2018 omnibus), and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334, Title VIII, commonly referred to as the 2018 farm bill).", "Many of the provisions enacted by the 115th Congress affect Forest Service and BLM implementation of two laws: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). These laws, among others, authorize specific forest management activities and establish decisionmaking procedures for those activities. The enacted provisions are summarized and analyzed in the following categories: project planning and implementation, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous. Ongoing issues for Congress include oversight of (i) the agencies' implementation of the new laws, and (ii) the extent these provisions achieve their specified purposes, such as improving agency efficiencies, increasing the scale, scope, and implementation of forest restoration projects, and reducing hazardous fuel levels to mitigate against the risk of catastrophic wildfire.", "Both the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill included provisions that affect Forest Service and BLM decisionmaking processes by changing certain aspects of the NEPA process and the interagency consultation requirements established in Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). For example, each law specified that certain forest management projects would be considered actions categorically excluded from the requirements of NEPA. Also, both laws expanded various authorities originally authorized in HFRA intended to expedite decisionmaking for specific projects. This included reauthorizing the use of procedures intended to expedite priority projects in designated NFS insect and disease treatment areas and amending the definition of an authorized fuel reduction project to include additional activities.", "The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill also contained provisions that affect federal wildland fire management. The FY2018 omnibus directed the Secretary of Agriculture to adapt the national-scale wildfire hazard potential map for use at the community level to inform risk management decisions. Both laws directed Forest Service and DOI to provide annual reports on a variety of wildfire-related metrics. The FY2018 omnibus also changed how Congress appropriates funding specifically for wildfire suppression purposes. The so-called wildfire funding fix authorized an adjustment to the discretionary spending limits for wildfire suppression operations for each year from FY2020 through FY2027. However, statutory spending limits are set to expire after FY2021, meaning that the adjustment is effectively in place for two years.", "Congress has established specific forest restoration programs for Forest Service and BLM, or has authorized forest restoration to be one of many activities or land management objectives for some programs. Forest restoration activities address concerns related to forest health, such as improving forest resistance and resilience to disturbance events (e.g., insect and disease infestation or uncharacteristically catastrophic wildfires). The 115th Congress established two new programs for Forest Service (water source protection and watershed condition framework) and amended three others: the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP, available only for Forest Service), stewardship contracting authority, and the good neighbor authority. Aspects of several of these programs allow Forest Service and BLM to partner with various stakeholders in different ways to perform specified forest management and restoration activities.", "Both the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill enacted various other provisions related to land acquisition, exchange and disposal; the issuance of special use authorizations for the use or occupancy of federal lands; the payments, activities, and Resource Advisory Committees authorized by the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act; and forest management on tribal lands."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction1", "paragraphs": ["This report summarizes and analyzes selected forest management provisions enacted in the 115 th Congress and compares them with prior law or policy.

This report focuses primarily on the provisions related to management of forested federal land. The federal forest management provisions change how the Forest Service (FS, within the Department of Agriculture (USDA)) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM, within the Department of the Interior (DOI)) manage their lands.

NFMA, as amended, specifies that the plans must be developed and revised with public involvement.

This includes compliance with NEPA, as well as Section 7 of Endangered Species Act (ESA), and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), among others. Each forest plan broadly describes a range of desired resource conditions across the specified NFS unit but does not authorize individual projects or specific on-the-ground actions.

How a federal agency demonstrates compliance with NEPA depends on the level of the proposal's impacts. A proposed action that would significantly affect the \"quality of the human environment\" requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) leading to a Record of Decision. If the impacts are uncertain, an agency may prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to determine whether an EIS is necessary, or whether a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) may be issued through a Decision Notice. For actions that require an EA or EIS, an agency generally must evaluate the impacts of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives to it, including the alternative of taking no action (i.e., a no-action alternative ). The analysis included in the EIS or EA/FONSI is used to inform the agency's decisionmaking process regarding the proposal.", "Under NEPA implementing regulations, categorical exclusions (CEs) refer broadly to categories of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the environment and hence are excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or an EA. FS and BLM have identified CEs based on each agency's past experience with similar actions. Some CEs have been explicitly established in statute by Congress, as discussed in the \" Statutorily Established NEPA CEs \" section of this report. Individual agencies also may determine whether or what additional documentation may be required for a CE. In its list of CEs, FS distinguishes between actions that generally do not require any further documentation and those that generally require the preparation of a decision memorandum as part of an administrative record supporting the decision to approve the proposal as a CE. ", "In their agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA, each federal agency has identified and listed actions it is authorized to approve that normally require an EIS, or an EA resulting in a FONSI, or that can be approved using a CE. FS and BLM regulations also provide for and identify the resource conditions in which a normally excluded action may have the potential for a significant environmental effect and warrant further analysis in an EA or EIS. The presence of these resource conditions is termed extraordinary circumstances. For example, FS has identified the presence of flood plains, municipal watersheds, endangered species or their habitat, wilderness areas, inventoried roadless areas, and archaeological sites, among others, as potential extraordinary circumstances that may preclude the use of a CE for an otherwise eligible project. ", "As commonly implemented, the process of identifying potential environmental impacts pursuant to NEPA serves as a framework to identify any other environmental requirements that may apply to that project as a result of those impacts. In this way, an agency's procedures to implement NEPA may serve as an umbrella compliance process. For example, within the framework of determining the resources affected and level of effects of a given proposal, the agency's NEPA process would identify project impacts that may trigger additional environmental review and consultation requirements under ESA and NHPA, among other laws. If compliance with NEPA was waived for a given category of action, the requirements triggered by impacts to those resources under other federal laws would still apply.

Hazardous fuel reduction projects are intended to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire by removing or modifying the availability of biomass (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses, needles, leaves, and twigs) that fuel a wildland fire through a variety of methods and measures. ", "HFRA defined specific hazardous fuel reduction projects and authorized an expedited planning and review process for those projects. The authorization is available to be used for projects covering up to a cumulative total of 20 million acres of federal land. HFRA defined several other relevant terms, some of which are summarized below", "At-Risk Community : an area that is comprised of an interface community as defined in the notice published in 66 Federal Register 753, or a group of homes and other structures with basic infrastructure and services within or adjacent to federal land, and an area in which conditions are conducive to a large-scale wildland fire disturbance event and for which a significant threat to human life or property exists as a result of significant wildland fire disturbance event. Authorized H azardous F uels R eduction P roject s (HFRA P rojects) : methods and measures for reducing hazardous fuels including prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and various mechanical methods (e.g., pruning or thinning, which is the removal of small-diameter trees to produce commercial and pre-commercial products). Fire R egimes and C ondition C lasses : terms used to describe the relative change between the historical frequency and intensity of fire patterns across a vegetated landscape to the current fire patterns. These terms are used to prioritize and assess hazardous fuel reduction projects. For a complete definition, see the shaded text box and Figure 1 . Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) : an area within or adjacent to an at-risk community with a community wildfire protection plan (CWPP), or an area within a specified distance to an at-risk community without a CWPP and with specified characteristics (e.g., steep slopes).", "HFRA projects may be conducted in the WUI; on specified areas within a municipal watershed and with moderate or significant departure from the historical fire regimes (see shaded text box); on wind-, ice-, insect-, or disease-damaged land, or land at risk of insect or disease damage; or on lands with threatened and endangered species habitat threatened by wildfire. HFRA explicitly excluded projects that would occur on designated wilderness areas, wilderness study areas, or areas that otherwise prohibit vegetation removal by an act of Congress or presidential proclamation. Also, HFRA projects must be consistent with the land and resource management plan in place for the area. Certain covered projects \u2014basically, any HFRA project except those in response to or anticipation of wind, ice, insect, or disease damage\u2014must focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior, while maximizing large or old-growth tree retention (if retention promotes fire resiliency).", "HFRA also directed FS to establish a pre-decisional administrative review process\u2014referred to as an objection process\u2014for proposed HFRA projects. The review is called pre-decisional because HFRA explicitly requires objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of the draft decision documents associated with the proposed project (e.g., a draft Decision Notice and final EA, or draft Record of Decision and final EIS). Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods and may only be on issues raised within those comments. If no comments were received on a project, no objections will be accepted. HFRA also set forth requirements for judicial review. If the objector is still not satisfied with the agency's decision after the administrative review (i.e., objections) process has been exhausted, the next step is judicial review in federal court. However, only issues that were raised during the public comment period and the pre-decisional administrative review process may be considered during judicial proceedings, unless significant new issues arise after the conclusion of the administration review. ", "Congress later directed FS to replace the post-decisional administrative appeals process used for non-HFRA projects with the pre-decisional objection process used by HFRA projects. As a result, all FS projects fall under the same pre-decisional objection process, although there are some differences between HFRA and non-HFRA projects.

To be eligible for this insect and disease treatment area designation, the NFS area must be experiencing declining forest health based on annual forest health surveys, at risk of experiencing substantial tree mortality over the next 15 years, or in an area in which hazard trees pose an imminent risk to public safety. In total, FS has designated approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide (see Figure 2 ).

Thus, these projects also are subject to HFRA's pre-decisional objections process; must be developed through a collaborative process with state, local, and tribal government collaboration and participation of interested persons; consider the best available science; and maximize the retention of old-growth and large trees, as appropriate for the forest type and to the extent it would promote insect and disease resiliency. Also pursuant to HFRA, projects planned within the WUI require the analysis of the proposed action and one action alternative during the preparation of an EA or EIS.

For example, a 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that FS took an average of 177 days to complete CEs, compared with 565 days to complete EAs, in FY2012. That same GAO report found that from FY2008 to FY2012, FS used CEs less frequently and the process took longer to complete compared with other agencies. However, the analysis period occurred before Congress authorized the Farm Bill CE, and it is possible that FS trends have since changed.

Those in favor of the enacted changes contend that not requiring Section 7 consultations for existing land management plans due to a species listing or designation of critical habitat will provide more flexibility in implementing plans, allow for consistency in keeping the plans in place, and enable plan and project implementation to proceed with fewer delays. The exceptions in the law would allow for changes in plans after a certain time, thereby reflecting changes to listed species and their critical habitat.

This section provides some background information on wildland fire appropriations and then discusses those changes in more detail. The laws also changed aspects of FS and DOI's hazardous fuel reduction programs. This included reauthorizing the use of procedures intended to expedite the priority projects in NFS areas designated as I&D areas and expanding the definition of an authorized fuel reduction project, as discussed previously in the \" Planning and Project Implementation Requirements \" section.

Within FS's and DOI's respective Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account, funding is provided to the Suppression Operations program to fund the control of wildfires that originate on federal land. This includes firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation asset operations, and incident support functions in direct support of wildfire response, plus personnel and resources for post-wildfire response programs. If their suppression funding is exhausted during a fiscal year, FS and DOI are authorized to transfer funds from their other accounts to pay for suppression activities; this is often referred to as fire borrowing . ", "Overall appropriations to FS and DOI for wildland fire management have increased considerably since the 1990s. A significant portion of that increase is related to rising suppression costs, even during years of relatively mild wildfire activity, although the costs vary annually and are difficult to predict. FS and DOI frequently have required more suppression funds than have been appropriated to them. This discrepancy often leads to fire borrowing, prompting concerns that increasing suppression spending may be detrimental to other agency programs. In response, Congress has typically enacted supplemental appropriations to repay the transferred funds and/or to replenish the agency's wildfire accounts. Wildfire spending\u2014like all discretionary spending\u2014is currently subject to procedural and budgetary controls. In the past, Congress has sometimes\u2014but not always\u2014effectively waived some of these controls for certain wildfire spending. This situation prompted the 115 th Congress to explore providing wildfire spending outside of those constraints, as discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Suppression Spending: Wildfire Funding Fix", "paragraphs": ["In the FY2018 omnibus, the 115 th Congress established a new mechanism for suppression funding, commonly referred to as the wildfire funding fix (\u00a7102(a)). Pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), discretionary spending currently is subject to statutory limits for each of the fiscal years between FY2012 and FY2021. Enacted discretionary spending may not exceed these limits. If spending that exceeds a limit is enacted, the limit is to be enforced through sequestration, which involves the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities. Certain spending is effectively exempt from the discretionary spending limits pursuant to Section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA), because those limits are \"adjusted\" upward each year to accommodate that spending. Spending for specified emergency requirements and disaster-relief purposes falls into this category. Section 102(a)(3) of the FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to add a new adjustment to the nondefense discretionary spending limit for wildfire suppression operations. This new adjustment starts in FY2020 and continues for each year thereafter through FY2027. For the purposes of the adjustment, wildfire suppression operations includes spending for the purposes of ", "the emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting, including support, response, and emergency stabilization activities; other emergency management activities; and funds necessary to repay any transfers needed for these costs.", "The new adjustment would apply to appropriations provided above an amount equal to the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations as calculated for FY2015 (\"FY2015 baseline\"). That is, an amount equal to the FY2015 baseline would be subject to the statutory discretionary limits, and then any additional funding appropriated would be considered outside the limits and would be the amount of the adjustment. The amount of the adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing by $0.1 billion ($100 million) to $2.95 billion in FY2027. ", "Whatever amount, if any, Congress elects to appropriate for wildfire suppression over the FY2015 baseline ($1.39 billion combined) effectively would not be subject to the discretionary spending limits established in the BCA for FY2020 and FY2021, up to the specified maximum. For example, in FY2020, Congress could appropriate the minimum FY2015 baseline of $1.39 billion for suppression operations, as requested by the agencies. This amount would be subject to the BCA discretionary limits. But then Congress could appropriate up to an additional $2.25 billion in FY2020, effectively outside of the discretionary limits. This means the agencies could be appropriated up to $3.64 billion in total in FY2020, for the same discretionary budget \"score\" as $1.39 billion. For context, FS and DOI combined received $2.05 billion for suppression purposes in FY2019 ($1.67 billion for FS; $388 million for DOI). Over the past 5 years, FS and DOI combined received $2.16 billion annually on average ($1.74 billion for FS; $428 million for DOI).", "The enactment of the wildfire funding fix potentially removes some budget process barriers to providing additional wildfire suppression funds, at least for FY2020 and FY2021. This is because the BCA statutory limits for discretionary spending are only in effect until FY2021. If new limits are statutorily established for any year between FY2022 through FY2027, then the wildfire adjustment would still be applicable. If no new limits are enacted, though, the wildfire adjustment would no longer apply. ", "It is also unclear if Congress would continue to provide the fire borrowing authority to the agencies once the wildfire adjustment is in effect starting in FY2020. Section 103 of the FY2018 omnibus requires the applicable Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to \"promptly\" submit a request to Congress for supplemental appropriations if the amount provided for wildfire suppression operations for a fiscal year is estimated to be exhausted within 30 days. This provision would give Congress notice of the likely need for additional funding but would require additional action from Congress to ensure the agencies have access to funds to enable continued federal services in response to wildfires. ", "The wildfire funding fix raises several potential concerns for Congress. As one example, FS did not report its 10-year suppression obligation for FY2020 since suppression appropriations are now tied to the FY2015 baseline (DOI reported its 10-year obligation average to be $403 million). This may raise concerns related to accountability and oversight of suppression spending. Another concern may be that the FY2015 baseline and the annual adjustment limits are not tied to any inflationary factors. Further, the wildfire funding fix is a temporary procedural change for how Congress funds suppression operations and does not address a variety of other concerns related to suppression costs, such as improving suppression cost forecasting, evaluating the effectiveness of suppression methods, or addressing any of the drivers of increasing suppression costs, among other concerns broadly related to wildland fire management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wildfire Hazard Potential Maps", "paragraphs": ["The Fire Modeling Institute, part of FS's Rocky Mountain Research Station, developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index and map to help inform strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale (see Figure 3 ).

Based on this data, FS estimates that approximately 226 million acres of land in the continental United States are classified at high or very high WHP. Of those lands identified at high or very high WHP, 120 million acres (53%) are federal land (58 million acres of NFS lands and 62 million acres of DOI lands), and the remaining 106 million acres (47%) are state, tribal, other public, or private lands.

The rights-of-way allow for the specific use of those federal lands for numerous purposes. Among other activities, these purposes also generally include issuing linear rights-of-way authorizing access \"over, upon, under, or through\" the specified lands for facilities and systems for : various types of water infrastructure ; infrastructure for the storage, transportation , or distribution of liquids , gases (with specified exceptions), and solid materials ; electricity generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure ; communication systems infrastructure ; roads, trails, highways, canals, tunnels and other means of transportation in general; and other \"necessary\" systems and facilities which are in the public interest.", "FS and BLM charge cost-recovery fees for processing and monitoring applications as well as an annual land use rental fee. The processing and monitoring fees are generally based on the estimated number of hours it will take the agency to process the application (or renewal) and monitor the activity to ensure compliance with the authorization. There is a general rental fee schedule for linear ROWs, based on land value, and a separate rental fee schedule for communication uses, based on the type of communication use and population served. BLM and FS use the same schedule for the processing and monitoring fees and the same land use rental fee schedules for linear ROWs and communication sites.", "The 115 th Congress enacted provisions directing FS to update their process and fee schedule for issuing special use authorizations for communication sites, directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for certain activities within electricity ROWs, and also established a similar pilot process for FS for many of the same activities within utility (defined as electricity, natural gas infrastructure, or related infrastructure) ROWs. In some cases, these provisions are related to concerns about wildfire ignitions within electricity transmission and distribution ROWs. For example, power line ignitions are associated with fires that burn across larger areas. This is in part due to weather conditions (e.g., wind) causing vegetation (e.g., tree limbs) to come into increasing contact with power lines. ", "Some have asserted that confusing or burdensome administrative processes prevent ROW permit-holders from conducting necessary maintenance activities (e.g., vegetation management) to mitigate the risk of ignitions on the federal lands within their ROWs. In contrast, others have placed more of the responsibility on the permit holders. The 115 th Congress provisions are perceived by some as potentially improving the processes for ROW permit holders to obtain approvals and implement vegetation management projects on federal lands. Others may acknowledge that process improvements could facilitate improved land conditions but are concerned about the appropriate balance between expediting project implementation and maintaining accountability and adherence to the laws regarding federal lands. ", "Some of the provisions specify the responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs for wildfires ignited within ROWs, costs associated with other damages, or place a cap on liability costs for ROW permit holders. Some are concerned with the breadth of these provisions and the potential implications for the federal government or others bearing a disproportionate share of the costs to suppress wildfires ignited within a ROW on federal lands. Others contend that the provisions limiting damages and liability will incentivize prompt agency action on maintenance requests from ROW permit holders and also reflect that utilities should not be responsible for the full costs of a wildfire\u2014regardless of ignition point or cause\u2014because past agency actions have contributed to the increased fuel levels surrounding ROWs. Further, others contend that limiting unexpected costs for the utilities would reduce the likelihood of passing on those costs to the ratepayers.

The law specifies the components of the plans, authorizes owners to develop and submit those plans for approval by the appropriate Secretary and conduct activities within their ROW pursuant to an approved plan. The law also specifies circumstances when owners may conduct certain management activities without an approved plan or without the approval of FS or BLM (e.g., when trees are in imminent danger of touching a power line). FS and BLM are also directed to identify any applicable NEPA categorical exclusions for these activities. The law directed the Secretaries to propose regulations implementing the provisions within one year of enactment and to finalize the regulations within two years.

Under the pilot program, participating permit holders may develop and implement vegetation management plans, subject to FS approval, for the NFS lands within their ROWs. Pursuant to those plans, pilot participants may also pay for and perform projects on specified NFS lands within and up to 75 feet from the ROW. Participants must adhere to FS and some state regulations regarding various fire prevention and vegetation removal activities when conducting projects on NFS lands. Participants are generally responsible for project costs, although FS may contribute funds at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture. Should a participant provide funds to the FS, the Secretary may retain those funds for implementing the pilot, subject to appropriations. The law directed FS to submit a program status report to Congress by December 31, 2020, and every two years afterwards.", "Section 8630 also specified the financial responsibility of pilot participants related to wildfire: participants must reimburse FS for the costs of wildfire suppression and damage to FS resources if the wildfire is caused by the operations of the pilot participant, under certain conditions. If the participant provides resources to suppress a wildfire caused by their operations in the ROW, the cost of those resources shall be credited toward the reimbursement costs, or if they exceed the maximum reimbursement costs, the FS must reimburse the pilot participant the excess. Section 8630 limits reimbursement costs to up to $500,000 in certain circumstances. ", "Although similar, the electricity ROW provisions prescribed in the FY2018 omnibus for FS and BLM differ from those in the ROW pilot program on NFS lands. The FY2018 omnibus program is specific to electricity ROWs, while the FS pilot program established under the 2018 farm bill is applicable to electricity ROWs as well as natural gas and other related infrastructure.

SRS authorized an optional payment system to those counties as an alternative to the revenue-sharing payments. SRS payments were based on a formula that accounted for historic revenue payments, acreage of land, and the counties' per capita income. The SRS statute specified the payments to be allocated among three categories based on payment level: Title I FS payments were to be used for funding education and roads (BLM payments were to be used for any governmental purpose); Title II payments were retained by the applicable agency to be used for projects on the lands under jurisdiction and within the county; and Title III payments were to be used for specified county programs, including fire prevention, county planning, and emergency services (e.g., search and rescue operations and firefighting). Title II also established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to \"improve collaborative relationships and provide advice and recommendations\" to the agencies, and established minimum membership requirements. Specifically, the law specified that RACs members must be appointed by the applicable Secretary and must consist of a total of 15 members representing specific interests (this includes outdoor recreation interests, the timber industry, environmental organizations, and local elected officials, among others).", "The authorized payment level was set in statute at 95% of the previous year's payment level. The original authorization for SRS payments expired at the end of FY2006, but the payments were extended several times through FY2015. Since payments were disbursed after the end of the fiscal year, the last authorized payment was disbursed in FY2016. When SRS payments are not authorized, counties receive a revenue-sharing payment, which is typically much less than they would receive under SRS. After the last authorized SRS payments had been disbursed in FY2016, counties received a revenue-sharing payment in FY2017."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Summary of Changes and Discussion", "paragraphs": ["The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018 (\u00a7\u00a7401, 402).

The reauthorization set the FY2017 payment level at 95% of the level of the last authorized payment and specified that the payment should account for the revenue-sharing payments already disbursed. Thus, counties received a full SRS payment for FY2017 (payments made in FY2018), but the payments were essentially made in two installments. The reauthorization also changed some of the payment allocation requirements and expanded the uses for Title III funds (added law enforcement patrols, training, and equipment costs). The reauthorization expired at the end of FY2018, meaning that no additional payments are authorized after the FY2018 payments are distributed in FY2019.", "In addition, the 2018 farm bill enacted changes to the SRS statute, despite the law's expiration at the time of enactment. The 2018 farm bill established a process for the applicable Secretary to modify the RAC membership requirements, and established a pilot program, through FY2023, for the Secretary to designate a regional forester to appoint RAC members in Montana and Arizona (\u00a78702).

The applicable NFS or BLM land should be in need of forest restoration activities or pose a fire, disease or other threat to tribal lands or communities, and include a \"feature or circumstance unique to that Indian Tribe.\" Under TFPA, the applicable Secretary is to evaluate a tribe's request on a \"best value basis\" and in consideration of a set of tribally related factors.

Congress may also be interested in the implication of these changes or how these provisions address concerns with federal forest management generally, and forest restoration specifically. ", "For example, the Forest Service has identified around 52-58 million acres of NFS lands at high or very high fire risk or insect infestation and in need of restoration treatments. FS reports that they accomplish around 2-6 million acres of treatments annually. At that pace, it would take at least 9 but possibly up to 29 years to eliminate the backlog of treatment needs, and that does not account for maintaining already treated areas to the desired resource conditions. Some estimate that hazardous fuels are accumulating three times faster than the rate of treatment. To address these concerns, FS has proposed to increase the scale, scope, and implementation of forest management projects generally, and forest restoration treatments specifically. ", "FS, and others, identify administrative process barriers as one of many factors impeding progress towards these restoration goals. More specifically, some identify agency decisionmaking processes, particularly related to implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act and opportunities for the public to challenge agency decisions administratively and judicially, as preventing the agencies from implementing projects at the pace and scale necessary to address forest health concerns. Others may point to FS-specific implementation issues related to NEPA as contributing to planning delays more than involvement from the public or administrative or judicial challenges. Other stakeholders identify other administrative barriers\u2014such as inadequate program funding levels and training\u2014as preventing the agency from implementing project planning requirements in a more efficient manner. ", "Many of the provisions enacted by the 115 th Congress aim to improve agency efficiencies by expanding the applicability of procedures intended to expedite the planning and review process for projects, such as hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects. For example, proponents of this approach contend that expanding the use of Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and allowing the agencies to plan more projects over larger areas under NEPA Categorical Exclusions would expedite project implementation and allow FS and BLM to achieve progress towards their restoration goals. Some, however, contend that changes made to the agency's decisionmaking processes\u2014such as through the establishment of CEs\u2014are changing the basic legal framework for federal forest management, and making it increasingly difficult for citizens to participate or challenge government decisions. In addition, some stakeholders contend that expanding the use of these authorities could result in environmental impacts that exacerbate forest health concerns.", "Many of these issues have been ongoing for decades. For example, concerns about deteriorating forest health conditions and high fuel levels were raised after wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. In 1994, the congressionally chartered National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended federal land management agencies invest more in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems, and observed that \"the question is no longer if policy-makers will face disastrous wildfires and their enormous costs, but when.\" A 1995 study recommended FS increase hazardous fuel treatments to up to 3 million acres per year by 2005. As another example, in 1999, GAO recommended FS develop a strategy to identify long-term options for reducing fuels to address forest health issues and mitigate wildfire risk. In 2006 OIG raised concerns with FS' hazardous fuels reduction program and recommended FS develop guidance and controls to identify, prioritize, implement, monitor, and report on hazardous fuels reduction projects and funding. A 2016 OIG report assessed FS' progress towards implementing the recommendations from that 2006 report and found continued issues with FS prioritizing, tracking, and reporting of hazardous fuels reduction projects. ", "Concerns about FS project implementation also have been ongoing. For example, in 2001 Congress asked GAO to evaluate the extent administrative or judicial challenges impeded FS' implementation of fuel management projects. The report found that approximately 24% of the fuel reduction decisions signed in FY2001 and FY2002 were appealed. A similar GAO analysis found that 20% of the fuel management projects identified for implementation in FY2006 through FY2008 were challenged through appeals or objections. In addition, there have been several academic studies examining FS NEPA implementation. Collectively, these studies suggest that projects that are more complex\u2014in terms of scale and scope\u2014are more likely to be challenged, but other project characteristics (e.g., timber harvests) and factors related to staffing, documentation, and implementation of the public involvement requirements also affect the likelihood of project challenges. ", "HFRA, passed in 2003, included provisions intended to expedite implementation of hazardous fuels reduction projects. Despite these provisions, the extent of NFS areas in need of treatment has continued to increase, and FS continues to look for ways to increase the pace of project implementation. To some, this implies that the HFRA approach to streamline agency decisionmaking has not been successful. To others, this implies that the HFRA approach needs to be more broadly applied, as it was in legislation enacted during the 115 th Congress. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
