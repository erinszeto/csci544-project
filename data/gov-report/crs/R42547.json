As a result, criminals are often prosecuted using laws intended to combat crimes in the real world. The distinction between cybercrime and other malicious acts in the virtual realm is the actor's motivation.

When referring to cybercrime incidents, terms such as cyber attack, cyber espionage, and cyber war are often loosely applied, and they may obscure the motives of the actors involved. Criminal attribution is a key delineating factor between cybercrime and other cyber threats. When investigating a given threat, law enforcement is challenged with tracing the action to its source and determining whether the actor is a criminal or whether the actor may be a terrorist or state actor posing a potentially greater national security threat.

Similarly, there is not a definition of cybercrime that distinguishes it from other forms of cyber threats, and the term is often used interchangeably with other Internet- or technology-linked malicious acts. Federal law enforcement agencies often define cybercrime based on their jurisdiction and the crimes they are charged with investigating. And, just as there is no overarching definition for cybercrime, there is no single agency that has been designated as the lead investigative agency for combating cybercrime.", "Congress may question whether it is necessary to have a clear definition of what constitutes cybercrime and what delineates it from other real world and cyber threats. On one hand, if the purpose of defining cybercrime is for investigating and prosecuting any of the various crimes under the broader cybercrime umbrella, it may be less critical to create a definition of the umbrella term and more imperative to clearly define which specific activities constitute crimes\u2014regardless of whether they are considered real world crimes or cybercrimes. On the other hand, a distinction between cybercrime and other malicious activities may be beneficial for creating specific policies on combating the ever-expanding range of cyber threats. If government agencies and private sector businesses design strategies and missions around combating cybercrime, it may be useful to communicate a clear definition of cybercrime to those individuals who may be involved in carrying out the strategies.", "The United States does not have a national strategy exclusively focused on combating cybercrime. Rather, there are other, broader strategies that have cybercrime components (a selection of which are presented in the Appendix). Policy makers may question whether there should be a distinct strategy for combating cybercrime or whether efforts to control these crimes are best addressed through more wide-ranging strategies such as those targeting cyber security or transnational organized crime. Congress may also question whether these broader strategies provide specific cybercrime-related objectives and clear means to achieve these goals.", "Comprehensive data on cybercrime incidents and their impact are not available, and without exact numbers on the current scope and prevalence of cybercrime, it is difficult to evaluate the magnitude of the threats posed by cyber criminals. There are a number of issues that have prevented the accurate measurement and tracking of cybercrime. For one, the lack of a clear sense of what constitutes cybercrime presents a barrier to tracking inclusive cybercrime data. Additionally, much of the available data on cybercrime are self-reported, and individuals or organizations may not realize a cybercrime has taken place or may elect\u2014for a host of reasons\u2014not to report it.

The device \"relies on sophisticated data-reading electronics to copy the magnetic stripe information from [the] credit card or debit card. It can capture both [the] credit card number and [the] PIN.\" Fraudsters can then retrieve the stolen information by physically collecting the skimming device or by programming the device to broadcast the data to thieves over a network.", "Researchers have proposed that some cybercrimes may require more technological expertise or heavier use of digital technologies to perpetrate than others. For example, phishing, identity theft, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks necessitate a greater understanding of computing and digital technologies than others, such as cyber stalking and online child pornography, that can be thought of as \"point and click\" crimes. Those crimes requiring more technological expertise may also be more firmly rooted in the virtual world than others. Regardless, the cyber component may delineate them from traditional crimes. Computers and other advanced technologies may be components of cybercrime through a variety of roles: ", "in some cybercrimes, computers themselves\u2014or data contained therein\u2014are the victims or targets of crime; in other instances, computers or other digital technologies are used as tools for carrying out crimes (victimizing individuals, organizations, or government); and technological devices may serve as repositories for evidence of a cybercrime.", "All of these issues underscore the salience of location in any conceptualization of cybercrime."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technology: Cyber vs. Real World Crime", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps one way of viewing cybercrimes is that they are digital versions of traditional offenses.

The defendants then used the stolen debit cards to obtain cash, without the knowledge or authorization of the identity theft victims.\" In another case, two men were sentenced for leading a criminal enterprise that stole credit and debit cards from mailboxes in affluent neighborhoods in South Florida. The thieves then used the cards to make large purchases and cash withdrawals from the cards, costing victims $786,000. In the cyber world, a computer hacker can easily steal this same PII\u2014electronically rather than physically. In September 2013, two Romanian nationals were sentenced for \"participating in an international, multimillion-dollar scheme to remotely hack into and steal payment card data from hundreds of U.S. merchants' computers.\" Defendants remotely hacked into POS systems and then, also remotely, installed \"keystroke loggers.\" These devices illegally captured victims' credit card information when the cards were swiped by the merchants, and then this information was transferred electronically to the fraudsters.

As a result, criminals are often prosecuted using laws intended to combat crimes in the real world. As Department of Justice (DOJ) officials have pointed out, federal laws to prosecute computer-related crimes are not necessarily as ample or broad as those used to confront their traditional counterparts. For instance, computer fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a71030) is not currently considered a predicate offense for racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act\u2014one of the primary tools used to prosecute organized crime. As noted, organized criminals are increasingly using the Internet and other advanced technologies to carry out their operations. Yet, the range of crimes carried out by organized crime encompasses both traditional and cybercrimes. The Obama Administration has recommended revising RICO provisions (which can be applied to both criminal and civil cases) so that computer fraud would be considered a predicate offense. Cyber criminal organizations have been targeted under civil RICO, citing predicate offenses such as wire fraud, bank fraud, and access device fraud. It is unknown whether or how adding computer fraud to the list of predicate offenses would further these investigations and prosecutions.", "In June 2014, the GameOver Zeus botnet, was disrupted through an international law enforcement effort led by the FBI.

This may exclude lone actors including hackers, stalkers, and online child predators. The FBI considers these malicious activities under the umbrella of cybercrime, as discussed in the \" Government Definitions and Agency Focus \" section of this report, but the classification noted above suggests that the FBI may prioritize investigation of criminal organizations engaging in cybercrime over lone actors.", "While there is a clear distinction that organized crime groups are motivated by profit and terrorists are motivated by ideologies, the motivation of state sponsored cyber threat actors may be more difficult to categorize and determine. This may be in part because different state sponsored actors may have different motivations, as is implied by the FBI description of the range of state sponsored cyber threats. For instance, some actors targeting the intellectual property of manufacturers and corporations may aim to gain a competitive advantage for businesses based in a particular country. Others actors seeking data from government agencies and contractors may desire to utilize this information to undermine the integrity and security of a rival nation.

Complicating this is the lack of clear attribution for the perpetrators. Although the security breach appeared to have origins in China, without an understanding of whether it was sponsored by a foreign government or military, it is difficult to categorize whether the hacking was merely a criminal activity or part of what could be considered an economic espionage campaign.

And, because Anonymous is known to be a loosely connected organization, can all members and actors be assimilated into the same category? Members' differing goals and activities may require that a variety of conceptualizations be applied to Anonymous and that a range of strategies be employed to counter any illegal activities. In its counter-Anonymous activities to date, the U.S. government has primarily treated the collective as a criminal entity and has indicted and arrested individuals associated with specific hacking and data breach incidents.", "Individuals associated with Anonymous have been charged and sentenced for their roles in a distributed denial of service attack against the website of Angel Soft bathroom tissue, a subsidiary of Koch Industries. The defendants reportedly used a \"'low orbit ion cannon' designed to flood the Angel Soft server with traffic with the intention of disrupting the website's service.\" The attack supposedly cost the Koch Industries several hundred-thousand dollars in losses. In March 2012, the Department of Justice indicted six individuals in the United States and abroad for hacking and other crimes related to their participation in Anonymous and related groups. The indictment cited the December 2011 hacking of Stratfor and theft of confidential information of about 860,000 individuals.

The USSS does not, however, have a publicly available definition for what it considers cybercrime. The USSS is charged with protecting the nation's financial infrastructure and payment systems to safeguard the economy. As such, it has established a Cyber Intelligence Unit, 45 Financial Crimes Task Forces, and 33 Electronic Crime Task Forces that investigate a range of crimes, including those with a cyber component.

For instance, identity theft (18 U.S.C. \u00a71028(a)(7)) is a crime whether it is committed solely in the real world or carried out via cyber means.

Indeed, some have argued that the prevention and remediation of cybercrime hinge on definitional clarity. If government agencies and private sector businesses design strategies and missions around combating \"cybercrime,\" it may be useful to communicate a clear definition of cybercrime to those individuals who may be involved in carrying out the strategies. For instance, if Congress receives an appropriations request for agency funds to combat cybercrime, policy makers may find it beneficial to understand what is meant by the term cybercrime as well as what activities would be implemented to combat the threat before deciding whether or not, as well as the extent to which, appropriations may be warranted.

For example, legal frameworks direct that law enforcement responds to criminal actors, the intelligence community engages in counterintelligence, and the military addresses threats posed by nation-states.

Firstly, the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes cybercrime presents a barrier to tracking comprehensive cybercrime data.

For instance, \"[m]any financial organisations still prefer to draw a veil over the issue of cybercrime losses because of the technological 'lack' it suggests in their operations.\" Companies may fear that reporting data breaches could damage their professional reputations and lead to customers/consumers pulling their support and patronage.
