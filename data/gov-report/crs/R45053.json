This report describes the federal tax structure, provides some statistics on the tax system as a whole, as of 2017.", "Historically, the largest component of the federal tax system, in terms of revenue generated, has been the individual income tax. In fiscal year (FY) 2016, $1.5 trillion, or 47% of the federal government's revenue, was collected from the individual income tax. The corporate income tax generated another $300 billion in revenue in FY2016, or 9% of total revenue. Social insurance or payroll taxes generated $1.1 trillion, or 34% of revenue in FY2016. Revenues in 2016 were 17.8% of GDP, slightly above the post-World War II average of 17.3%.", "The federal individual income tax is levied on an individual's taxable income, which is adjusted gross income (AGI) less deductions and exemptions. Tax rates based on filing status (e.g., married filing jointly, head of household, or single individual) determine the level of tax liability. Tax rates in the United States are generally progressive, such that higher levels of income are typically taxed at higher rates. Once tentative tax liability is calculated, tax credits can be used to reduce tax liability. Tax deductions and tax credits are tools available to policymakers to increase or decrease the after-tax price of undertaking specific activities. Individuals with high levels of exemptions, deductions, and credits relative to income may be required to file under the alternative minimum tax (AMT).", "Corporate taxable income is also subject to varying rates, where those with higher levels of income pay higher levels of taxes. Social Security and Medicare tax rates are, respectively, 12.4% and 2.9% of earnings. In 2017, Social Security taxes are levied on the first $127,200 of wages. Medicare taxes are assessed against all wage income. Federal excise taxes are levied on specific goods, such as transportation fuels, alcohol, and tobacco.", "Looking at the tax system as a whole, several observations can be made. Notably, the composition of revenues has changed over time. Corporate income tax revenues have become a smaller share of overall tax revenues over time, while social insurance revenues have trended upwards as a share of total revenues. Social insurance revenues are a sizable component of the overall federal tax system. Most taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. Many taxpayers pay social insurance taxes but do not pay individual income taxes, having incomes below the amount that would generate a positive income tax liability. From an international perspective, the U.S. federal tax system tends to collect less in federal revenues as a percentage of GDP than other OECD countries.", "This report reflects the tax system as in effect in 2017.

President Barack Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in 2010 to address the deficit and national debt. In December 2010, the Fiscal Commission released its final report, \"A Moment of Truth,\" which included base-broadening, rate-reducing, revenue-raising tax reform as part of a broader fiscal reform package.

Currently, the individual income tax system has seven marginal income tax rates: 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%.

If a tax credit is refundable, and the credit amount exceeds tax liability, a taxpayer receives the credit (or a portion of the credit) as a refund. If credits are not refundable, then the credit is limited to the amount of tax liability. In some cases, unused credits can be carried forward to offset tax liability in future tax years.

For example, the earned income tax credit (EITC) phases in as income increases, reducing a taxpayer's marginal tax rate.

Having these \"bubble\" rates, or higher marginal tax rates along part of the schedule, increases the effective tax rate for higher-income corporations. Essentially, these higher \"bubble\" brackets serve to reduce any tax savings larger corporations would have incurred from having their first $75,000 in income taxed at lower rates.", "In broad economic terms, the base of the corporate income tax is the return to equity capital. Wages are tax deductible, so labor's contribution to corporate revenue is excluded from the corporate tax base. Income produced by corporate capital investment includes that produced by corporate investment of borrowed funds, and that produced by investment of equity, or funds provided by stockholders. Profits from debt-financed investment are paid out as interest, which is deductible. Thus, the return to debt capital is excluded from the corporate tax base. Equity investments are financed by retained earnings and the sale of stock. The income equity investment generates is paid out as dividends and the capital gains that accrue as stock increases in value. Neither form of income is generally deductible. Thus, the base of the corporate income tax is largely the return to equity capital.", "Because of the nature of its base, the corporate income tax has several broad effects on the allocation of capital investment. First, it favors non-corporate investment\u2014for example, unincorporated business and owner-occupied housing\u2014over corporate investment. Second, it favors corporate debt over corporate equity investment since the former is not subject to the tax. However, while the base of the tax is largely equity income, the flow of capital out of the corporate sector and other economic adjustments probably cause the burden of the tax to spread to all owners of capital: owners of unincorporated business, bondholders, and homeowners. Government agencies analyzing the incidence of the corporate tax distribute most of the burden to owners of capital, with a smaller portion falling on labor income.
