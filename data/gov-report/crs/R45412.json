ABPs were first introduced in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA 2005; P.L. 109-171 P.L. 109-171) and are referred to in the Social Security Act (SSA) as benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage.", "In general, under traditional Medicaid benefit coverage, state Medicaid programs must cover specific required services listed in statute (e.g., inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician's services, or laboratory and x-ray services) and may elect to cover certain optional services (e.g., prescription drugs, case management, or physical therapy services). Under ABPs, by contrast, states may furnish a benefit that is defined by reference to an overall coverage benchmark that is based on one of three commercial insurance products (e.g., the commercial health maintenance organization (HMO) with the largest insured commercial, non-Medicaid enrollment in the state) or a fourth, \"Secretary-approved\" coverage option rather than a list of discrete items and services. The 33 states and District of Columbia that have implemented the state option to expand Medicaid to low-income adults under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) are required to cover the ACA Medicaid expansion population using ABPs, and states also may elect to require other Medicaid populations to receive care through ABPs.

In addition, ABPs must include a variety of specific services, including services under Medicaid's early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and testing (EPSDT) benefit and family planning services and supplies. Unlike traditional Medicaid benefit coverage, coverage under an ABP must include at least the essential health benefits (EHB) that most plans in the private health insurance market are required to furnish. States choose whether to furnish ABPs through managed care or a fee-for-service delivery system. The Medicaid limitations on beneficiary premiums and cost sharing apply to services furnished through ABPs.", "To date, states have chiefly used ABPs as the benefit package for the ACA Medicaid expansion population. However, several states have elected to use ABPs to serve other Medicaid populations (e.g., working individuals with disabilities or children and adults who do not have special health care needs).

ABP coverage meets the requirements in DRA 2005 if (among other requirements) it either corresponds precisely to a benchmark plan selected by the state from options listed in the law or qualifies as benchmark-equivalent because the ABP has an aggregate actuarial value equivalent to the selected benchmark benefit package and meets various other requirements in the statute.

States can even design different ABPs for different beneficiary subgroups. States are nonetheless prohibited from requiring various high-needs subcategories of Medicaid beneficiaries from receiving Medicaid through ABPs.", "The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA 2009; P.L. 111-3 ) and the ACA with its implementing regulations made significant changes to the ABP requirements, relating both to the scope of benchmark and benchmark-equivalent coverage and to the populations that may be required to receive Medicaid through ABPs.
