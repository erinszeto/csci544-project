For PDUFA to succeed, FDA, industry, and Congress had to agree on two concepts: (1) performance goals \u2014FDA would commit to performance goals it would negotiate with industry that set target completion times for various review processes; and (2) use of fees \u2014the revenue from prescription drug user fees would be used only for activities to support the review of human drug applications and would supplement, rather than replace, funding that Congress appropriated to FDA. The added resources from user fees allowed FDA to increase staff to review what was then a backlog of new drug applications and to reduce application review times.

Medical devices are broadly integrated into health care and include simple devices, such as tongue depressors, as well as more complex devices, such as implantable hips. The extent of FDA authority to regulate whether a device may be marketed in the United States and how it is monitored afterward varies across types of devices.", "To determine the applicability of premarket requirements (i.e., clearance or approval before marketing) for a given device, FDA classifies the device based on the risk to the patient: (1) low-risk devices are class I; (2) moderate-risk devices are class II; and (3) high-risk devices are class III. Low-risk medical devices (class I) and a very small number of moderate-risk medical devices (class II) are exempt from premarket review. In general, for moderate-risk and high-risk medical devices, manufactures may use two pathways to bring such devices to market with FDA's permission: (1) premarket approval (PMA) and (2) premarket notification submission (also known as a 510(k) submission, after the section in the FFDCA that authorized this type of notification).", "The PMA process generally consists of conducting clinical studies and submitting a PMA application, which requires evidence providing reasonable assurance that a device is safe and effective. This is somewhat analogous to the new drug application process. A PMA is used for novel and high-risk devices, is often lengthy and expensive, and results in a type of FDA permission called approval. The other path involves submitting a 510(k) notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device already on the market (a predicate device) that does not require a PMA. The 510(k) process is unique to medical devices and results in FDA clearance. Substantial equivalence is determined by comparing the performance characteristics of a new device with those of a predicate device.", "Once a device is on the market, FDA has authority to carry out certain activities to monitor the device's safety and effectiveness. The extent of the agency's postmarket authority is tied to characteristics of the device. Manufacturer requirements include areas such as labeling, postmarket surveillance, device tracking, and adverse event reporting.", "In general, Title VII makes the following amendments to various FFDCA provisions to modify various aspects of device regulation:", "Amends FFDCA Section 510(h) to change the inspection schedule of establishments engaged in the manufacture or processing of a device from biennial to a risk-based approach (\u00a7701). Amends FFDCA Section 704 to require the Secretary to identify and adopt uniform standards and processes for the conduct of device establishment inspections, other than for-cause inspections; these must allow unspecified exceptions to the inspection processes and standards, require notification within a reasonable timeframe to the establishment of the type and nature of the inspection, and require to the extent feasible advance notice of the records that will be requested; and requires the issuance of draft and final guidance regarding these changes to inspections (\u00a7702). Amends FFDCA Section 501(j) to add that a device may be considered to be adulterated if the device establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection (\u00a7702). Amends FFDCA Section 704 to reauthorize through FY2022 the third-party inspection program, allowing accredited third parties to inspect medical device establishments (\u00a7703). Amends FFDCA Section 801 to make changes regarding the certification of devices for export: if a request for certification is denied, the basis for the denial shall be provided in writing; the Secretary shall not deny a request for certification solely on the basis of an inspection report that documents violations, provided that the device establishment has agreed to a plan of correction in response to such a report; the owner of a device establishment may request a review at any time to present new information that addresses the reasons for denial of certification; and requires the issuance of guidance regarding these changes (\u00a7704).

Adds a new subsection (y) to FFDCA Section 505; following the marketing authorization of an imaging device that uses a contrast agent, the sponsor of the contrast agent may submit a supplemental application for the new use of the contrast agent; specifies that the agency center charged with the premarket review of drugs has jurisdiction over review of the supplement; and provides definitions for \"new use,\" \"applicable medical imaging device,\" and \"contrast agent\" (\u00a7706). Amends FFDCA Section 513 to make changes to the classification of accessories that are used with medical devices; directs the Secretary to classify an accessory to a device based on the risks of the accessory when used as intended, rather than the risk of the device with which the accessory is intended to be used (\u00a7707). Amends FFDCA Section 519 to direct the Secretary to initiate one or more voluntary postmarket pilot projects to generate timely and reliable information on the safety and effectiveness of approved or cleared medical devices: the pilot projects will use electronic health data and will prioritize certain specified devices and device types; requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress on the status of each pilot project and sunsets the project on October 1, 2022; requires the Secretary, acting through the FDA Commissioner, to conduct a review through an independent third-party contract to determine whether such pilot projects generate reliable and timely evidence about the safety and effectiveness of medical devices (\u00a7708).

Specifically, FDA posted on its website a list of drugs that have no listed patents or exclusivities and for which there is no approved ANDA. The agency states that it intends to expedite the review of ANDAs for drugs on this list and will continue to expedite the review of ANDAs until there are three approved generics for a given drug.

Allows the Secretary to expedite the inspection or reinspection of an establishment that proposes to manufacture such a drug (\u00a7801). Requires the applicant, in order to qualify for priority review, to provide complete, accurate information regarding the facilities involved in manufacturing processes and testing of the drug to enable the Secretary to determine whether an inspection of the facility is necessary (\u00a7801). Requires the Secretary to publish on the FDA website, and update every six months, a list of drugs for which all patents and periods of exclusivity have expired and for which no ANDA has been approved (\u00a7801). Amends FFDCA Section 505(j), requiring the Secretary, upon request of the applicant, to provide review status updates for pending ANDAs, as specified (\u00a7802). Creates a new FFDCA Section 506H, \"Competitive Generic Therapies\" which allows the Secretary, upon request of the applicant, to designate a drug as a competitive generic therapy if the Secretary determines that there is inadequate generic competition ; defines inadequate generic competition to mean there is not more than one approved drug listed in the active section of the Orange Book that is either (1) the RLD (i.e., the brand-name drug, and there is no approved generic) or (2) a generic drug with the same RLD as the drug seeking competitive generic therapy designation (i.e., one generic drug has been approved, but the RLD has been discontinued); and allows the Secretary to expedite the development and review of an ANDA of a competitive generic therapy (\u00a7803).
