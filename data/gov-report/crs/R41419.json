After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the federal government began deploying neutron detectors at the U.S. border to help secure the nation against smuggled nuclear and radiological material. The deployment of this equipment created new demand for helium-3. Use of the polarized helium-3 medical imaging technique also increased. As a result, the size of the stockpile shrank. After several years of demand exceeding supply, a call for large quantities of helium-3 spurred federal officials to realize that insufficient helium-3 was available to meet the likely future demand.", "Policymakers now face a number of challenging decisions. In the short term, these decisions are mainly about how to allocate a scarce resource in the face of competing priorities: science versus security, the private sector versus the public sector, and national needs versus international obligations.

For example, some types of cryogenic research can only be accomplished using helium-3, whereas in medical imaging and neutron detection, helium-3 has advantages but also alternatives. In the longer term, policymakers also face choices about how or whether to increase helium-3 supply or reduce helium-3 demand and about possible alternative mechanisms for allocating supply. It seems likely that a combination of policy approaches will be necessary.", "In addition to the nuclear weapons program, potential sources of helium-3 include tritium produced as a byproduct in commercial heavy-water nuclear reactors; extraction of naturally occurring helium-3 from natural gas or the atmosphere; and production of either tritium or helium-3 using particle accelerators.

This uncertainty results from incomplete characterization of the sources, variability in helium-3 content, and other factors, such as the willingness of public or private entities to invest in infrastructure to enable production at a particular scale.

The NNSA recycles the mixture of tritium and helium-3 that results from this decay process and reuses the resulting pure tritium.

If this capacity were fully utilized at Watts Bar and Sequoyah, annual helium-3 production from the resulting additional tritium could eventually increase by approximately 25,000 liters. At present, however, the site-specific licenses for Watts Bar and Sequoyah permit irradiation of only a much smaller number of TPBARs, and the TVA has limited that number still further because of an issue with tritium permeation into the reactor cooling water. If the current rate of 544 TPBARs per cycle at Watts Bar were successfully extended to both Sequoyah reactors, the result might be an eventual increase in annual helium-3 production of approximately 3,000 liters.", "To realize these annual production rates, however, the increased tritium production would need to continue for many years.

Only after more than a decade of increased tritium production would the rate of additional helium-3 production approach even 50% of the projected long-term level.", "At present, the nuclear weapons program, in effect, subsidizes the cost of production for helium-3, because the program must manufacture and purify tritium for the ongoing maintenance of its nuclear weapons. The same would presumably be true for additional helium-3 that resulted from increased tritium production to meet the weapons program's needs. If, however, the weapons program increased tritium production to more than the amount it needed, solely in order to generate additional helium-3, it might pass the additional infrastructure and processing costs on to the users of helium-3. According to one estimate, the unsubsidized cost of manufacturing tritium for the nuclear weapons program is between $84,000 and $130,000 per gram.

A different view might identify the lower price as a subsidy for those federal agencies and grantees, a subsidy for which the other customers are ineligible. Alternatively, the higher prices for nonfederal customers might reflect the greater ability of nonfederal customers to recoup these additional costs through the production of value-added goods and services. Finally, the current pricing schedule implies that the medical community is more similar to the federal customers and their grantees than the nonfederal customers, since the federal price and the medical prices have increased commensurately.

For example, private companies might not wish to invest capital in facilities to separate helium-3 from natural gas if they fear that the government will increase its production of tritium through the weapons program, or if they fear that the government may facilitate or subsidize purchases of helium-3 from other countries. To offset such uncertainty, the government might provide incentives to private producers through subsidies, tax credits, market guarantees, or other means."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Summary of Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["In summary, Congress could address the helium-3 shortage in a variety of ways:", "Oversight of the current situation, how it arose, and the processes currently in place for addressing it. Actions to increase supply: Mandate or encourage increased tritium manufacture by the government or by the private sector through measures such as subsidies or tax incentives. Facilitate access to international sources, perhaps through support for international agreements. Seek alternative sources: commission studies, fund R&D projects or demonstration plants, provide subsidies or incentives. Mandate or facilitate recycling. Actions to reduce demand: Fund or encourage the development of alternative technologies. Require or provide incentives for the use of alternative technologies. Choices about how the supply should be allocated: Establish or modify a process and criteria for prioritized allocation by the government. Establish a market-based process for allocation.
