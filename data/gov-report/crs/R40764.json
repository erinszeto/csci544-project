As of March 2011, DOD had more contractor personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq (155,000) than uniformed personnel (145,000). Contractors made up 52% of DOD's workforce in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since December 2009, the number of DOD contractors in Afghanistan has exceeded the number in Iraq.", "According to DOD, in Afghanistan, as of March 2011, there were 90,339 DOD contractor personnel, compared to approximately 99,800 uniformed personnel. Contractors made up 48% of DOD's workforce in Afghanistan at that time. This compares to December 2008, when contractors represented 69% of DOD's workforce in Afghanistan. According to DOD data, the recent surge of uniformed personnel in Afghanistan and the increase in contract obligations did not result in a corresponding increase in contractor personnel.", "DOD obligated approximately $11.8 billion on contracts performed primarily in the Afghanistan theater of operations (including surrounding countries) in FY2010, representing 15% of total DOD obligations for the area.

Contractors made up 58% of DOD's workforce in Iraq. Contractor and troop levels have decreased every quarter for the last nine quarters. DOD obligated approximately $15.4 billion on contracts in the Iraq theater in FY2010, representing 20% of total DOD obligations for the area.

During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Army relied on contractors to provide such goods and services as transportation and engineering services, construction, clothing, and weapons. Since then, advances in warfare and technology have expanded the functions and responsibilities of contractors in military operations. After the Cold War, reliance on contractors further increased when DOD cut logistic and support personnel. As a result of these cuts, DOD lost in-house capability and was forced to rely even further on contractor support. Many analysts now believe that DOD is unable to successfully execute large missions without contractor support. These analysts point to recent contingency operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans\u2014the three largest military operations of the past 15 years\u2014where contractors have comprised approximately 50% of DOD's combined contractor and uniformed personnel workforce in country (see Figure 1 ). ", "Contractors are often seen as providing operational benefits to DOD. Using contractors to perform non-combat activities augments the total force and can free up uniformed personnel for combat missions. Since contractors can be hired faster than DOD can develop an internal capability, contractors can be quickly deployed to provide critical support capabilities when necessary. Contractors also provide expertise in specialized fields that DOD may not possess, such as linguistics. Using contractors can also save DOD money. Contractors can be hired when a particular need arises and be let go when their services are no longer needed. Hiring contractors only as needed can be cheaper in the long run than maintaining a permanent in-house capability.

The Commission on Wartime Contracting highlighted over-spending on contracts as a key concern.

In July 2008, DOD, the Department of State, and USAID signed a memorandum of understanding designating SPOT as the system to track contractor.

Specifically, there has been inconsistency in the reporting of day laborer personnel. SPOT [the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker system] does not require the registration of contractors working on a contract for less than 30 days. However, some contracting activities (in some quarters) include these contractors in their total manual census/SPOT Plus count. The inconsistency of who is counted is compounded by the frequent turnover of personnel responsible to provide input to the census and their individual understanding of reporting requirements.

Employing local nationals injects money into the local economy, provides job training, builds support among local nationals, and can give the U.S. a more sophisticated understanding of the local landscape, says DOD. In January 2009, General Raymond Odierno issued a memorandum to this effect, stating \"employment of Iraqis not only saves money but it also strengthens the Iraqi economy and helps eliminate the root causes of the insurgency\u2014poverty and lack of economic opportunity.\" The memorandum set forth a goal of increasing the percentage of local national contractors. Despite this policy, DOD has trended away from using local nationals as contractor personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq. The percentage of contractors who were local nationals in both countries dropped from 49% in December 2009 to 36% in March 2011. ", "An analysis of contractor data also appears to indicate differences in how DOD used contractors in Afghanistan when compared to Iraq. For example, 51% of contractors in Afghanistan are local nationals compared to only 15% in Iraq (see Figure 5 and Figure 11 , respectively). Some analysts contend that understanding these differences\u2014and why they occur\u2014could help DOD to strategically plan for the management and use of contractors in future operations.

For example, focusing on the nationality of contractor personnel, and not where in Afghanistan workers are from, can undermine some of the goals of the Afghan first policy. When contractors are working in a given region, the local population often wants local residents to be hired to perform the work. In such situations, bringing in Afghan contractors who are not from the local community could undermine efforts to build relationships with the local populace. Another issue to consider is whether in certain circumstances awarding contracts to local nationals could empower bad actors, criminal gangs, or corrupt individuals.
