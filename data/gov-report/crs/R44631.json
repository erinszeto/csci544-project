For example, the FCA would repeal Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, also known as the \"Volcker Rule.\" The Volcker Rule has two main parts\u2014it prohibits banks from proprietary trading of risky assets and from certain relationships with risky investment funds, including acquiring or retaining \"any equity, partnership, or other ownership interest in or sponsor a hedge fund or a private equity fund.\" The statute carves out exemptions from the rule for trading activities that Congress viewed as legitimate for banks to participate in, such as risk-mitigating hedging and market-making related to broker-dealer activities. It also exempts certain securities, including those issued by the federal government, government agencies, states, and municipalities, from the ban on proprietary trading. Other provisions would modify the supervision of lenders for safety and soundness. For example, the FCA would require regulators to satisfy certain timelines for completing bank examinations and establish a new ombudsman to investigate bank complaints about supervisory exams. It would prohibit specific actions by the supervisor in retaliation for appealing. It would give banks the right to appeal exam results to the ombudsman or an administrative law judge, and would not allow the ombudsman or judge to defer to the supervisor's opinions. It would not permit further appeal by the supervisor, but would allow the bank to appeal this decision to appellate court. Other provisions would reduce regulatory compliance costs.

Prudential regulation covers a broad set of a bank's activities, including assessing whether a bank will be able to meet its obligations during a market downturn, evaluating the quality of its assets and management team, and other factors. One of the main areas of focus is bank capital. ", "Capital is the difference between the value of a bank's assets and its liabilities and is an indicator of a bank's ability to absorb losses. If a bank has $100 worth of assets and $90 of liabilities, then the bank has capital of $10. If the value of the assets decreases by $5 to $95 and the bank still has $90 in liabilities, then the $5 decline in asset value would be absorbed by the capital, which would decrease from $10 to $5.", "Capital is often measured as the ratio of capital to the bank's assets. A 10% capital ratio, for example, would imply $10 of capital for every $100 of assets. Banks are required to satisfy several different capital ratios, but the ratios fall into two main categories: (1) a leverage ratio and (2) a risk-weighted asset ratio. Failure to satisfy the required ratios could lead to regulators taking corrective action against a bank, including ultimately shutting the bank down. ", "Under a leverage ratio, all assets regardless of riskiness are treated the same and, as in the previous example, the ratio is calculated by dividing capital by assets. Under a risk-weighted asset ratio, each asset is assigned a risk weight to account for the fact that some assets are more likely to lose value than others. Riskier assets receive a higher risk weight, which requires banks to hold more capital\u2014and so be better able to absorb losses\u2014to meet the ratio requirement. ", "The specifics of the capital ratios\u2014what the minimum levels are, what qualifies as capital, what the asset risk weights are, what is included in total assets\u2014were proposed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision and then implemented by the U.S. financial regulators. The Basel Committee \"is the primary global standard-setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters.\" The most recent proposed comprehensive reform proposal is referred to as Basel III. ", "The capital ratios that a bank must satisfy and how those levels are computed varies based on a bank's size and complexity. The largest banks are required to hold more capital than smaller, less complex banks. In regards to the simple leverage ratio, most banks are required to meet a 4% leverage ratio. Large banks are subject to a supplementary leverage ratio ranging from 3% to 6% depending on their size and the type of bank charter they hold. The supplementary leverage ratio is more expansive than the leverage ratio to which smaller banks are subject because it takes into account certain off-balance sheet assets and exposures.", "The required risk-weighted ratios depend on bank size and capital quality (some types of capital are considered to be less effective at absorbing losses than other types, and so considered lower quality). Most banks must meet a risk-weighted ratio of 4.5% for the highest quality capital and of 6% and 8% for lower quality capital. Banks are then required to have an additional 2.5% of high quality capital on top of those levels as part of the \"capital conservation buffer.\" The eight U.S. banks that have been designated as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) face a capital surcharge that can range from 1% to 4.5%. Although currently set at zero and not yet fully phased in, a large bank also could be subject to a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets if regulators deem it necessary. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Issues", "paragraphs": ["Some economists argue that it is important to have both a risk-weighted ratio and a leverage ratio because the two complement each other. A basic tenet of finance is that riskier assets have a higher expected rate of return to compensate the investor for bearing more risk. Without risk weighting, banks would have an incentive to hold riskier assets because capital is costly and the same amount of capital must be held against riskier and safer assets. But risk weights may prove inaccurate. For example, banks held highly rated mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) before the crisis, in part because those assets had a higher expected rate of return than other assets with the same risk weight. MBSs then suffered unexpectedly large losses during the crisis. Thus, the leverage ratio can be thought of as a backstop to ensure that incentives posed by risk-weighted capital ratios to minimize capital and maximize risk within a risk weight do not result in a bank holding insufficient capital. ", "Others argue that the risk-weighted system provides \"needless complexity\" and is an example of \"central planning.\" The complexity benefits those largest banks that have the resources to absorb the added regulatory cost. They believe that the risk weights in place prior to the financial crisis were poorly calibrated and \"encouraged financial firms to crowd into these\" risky assets, exacerbating the downturn. Risk weighting may encourage regulators to set the weights so as \"to provide a cheaper source of funding for governments and projects favored by politicians,\" which can lead to a distortion in credit allocation. Better, they argue, to eliminate the risk-weighted system for those banks that agree to hold more capital and satisfy a higher, simpler leverage ratio.", "In addition to the issue of whether it is better to have either both a risk-weighted ratio and a leverage ratio or just a leverage ratio is the broader issue of the role of capital in bank regulation. Those who argue in favor of just having a higher leverage ratio also generally support eliminating other forms of prudential regulation, such as liquidity requirements, asset concentration guidelines, and counterparty limits. They argue that capital is essential to absorbing losses and, so long as sufficient capital is in place, banks should not be subject to excessive regulatory micromanagement. Others, however, believe that the different components of prudential regulation each play an important role in ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions and are essential complements to bank capital.

A bank would not have to follow this new regulatory approach but would have the option. Regulators would still have authority to conduct stress tests on certain entities that opted for the new regulatory approach but would be limited in their ability to require them to alter their capital levels.

Among the over three dozen securities-related provisions in the FCA are", "Provisions that relax restrictions on who is eligible to invest in certain types of securities, including venture capital investors. For example, under federal securities laws, entities who qualify as accredited investors are eligible to invest in private and limited corporate offerings (private placements) that are exempt from SEC registration requirements. The concept of the accredited investor is that some investors are sophisticated enough to understand the risks of investing in privately placed securities. Individuals are currently defined as accredited investors based on income or asset thresholds. The FCA would amend the definition of an accredited investor to also include licensed securities industry professionals (including registered brokers and investment advisers) and persons whom the SEC and FINRA determines to have certain educational or job experiences that qualify them as having sufficient professional subject expertise. The FCA provision is modeled after H.R. 2187 , which previously passed the House. Provisions that relax regulatory requirements on licensed professionals in the securities industry, including private equity advisers, private funds, municipal advisors, investment fund researchers, and credit rating agencies. For example, under federal securities laws, SEC-registered investment advisers are fiduciaries , a designation that carries a legal obligation to act in their client's best interest. By contrast, brokers and dealers who receive commissions are generally not subject to the fiduciary standard, and are instead required to make investment recommendations that are suitable for the customer, a comparatively less demanding standard of client duty. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized, but did not require, the SEC to promulgate rules that establish a uniform standard of client responsibility for broker-dealers and investment advisers, which SEC officials currently describe as a work in progress. In 2016, the Department of Labor (DOL) finalized rules to amend the definition of investment advice to broaden the class of financial professionals subject to the fiduciary obligation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 which governs retirement and benefit plans. The rules go into effect April 10, 2017. The FCA would repeal the DOL rule and require that prior to conducting the aforementioned rulemaking, the SEC must first report to Congress on whether (1) retail investors would be harmed by the rule; and (2) alternative approaches existed to reduce confusion or harm to retail investors. The provision is modeled after provisions in H.R. 1090 , which previously passed the House. Provisions that relax regulatory requirements for firms that issue capital or securities, including emerging growth companies, risk retention requirements for non-mortgage securitizers, firms subject to disclosures on conflict minerals, and companies raising funds via crowdfunding or from angel investors. For example, Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires public company annual reports to include commentary on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls (methodology aimed at ensuring the integrity of financial and accounting information) and requires a company's outside auditor to attest to that managerial assessment of the internal controls. Due to the proportionally higher cost on smaller public companies of complying with Section 404(b), the Dodd-Frank Act permanently exempted non-accelerated filers\u2014generally public companies with less than $75 million in global public float\u2014from compliance with Section 404(b). Many in the business community still criticize Section 404(b) for being problematically costly for firms with more than $75 million in public float, however. In a study required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC did not recommend expanding the current Section 404(b) exemption threshold. The FCA would expand the number of firms with Section 404(b) exemptions from less than $75 million to less than $250 million in public float. The FCA would also extend the exemption to depository institutions with less than $1 billion in assets. Provisions related to derivatives markets. One example is the regulation of cross-border swaps. The topic of cross-border swaps broadly relates to the question of to what degree did the Dodd-Frank Act authorize the CFTC to regulate swaps that may extend beyond U.S. borders? Because the swaps market is international in nature, with considerable cross-border trading, this question is material. The Dodd-Frank Act stated that swaps reforms shall not apply to activities outside the United States unless the activities have \"a direct and significant connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States.\" One issue that has arisen is the need for U.S. and foreign regulators to recognize one another's derivatives clearinghouses, trading exchanges, and data repositories for reporting trades as \"equivalent,\" so that one trade spanning multiple jurisdictions need only be cleared, traded, and reported one time. The FCA requires the CFTC to issue a rule within one year that establishes criteria for finding foreign jurisdictions regulations comprehensive and comparable to the U.S. regime. If the CFTC has not done so after 18 months, the FCA would consider the eight largest foreign swaps jurisdictions (which would encompass most of the world of swaps trading, particularly if countries in the European Union were treated as one swaps jurisdiction) to be comparable and comprehensive\u2014unless the CFTC found a foreign jurisdiction to be lacking.

The Dodd-Frank Act's main approach was to create an enhanced regulatory regime mostly administered by the Federal Reserve to hold systemically important firms to stricter prudential standards than other financial firms. Prudential regulation is a concept from banking regulation that refers to monitoring an institution's financial safety and soundness; the concept was generally not applied federally to nonbank financial firms before the crisis, with limited exceptions. The enhanced regulatory regime can include capital standards, liquidity standards, counterparty limits, stress tests, risk-management standards, \"living will\" requirements, and early remediation requirements. ", "The Dodd-Frank Act applied enhanced prudential regulation to three sets of financial entities\u2014banks; nonbank financial firms; and payment, clearing, and settlement systems (called financial market utilities , or FMUs). Bank holding companies (BHCs) are automatically subject to enhanced regulation if they have $50 billion or more in assets. More than 30 BHCs, including most of the largest U.S. financial firms, meet this criterion. A BHC cannot \"debank\" to avoid enhanced regulation if it received funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (referred to as the \"Hotel California\" provision). A smaller subset of the largest U.S. BHCs faces, when fully phased in, additional capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements through U.S. regulations implementing Basel III, an international accord. Nonbank financial firms and FMUs are subject to enhanced regulation if they are designated as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. To date, eight FMUs and four nonbank financial firms, three of which are insurance companies, have been designated. Subsequently, one firm (GE Capital) has had its designation removed by FSOC and one designation (MetLife) has been overturned in court. ", "The Dodd-Frank Act included other approaches to coping with the TBTF problem, including provisions to limit the size of financial firms and narrow the scope of emergency authority to limit future \"bailouts\". It gave the Federal Reserve the authority to restrict the size and activities of a financial firm that posed \"a grave threat to financial stability\" and prevented a nonbank financial firm from most mergers and acquisitions that would cause its liabilities to exceed 10% of total financial-sector liabilities. These powers could be used only in limited circumstances, however, and have not been exercised to date.

Although these two approaches need not be at odds with one another in the abstract\u2014and policymakers have tried to pursue both simultaneously\u2014in practice they may be.

They point to the excessive risk taking leading up to 2008\u2014when the government did not have a policy of aiding failing firms\u2014and the subsequent decision to assist large firms to avoid a further deterioration in financial conditions as an example of the failure of market discipline. Also, the fact that many large failing firms did receive government assistance in 2008 may have already undermined the viability of the market discipline approach, by undermining the credibility of any subsequent pledge to allow firms to fail (regardless of current statutory limitations). Furthermore, systemic risk is a risk to the rest of society that investors do not internalize. From a policymaker's perspective, systemic risk may still be too high in the presence of perfect market discipline, because a TBTF firm's creditors have less to lose from its failure than the financial system as a whole. Another limit to market discipline is that creditors do not have access to the same confidential information as regulators.", "The concept of prudential regulation of nonbank SIFIs raises additional policy questions: ", "Enhanced regulation. Can the Federal Reserve effectively adapt banking prudential regulation and supervision to nonbanks, tailoring regulation to match their business models and the risks that they pose? Designation process. Given the lack of consensus on how to measure systemic importance, is FSOC's discretion appropriate or is the existing designation process too opaque and arbitrary?

Subsequently, the financial system suffered a financial panic. Some analysts believe that the rules for resolving failing non-bank financial firms contributed to financial instability during 2007-2008. ", "In response to these concerns, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act created a special resolution regime (called Orderly Liquidation Authority or OLA) for liquidating failing financial firms if federal policymakers determine that a firm's failure poses a threat to financial stability. OLA is statutorily structured as a fallback alternative to the normally applicable insolvency regimes, such as the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and is to be triggered only under extraordinary circumstances. OLA is an administrative, rather than judicial, resolution forum modeled on how the FDIC resolves insured depository institutions. Should the failing firm's estate lack sufficient liquid assets to prevent creditor reactions from contributing to financial instability, the FDIC is empowered to contribute resources to the failing firm's estate. Any such payments would be recouped by assessments on surviving firms in the financial industry. (Note that access to OLA is not limited to designated SIFIs and has not been used to date.)", "The failure of most nonbank financial institutions generally is dealt with under the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Code consists of separate chapters designed for a variety of failing entities. However, certain entities are not statutorily permitted to be resolved through the Bankruptcy Code. The policy justifications for these exceptions vary. For example, the FDIC is statutorily authorized to resolve failing insured depositories administratively in part because the FDIC, as deposit insurer, guarantees payment to depositors even if such obligations exceed the resources of the failing firm's estate, but also due to the threat of financial instability accompanied by widespread failures of depositories. OLA allows another class of firms, financial firms with the exception of depository institutions, to be resolved administratively by the FDIC rather than judicially through the Bankruptcy Code."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Issues", "paragraphs": ["Advocates of the \"Lehman Moment\" explanation of the financial crisis highlight several specific characteristics of financial markets and the Bankruptcy Code at the time that may have magnified financial instability.

Third, some argue that the treatment of some financial contracts, such as acceleration and netting of qualifying financial contracts (QFCs) is done selectively by counterparties to the detriment of the bankruptcy estate. Fourth, some argue that the nature of financial intermediaries' continuous need to access credit (liquidity) makes a bankruptcy process impractical for large financial institutions. ", "Critics of OLA argue that it \"institutionalized\" bailouts and that the FDIC's plan for implementing OLA has promoted \"expectations that the government will come to the rescue of large financial institutions and insulate their creditors and counterparties from losses.\" The government, they argue, should not be given the authority to borrow money to carry out an orderly liquidation, especially given the potentially significant liquidity needs of a large financial institution in receivership. Supporters of OLA, however, note that it is unlikely that markets will be able to provide sufficient private financing during the bankruptcy of a failing firm and, therefore, \"it is not credible to suggest that a financial institution bankruptcy can work without standby government financing,\" as is provided by Title II.

The Chairman of the FDIC, however, has argued that in \"the years since enactment of Dodd-Frank, the FDIC has made significant progress in developing the operational capabilities to carry out a resolution if needed.\" He highlights the FDIC's \"ability to plan and the availability of a large team of professionals experienced in financial institution resolution are additional advantages the FDIC can bring to bear\" in the event OLA is used.

Although Title II instructs the FDIC to generally treat similarly situated creditors similarly, critics worry that the fact that, if necessary for financial stability, the FDIC has \"authority to treat similarly situated creditors differently places far too much discretion in the hands of the government to pick winners and losers\" during a resolution. Uncertainty about how creditors would be treated in a failure could exacerbate a crisis and give an incentive for creditors to race to debtors and demand immediate repayment\u2014to be the first creditor to get paid\u2014thereby hastening insolvency or spreading the financial panic. While proponents argue that OLA can reduce financial instability by reducing uncertainty, this example demonstrates how in some ways OLA can increase uncertainty relative to the bankruptcy process. The FDIC, in addressing these concerns, has noted that it \"expects that disparate treatment of creditors would occur only in very limited circumstances and has, by regulation, expressly limited its discretion to treat similarly situated creditors differently.\" The FDIC has attempted to reduce uncertainty by stating its position on creditor seniority prior to a resolution occurring, but it is unclear how effective that will be at reducing uncertainty given the untested nature of the OLA process. ", "Proponents of OLA primarily point to two potential advantages that could contribute to financial stability: (1) OLA's administrative forum would allow the FDIC to move more quickly than generally is possible through a judicial bankruptcy proceeding, thus decreasing market uncertainty; and (2) OLA's statutory focus on maintaining financial stability, of which there is no statutory equivalent under the existing Bankruptcy Code; and (3) the ability of the FDIC to make guarantees to cover counterparty positions (which the Federal Reserve says it did not have legal authority to make in its decision not to rescue Lehman).", "Critics say the first two advantages could be replicated in a judicial forum by establishing a new chapter of the Bankruptcy Code designed specifically for certain financial institutions.

First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.", "In Chevron , the Supreme Court elucidated several reasons for favoring a restrained judicial role when reviewing an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute. First, the Court noted that when Congress enacts an ambiguous statute, it has, in effect, delegated to the agency the authority to clarify the ambiguity. In other words, Congress made a conscious choice in selecting a specific agency to implement the statutory delegation, and the courts, the Supreme Court reasoned, should respect Congress's decision by granting the agency the ability to interpret the statute Congress has charged it with administering. Moreover, the Court noted that interpreting a statutory ambiguity is akin to making a policy decision on how to implement a statutory program. In the Court's view, agencies and legislators are best suited to balance applicable considerations and to resolve debates regarding competing, acceptable interpretations of an ambiguous delegation.", "Second, according to the Court, agencies have technical expertise in the field in which they are acting and are, therefore, in a better position to make appropriate policy decisions as part of a large and complex regulatory scheme. Courts, on the other hand, generally lack such expertise. In Chevron , the Court specifically acknowledged that \"judges are not experts in the field\" and thus \"may not substitute [their] own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\"", "Finally, the Chevron Court noted that administrative agencies are politically accountable\u2014though not directly\u2014through the democratic process. Although courts are called to reconcile political preferences in certain circumstances, they should not do so when the power to implement the statute has been delegated to an administrative agency. In the Court's view, an Administration has the authority to implement its policy judgments through the permissible interpretation of a statute. If the agency's, and by extension the Administration's, permissible construction of a statute is undesirable, the electorate may have its voice heard through the democratic process. By contrast, when a federal court interprets a statute, the electorate cannot voice similar concerns to the unelected court.", "Some have argued, however, that judicial deference under Chevron has allowed administrative agencies to exercise too much \"power to expand the scope of their own authority ... to decide what and who they can regulate, and how to regulate,\" risking abrupt deviations from long-standing statutory interpretations. Thus, the argument has been made that a recalibration of judicial review of administrative rulemakings is necessary to ensure that laws are interpreted as intended by Congress and to effectively hold agencies accountable in how they implement federal law. By contrast, such a recalibration of the judicial review over agency decisions arguably could result in courts engaging more directly in policymaking decisions. It also might increase the number of legal challenges to agency rulemakings, which could delay the time it takes for new regulations to take legal effect, as well as increase the costs of promulgating regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Provisions in the FCA", "paragraphs": ["The FCA would upend Chevron's policy of judicial deference to administrative rulemakings as it applies to certain federal financial regulators. The provision would apply to regulations issued by the financial regulators listed in Table 1 . In lieu of deferring to the covered agencies' reasonable interpretations of silent or ambiguous statutes in accordance with Chevron , the FCA would require courts to apply a de novo review of administrative actions\u2014that is, review wherein a court reviews an administrative agency's decision without any deference. This would require courts to independently interpret a covered agency's statutory authority, rather than deferring to that agency's reasonable interpretations of the law.
