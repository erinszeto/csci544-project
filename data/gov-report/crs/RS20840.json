If a WTO challenge occurs and is successful, the WTO remedy likely would imply the elimination, alteration, or amendment by Congress of the program in question to bring it into compliance. Since most governing provisions over U.S. farm programs are statutory, new legislation could be required to implement even minor changes to achieve compliance. As a result, designing farm programs that comply with WTO rules can avoid potential trade disputes.

Whenever a program payment influences a producer's behavior it has the potential to distort markets (i.e., to alter the supply of a commodity) from the equilibrium that would otherwise exist in the absence of the program's influence. Those outlays that have the greatest potential to distort agricultural markets\u2014referred to as amber box subsidies\u2014are subject to spending limits. In contrast, more benign outlays (i.e., which cause less or minimal market distortion) are exempted from spending limits under green box, blue box, de minimis , or special and differential treatment exemptions.

Specifically, the WTO uses a traffic light analogy to group programs.", "Green Box programs are minimally or non-trade distorting and not subject to any spending limits. Blue Box programs are described as production-limiting. They have payments that are based on either a fixed area or yield, or a fixed number of livestock, and are made on less than 85% of base production. As such, blue box programs are also not subject to any payment limits. Amber Box programs are the most market-distorting programs and are subject to a strict aggregate, annual spending limit. The United States is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays subject to certain de minimis exclusions. De minimis exemptions are domestic support spending that is sufficiently small\u2014relative to either the value of a specific product or total production\u2014to be deemed benign. De minimis exemptions are limited by 5% of the value of production\u2014either total or product-specific.

", "The key aspect of SCM commitments is the degree to which a domestic support program engenders market distortion. Based on precedent from past WTO decisions, several criteria are important in establishing whether a subsidy could result in significant market distortions: ", "the subsidy constitutes a substantial share of farmer returns or covers a substantial share of production costs; the subsidized commodity is important to world markets because it forms a large share of either world production or world trade; and a causal relationship exists between the subsidy and adverse effects in the relevant market.

To qualify for exemption in the green box, a program must meet two general criteria, as well as a set of policy-specific criteria relative to the different types of agriculture-related programs. The two general criteria are:", "1. It must be a publicly funded government program (defined to include either outlays or forgone revenue) that does not involve transfers from consumers. 2. It must not have the effect of providing price support to producers.", "In addition, every green-box-qualifying program must comply with at least one of the following criteria and conditions specific to the program itself. ", "A \"general service\" benefitting the agricultural or rural community in general cannot involve direct payments to producers or processors. Such programs can include research; pest and disease control; training, extension, or advisory services; inspection services, including for health, safety, grading, or standardization; marketing and promotion services, including information advice and promotion (but not spending for unspecified purposes that sellers could use to provide price discounts or other economic benefits to purchasers); and generally available infrastructure like utility, transportation, or port facilities, water supply facilities, or other capital works construction. Public acquisition (at current market prices) and stockholding of products for food security must be integral to a nationally legislated food security program and be financially transparent. Domestic food aid is to be based upon clearly defined eligibility and nutritional criteria, be financially transparent, and involve government food purchases at current market prices. \"Decoupled\" income support is to use clearly defined eligibility criteria in a specified, fixed base period; not be related in any way after the base period to (a) domestic or world prices, (b) type or volume of crop or livestock production, or (c) factors of production; and, further, not be contingent on any production in exchange for payments. Government financial participation in an income insurance or income safety net program should define eligibility as agricultural income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income (or equivalent in net income terms) in the preceding three-year period (or preceding five-year period, excluding the highest and lowest years\u2014the so-called Olympic average), with such payment compensating for less than 70% of the income loss in year of eligibility, and payments based solely on income, not production, price, or inputs. Total annual payments under this and natural disaster relief (see next paragraph) cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Payments (whether direct or through government crop insurance) for natural disaster relief are to use eligibility based on formal government recognition of the disaster. Payments are to be determined by a production loss exceeding 30% of production in the preceding three-year (or five-year Olympic average) period, apply only to losses of income, livestock, land, or other production factors, and cannot exceed the total replacement cost or require types/quantities of future production. Total annual payments under this and the income insurance or safety net measure cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Structural adjustment through producer retirement shall tie eligibility to clearly defined criteria in programs to facilitate producers' \"total and permanent\" retirement from agricultural production or their movement into nonagricultural activities. Structural adjustment through resource retirement shall be determined through clearly defined programs designed to remove land, livestock, or other resources from marketable production, with payments (a) conditioned on land being retired for at least three years and on livestock being permanently disposed; (b) not contingent upon any alternative specified use of such resources involving marketing agricultural production; and (c) not related to production type/quantity, or to prices of products using remaining productive resources. Structural adjustment provided through investment aids must be determined by clearly defined criteria for programs assisting financial or physical restructuring of a producer's operations in response to objectively demonstrated structural disadvantages (and may also be based on a clearly defined program for \"re-privatization\" of agricultural land). The amount of payments (a) cannot be tied to type/volume of production, or to prices, in any year after the base period; (b) shall be provided only for a time period needed for realization of the investment in respect of which they are provided; (c) cannot be contingent on the required production of designated products (except to require participants not to produce a designated product); and (d) must be limited to the amount required to compensate for the structural disadvantage. Environmental program payments must have eligibility determined as part of a clearly defined government environmental or conservation program, and must be dependent upon meeting specific program conditions, including conditions related to production methods or inputs. Payments must be limited to the extra costs (or loss of income) involved with program compliance. Regional assistance program payments shall be limited only to producers in a clearly designated, contiguous geographic region with definable economic and administrative identity, considered to be disadvantaged based on objective, clearly defined criteria in the law or regulation, which indicate that the region's difficulties are more than temporary. Such payments in any year (a) shall not be related to or based on type/volume of production in any year after the base period (other than to reduce production) or to prices after the base period; (b) where related to production factors, must be made at a degressive rate above a threshold level of the factor concerned; and (c) must be limited to the extra costs or income loss involved in agriculture in the prescribed area.

For example, the value of the 2012 U.S. corn crop was $74.3 billion, and 5% of that was $3.8 billion. This compares with corn-specific AMS outlays of $2.7 billion. As a result, the entire $2.7 billion was exempted from inclusion under the AMS limit for the marketing year 2012. In contrast, U.S. sugar support of $1.454 billion for 2012 easily exceeded its 5% product-specific de minimis of $184.8 million (based on total sugar value of $3.7 billion) and, therefore, was counted against the AMS limit. Non-product-specific domestic support, whereby it does not exceed 5% of the \"value of the Member's total agricultural production.\" All non-product-specific support is tallied to determine whether the 5% level is exceeded. For example, the value of 2012 U.S. agricultural production was notified to the WTO as $396.6 billion. The 5% threshold for non-product-specific support was calculated as $19.8 billion.
