The \"Promote Economic Recovery\" objective aims to reverse Haiti's trend of economic regress by promoting macro-economic stability; providing reliable electricity; reviving the private sector; and providing jobs and access to micro-finance. Economic Recovery programs also aim to help farmers meet their needs; improve roads and transport; and rehabilitate and protect the environment. \"Improve Access to Basic Services\" is the fourth axis. Because basic services are so scarce in Haiti, the priorities in this category are many. They range from immediate goals such as providing emergency humanitarian aid to more long-term goals.

Three factors contributing to income inequality are: a large disparity in the capacity to generate income, with the rural areas having the least capacity; access to education, which only half the population has; and whether or not a household receives remittances from abroad.

Access to education, it says, can reduce poverty relatively quickly by increasing individual productivity and helping to shift poor people from low-paying agricultural employment to better paying jobs in the industrial and service sectors. In the long-term, the Bank says, education can increase poor children's chances of breaking out of the cycle of poverty by gaining access to formal employment.
