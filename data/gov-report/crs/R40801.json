In general, the offices are responsible for formulating and implementing policy initiatives and managing Treasury's operations, while the bureaus perform specific tasks assigned to Treasury, mainly through statutory mandates. In the past decade or so, the bureaus have accounted for over 95% of the agency's funding and work force.", "With one exception, the bureaus can be divided into those engaged in financial management and regulation and those engaged in law enforcement. In recent decades, the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Financial Management Service (FMS), Bureau of the Public Debt, Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI), and Office of Thrift Supervision have taken on responsibilities related to the management of the federal government's finances or the supervision and regulation of the U.S. financial system. In contrast, law enforcement arguably has been the primary focus of the responsibilities handled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; U.S. Secret Service; Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; U.S. Customs Service; Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. With the advent of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, Treasury's direct involvement in law enforcement has shrunk considerably.

Funds from this account allow Treasury to recommend and implement domestic and international economic and tax policy, formulate fiscal policy, track and disrupt efforts to channel money to domestic and foreign terrorist groups, protect the U.S. and world financial systems from financial crimes such as money laundering, manage the public debt and government finances, oversee international development policy, and finance its operations, among other things.", "Obama Administration's FY2010 Budget Request: The Obama Administration asked for $302 million in appropriated funds for DO in FY2010, or $23 million more than the amount enacted for FY2009. According to Treasury budget documents, about $20 million of the proposed increase in budget authority would be used to bolster Treasury's expertise and manpower in housing finance, capital markets, tax administration, and information technology management, and to administer the tax credit exchange program authorized by the ARRA. Under the Administration's request, funding for TFI would rise from $62 million in FY2009 to $67 million in FY2010. A proposed increase of $11.5 million in appropriations for financial policies and programs would account for nearly half of the proposed increase in DO direct appropriations for FY2010. Funding for the Office of Financial Stability (OFS) comes through that account. OFS is responsible for implementing and managing the programs aimed at stabilizing financial markets and restoring the flow of credit to consumers and companies that Treasury established in the wake of the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 , EESA)", "Senate Action on the Request: DO would receive $306 million in direct appropriations under a bill ( S. 1432 ) approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 9, 2009. In its report on the bill ( S.Rept. 111-43 ), the Committee noted that the entire amount of its recommended $3.3 million increase over the Administration's DO budget request should be used to finance two studies by the National Academy of Sciences (one of which would involve an assessment of the federal tax provisions that have the biggest impact on current carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions) and the financial literacy programs administered by Treasury's Office of Financial Education. The Committee also endorsed the proposed increases in funding for several DO programs from FY2009.", "In its report, the Committee also expressed its concerns about several programs managed by Treasury offices that receive most of their funding through the DO appropriation. Specifically, it directed Treasury to find a better way to explain to Congress and the general public how the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) is supposed to operate, and to require more detailed reporting by financial firms receiving TARP funds. The Committee also asked Treasury to \"expand its efforts to address the foreclosure crisis beyond the scope of voluntary programs,\" and to provide the Committee with a monthly report on the number and value of foreclosures prevented through Treasury programs to date. Another concern addressed in the report was TFI's management of existing economic and trade sanctions. The Committee urged Treasury to \"fully implement all sanctions and divestment measures, particularly those applicable to North Korea, Burma, Iran, Sudan and Zimbabwe.\"", "House Action on the Request: A bill ( H.R. 3170 ) passed by the House on July 16 would provide $303 million in direct appropriations for DO, or $1 million more than the budget request. Nearly half of that additional amount would be used to expand current efforts by the Department's Office of Financial Education to improve the financial literacy of elementary school and high school students. Another $1.5 million would be used to pay for a so-called carbon audit of the federal tax code that was authorized by the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 ).", "The report ( H.Rept. 111-202 ) on H.R. 3170 issued by the House Appropriations Committee expressed some concern about the manner in which the Obama Administration is reviewing the operating budget for the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP). The office was established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA). SIGTARP's main purpose is to oversee Treasury's management of the TARP and the trillions of dollars that could be spent under it to stabilize and revive domestic financial markets. Under the act, SIGTARP's budget authority was set initially at $50 million. In its review of the budget, the Administration is trying to determine whether additional funds will be needed in the next year or two. The Committee wants the Administration to submit a FY2010 budget amendment \"well before the conclusion of the current fiscal year,\" if it should decide more funding is needed.", "Exercising its powers of oversight, the Committee also directed the Department to submit quarterly reports for the next year, beginning September 1, 2009, on its efforts to implement recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), SIGTARP, and the Congressional Oversight Panel for TARP on how to use TARP funds to achieve their intended benefits at the lowest possible cost. Treasury is also supposed to report to the Committee no later than September 1 on the Department's plans for using those funds beyond the end of 2009, whether Treasury has the staff and funds needed to carry out any such plans, and how those plans would promote the main goals of federal financial stabilization programs.", "Final Action: Under the conference agreement for the FY2010 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill ( H.R. 3288 ) approved by the House and Senate, DO is receiving $305 million in direct appropriations in FY2010. Of this amount, $65 million is designated for terrorism and financial intelligence, $49 million for financial policies and programs, and $47 million for economic policies and programs. Like the House-passed version of H.R. 3170 , the agreement directed Treasury's Office of Financial Education to spend $1 million more than the amount requested by the administration on continuing efforts to improve financial literacy. The agreement also set aside $1.5 million within the budget for economic policies and programs for a \"comprehensive\" carbon audit of the Internal Revenue Code. House and Senate conferees agreed that Treasury should \"fully implement\" existing trade and financial sanctions against North Korea, Burma, Zimbabwe, Iran, and Sudan and notify the Appropriations Committees if it lacks the resources to do so in FY2010. In addition, they endorsed the detailed reporting requirements for Treasury's management of TARP spelled out in H.Rept. 111-202 and directed Treasury to find a better way to communicate with Congress and other stakeholders about its efforts to stabilize financial markets and promote economic growth, require entities receiving TARP funds to provide more detailed reports on their use of the funds, and provide Congress with monthly reports on the number and value of foreclosures prevented so far through Treasury programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Department-Wide Systems and Other Capital Investment Programs (DSCIP)", "paragraphs": ["Purpose: This account provides funding mainly for programs to modernize Treasury's business processes through investments in information technology that affect more than one Treasury bureau or its connections to other federal agencies.", "Administration's FY2010 Budget Request: The Obama Administration requested $9.5 million in appropriated funds for DSCIP, or $17.4 million less than the amount enacted for FY2009.

However, there are numerous restrictions and licensing requirements for these exports. For instance, exporters are denied access to U.S. private commercial financing or credit, and all transactions must be paid for in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. The Bush Administration tightened sanctions on Cuba in February 2005 by further restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid for their product. OFAC amended the CACR to clarify that the term \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the shipment of the goods. This differs from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods, a practice that had been utilized by many U.S. agricultural exporters to Cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001. U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress strongly objected to this \"clarification\" on the grounds that the action constituted a new sanction that violated the intent of TSRA, and could jeopardize millions of dollars in U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. Then OFAC Director Robert Werner maintained that the clarification \"conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade.\"", "Since 2002, the United States has been Cuba's largest supplier of food and agricultural products, and Cuba has purchased almost $2.7 billion in agricultural products from the United States. Overall U.S exports to Cuba rose from about $7 million in 2001 to $404 million in 2004. U.S. exports to Cuba declined in 2005 and 2006 to $369 million and $340 million, respectively, but increased to $447 million in 2007. In 2008, U.S. exports to Cuba rose to $712 million, far higher than in previous years, in part because of the rise in food prices and because of Cuba's increased food needs in the aftermath of several hurricanes and tropical storms that severely damaged Cuba's agricultural sector. In the first 10 months of 2009, U.S. exports to Cuba were valued at $449 million, 25% lower than the same time period in 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Action", "paragraphs": ["From 2000-2007, either one or both houses of Congress included provisions in the annual Treasury Department appropriations bill that would have eased U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba (especially on travel and on U.S. agricultural exports), but none of these provisions were enacted. The Bush Administration regularly threatened to veto legislation if it included any provision weakening sanctions on Cuba. In 2008, both House and Senate Appropriations Committee versions of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill for FY2009, H.R. 7323 and S. 3260 , contained various provisions easing restrictions on travel and on payment terms related to the payment of cash in advance for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba.

Unlike the Bush Administration, the Obama Administration did not threaten to veto the measure if it included provisions easing Cuba sanctions. The omnibus appropriations measure ultimately included three Cuba provisions that eased restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing and sale of U.S. agricultural and medical exports to Cuba, and were intended to ease payment provisions for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The Treasury Department's interpretation of the latter provision, however, mitigated its practical effect. ", "As set forth in the omnibus measure, section 622 of Division D prohibits funds in the act from being used to administer, implement, or enforce an amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations issued on February 25, 2005, requiring that U.S. agricultural exporters using the \"cash in advance\" payment mechanism for selling their goods to Cuba must be paid in cash for their goods before the goods leave U.S. ports. As noted above, TSRA requires either the \"payment of cash in advance\" for such exports (or financing by third country financial institutions), but does not provide a definition of cash in advance. Prior to the February 2005 amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations, U.S. exporters could be paid for the goods before they were unloaded in Cuba. OFAC guidance on the implementation of this provision states that TSRA's statutory provisions remain in place that agricultural exports to Cuba be either paid for by \"cash in advance\" or financed using a third-country bank. During Senate consideration of the omnibus measure, Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner provided additional guidance on the implementation of this provision in a letter published in the Congressional Record that states that \"exporters will still be required to receive payment in advance of shipment.\" This appeared to continue the Bush Administration policy imposed in February 2005. Given the Secretary's interpretation, the omnibus provision had little, if any, practical effect. While the Secretary's response ameliorated the concerns that several Senators had regarding the provision, it also triggered concerns by other Senators who maintained that the Secretary's action ignored the legislative intent of the Cuba provision to ease restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba.", "As a result of the Treasury Department's action, both the House-passed and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported versions of the FY2010 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, H.R. 3170 and S. 1432 , had an identical provision (section 618 in the House bill and section 617 in the Senate bill) stating that during FY2010, the term \"payment of cash in advance\" as used in TSRA \"shall be interpreted as payment before the transfer of title to, and control of, the exported items to the Cuban purchaser.\" In its report to the bill ( S.Rept. 111-43 ), the Senate Appropriations Committee maintained that it was aware that the Treasury Department was continuing to require the sellers of agricultural goods to Cuba to receive cash payments in advance of shipping rather than in advance of delivering the goods, and asserted that the policy impedes U.S. sales since it increases the cost of doing business. In the report, the committee urged the Treasury Department to use its rulemaking authority to permanently amend the Cuban Assets Control Regulations and remove impediments to U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba.", "The provision defining the term \"payment of cash in advance\" for FY2010 was ultimately included as Section 619 in the enacted version of the FY2010 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, which Congress incorporated as Division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( H.R. 3288 / P.L. 111-117 ). Supporters of the provision maintain that it restores congressional intent on the matter, and will make it easier for U.S. agricultural producers to export to Cuba, while opponents maintain the provision constitutes a foreign policy change included in a must-pass spending bill without appropriate congressional consideration."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
