CPB's appropriation is allocated through a distribution formula established in its authorizing legislation and has historically received two-year advanced appropriations. Congressional policymakers are increasingly interested in the federal role in supporting CPB due to concerns over the federal debt, the role of the federal government funding for public radio and television, and whether public broadcasting provides a balanced and nuanced approach to covering news of national interest.", "It is also important to note that many congressional policymakers defend the federal role of funding public broadcasting. They contend that it provides news and information to large segments of the population that seek to understand complex policy issues in depth, and in particular for children's television broadcasting, has a significant and positive impact on early learning and education for children.", "On June 20, 2012, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting released a report, Alternative Sources of Funding for Public Broadcasting Stations. The report was undertaken in response to the conference report accompanying the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Appropriations Act of 2012 (incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012, H.R. 2055, P.L. 112-74). The CPB engaged the consulting firm of Booz & Company to explore possible alternatives to the federal appropriation to CPB. Among its findings, the report stated that ending federal funding for public broadcasting would severely diminish, if not destroy, public broadcasting service in the United States.", "The two-year advanced appropriations process for CPB means that in any given year congressional policymakers are considering what the CPB appropriations will be two years from that time. So as Congress continues to consider funding for the FY2017 fiscal year, that deliberation would include CPB funding for FY2019. On June 9, 2016, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted 29-1 to approve S.Rept. 114-274, the FY2017 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill. Included in this report is $445 million for CPB in FY2019. On May 5, 2017, President Trump signed P.L. 115-31, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, which maintained FY2017 funding for CPB through the rest of the fiscal year. On May 23, 2017, the Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request.

CPB is the largest single source of funding for public television and radio programming.", "Most CPB-funded television programs are distributed through the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), created in 1969 by CPB. CPB-funded radio programs are distributed primarily through National Public Radio (NPR), created in 1970 by CPB. Both PBS and NPR are private, not-for-profit corporations.", "The number of radio and television public broadcasting stations supported by CPB increased from 270 in 1969 to 1,495 in 2016, of which 364 are television stations. Public broadcasting stations are run by universities, nonprofit community associations, state government agencies, and local school boards, all of which are licensed by the FCC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corporation for Public Broadcasting", "paragraphs": ["CPB is a nonprofit private corporation and is guided by a nine-member board of directors. These directors are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The directors serve for staggered six-year terms.

CPB's principal function is to receive and distribute the federal appropriation in accordance with the Public Broadcasting Act, supporting qualified public radio and television stations and funding national content. Seventy percent of the federal appropriation is used to provide Community Service Grants (or CSGs) to stations that meet specified eligibility criteria. CPB exercises minimum control of program content and other activities of local stations, and is prohibited from owning or operating any of the primary facilities used in broadcasting. In addition, it may not produce, disseminate, or schedule programs. The current president and CEO of CPB is Patricia de Stacy Harrison, appointed by the board of directors in June 2005.", "Approximately 15% of public television and 10% of radio broadcasting funding comes from the federal appropriations that CPB distributes. However, among individual public broadcasting stations, the amount of federal dollars that contributes to a station's annual budget depends on the funds it receives from nonfederal sources; the number and extent of broadcast transmitters required to service its coverage area; the extent to which a station is serving rural areas and minority audiences; and whether or not it is a television or radio station.", "While federal funding for CPB primarily comes from the Departments of Labor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations bill as a separate entry under the \"Related Agencies\" section of that bill, it may receive other sources of funding from the federal government. For example, on September 8, 2015, CPB and PBS received a five-year Ready to Learn (RTL) grant from the Department of Education's Office of Innovation and Improvement, which supports the development of educational television and digital media targeted at preschool and early elementary school children. According to the CPB, for the last year data are available, the RTL grant was funded for FY2016 at $25.741 million.

The array of commercial all-news radio and radio talk shows, many of which are also streamed on the Internet, provides various sources of news and opinion. Supporters of public broadcasting argue that public radio and television broadcasters, free of commercial interruption, provide perhaps the last bastion of balanced and objective information, news, children's education, and entertainment in an era of a changing media landscape. Still others contend that public broadcasting has lost much of its early impact since the media choices have grown so much over the last several decades and that the federal role in public broadcasting should be reevaluated as well. ", "Supporters of public broadcasting contend that public radio and public television provide education and news to many underserved parts of the American population. Public broadcasters may provide this service to an underserved and less commercially attractive population that commercial broadcasters do not address. For example, PBS broadcasting for children includes lessons in reading, counting, and spelling, subjects not normally found on commercial broadcasts. According to NPR Inc., approximately 90% of public radio stations provide local newscasts, airing both newscast and non-newscast content (primarily in weekday drive times and especially during morning drive time). About half of all public radio stations carry local news during the weekends, says NPR, and 74% of stations are producing and inserting stories into their programming. ", "On June 20, 2012, the CPB released a report, Alternative Sources of Funding for Public Broadcasting Stations. The report was undertaken in response to language in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2012 directing the CPB to provide a report to congressional appropriations committees on alternative sources of federal funding for public broadcasting stations. ( H.R. 2055 , P.L. 112-74 ). The report, undertaken by the consulting firm of Booz & Company, provides several alternative or new funding options for public broadcasting stations, with possible benefits as well as liabilities for each option. Five options considered by Booz & Company are television advertising, radio advertising, retransmission consent fees, paid digital subscriptions, and digital game publishing. In addition, 14 current sources of revenue streams already employed by public broadcasting, ranging from merchandise licensing to mobile device applications, were also analyzed as options to replace federal funding for public broadcasting. Booz & Company found \"there is simply no substitute for the federal investment\" in public broadcasting and that \"Ending federal funding for public broadcasting would severely diminish, if not destroy, public broadcasting service in the United States.\" The report concludes that if the existing public broadcasting structure were commercialized, the new revenue streams would not offset the loss of federal funding, and that many public broadcasters would have to deviate from their statutory service mission or compete for advertising with established commercial broadcasters in a difficult economic environment. ", "Still, some critics contend that the report substantiates criticisms of the public broadcasting model: required to compete with commercial television and radio broadcasters that also provide news and entertainment, many public broadcasters could not adapt to a changing media world that provides multiple sources of information and entertainment. For these critics, if many public broadcasters struggle to operate with budget deficits even with federal funding available, what does that say about the need and viability of these stations in a multimedia world, or the ability of their audiences to sustain this business model going forward? ", "Several important issues are facing congressional policymakers as they address federal appropriations for all forms of public broadcasting. On the most fundamental level, many question the 1967 law that created the national public broadcasting system and whether the federal government should be in the \"business\" of providing general appropriations to CPB every year since 1969. They ask: is this still a relevant and appropriate role of the federal government? On a second level, some may contend that in an era of spiraling federal deficits, in which many (if not all) federal expenditures are being reexamined, appropriations for CPB should be reduced if not eliminated. Underlying this position are concerns that the federal role, once so clear in 1967, has been eclipsed in a multimedia Internet age; concerns that the size and scope of the federal government budget deficit requires significant cutbacks in many areas; and allegations that public broadcasting is not objective, balanced, or free of an ideological slant.", "These questions revolve around whether federal funding for public broadcasting should be continued at its current level; whether the funding should be modified or reduced; whether the arrangement between the federal funding process and public broadcasting should be changed; or whether federal funding for public broadcasting should be eliminated. ", "Public broadcasting retains its strong supporters. Most federal appropriations go through CPB to directly support member stations of NPR, PBS, and other independent affiliates. Since, according to NPR, federal funding to supplement administrative functions amounts to less than 2% of its annual budget, some may question whether such a small amount is worthy of congressional action to eliminate federal funding. As indicated in Table 1 , CPB has consistently received increasing federal appropriations since 1969. Some would contend that this demonstrates a general consensus among congressional policymakers that there is a federal role in public broadcasting. In addition, public support of public radio and television broadcasting generally has been consistent as well. Supporters of a public broadcasting network system contend that local programming content is not determined by NPR Inc., or PBS, and that most content is local, serving community needs. Balanced against concerns about the role of the federal government in public broadcasting, as well as strong pressure to reduce federal spending, these issues will likely continue to be of interest to federal policymakers."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
