{"id": "R45518", "title": "Banking Policy Issues in the 116th Congress", "released_date": "2019-02-21T00:00:00", "summary": ["Regulation of the banking industry has undergone substantial changes over the past decade. In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, many new bank regulations were implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) or under the existing authorities of bank regulators to address apparent weaknesses in the regulatory regime. While some observers view those changes as necessary and effective, others argued that certain regulations were unjustifiably burdensome. To address those concerns, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-174) relaxed certain regulations. Opponents of that legislation argue it unnecessarily pared back important safeguards, but proponents of deregulation argue additional pare backs are needed. Meanwhile, a variety of economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, the 116th Congress faces many issues related to banking, including the following:", "Safety and Soundness. Banks are subject to regulations designed to reduce the likelihood of bank failures. Examples include requirements to hold a certain amount of capital (which enables a bank to absorb losses without failing) and the so-called Volcker Rule (a ban on banks' proprietary trading). In addition, anti-money laundering requirements aim to reduce the likelihood banks will execute transactions involving criminal proceeds. Banks are also required to take steps to avoid becoming victims of cyberattacks. The extent to which these regulations (i) are effective, and (ii) appropriately balance benefits and costs is a matter of debate.", "Consumer Protection, Fair Lending, and Access to Banking. Certain laws are designed to protect consumers and ensure that lenders use fair lending practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authorities to regulate for consumer protection. No consensus exists on whether current regulations strike an appropriate balance between protecting consumers while ensuring access to credit and justifiable compliance costs. In addition, whether Community Reinvestment Act regulations as currently implemented effectively and efficiently encourage banks to provide services in their areas of operation is an open question.", "Large Banks and \"Too Big To Fail.\" Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with very large and complex financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for certain large banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one fails. In addition, bank regulators imposed additional capital requirements on certain large, complex banks. Subsequently, some argued that certain of these additional regulations were too broadly applied and overly stringent. In response, Congress reduced the applicability of the Dodd-Frank measures and regulators have proposed changes to the capital rules. Whether relaxing these rules will provide needed relief to these banks or unnecessarily pare back important safeguards is a debated issue.", "Community Banks. The number of small or \"community\" banks has declined substantially in recent decades. No consensus exists on the degree to which regulatory burden, market forces, and the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are causing the decline.", "What Companies Should Be Eligible for Bank Charters. To operate legally as a bank, an institution must hold a charter granted by a state or federal government. Traditionally, these are held by companies generally focused on and led by people with experience in finance. However, recently companies with a focus on technology are interested in having legal status as a bank, either through a charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state-level industrial loan company charter. Policymakers disagree over whether allowing these companies to operate as banks would create appropriately regulated providers of financial services or inappropriately extend government-backed bank safety nets and disadvantage existing banks.", "Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces also pose issues for the banking industry. Some observers argue that increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated \"shadow banking\" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. If interest rates rise, it could create opportunities and risks. Such trends could have implications for how the financial system performs and influence debates over appropriate banking regulations."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Banks play a central role in the financial system by connecting borrowers to savers and allocating available funds across the economy. As a result, banking is vital to the U.S. economy's health and growth. Nevertheless, banking is an inherently risky activity involving extending credit and undertaking liabilities. Therefore, banking can generate tremendous societal and economic benefits, but banking panics and failures can create devastating losses. Over time, a regulatory system designed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks has developed, and both banks and regulatio n have coevolved as market conditions have changed and different risks have emerged. For these reasons, Congress often considers policies related to the banking industry.", "The last decade has been a transformative period for banking. The 2007-2009 financial crisis threatened the total collapse of the financial system and the real economy. Many assert only huge and unprecedented government interventions staved off this collapse. Others argue that government interventions were unnecessary or potentially exacerbated the crisis. In addition, many argue the crisis revealed that the financial system was excessively risky and the regulatory regime governing the financial system had serious weaknesses. ", "Policymakers responded to the perceived weaknesses in the pre-crisis financial regulatory regime by implementing numerous changes to financial regulation, including to bank regulation. Most notably, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203 ) in 2010 with the intention of strengthening regulation and addressing risks. In addition, U.S. bank regulators have implemented changes under their existing authorities, many of which generally adhere to the Basel III Accords\u2014an international framework for bank regulation agreed to by U.S. and international bank regulators\u2014that called for making certain bank regulations more stringent.", "In the ensuing years, some observers raised concerns that the potential benefits of those regulatory changes (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, potentially higher economic growth over the long term) were outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., compliance costs incurred by banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, potentially slower economic growth). In response to these concerns, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act; P.L. 115-174 ). Among other things, the law modified certain (1) regulations facing small banks; (2) regulations facing banks large enough to be subjected to Dodd-Frank enhanced regulation but still below the size thresholds exceeded by the very largest banks; and (3) mortgage regulations facing lenders including banks.", "In addition, federal banking regulatory agencies\u2014the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\u2014have proposed further changes in regulation. Implementing the regulatory changes prescribed in the aftermath of the crisis and made pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act occurred over the course of years. In recent years\u2014a period in which the leadership of the regulators has transferred from Obama Administration to Trump Administration appointees\u2014the banking regulators have expressed the belief that, after having viewed the effects of the regulations, they now have the necessary information to determine which regulations may be ineffective or inefficient as currently implemented. Recently, these regulators have made of number of proposals with the aim of reducing regulatory burden. A key issue surrounding regulatory relief made pursuant to the EGRRCP Act and regulator-initiated changes is whether regulatory burden can be reduced without undermining the goals and effectiveness of the regulations.", "Meanwhile, market trends and economic conditions continue to affect the banking industry coincident with the implementation of new regulation. Some of the more notable conditions include the development of new technologies used in financial services (known as \"fintech\") and a rising interest rate environment following an extraordinarily long period of very low rates.", "This report provides a broad overview of selected banking-related issues, including issues related to \"safety and soundness\" regulation, consumer protection, community banks, large banks, what type of companies should be able to establish banks, and recent market and economic trends.

The practice is usually profitable, but does expose banks to risks that can potentially lead to failure. ", "Failures can be reduced if (1) banks are better able to absorb losses or (2) they are less likely to experience unsustainably large losses. One tool regulators use to increase a bank's ability to absorb losses is to require banks to hold a minimum level of capital. Another tool regulators use to reduce the likelihood and size of potential losses is to prohibit banks from engaging in activities that could create excessive risks. For example, the Volcker Rule prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading \u2014the buying and selling of securities that the bank itself owns with the aim of profiting from price changes.", "The EGRRCP Act mandated certain changes to these prudential regulations, and regulators have proposed changes under existing authorities. Regulators are to promulgate these changes through the rulemaking process in the coming months and years. In addition, whether policymakers have calibrated these regulations such that their benefits and costs are appropriately balanced is likely to be an area of ongoing debate. For these reasons, prudential regulation issues will likely continue to draw congressional attention."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Capital Requirements", "paragraphs": ["A bank's balance sheet is composed of assets, liabilities, and capital. Assets are largely the value of loans owed to the bank and securities owned by the bank. To make loans and buy securities, a bank secures funding by either issuing liabilities or raising capital. A bank's liabilities are largely the value of deposits and borrowings the bank owes savers and creditors. Capital is raised through various methods, including issuing equity to shareholders or special types of bonds that can be converted into equity. ", "Banking is an inherently risky activity, because banks may suffer losses on assets but face rigid obligations on the liabilities owed to depositors and creditors. In contrast to liabilities, capital generally does not obligate the bank to repay or distribute a specified amount of money at a specified time. This characteristic means that, in the event a bank suffers losses, capital gives the bank the ability to absorb some amount of losses while meeting its obligations. Thus, banks can avoid failures if they hold sufficient capital. ", "Banks are required to satisfy several requirements to ensure they hold enough capital. In the United States, these requirements are generally aligned with the Basel III standards developed as part of a nonbinding agreement between international bank regulators. In general, these are expressed as minimum ratios between certain balance sheet items that banks must maintain. A detailed examination of how these ratios are calculated and what levels must be met is beyond the scope of this report. This examination of policy issues only requires noting that capital ratios fall into one of two main types\u2014a leverage ratio or a risk-weighted ratio. ", "A leverage ratio treats all assets the same, requiring banks to hold the same amount of capital against assets regardless of how risky each asset is. A risk-weighted ratio assigns a risk weight\u2014a percentage based on the riskiness of the asset that the asset value is multiplied by\u2014to account for the fact that some assets are more likely to lose value than others. Riskier assets receive a higher risk weight, which requires banks to hold more capital to meet the ratio requirement.", "Whether the benefits of capital requirements (e.g., increased bank and financial system stability) are generally outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., reduced credit availability) is an issue subject to debate. Capital is typically a more expensive source of funding for banks than liabilities. Thus, requiring banks to hold higher levels of capital may make funding more expensive, and so banks may choose to reduce the amount of credit available. Some studies indicate this could slow economic growth. However, no economic consensus exists on this issue, because a more stable banking system with fewer crises and failures may lead to higher long-run economic growth. In addition, estimating the value of regulatory costs and benefits is subject to considerable uncertainty, due to difficulties and assumptions involved in complex economic modeling and estimation.", "Lack of consensus also surrounds questions over whether or under what circumstances risk-weighted ratios are necessary, effective, and efficient. Proponents of risk-based measures assert that it is important to use both risk-weighted and leverage ratios because each addresses weaknesses of the other. For example, riskier assets generally offer a greater rate of return to compensate the investor for bearing more risk. Without risk weighting, banks would have an incentive to hold riskier assets because the same amount of capital must be held against risky and safe assets.", "However, the use of risk-weighted ratios could be problematic for a number of reasons. Risk weights assigned to particular classes of assets could potentially be an inaccurate estimation of some assets' true risk, which could incent banks to misallocate available resources across asset classes. For example, banks held a high level of seemingly low-risk, mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) before the crisis, in part because those assets offered a higher rate of return than other assets with the same risk weight. MBSs then suffered unexpectedly large losses during the crisis. ", "Another criticism is that the risk-weighted requirements involve \"needless complexity\" and their use is an example of regulatory micromanagement. The complexity could benefit the largest banks that have the resources to absorb the added regulatory cost compared with small banks that could find compliance costs more burdensome. (Small or \"community\" bank compliance issues will be covered in more detail in the \" Regulatory Burden on Community Banks \" section later in the report.)", "Section 201 of the EGRRCP Act is aimed at addressing concerns over the complexity of risk-weighted ratios and the costs they impose on community banks. This provision created an option for banks with less than $10 billion in assets to meet a higher leverage ratio\u2014the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR)\u2014in order to be exempt from having to meet the risk-based ratios described above. Bank regulators have issued a proposal to implement this provision wherein banks (1) below the threshold that (2) meet at least a 9% leverage ratio measure of equity and certain retained earnings to assets and (3) had limited off-balance sheet exposures and limited securities trading activity (among other requirements) would qualify for the exemption. The FDIC estimates that more than 80% of community banks will be eligible for the CBLR. ", "However, this new optional exemption does not entirely settle the issue. One bank industry group has argued that 9% is set higher than is necessary, excluding deserving banks from the exemption. In addition, bills in the 115 th Congress, notably H.R. 10 , proposed a high-leverage-ratio option be available to banks regardless of size that would exempt qualifying banks from a wider range of prudential regulations. There are also specific policy issues relating to capital requirements for large banks, which are discussed in the \" Regulator Proposals Related to Large Bank Capital Requirements \" section below. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Volcker Rule", "paragraphs": ["Section 619 of Dodd-Frank\u2014often referred to as the Volcker Rule\u2014generally prohibits depository banks from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund. Proprietary trading refers to owning and trading securities for a bank's own portfolio with the aim of profiting from price changes. Put simply, if a bank is engaged in proprietary trading, it is itself an investor in stocks, bonds, and derivatives, which is commonly characterized as \"playing the market\" or \"speculating.\" The rule includes exceptions for when bank trading is deemed appropriate\u2014such as (1) when a bank is hedging against risks the bank has assumed as a part of its traditional business and (2) market-making (i.e., buying available securities with the intention of quickly selling them to meet market demand).", "Proprietary trading is an inherently risky activity, and banks have faced varying degrees of restrictions over engaging in this activity for a number of decades. Sections 16, 20, 21, and 32 of the Banking Act of 1933 (P.L. 73-66)\u2014commonly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act\u2014generally prohibited certain deposit-taking banks from engaging in certain securities markets activities. Over time, regulator interpretation of Glass-Steagall and legislative changes expanded permissible activities for certain banks, allowing them to make certain securities investments and authorizing bank-holding companies to own depositories and securities firms within the same organization. The financial crisis increased debate over whether banks were engaging in unnecessarily risky activities. Ultimately, certain provisions in Dodd-Frank placed restrictions on permissible activities to reduce banks' riskiness, and the Volcker Rule was designed to prohibit proprietary trading by depository banking organizations.", "One of the Volcker Rule's proponents' main rationales for the separation of deposit-taking and certain securities investments is that when banks analyze and assume risks, they may be subject to moral hazard \u2014the willingness to take on excessive risk due to some outside protection from losses. Deposits are an important source of bank funding and insured (up to a limit on each account) by the government. This arguably reduces depositors' incentive to monitor their banks' riskiness. Thus, a bank could potentially take on excessive risk without concern about losing this funding because, in the event of large losses that lead to failure, at least part of the losses will be borne by the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (which is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and so ultimately the taxpayer). Thus, supporters of the Volcker Rule have characterized it as preventing banks from \"gambling\" in securities markets with taxpayer-backed deposits.", "However, critics of the Volcker Rule doubt its necessity and efficiency. In regard to necessity, they assert that proprietary trading at commercial banks did not play a substantive role in the financial crisis. They note the rule would not have prevented a number of the major events that played a direct role in the crisis\u2014including failures or bailouts of large investment banks and insurers and losses on loans held by commercial banks. On this point, they also argue that proprietary trading risks are no greater than those posed by \"traditional\" banking activities, such as mortgage lending, and allowing banks to take on risks in different markets might diversify their risk profiles, making them less likely to fail.", "Debates relating to the efficiency of the Volcker Rule involve its complexity, compliance burden, and potential to lead banks to reduce their engagement in beneficial market activities. Recall that the Volcker Rule is not a ban on all trading, as banks are still allowed to trade to hedge risks or make markets. This poses practical supervisory problems. For example, how can regulators determine whether a broker-dealer is holding a security for market-making, as a hedge against another risk, or as a speculative investment? Differentiating among these motives creates the aforementioned complexity and compliance costs that could affect banks' trading behavior, and so could reduce financial market efficiency.", "Another criticism of the Volcker Rule in its original form was that it unnecessarily subjected all banks to the rule and their associated compliance costs. Critics of this aspect asserted that the vast majority of community banks are not involved in complex trading activity, but nevertheless must incur costs in evaluating the rule to ensure they are in compliance. ", "Both Congress and regulators have recently taken actions in response to concerns over the complexity of the Volcker Rule and its compliance burden for small banks. Section 203 of the EGRRCP Act exempted banks with less than $10 billion in assets that fell below certain trading activity limits from the rule. Independent of that mandate, the agencies that implemented and enforced the Volcker Rule released and called for public comment on a proposal to simplify the rule in May 2018. Under the proposal, the agencies would clarify certain of the rule's definitions and criteria in an effort to reduce or eliminate uncertainties related to how certain trading activity can qualify for exemption. The proposal would also further tailor the compliance requirements facing banks based on the size of an institution's trading activity.", "Proponents of the Volcker Rule are generally wary of size-based exemptions. They contend that community banks typically do not face compliance obligations under the rule and do not face an excessive burden by being subject to it. They argue that community banks that are subject to compliance requirements can comply by having clear policies and procedures in place for review during the normal examination process. In addition, Volcker Rule supporters are generally critical of the regulators' proposal, asserting that the changes would undermine \"the effective supervision and enforcement\" of the rule.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury estimates domestic financial crime, excluding tax evasion, generates $300 billion in illicit proceeds that might involve money laundering. Despite robust AML efforts in the United States, the ability to counter money laundering effectively remains challenged by factors including (1) the diversity of illicit methods to move and store ill-gotten proceeds through the international financial system; (2) the introduction of new and emerging threats such as cyber-related financial crimes; (3) gaps in legal, regulatory, and enforcement regimes; and (4) the costs associated with financial institution compliance with global AML guidance and national laws.", "In the United States, the statutory foundation for domestic AML originated in 1970 with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA; P.L. 91-508) and its major component, the Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act. Amendments to the BSA and related provisions in the 1980s and 1990s expanded AML policy tools available to combat crime, particularly drug trafficking, and prevent criminals from laundering their illicitly derived profits. Key elements to the BSA/AML legal framework include requirements for customer identification, recordkeeping, reporting, and compliance programs intended to identify and prevent money laundering abuses.", "In general, banking regulators examine institutions for compliance with BSA/AML. When a regulator finds BSA violations or deficiencies in AML compliance programs, it may take informal or formal enforcement action, including possible civil fines. The BSA/AML policy framework is premised on banks and other covered financial entities filing a range of reports with the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), when their clients either engage in suspicious financial transactions, large cash transactions, or certain other transactions. For example, a bank generally must file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) if, among other reasons, it conducts a transaction of $5,000 or more that the bank suspects involves money laundering or other criminal activity. A bank must file a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) if it conducts a currency (i.e., cash) transaction of $10,000 or more as to which it has the same suspicions. The accurate, timely, and complete reporting of such activity to FinCEN flags situations that may warrant further investigation for law enforcement.", "Whether this regulatory framework adequately hinders criminals from using the banking system to launder their criminal proceeds and whether it does so efficiently without unduly burdening banks are debated issues. One aspect of this debate is whether current reporting requirements are inefficient and overly costly to the banking industry. Some industry observers\u2014including officials from the OCC\u2014have indicated that they believe certain areas of the current framework could be reformed in a way that reduces compliance costs without unduly weakening the ability to prevent money laundering. In contrast, officials from other agencies involved in AML and law enforcement\u2014including FinCEN and the FBI\u2014have stressed the importance of the information gathered under the current reporting requirements in combating money laundering. ", "Another area of concern involves beneficial owners \u2014that is, the natural person(s) who own or control a legal entity, such as a corporation or limited liability company. When such entities are set up without physical operations or assets, they are often referred to as shell companies . Shell companies can be used to conceal beneficial ownership and facilitate anonymous financial transactions. In recent years, policymakers have become increasingly concerned regarding potential risks posed by shell companies whose beneficial ownership is not transparent. This is due in part to a series of leaks to the media regarding the use of shell companies to facilitate criminal activity (such as \"the Panama Papers\") and sustained multilateral criticism of current U.S. practices by the Financial Action Task Force, an international standard-setting body. In May 2018, a new FinCEN regulation came into effect that increased the requirements for banks to conduct customer due diligence (CDD) and ascertain the identity of beneficial owners in certain cases. Central to the CDD rule is a requirement for financial institutions to establish and maintain procedures to identify and verify beneficial owners of a legal entity opening a new account.", "If Congress decides that reporting requirements facing banks are not appropriately calibrated, it could pass legislation amending those requirements. For example, Congress could change the CTR or SAR reporting threshold or index the threshold levels to inflation. Certain bills introduced in the 115 th Congress would have increased financial transparency and reporting requirements for beneficial owners in other nonbank fields, such as real estate, but could potentially indirectly impact the banking industry as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cybersecurity50", "paragraphs": ["Cybersecurity is a major concern of banks, other financial services providers, and federal regulators. In many ways, it is an important extension of physical security. For example, banks are concerned about both physical and electronic theft of money and other assets, and they do not want their businesses shut down by weather events or electronic denial-of-service attacks. Maintaining the confidentiality, security, and integrity of physical records and electronic data held by banks is critical to sustaining the level of trust that allows businesses and consumers to rely on the banking industry to supply services on which they depend.", "The federal government has increasingly recognized the importance of cybersecurity in the financial services industry, as evidenced by the inclusion of financial services in the government's list of critical infrastructure sectors. The basic authority that federal regulators use to establish cybersecurity standards emanates from the organic legislation that established the agencies and delineated the scope of their authority and functions. As previously discussed, federal banking regulators are required to promulgate safety and soundness standards for all federally insured depository institutions to protect the stability of the nation's banking system. Some of these standards pertain to cybersecurity issues, including information security, data breaches, and destruction or theft of business records.", "In addition, certain laws (at both the state and federal levels) have provisions related to cybersecurity of financial services that are often performed by banks, including the Dodd-Frank Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA; P.L. 106-102 ), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-204 ). For example, Section 501 of GLBA imposes obligations on financial institutions to \"respect the privacy of ... [their] customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers' nonpublic personal information.\" Federal banking regulators require the entities that they regulate to protect customer privacy of physical and electronic records as mandated by the privacy title of GLBA. Federal bank regulators also issue guidance in a variety of forms designed to help banks evaluate their risks and comply with cybersecurity regulations.", "Regulators bring adjudicatory enforcement actions on a case-by-case basis related to banks' violations of cybersecurity protocols. Banks often view these actions as signaling how an agency interprets aspects of its regulatory authority. For example, a number of recent consent orders issued by the FDIC have directed banks to perform assessments or audits of information technology programs and management to identify risks and ensure compliance with cybersecurity requirements. ", "Thus, oversight of financial services and bank cybersecurity reflects a complex and sometimes overlapping array of state and federal laws, regulators, regulations, and guidance. However, whether this framework is effective and efficient, resulting in adequate protection against cyberattacks without imposing undue cost burdens on banks, is an open question. The occurrence of successful hacks of banks and other financial institutions, wherein huge amounts of individuals' personal information are stolen or compromised, highlights the importance of ensuring bank cybersecurity. For example, in 2014, JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, experienced a data breach that exposed financial records of 76 million households.

", "Recently, banks and other nonbank financial institutions that provide financial products to consumers (e.g., mortgages, credit cards, and deposit accounts) have been affected by the implementation of new CFPB regulations. For example, banks and other lenders have begun to comply with major new mortgage rules such as the Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards Rule (ATR/QM) and Truth in Lending Act/Real Estate Settlement Act Integrated Disclosure Rule (TRID). The ATR/QM encourages lenders to gather more information on prospective borrowers than they otherwise might have in order to reduce the likelihood that a borrower would receive an inappropriate loan. TRID requires lenders to provide borrowers with certain information about the mortgages for which they are applying. In addition to these and other new regulations, the CFPB also provides information on its supervisory activities related to banks, such as instances where its examiners found that certain financial institutions misrepresented service fees associated with deposit and checking accounts.", "Compliance with these new rules has increased banks' operational costs, which some argue potentially leads to higher costs for consumers in certain markets or a reduction in the availability of credit.

Regarding aspects of CRA compliance that may be unnecessarily burdensome, Treasury recommends increasing the timeliness of the CRA performance examination process.

Failures were minimal from 1999 to 2007, but played a larger role in the decline during the late 1980s and following the 2007-2009 financial crisis and subsequent recession.

For example, a bank that is struggling financially may look to merge with a stronger bank to stay in business. Alternatively, a community bank that has been outperforming its peers may be bought by a larger bank that wants to benefit from its success. ", "In addition, other fundamental changes besides regulatory burden in the banking system could be driving consolidation, making it difficult to isolate the effects of regulation. Through much of the 20 th century, federal and state laws restricted banks' ability to open new branches and banking across state lines was restricted. Thus, many more banks were needed to serve every community. Branching and banking across state lines was not substantially deregulated at the federal level until 1997 through the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-328 ). When these restrictions were relaxed, it became easier for community banks to consolidate or for mid-size and large banks to spread operations to other markets. In addition, there may be economies of scale, not only in compliance, but in the business of banking in general. Furthermore, the economies of scale may be growing over time, which would also drive industry consolidation. For example, information technology has become more important in banking (e.g., cybersecurity and mobile banking), and certain information technology systems may be subject to economies of scale. Finally, the slow growth coming out of the most recent recession, and macroeconomic conditions more generally (such as low interest rates), may make it less appealing for new firms to enter the banking market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Burden on Community Banks", "paragraphs": ["Community banks receive special regulatory consideration to minimize their regulatory burden.

Advocates for further regulatory relief argue that certain realized benefits are likely to be relatively small, whereas certain realized costs are likely to be relatively large.", "One area where the benefits of regulation may be relatively small for community banks relative to large banks is regulations aimed at improving systemic stability, because community banks individually pose less of a risk to the financial system as a whole than a large, complex, interconnected bank. Many recent banking regulations were implemented at least in part in response to the systemic nature of the 2007-2009 crisis. Some community bank proponents argue that because small banks did not cause the crisis and pose less systemic risk, they need not be subject to new regulations made in response to the crisis. Opponents of these arguments note that systemic risk is only one of the goals of regulation, along with prudential regulation and consumer protection, and that community banks are exempted from many of the regulations aimed at systemic risk. They note that hundreds of small banks failed during and after the crisis, suggesting the prudential regulation in place prior to the crisis was not stringent enough.", "Another potential rationale for easing regulations on community banks would be if there are economies of scale to regulatory compliance costs, meaning that regulatory compliance costs may increase as bank size does but decrease as a percentage of overall costs or revenues. Put another way, as regulatory complexity increases, compliance may become relatively more costly for small institutions. Empirical evidence on whether compliance costs are subject to economies of scale is mixed, thus consider this illustrative example to show the logic behind the argument. Imagine a bank with $100 million in assets and 25 employees and a bank with $10 billion in assets and 1,250 employees each determine they must hire an extra employee to ensure compliance with new regulations. The relative burden is larger on the small institution that expands its workforce by 4% than on the large bank that expands by less than 0.1%. From a cost-benefit perspective, if regulatory compliance costs are subject to economies of scale, then the balance of costs and benefits of a particular regulation will differ depending on the size of the bank. For the same regulatory proposal, economies of scale could potentially result in costs outweighing benefits for smaller banks. ", "Due to a lack of empirical evidence of the exact benefits and costs of each individual regulation at each individual bank (and even lack of consensus over which banks should qualify as community banks), debates over the appropriate level of tailoring of regulations is a debate over calibration involving qualitative assessments. Where should the lines be drawn? Should exemption thresholds be set high so that regulations apply only to the very largest, most complex banks? Should thresholds be set relatively low, so that only very small banks are exempt? At what point does a bank cease to have the characteristics associated with community banks? Often at issue in this debate are the so-called regional banks \u2014banks that are larger and operate across a greater geographic market than the community banks but are also smaller and less complex than the largest, most complex organizations with hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars in assets.

In the context of traditional banking, credit intermediation is performed by taking deposits from savers and using them to fund loans to borrowers. Nonbank institutions can also perform similar credit intermediation to banks\u2014sometimes called shadow banking \u2014using certain instruments such as money market mutual funds, short-term debt instruments, and securitized pools of loans. When illiquid assets are funded by liquid liabilities, an otherwise-solvent bank or nonbank might experience difficulty meeting short-term obligations without having to sell assets, possibly at \"fire sale\" prices. If depositors or other funding providers feel their money is not safe with an institution, many of them may withdraw their funds at the same time. Such a \"run\" could cause an institution to fail. ", "Long-established government programs mitigate liquidity- and run-risk in the banking industry. The Federal Reserve is authorized to act as a \"lender of last resort\" for a bank experiencing liquidity problems, and the FDIC insures depositors against losses. Banks are also subject to prudential regulation\u2014as discussed in the \" Prudential Regulation \" section. However, nonbank intermediation is performed without the government safety nets available to banks or the prudential regulation required of them. The lack of an explicit government safety net in shadow banking means that taxpayers are less explicitly or directly exposed to risk, but it also means that shadow banking may be more vulnerable to a panic that could trigger a financial crisis. ", "Some argue that the increased regulatory burden placed on banks in response to the financial crisis\u2014such as the changes in bank regulation mandated by Dodd-Frank or agreed to in Basel III\u2014could result in a decreased role for banks in credit intermediation and an increased role for relatively lightly regulated nonbanks.", "Many contend the financial crisis demonstrated how risks to deposit-like financial instruments in the shadow banking sector\u2014such as money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements\u2014can create or exacerbate systemic distress. Money market mutual funds are deposit-like instruments that are managed with the goal of never losing principal and that investors can convert to cash on demand. Institutions can also access deposit-like funding by borrowing through short-term funding markets\u2014such as by issuing commercial paper and entering repurchase agreements. These instruments can be continually rolled over as long as funding providers have confidence in the borrowers' solvency. During the crisis, all these instruments\u2014which investors had previously viewed as safe and unlikely to suffer losses\u2014experienced run-like events as funding providers withdrew from markets. Moreover, nonbanks can take on exposure to long-term loans through investing in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or other asset-backed securities (ABS). During the crisis, as firms faced liquidity problems, the value of these assets decreased quickly, possibly in part as a result of fire sales.", "Since the crisis, many regulatory changes have been made related to certain money market, commercial paper, and repurchase agreement markets and practices. For example, in the United States, certain money market mutual funds now must have a floating net asset value . Among other benefits, this may signal to fund investors that a loss of principal is possible and thus reduce the likelihood that investors would \"run\" at the first sign of possible small losses. However, some observers are still concerned that shadow banking poses risks, because the funding of relatively long-term assets with relatively short-term liabilities will inherently introduce run-risk absent certain safeguards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Technology, or \"Fintech\"", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, f intech usually refers to technologies with the potential to alter the way certain financial services are performed. Banks are affected by technological developments in two ways: (1) they face choices over how much to invest in emerging technologies and to what extent they want to alter their business models in adopting technologies, and (2) they potentially face new competition from new technology-focused companies. Such technologies include online marketplace lending, crowdfunding, blockchain and distributed ledgers, and robo-advising, among many others. Certain financial innovations may create opportunities to improve social and economic outcomes, but there is also potential to create risks or unexpected financial losses. ", "Potential benefits from fintech are greater efficiency in financial markets that creates lower prices and increased customer and small business access to financial services. These can be achieved if innovative technology replaces traditional processes that are outdated or inefficient. For example, automation may be able to replace employees, and digital technology can replace physical systems and infrastructure. Cost savings from removing inefficiencies may lead to reduced prices, making certain services affordable to new customers. Some customers who previously did not have access to services\u2014due to such things as the lack of information about creditworthiness or geographic remoteness\u2014could also potentially gain access. Increased accessibility may be especially beneficial to traditionally underserved groups, such as low-income, minority, and rural populations.", "Fintech could also create or increase risks. Many fintech products have only a brief history of operation, so it can be difficult to predict outcomes and assess risk. It is possible certain technologies may not in the end function as efficiently and accurately as intended. Also, the stated aim of a new technology is often to bring a product directly to consumers and eliminate a \"middle-man.\" However, that middle-man could be an experienced financial institution or professional that can advise consumers on financial products and their risks. In these ways, fintech could increase the likelihood that consumers engage in a financial activity and take on risks that they do not fully understand.", "Policymakers debate whether (and which) innovations can be integrated into the financial system without additional regulatory or policy action. Technology in finance largely involves reducing the costs or time involved in providing existing products and services, and the existing regulatory structure was developed to address risks from these financial products and activities. Existing regulation may be able to accommodate new technologies while adequately protecting against risks. However, there are two other possibilities. One is that some regulations may be stifling beneficial innovation. Another is that existing regulation does not adequately address risks created by new technologies.", "Some observers argue that regulation could potentially impede the development and introduction of beneficial innovation. For example, companies incur costs to comply with regulations. In addition, companies are sometimes unsure how regulators will treat the innovation once it is brought to market. A potential solution being used in other countries is to establish a regulatory \"sandbox\" or \"greenhouse\" wherein companies that meet certain requirements work with regulators as products are brought to market under a less onerous regulatory framework. In the United States, the CFPB has recently introduced a sandbox wherein companies can experiment with disclosure forms.", "Some are concerned that existing regulations may not adequately address certain risks posed by new technologies. Regulatory arbitrage\u2014conducting business in a way that circumvents unfavorable regulations\u2014may be a concern in this area. Fintech potentially could provide an opportunity for companies to claim they are not subject to certain regulations because of a superficial difference between how they operate compared with traditional banks. ", "Another group of issues posed by fintech relates to cybersecurity (for general issues related to cybersecurity, see the \" Cybersecurity \" section above). As financial activity increasingly uses digital technology, sensitive data are generated. Data can be used to accurately assess risks and ensure customers receive the best products and services. However, data can be stolen and used inappropriately, and there are concerns over privacy issues. This raises questions over ownership and control of the data\u2014including the rights of consumers and the responsibilities of companies in accessing and using data\u2014and whether companies that use and collect data face appropriate cybersecurity requirements. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Higher Interest Rate Environment", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Reserve's monetary policy response to the financial crisis, the ensuing recession, and subsequent slow economic growth was to keep interest rates unusually low for an extraordinarily long time. It accomplished this in part using unprecedented monetary policy tools such as quantitative easing \u2014large-scale asset purchases that significantly increased the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Recently, as economic conditions improved, the Federal Reserve took steps to normalize monetary policy such as raising its target interest rate and reducing the size of its balance sheet. ", "A rising interest rate environment\u2014especially following an extended period of unusually low rates achieved with unprecedented monetary policy tools\u2014is an issue for banks because they are exposed to interest rate risk . A portion of bank assets have fixed interest rates with long terms until maturity, such as mortgages, and the rates of return on these assets do not increase as current market rates do. However, many bank liabilities are short term, such as deposits, and can be repriced quickly. So although certain interest revenue being collected by banks is slow to rise, the interest costs paid out by banks can rise quickly. In addition to putting stress on net income, rising interest rates can cause the market value of fixed-rate assets to fall. Finally, banks incur an opportunity cost when resources are tied up in long-term assets with low interest rates rather than being used to make new loans at higher interest rates.", "The magnitude of interest rate risks should not be overstated, as rising rates can potentially increase bank profitability if they result in a greater difference between long-term rates banks receive and short-term rates they pay\u2014referred to as net interest margin . However, thus far into the Federal Reserve interest rate normalization process, this has not materialized. During 2018, the difference between long-term rates and short-term rates has generally decreased (known as a flattening of the yield curve ). ", "Whatever changes may occur to various interest rates in the coming months and years, banks and regulators typically recognize the importance of managing interest rate risk, carefully examine the composition of bank balance sheets, and plan for different interest rate change scenarios. While banks are well-practiced at interest rate risk management through normal economic and monetary policy cycles, managing bank risk through a period of interest rate growth could be more challenging because rates have been so low for so long and achieved through unprecedented monetary policy tools. Because rates have been low for so long, many loans made in different interest rate environments that preceded the crisis have matured. Meanwhile, all new loans made in the past 10 years were made in a low interest rate environment. This presents challenges to banks seeking to hold a mix of loans with different rates. In addition, because the Federal Reserve has used new monetary policy tools and grown its balance sheet to unprecedented levels, accurately controlling the pace of interest rate growth may be challenging.
