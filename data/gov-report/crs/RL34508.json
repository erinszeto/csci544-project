For the most part, North America has a continent-wide market that is integrated through a pipeline network that connects the lower-48 states, the most populous provinces of Canada, and parts of Mexico. Prices throughout this integrated market are influenced by demand (which may be influenced by weather, economic conditions, alternative fuel prices, and other factors), supply, and the capacity available to link supply sources and demand loads (transmission and distribution systems).", "The U.S. natural gas market is the major component of the North American natural gas market. It accounts for about 81% of North American consumption and about 69% of North American supply.", "The key price point in North America is Henry Hub. Henry Hub is a major pipeline hub in Erath, Louisiana, that is used as the designated pricing and delivery point for the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) gas futures contract and other transactions. The price difference between other locations and Henry Hub is called the \"basis differential.\" When there is spare capacity available to move natural gas from Henry Hub, or the Gulf of Mexico region in general, to the relevant price point area, the basis differential tends to be low, approximating the costs of fuel used to move the gas to the location. When capacity availability is tight, basis differentials can grow because the driving force can become the value of the natural gas at the delivery point, rather than the cost of getting the natural gas to that point.", "Natural gas prices also incorporate costs for distributing the gas from the wholesale marketplace to retail customers. These rates are generally determined by state regulators and involve both (1) the approval of costs and rates of return and (2) the allocation of costs among customer classes (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial).", "Although the North American natural gas market remains a distinct regional market, it is increasingly connecting to a global gas marketplace through international LNG trade.

Interestingly, while some continue to call for more storage because of the growing consumption of natural gas, the decrease in the seasonal swing (through a decrease in the high month volume and an increase in the low month volume) means that less storage may be able to serve the annual cycling needs of the U.S. markets. Those trading natural gas may want additional storage for arbitrage uses, but the fundamental needs related to system reliability may decrease somewhat with a decrease in the difference between the minimum and maximum consumption rates.", "Another noteworthy seasonal feature observed in 2007 by EIA found that natural gas price volatility is \"considerably higher\" in colder months than in other times."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing Gas-for-Power Use", "paragraphs": ["The natural gas consumption sector with the greatest increase from 2006 to 2007 was electric power.

As the extent of oil/gas fuel switching has declined, this linkage has changed. During 2007, as crude oil and petroleum product prices increased, relative prices for natural gas became lower than the historical pattern. In the recent past, natural gas and oil product price competition tended to exhibit itself most clearly around the New York metropolitan area, where there remained a fair amount of fuel switching capability. This fuel switching capability tended to keep natural gas prices at the New York citygate in a range bounded on the high side by distillate fuel oil prices and on the low side by low sulfur residual fuel oil prices. In 2007, the relevant natural gas prices tended to be below this range (see Figure 2 ).", "The shift to outside this fuel price range suggests that the consumers had done all the fuel switching to natural gas that remained feasible.

In the first storage report after the 2007-2008 heating season, working gas storage was at 1,234 billion cubic feet, the lowest level since April 30, 2004. This may indicate that slack in the supply side is decreasing. The opening of the Rockies Express natural gas pipeline out of the Rocky Mountain production region appears to have relieved transmission congestion there. This improved the net back price within the production area. The wellhead price in the Rockies area increased from $4.82 per million Btu in November 2007 to $8.41 in March 2008. This improves the incentives for producers to find and develop new supplies in this area. The natural gas pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska has made progress. In January 2008, the Governor of Alaska announced that one of the pipeline project applications under the state Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA) was judged complete. In April 2008, two of the North Slope gas producers, BP and ConocoPhillips, announced that they had joined together to start a potentially competing effort, the Denali Alaska Gas Pipeline, which has an open season target date (date when capacity will be offered to potential shippers) of 2010 and an in-service target of 2018 (stated by the producers as a 10-year target). In early April, the Independence Trail pipeline that serves the Independence Hub platform in the Gulf of Mexico was taken out of service for pipeline repairs that could take until mid-year to complete.
