Pertinent to the discussion is the potential for a shortfall in the nation's C2ISR capabilities if Congress or DOD chooses to minimize funding for sustainment and upgrades that would keep the weapon systems viable until they are recapitalized. Another issue for Congress is DOD, Air Force, and Navy priorities for sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization efforts. An important question is whether development of a C2ISR replacement aircraft can or should be further delayed by increasing funding for legacy C2ISR aircraft sustainment and modernization. Additionally, potentially shifting some of the legacy C2ISR missions to remotely piloted aircraft may affect recapitalization efforts. Congress's decisions on these issues could also have implications for any potential future base realignment and closure (BRAC) decisions as well as impact the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industrial base. Ultimately, the priority the DOD places on legacy C2ISR sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization, and any decisions considered by Congress, could have potential consequences for future national defense strategies and on U.S. C2ISR capabilities, given the pivotal role C2ISR plays in implementing those strategies.", "A note on sources: As small fleets of specialized aircraft, relatively little has been written on the programs discussed in this paper.

The most prominent external feature is a 27-foot long, canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage that houses a 24-foot long, side-looking phased array antenna. The antenna can tilt to either side of the aircraft where it can develop a 120-degree field of view covering nearly 19,305 square miles, and is capable of detecting targets more than 155 miles away.

All of these aircraft struggle with diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages in an effort to replace and repair aircraft parts and equipment that original manufacturers no longer produce. As the nation's current budget debate shifts towards spending cuts, some analysts note the potential for deep defense cuts may drive the defense industry to streamline and consolidate operations, potentially exit prior production lines, and undergo internal restructuring in an effort to maintain their existing profit margin.

As these legacy C2ISR platforms continue to remain in the inventory and their age increases, understanding the Air Force and Navy sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization plans is likely important for Congress. The central issue is how much Congress should consider appropriating for the continued sustainment and modernization of these aircraft compared to funding for recapitalization of these missions to new aircraft. Without sufficient sustainment and modernization funding, many analysts argue, the legacy C2ISR fleet will quickly become a decrepit force ill-suited to the potential challenges posed by future adversaries. Other suggest that moving to recapitalization and new platforms will result in greater mission effectiveness over the long term, and better cost-effectiveness than keeping up older platforms.", "A key issue for Congress is whether to continue providing sustainment, modernization, and/or recapitalization funding for the DOD's Boeing 707-based legacy C2ISR aircraft fleet, and if so, at what levels. Pertinent to the discussion is the potential for a shortfall in the nation's C2ISR capabilities if Congress or the DOD chooses to minimize funding for sustainment and upgrades that would keep the weapon systems viable until they are recapitalized. An important question to ask is whether development of a C2ISR replacement aircraft can be further delayed given sufficient levels of funding for legacy C2ISR aircraft sustainment and modernization, and if that is a good idea. Additionally, Congress's potential oversight of whether to shift some of the legacy C2ISR missions to remotely piloted aircraft bears directly on recapitalization efforts. Finally, Congress's decisions on these issues could also have implications for any potential future base realignment and closure (BRAC) decisions as well as impact the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industrial base. Ultimately, the priority the DOD places on legacy C2ISR sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization, and Congress's response could have potential consequences on U.S. C2ISR capabilities and for the future national defense strategies they support."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
