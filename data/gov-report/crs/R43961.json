The program is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by individuals who work in Social Security-covered employment and their employers. Employees and their employers each pay 6.2% of covered earnings, up to an annual limit on taxable earnings; self-employed individuals pay 12.4% of net self-employment income, up to an annual limit on taxable earnings. The program is also credited with federal income taxes that some beneficiaries pay on a portion of their benefits; reimbursements from the general fund of the Treasury for a variety of purposes; and interest income from the Treasury on the investment of Social Security revenues in special federal government obligations. ", "The program provides monthly cash benefits to eligible retired or disabled workers and their family members, and to the family members of deceased workers. To be eligible for a retired-worker benefit, a worker needs 10 years of covered employment, among other requirements. Fewer years of covered employment are needed to qualify for a disabled-worker benefit, depending on the age of the worker when he or she becomes disabled. As of December 2014, there were approximately 59 million Social Security beneficiaries: 42 million retired workers and their family members (71%); 11 million disabled workers and their family members (19%); and 6 million survivors of deceased workers (10%).

To be eligible for a retired-worker benefit, a worker needs 40 earnings credits (10 years of covered employment). Fewer credits are needed to qualify for a disabled-worker benefit if the worker is under age 62. The number of credits needed varies, depending on the age of the worker when he or she becomes disabled. For example, a worker who becomes disabled before age 24 needs six credits (1\u00bd years of covered employment) in the three years before the onset of the disability. For Social Security purposes, disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last for at least 12 months or result in death. Generally, the worker must be unable to do any kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy, taking into account age, education, and work experience.", "A worker is eligible to receive a retirement benefit as early as age 62. However, if a worker begins receiving a retirement benefit before the full retirement age (FRA), his or her benefit is permanently reduced to take into account early retirement and the longer expected period of benefit receipt. The FRA ranges from age 65 to age 67, depending on the worker's year of birth.

Specifically, a worker's primary insurance amount (PIA) is his or her monthly benefit payable at the FRA. The PIA is determined based on the following steps: (1) the worker's annual earnings in covered employment are indexed to historical wage growth, to bring past earnings up to near-current wage levels; (2) the highest 35 years of indexed earnings are summed to get the total earnings; (3) the total earnings are divided by 420 months (35 years x 12 months) to get the amount of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) over the worker's career in covered employment; and finally, (4) a progressive benefit formula is applied to the worker's AIME (the progressive benefit formula is designed to provide a higher replacement rate for lower-wage workers compared to higher-wage workers). ", "The monthly benefit that is payable to a worker may be less than or greater than his or her PIA, depending on the circumstances. For example, a worker's benefit is permanently reduced if he or she claims retirement benefits before the full retirement age, to take into account the longer expected period of benefit receipt (based on average life expectancy). Similarly, a worker's benefit is permanently increased if he or she claims retirement benefits after the full retirement age (up to age 70), to take into account the shorter expected period of benefit receipt. In addition to benefit adjustments based on age, other benefit adjustments may apply, such as reductions/offsets based on simultaneous entitlement to more than one type of Social Security benefit (a Social Security retired-worker benefit and a spousal benefit, for example) or receipt of a pension from work that was not covered by Social Security.

In order to qualify for these benefits as one of these family members, the applicant must meet the relationship requirements to the Number Holder (also referred to as the insured) as set out in these provisions. The Number Holder is the worker on whose record benefits are claimed. Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act ( Determination of Family Status ) references the use of state law in the determination of entitlement to Social Security benefits as a spouse, surviving spouse, child, or parent of the worker. While state law does not affect a person's entitlement to benefits as a retired or disabled worker, it does affect a person's entitlement to benefits as a family member of a retired, disabled or deceased worker.", "In determining family relationship for purposes of a person's application for benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse , SSA looks to the laws of the state - as interpreted by the courts of that state - where the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of the application, or at the time of the Number Holder's death, as specified in Section 216(h)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. SSA has interpreted \"domiciled\" in this context to mean the \"true and fixed home (legal domicile) of a person...to which a person intends to return whenever he or she is absent.\" The relationship requirement is met if the applicant and the Number Holder were validly married under state law as interpreted by the courts of that state at the time of application for spousal benefits, or at the time of the Number Holder's death in the case of an application for surviving spouse benefits. ", "Alternatively, the relationship requirement is met if, under state intestate law, the applicant would be able to inherit a wife's, husband's, widow's, or widower's share of the Number Holder's personal property if the Number Holder were to die without leaving a will. The Uniform Probate Code, which serves as a guideline for the intestate laws of some states, does not explicitly define \"spouse\" or \"marriage.\" For the purposes of defining marriage in intestate law, the Uniform Probate Code instead directs state legislatures to incorporate that state's particular legal definition of marriage.", "If a relationship by marriage cannot be established under state law, the applicant may be eligible for benefits as the wife, husband, widow, or widower of the Number Holder under other circumstances (i.e., based upon a deemed valid marriage), as specified in Section 216(h)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act. For example, the regulations state, in part:", "You will be deemed to be the wife, husband, widow, or widower of the insured if, in good faith, you went through a marriage ceremony with the insured that would have resulted in a valid marriage except for a legal impediment. A legal impediment includes only an impediment which results because a previous marriage had not ended at the time of the ceremony or because there was a defect in the procedure followed in connection with the intended marriage.", "Therefore, under current Social Security law, the determination of entitlement to benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse can vary from state to state, regardless of the gender of each individual in a couple. With respect to same-sex married couples, two factors in determining entitlement to Social Security benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse are that (1) the couple was validly married in a state that permits same-sex marriage and (2) the Number Holder is domiciled in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage at the time of application for spousal benefits, or at the time of the Number Holder's death in the case of an application for surviving spouse benefits. In addition, persons in civil unions or other nonmarital legal same-sex relationships can qualify for Social Security benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse in some cases.

Benefits payable to family members are subject to adjustments based on a number of factors, including the person's age at entitlement, receipt of a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work in covered employment, and receipt of a pension based on work that was not covered by Social Security. In addition, there is an overall limit on the total amount of benefits payable to a family based on a worker's record.

After the marriage ceremony, the couple then moves to California (CA), which recognizes out-of-state same-sex marriages. Additionally, Michael is living in California at the time David files the application for spousal benefits.
