Since their creation, the grants have been composed of three or four separate programs, though for the majority of their existence, between 1992 and 2012, the grant programs were unchanged. During this time period, there were four programs authorized and funded by Congress: the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG), the Supportive Housing Program (SHP), the Shelter Plus Care (S+C) program, and the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation for Single Room Occupancy Dwellings (SRO) program. Funds for the ESG program were used primarily for the short-term needs of homeless persons, such as emergency shelter, while the other three programs addressed longer-term transitional and permanent housing needs.", "The composition of the Homeless Assistance Grants changed when Congress enacted the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act as part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act in the 111th Congress (P.L. 111-22). The HEARTH Act renamed the ESG program (it is now called the Emergency Solutions Grants) and expanded the way in which funds can be used to include homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing (quickly finding housing for families who find themselves homeless), and it consolidated SHP, S+C, and SRO into one program called the Continuum of Care (CoC) program. A third program carved out of the CoC program to assist rural communities\u2015the Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program\u2015was also created by P.L. 111-22. In addition, the HEARTH Act broadened HUD's definition of homelessness. The changes in P.L. 111-22 had repercussions for the way in which funds are distributed to grantees, the purposes for which grantees may use funds, and who may be served.", "HUD began to implement the ESG program in FY2011 and the CoC program in FY2012, and it released proposed regulations for the Rural Housing Stability (RHS) grants in March 2013 (and has not yet provided RHS grants). Funds for the ESG program, in addition to being available for homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing, can be used for emergency shelter and supportive services. CoC program funds can be used to provide permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, supportive services, and rapid rehousing. If the RHS program is implemented, rural communities will have greater flexibility in who they are able to serve (those assisted may not necessarily meet HUD's definition of \"homeless individual\"), and may use funds for a variety of housing and services options.", "HUD uses one method to distribute funds for the ESG program and another method to distribute funds for the CoC program. The ESG program distributes funds to states, counties, and metropolitan areas using the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program formula, while the CoC grants are distributed through a competitive process, though the CDBG formula plays a role in determining community need. In July 2016, HUD proposed to change the CoC formula so that it no longer relies on the CDBG formula distribution.", "Funding for the Homeless Assistance Grants has increased by almost $1 billion in the last 10 years, reaching nearly $2.4 billion in FY2017 compared to $1.4 billion in FY2007 (see Table 3). Despite funding increases, the need to renew existing grants requires the majority of funding.

Throughout the early and middle part of the 20 th century, homelessness was typified by \"skid rows\"\u2014areas with hotels and single-room occupancy dwellings where transient single men lived. Skid rows were usually removed from the more populated areas of cities, and it was uncommon for individuals to actually live on the streets. Beginning in the 1970s, however, the homeless population began to grow and become more visible to the general public. According to studies from the time, homeless persons were no longer almost exclusively single men, but included women with children; their median age was younger; they were more racially diverse (in previous decades the observed homeless population was largely white); they were less likely to be employed (and therefore had lower incomes); they were mentally ill in higher proportions than previously; and individuals who were abusing or had abused drugs began to become more prevalent in the population.", "A number of reasons have been offered for the growth in the number of homeless persons and their increasing visibility. Many cities demolished skid rows to make way for urban development, leaving some residents without affordable housing options. Other possible factors contributing to homelessness include the decreased availability of affordable housing generally, the reduced need for seasonal unskilled labor, the reduced likelihood that relatives will accommodate homeless family members, the decreased value of public benefits, and changed admissions standards at mental hospitals. The increased visibility of homeless people was due, in part, to the decriminalization of actions such as public drunkenness, loitering, and vagrancy.", "In the 1980s, Congress first responded to the growing prevalence of homelessness with several separate grant programs designed to address the food and shelter needs of homeless individuals. Then, in 1987, Congress enacted the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney Act), which created a number of new programs to comprehensively address the needs of homeless people, including food, shelter, health care, and education ( P.L. 100-77 ). The act was later renamed the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney-Vento) in P.L. 106-400 after its other prominent sponsor, Bruce F. Vento.", "Among the programs authorized in the McKinney-Vento Act were four grants to provide housing and related assistance to homeless persons: the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program, the Supportive Housing Demonstration program, the Supplemental Assistance for Facilities to Assist the Homeless (SAFAH) program, and the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Assistance for Single Room Occupancy Dwellings (SRO) program. These four programs, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), were created to provide temporary and permanent housing to homeless persons, along with supportive services. Over the years, Congress changed the makeup of the Homeless Assistance Grants, but for 20 years, from 1992 to 2012, the same four grant programs composed the Homeless Assistance Grants. These were the ESG program, the Supportive Housing Program (SHP), the Shelter Plus Care (S+C) program, and the SRO program.

In addition, the HEARTH Act did not specify which other federal statutes would be included in defining homeless families with children and unaccompanied youth. In its regulations, HUD listed seven other federal programs as those under which youth or families with children can be defined as homeless: the Runaway and Homeless Youth program; Head Start; the Violence Against Women Act; the Healthcare for the Homeless program; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program; and the McKinney-Vento Education for Children and Youth program.", "Five of these seven programs (all but Runaway and Homeless Youth and Health Care for the Homeless programs) either share the Education for Homeless Children and Youths definition, or use a very similar definition.

Prior to enactment of the CoC program, transitional housing was provided through the SHP program. Permanent Housing: As its name indicates, the statute governing the CoC program provides that permanent housing is not time limited and may be provided with or without supportive services. However, HUD, when it released interim CoC program regulations, set out two types of permanent housing that grantees may provide, refining the definition. Permanent Supportive Housing: Pursuant to the regulations, grantees may provide permanent housing with supportive services to individuals with disabilities and families where an adult or child has a disability. Rapid Rehousing: The CoC program regulations allow permanent housing assistance to be provided in the context of rapid rehousing. Rapid rehousing is a process targeted to assist homeless individuals and families through supportive services together with rental assistance. The hope is that, after a period of time with assistance, those experiencing homelessness will be able to maintain permanent housing on their own. Grantees may pay for short-term rental assistance (up to three months) and medium-term rental assistance (from 3 to 24 months). Supportive Services: The statute continues to allow the CoC program to fund an array of supportive services for homeless individuals and families. The statute, augmented by the interim regulations, lists a number of authorized services. The services include case management, child care, education services, employment assistance and job training, housing search, life skills training, legal services, mental health services, outpatient health services, substance abuse treatment, transportation, and payment of moving costs and utility deposits. Note, however, that a decreasing share of CoC program funds pays for supportive services. See Table 2 . Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS): Homeless Management Information Systems are databases established at the local level through which homeless service providers collect, organize, and store information about homeless clients who receive services. Prior to implementation of the HEARTH Act, communities could use SHP grants to pay for HMIS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligible Costs", "paragraphs": ["In the three predecessor programs to the CoC program, the methods through which grantees provided housing and services to homeless individuals (e.g., through rental assistance, construction of housing, etc.) varied based on the particular program. In the CoC program, the relevant ways of providing assistance remain the same, but there is not the same limitation based on program type.", "Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Construction: CoC program funds can be used to acquire and/or rehabilitate property to be used for housing or supportive services for homeless individuals. Funds can be used for construction of housing for those who are homeless (but not for a facility that would only provide supportive services). These were eligible uses of funds under SHP. Leasing: Funds can be used to lease property in which housing and/or supportive services are made available to homeless individuals and families. Grant recipients must enter into occupancy agreements or subleases with program participants, and they may impose an occupancy charge. As in the SHP program, leases for housing may be for transitional or permanent housing. Rental Assistance: Similar to the S+C program, the HEARTH Act provides that grantees may use CoC funds for tenant-based rental assistance, project-based rental assistance, and sponsor-based rental assistance. Eligible grantees are states, units of local government, Public Housing Authorities, and private nonprofit organizations. With tenant-based vouchers, residents find private market housing much as they would with a Section 8 voucher; project-based assistance is provided to building owners and attached to specific units of housing (unlike a portable voucher); with sponsor-based assistance, grant recipients contract with private nonprofit housing providers or community mental health centers to provide housing. Unlike S+C, however, tenant-based rental assistance may be provided for a limited duration as rapid rehousing. It can be short term (up to 3 months) or medium term (between 3 and 24 months). Rental assistance may also be used for permanent housing without a time limit. Residents must pay a portion of rent in accordance with HUD rules. Personnel Costs of Supportive Services: Grantees that provide supportive services themselves (versus contracting with outside service providers) may use CoC program funds to pay the salaries and benefits costs of staff who provide services. Operating Costs: Grantees may use operating funds for transitional housing, permanent housing, and facilities that provide supportive services. Costs may include maintenance, taxes and insurance, reserves for replacement of major systems, security, utilities, furniture, and equipment. Funds may not be used for operating costs in cases where a property already receives rental assistance. Administrative Costs: The percentage of funds that may be used for administrative costs increased for the CoC program compared to the three predecessor programs. Individual grantees may use up to 10% of their grants for administrative expenses. Administrative expenses include administrative staff salaries (as outlined in the regulations), administrative supplies, and Continuum of Care training, among other things. Prior to enactment of the CoC program, SHP grant recipients could use 5% of funds for administrative purposes, and S+C recipients could use 8% of funds. Collaborative Applicants may use up to 3% of CoC funds for administrative expenses related to the application process for HUD funds. Collaborative Applicants that have the status of Unified Funding Agencies, and are able to receive and distribute the CoC program funds awarded to the Continuum of Care, may use an additional 3% of funds for fund distribution, ensuring that grant recipients develop fiscal control and accounting procedures, and arranging for annual audits or evaluations of each project.

Two General Accounting Office (now Government Accountability Office) reports from the late 1980s noted that the CDBG formula might not be the best way to target funds to areas that most need homeless assistance funds. Congress, too, has questioned the relationship between the formula and homelessness.

For example, legislation to reauthorize the McKinney-Vento Act that was introduced prior to enactment of the HEARTH Act gave more specific guidance as to how the HUD Secretary might determine need. The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act of 2007 ( S. 1518 ), as passed by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, would have directed the Secretary to consider factors such as the number of homeless individuals, shortages of affordable housing, and severe housing problems among extremely low-income households. The report released by HUD in 2001 proposed a number of potential formula factors, with an emphasis on a measure of housing affordability. ", "In general, factors used to distribute formula funds for programs such as CDBG are based on data collected by government entities, like the Census Bureau, that do not have an interest in the way in which funds are distributed. While the best measure of community need for homeless assistance may be the number of people who are homeless in a given community, current measures of homelessness are uncertain (it is difficult to accurately collect data on people experiencing homelessness), and the entities that collect the data\u2015the communities themselves\u2015have an interest in the distribution of funds.", "Another possible issue that could affect the distribution of the Homeless Assistance Grants is the CDBG formula itself. In past years, HUD and the Administration have proposed changes to the formula, but, to date, no legislation has been introduced that would affect the distribution. For example, in the President's FY2010 budget, the Obama Administration proposed using the number of people in poverty, excluding college students; housing that is 50 years old or older and occupied by a household in poverty; female-headed households with children under the age of 18; and overcrowding.

HUD proposed four alternative formulas with varying formula factors for each. HUD considered formula factors derived from data sources that have four characteristics: (1) they are relevant to measuring homelessness, (2) they are accurate, (3) they are timely, and (4) they are readily available for each jurisdiction. HUD correlated potential formula factors with the two-year average of local point-in-time counts of people experiencing homelessness in each community to determine the extent to which they might be an effective measure of homelessness. The formula factors that HUD ultimately proposed using in the four alternate formulas are population, poverty, affordability gap (gap between demand for and supply of rental housing that is affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households), rent-burdened extremely low-income households, renter-occupied units, and a hybrid factor using rent-burdened households and renter-occupied units.", "HUD also published a table comparing allocations to Continuums of Care based on each alternate formula, as well as a tool that can be used to change the relative weights of each factor. The comment period was open until September 23, 2016."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Competitive Grants Prior to Enactment of the HEARTH Act", "paragraphs": ["The Supportive Housing Program (SHP)", "The SHP provided funds for transitional housing for homeless individuals and families for up to 24 months, permanent housing for homeless individuals with disabilities, and supportive services. In FY2011, nearly 69% of total HUD competitive grant funds went to recipients as SHP grants. Eligible applicants for SHP grants included states, local government entities, public housing authorities (PHAs), private nonprofit organizations, and community mental health centers. Grant recipients could provide housing together with services, or could choose to provide services only (without a housing program component). Specifically, grantees could use funds to acquire and/or rehabilitate buildings that were used either to provide supportive housing or buildings that were used to provide supportive services only. Funds were able to be used to construct buildings that were used for supportive housing (but not supportive services only). At least 10% of total SHP funds had to be used for supportive services, at least 25% were to be used for projects that served families with children, and at least 25% had to be used for projects that serve homeless persons with disabilities. ", "In addition to financing physical structures, grantees could use funds to provide services like case management, health care, child care, housing assistance, nutritional counseling, and employment assistance. Grant recipients could provide these services themselves, or through contracts with outside providers. In addition, grant recipients could use funds to pay for up to 75% of their annual operating expenses and to help implement a Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) to keep records regarding the homeless individuals served within their community.", "Recipients of SHP grants were required to meet match requirements. All of the matching funds had to be provided by cash sources, but the level of nonfederal funds required varied with the type of activity undertaken. Funds that were used for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction had to be matched with an equal amount of the grant recipient's own funds. SHP grantees that received funds for supportive services had to provide at least a 20% match with funds from other sources, while grantees that received funds for operating expenses had to provide at least a 25% match of these funds on their own.", "The Single Room Occupancy Program (SRO)", "The Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program provided permanent housing to homeless individuals in efficiency units similar to dormitories, with single bedrooms, community bathrooms, and kitchen facilities. In FY2011, three new competitive grants were awarded to SRO projects for a total of approximately $3.2 million. The SRO program did not require homeless residents to have a disability and did not fund supportive services. Eligible applicants for SRO grants were PHAs and private nonprofit organizations. SRO units were funded as part of HUD's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program, which required grant recipients to spend at least $3,000 per unit to rehabilitate property to be used for SRO housing in order to bring the property into compliance with HUD's housing quality standards. Grant recipients were reimbursed for the costs of rehabilitating SRO units through Section 8 rental assistance payments that they received over a 10-year contract period. The costs of rehabilitation were amortized and added to a base rental amount. The maximum amount that a building owner could spend per unit and still be reimbursed was $23,000 as of FY2011 (this amount was updated annually). After the 10-year rental contracts expired, they were renewed through the Section 8 project-based rental assistance account on an annual basis rather than through the Homeless Assistance Grants.", "The Shelter Plus Care Program (S+C)", "The S+C program provided permanent supportive housing through rent subsidies for homeless individuals with disabilities and their families. In FY2011, approximately 40% of total competitive grant funds went to S+C grantees. Eligible applicants for the S+C grants were states, local government entities, and PHAs. The S+C rent subsidies could be tenant-based vouchers, project-based rental assistance, sponsor-based rental assistance, or single room occupancy housing. With tenant-based vouchers, residents found private market housing much as they would with a Section 8 voucher; project-based assistance was provided to building owners and attached to specific units of housing (unlike a portable voucher); with sponsor-based assistance, grant recipients contracted with private nonprofit housing providers or community mental health centers to provide housing; and rental assistance for SROs was targeted to a particular development. The S+C program required grant recipients to match the amount of grant funds they receive for rental assistance with an equal amount of funds that they used to provide supportive services. The services under S+C were similar to those provided in the SHP, and included activities like physical and mental health care, substance abuse counseling, child care services, case management, and educational and job training. Grant recipients could fulfill their match requirement with cash, the value of a lease, salary expenses for employees, or the time of volunteers."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
