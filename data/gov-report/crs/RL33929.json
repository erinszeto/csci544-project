Prior to FY2003, PHAs received funding for each voucher they were authorized to administer, based on their average costs from the previous year, plus inflation, referred to as \"unit-based\" funding. Most PHAs were not using all of their vouchers, due in part to rental market conditions, and each year the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was able to recapture unspent funds. In FY2001 and FY2002, some Members of Congress began expressing concern about the underutilization of vouchers and the amount of recaptures.", "Beginning in FY2003, and culminating in FY2006, Congress fundamentally changed the way PHAs received voucher funding. The changes were designed to limit the amount of unspent funds held by PHAs and limit the cost of vouchers, which had begun to grow rapidly in 2001 and 2002, due in part to market changes and in part to policy changes. In FY2006, PHAs were funded based on the amount of funding they had received in the previous year (regardless of changes in their costs and utilization), plus an inflation adjustment, prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. Under this formula, the funding needs of the program became more predictable, but some agencies received more funding than they were legally permitted to spend, while other agencies did not receive enough funding for all of the vouchers they were authorized to administer. The Bush Administration supported this conversion to a \"budget-based\" formula and requested that Congress enact permanent reforms to complement the new funding method. Low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups generally opposed both the funding changes and the Bush Administration's proposed policy reforms.", "In FY2007, Congress again changed the funding formula through the appropriations process. PHA funding was based on what they were spending in the previous year (rather than what they had been allocated in the previous year). As a result, PHAs that had not been spending all of their funding in FY2006 saw a reduction in funding in FY2007. Nonetheless, the funding provided was sufficient so that all PHAs received more than 100% of their 2006 costs and utilization. In FY2008 and FY2009, Congress adopted a cost and utilization-based formula similar to FY2007, but with a reduction in funding for PHAs with excess unspent funding in reserve. In FY2009, concerns were raised about how the implementation of the FY2009 formula may have left some PHAs without sufficient funding to continue serving all eligible families. Ultimately, Congress provided HUD with access to additional funding to help address shortfalls that could have resulted in families losing assistance. In FY2010-FY2012, Congress again adopted a cost and utilization-based formula, a hybrid of the \"unit-based\" and \"budget-based\" models. While Congress did not include a reduction for excess reserves in FY2010-FY2011, they did in FY2012.", "During the period of solely \"budget-based\" funding formulas, utilization of both authorized vouchers and of available funding declined. Since the adoption of a cost and utilization-based funding model, utilization has begun to increase again. As utilization increases, the cost of the program to Congress increases. This presents a set of policy tradeoffs between the goal of cost containment and the goal of serving as many eligible families as possible. The Section 8 voucher renewal funding formula continues to be a source of debate in the annual appropriations cycle, as well as in Section 8 voucher reform bills, which have contained proposals for statutory formula changes.

The Section 8 voucher program is federally funded and governed by federal rules, but is administered at the local level by quasi-governmental public housing authorities (PHAs). Section 8 vouchers are rental subsidies that low-income families use in the private market to help make up the difference between their rent and their expected contribution toward that rent (30% of adjusted income). The cost of a voucher to a PHA is the difference between the lesser of a tenant's actual rent or the maximum subsidy level set by the PHA\u2014called a payment standard\u2014and 30% of a tenant's income. That cost increases or decreases with changes in tenant incomes and changes in rents and payment standards.

Despite the fact that they received full funding, few PHAs were able to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers. Low utilization rates were a major concern of Congress for several years. While PHAs are expected to have utilization rates of at least 95%, in FY2000 and FY2001, national voucher utilization rates were just over 91%. Since PHAs were not utilizing all of their vouchers, they typically had low budget utilization as well, meaning that they had more money in their budgets than they needed, and they rarely had to dip into their one-month program reserves, even if their costs rose significantly. At the end of the year, HUD and each PHA would reconcile their budgets, and HUD was typically able to recapture excess funds from PHAs' reserves.", "HUD generally used this same formula\u2014last year's actual costs, plus an inflation, times the number of authorized vouchers\u2014each year to determine how much funding to request from Congress for the renewal of tenant-based Section 8 vouchers. HUD would also make available to Congress for rescission those unused funds that the agency had recaptured from PHAs. The end result of this system for PHAs was that their funding increased along with their costs. If their costs dropped, they were permitted to use some of their excess funds to create new vouchers, a process called maximized leasing. The end result of this system for Congress was that each year it provided more funds for voucher renewals than PHAs could reasonably be expected to use, and then recaptured those unused funds the following year to offset the cost of that year's appropriation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2003-FY2006: The Emergence of \"Budget-Based\" Funding", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FY2003 Funding Changes", "paragraphs": ["In FY2003, Congress changed the way PHAs were funded in an attempt to limit recaptures of unspent funds and provide funding levels that better reflected actual use.

The notice stated that PHAs could appeal to the Secretary only if they could document that rental costs in their areas had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. The notice proved controversial. Some housing advocates contended that Congress gave HUD the authority to use a broader measure of inflation than the AAF, taking into account not just rental costs but also other changes in PHAs' costs, such as utility costs and changes in their tenant populations. The notice was not modified, and on August 31, 2004, HUD granted the appeals requests of 380 agencies out of approximately 400 that applied, distributing a total of $160 million from the Central Reserve.

If a PHA's May-July data were not available, HUD was directed to fund the agency based on February-April 2004 data, or if these data were not available, to fund the PHA based on its most recently submitted year-end financial statement, as of March 31, 2004. If the amount provided in the law was insufficient to fund all PHA budgets under this formula, then the Secretary was directed to prorate agency budgets. According to the conference report ( H.Rept. 108-792 ), PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, regardless of their actual costs. The report also stated that \"HUD shall provide agencies with flexibility to adjust payment standards and portability policies as necessary to manage within their 2005 budgets.\" Agency reserves were reduced from the one-month to the one-week level and no Central Reserve was provided to replenish depleted reserves. Finally, the act continued the prohibition on maximized leasing.", "The FY2005 appropriations act made another important change to the way that PHAs received their voucher renewal funding. Rather than funding PHAs for the federal fiscal year (October 1, 2004-September 30, 2005), the act funded PHAs for the calendar year (January 1, 2005-December 30-2005). The accounting change allowed for some one-time budget authority savings in the appropriations process. As a result, PHAs had to alter the way in which they budget for their voucher programs to a calendar-year cycle.", "HUD published guidance implementing these provisions on December 8, 2004 (HUD Notice PIH 2005-1). Agencies received notification of their preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004. At that time, PHAs were directed to inform HUD of any data errors within 10 days (although the deadline was later extended). The appeals were limited to data errors; agencies were told that they could not appeal the actual formula used for calculating their budgets. The final calculations, including a final proration factor, were published on January 21, 2005. Agencies were funded generally at 4.03% less than their May-July 2004 actual cost and utilization levels, plus the 2005 AAF.

This number hides a wide variance; the change at the fifth percentile was a decrease of 12% and the change at the 95 th percentile was an increase of 14%. On February 25, 2005, HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9, entitled \"[PHA] Flexibility to Manage the Housing Choice Voucher Program in 2005.\" It identified administrative options available to PHAs to lower their costs in 2005. Suggestions included lowering payment standards; reducing utility assistance to families; restricting portability; reviewing rents to ensure they are reasonable in the market; suspending the reissuance of vouchers when families leave the program; restricting bedroom sizes; instituting minimum rents; monitoring income eligibility more strictly; and terminating assistance to families due to insufficient funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2006 Funding Formula", "paragraphs": ["The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-115 ) distributed renewal funding using roughly the same formula as FY2005.

The act provided the Secretary with $45 million to adjust the budgets of agencies in two categories: (1) those for whom the May-July period used as the basis for CY2005 funding represented unusually low leasing or costs and who applied to the Secretary for an adjustment; and (2) those whose costs had risen due to unforeseen circumstances or portability billings.

Instead, the law adopted a formula based on how much funding PHAs were using (similar to the formula enacted in FY2004), rather than a formula based on how much funding PHAs had received in the previous year. Specifically, in FY2007, PHAs received funding based on their leasing and cost data from their most recent 12 months of reported data, adjusted for the first-time renewal of tenant protection and HOPE VI vouchers and vouchers reserved for project-based contracts, inflated by the AAF, and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. The law included a central reserve fund which the Secretary could use (1) for adjustments for PHAs that experienced a significant increase in renewal costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances or from voucher portability; and (2) for adjustments for public housing agencies experiencing a significant decrease in voucher funding, due to the formula shift, that could result in a loss of voucher units. The act continued the prohibition on over-leasing.", "P.L. 110-28 , an emergency supplemental funding bill, later amended the formula to provide exceptions for three categories of PHAs. First, certain Hurricane Katrina-affected agencies were funded on the basis of the higher of what they would have received under the FY2007 formula or what they received in FY2006. Second, agencies that would have lost funding under the FY2007 formula and had been placed under receivership within the prior 24 months were funded on the basis of the higher amount they received in FY2006. Third, agencies that spent more in FY2006 than their FY2006 allocations plus their unspent voucher and administrative fee balances were funded on the basis of what they received in FY2006.", "Under the FY2007 formula change, PHAs (except for those noted above) were funded based on the amount of funding they were using in FY2006, rather than the amount of funding they received in FY2006.

However, the funding provided was sufficient to fund all PHAs at more than 105% of their eligibility.

While PHAs had accumulated large reserves during the budget-based formula days of 2005 and 2006, by the end of FY2009, much of those reserves had been spent down as a result of the rescissions enacted in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs, which remained relatively flat in CY2005 and CY2006, began rising again in CY2007, continued through CY2008 and CY2009, and were anticipated to continue rising in CY2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Reform Proposals", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, some Members of Congress from both parties have introduced voucher reform legislation containing statutory changes to the voucher renewal funding formula, generally similar to the cost and utilization based formulas contained in recent appropriations acts. However, it is important to note that even if a new funding formula were to be adopted through the authorizing process, the Appropriations Committees could override the formula by adopting a different allocation formula in the annual appropriations act, as they have each year since FY2003. It is unclear whether the Appropriations Committees would defer to the authorizing committees in this circumstance. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary and Policy Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Prior to FY2003, the Section 8 voucher program was funded much like an entitlement program; the amount provided by Congress was largely determined by a formula, limiting Congress's ability to constrain funding without facing the prospect of reducing the number of vouchers and providing little incentive for PHAs to restrain costs. In response to concern about inefficient funding allocations, as well as, later, rising costs, and in an attempt to obtain greater control over future cost growth, Congress enacted a series of funding changes, beginning with those enacted for FY2003. These changes resulted in a conversion of the program's funding structure into one more similar to other discretionary programs, in which grantees received an annual fixed sum of money, regardless of changes in their costs or the number of people served. While these changes gave Congress greater control over the program's budget, many PHAs argued the changes made the program more difficult to administer. PHAs have only limited control over their costs since the value of the subsidies provided to families is statutorily set (as roughly the difference between rent and 30% of income).", "In areas where they did have control, such as in setting payment standards, selecting families from the waiting list, and issuing vouchers, many PHAs made changes. Some lowered their payment standards from 110% to 100% or less of local fair market rents. Since changes in payment standards only affect future families in the program, some PHAs undertook rent reasonableness reviews and reduced rents paid to landlords, some of whom accepted the cut, others of whom chose to no longer participate in the program. PHAs had the option of selecting higher-income families from their waiting lists (for whom subsidy costs are lower), although PHAs were still constrained by a requirement that 75% of all vouchers be targeted to the lowest-income families. Many PHAs intentionally reduced their utilization rates by not reissuing vouchers when families left the program. Agencies that intentionally lowered their utilization rates in order to save money in FY2004 likely encountered problems in FY2005, as their budgets were capped at their costs and utilization rates as of the third quarter of FY2004. It is likely that, at least for some PHAs whose costs had risen faster than their funding under the new formula, these changes resulted in fewer households receiving vouchers.", "Data from HUD indicate that voucher costs leveled off and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. According to CRS analysis of HUD data, average voucher costs declined by around 1.5% and average utilization declined by over 2% during that period. At the same time, some agencies were receiving more money than they were legally permitted to spend. Under the budget-based funding formulas in place in FY2005 and FY2006, PHAs' funding did not necessarily decrease if their costs decreased (for example, due to changes in the types of families served or changes in the rental market). Since maximized leasing was prohibited, some PHAs had funds that they were not permitted to spend, even if they had waiting lists for vouchers in their communities (7% of all PHAs had unusable funds, as of September 2006, according to CRS analysis).", "The budget-based funding formula changes enacted through FY2006 were controversial with low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. Most low-income housing advocates called for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula. PHA advocacy groups were vocal about the difficult predicament they felt that the current formula put them in, given the statutory constraints under which they run their programs.", "The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the one that was in place when the changes first began. In FY2007, PHAs were funded based on the amount of funding they were using in the previous year, rather than the amount of money they had received in the previous year. As a result, PHAs that had large funding surpluses were eligible for less funding in FY2007, although funding for the program was sufficient to provide all PHAs with over 105% of their formula eligibility, meaning PHAs could continue to serve at least all of the families they had been serving, and additional families, as long as they were not overleasing. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas followed the FY2007 formula closely, although they included reductions in the budgets of agencies that had more reserve funding than they were legally permitted to spend, paired with rescissions. These rescissions and offsets made unusable funding usable, and reduced the amount of appropriations needed to fund the program. The FY2010 and FY2011 formulas were similar to the FY2009 formula, except without a reduction related to reserves. In FY2012, again, agency reserves were used to offset the cost of renewals. ", "Now that the strictly \"budget-based\" funding model has been replaced with a cost and utilization-based model, PHAs again have an incentive to increase their utilization and spend all of their funding. As a result, costs and utilization have begun rising again. Since costs and utilization are rising, so is the cost of the program to Congress. As in FY2003 and FY2004, these rising costs could put pressure on policy makers to find ways to again contain costs in the program. Past cost containment strategies have been effective at reducing costs, but have also led to a reduction in the number of families served, and accumulations of unspent and unusable funds. Policy makers wishing to pursue future cost containment strategies may want to tailor policies that attempt to maintain a level of service to families, while minimizing the accumulation of unspent funds. Section 8 voucher reform legislation has proposed formula changes designed to maximize the number of families served, but not necessarily to firmly cap future cost growth. Further, even if such legislation is enacted, it could be overridden by future appropriations legislation."], "subsections": []}]}}
