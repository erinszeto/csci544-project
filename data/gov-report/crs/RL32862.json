This \"Lugar-Biden\" legislation codified the existence and functions of S/CRS and authorized new operational capabilities within the State Department, a Civilian Response Corps (CRC) of government employees with an active and a standby component, and a reserve component. Earlier, in 2004, the George W. Bush Administration had stood up S/CRS to address long-standing concerns, both within Congress and the broader foreign policy community, over the perceived lack of the appropriate capabilities and processes to deal with transitions from conflict to stability. These capabilities and procedures include adequate planning mechanisms for stabilization and reconstruction operations, efficient interagency coordination structures and procedures in carrying out such tasks, and appropriate civilian personnel for many of the non-military tasks required.", "From July 2004, S/CRS worked to establish the basic concepts, mechanisms, and capabilities necessary to carry out such operations. With a staff that slowly grew from a few dozen to well over 100 individuals, S/CRS took steps to monitor and plan for potential conflicts, to develop a rapid-response crisis management \"surge\" capability, to improve interagency and international coordination, to develop interagency training exercises, and to help State Department regional bureaus develop concepts and proposals for preventive action.", "Not until four years later, in 2008, did Congress provide the first funding to establish civilian response capabilities, as well as the first line-item funding for S/CRS. The Bush Administration plans at that point contemplated a CRC force of 4,250, including a sizable reserve component of private citizens similar in concept to the U.S. military reserve. The Obama Administration proceeded with plans and funding requests to develop S/CRS and its operational arm, the CRC. The 111th Congress provided funding to expand the active and standby units, but not to establish the civilian reserve. The 111th Congress also established a new USAID Complex Crises Fund (CCF) to support programs and activities responding to emerging or unforeseen complex crises abroad. The 112th Congress continued to fund S/CRS and its successor, the CSO Bureau, as well as the CCF, although at reduced levels.", "As background for the 113th Congress's possible consideration of civilian capabilities, this report covers their development through the formation of the CSO Bureau.

Senator Richard G. Lugar and former Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. provided the impetus to establish it in permanent law.

This concern grew from U.S. military operations in Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, and elsewhere, where military forces were tasked with a variety of state-building tasks, such as creating justice systems, assisting police, and promoting governance. With the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, consensus increased that the United States must develop adequate civilian organizational structures, procedures, and personnel to respond effectively to post-conflict and other \"stabilization and reconstruction\" (S&R) situations. ", "The George W. Bush Administration launched several initiatives to do just that. The centerpiece of its efforts was the establishment of the S/CRS in the Office of the Secretary of State. Created in mid-2004, S/CRS was tasked with designing, and in some cases establishing, the new structures within the State Department and elsewhere that would allow civilian agencies to develop effective policies, processes, and personnel to build stable and democratic states. Among other tasks, S/CRS developed plans for the creation of a civilian \"surge\" capability that could respond rapidly to S&R emergencies. ", "In the early months of the Obama Administration, Administration officials signaled their support for civilian S&R capabilities. In her January 2009 confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton mentioned the State Department's new S&R responsibilities, citing a department need to demonstrate competence and secure funding to carry them out. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, while serving in that position under former President George W. Bush, urged the development of civilian capabilities in major speeches. As Senator, Vice President Joseph Biden was the co-sponsor, with Senator Lugar, of legislation, first introduced in 2004, to create an office within the State Department that would coordinate U.S. government S&R operations and deploy civilian government employees and private citizens to carry out state-building activities in crises abroad. ", "In its second session, the 110 th Congress enacted legislation that \"operationalized\" certain groups of personnel within the Department of State and other federal agencies for S&R efforts by authorizing the creation of federal civilian \"response\" units, as well as the creation of a volunteer S&R civilian reserve force, akin to the military reserve force. This legislation advanced the work of previous Congresses regarding Bush Administration initiatives to improve the conduct of (S&R) efforts. With the passage in September 2008 of Title XVI of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 ( S. 3001 / P.L. 110-417 , known as the Lugar-Biden bill after its sponsors), signed into law October 14, 2008, Congress established S/CRS as part of permanent law. This law formally \"operationalized\" certain units in civilian federal agencies, most particularly the State Department; it expanded the State Department's functions to include effecting change through the deployment of \"on-the-ground\" personnel and programs dedicated to promoting security and stability in transitions from conflict and post-conflict situations. This was accomplished by authorizing the creation of a two component \"readiness response\" corps consisting of a small active unit of federal employees drawn from several agencies and a federal standby unit, and a large civilian reserve corps, analogous to the military reserve. ", "The State Department's December 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Defense Review (QDDR), with its broad reform agenda for State Department and USAID structures and activities, addressed potential changes to S/CRS, the response corps, and the reserves. The QDDR proposed reorganizing the structures to enhance the State Department's ability to develop and implement policy to address crises, conflict, and stability, including endowing an expanded version of S/CRS's mandate and capabilities in a new Bureau for Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The Obama Administration put some of the QDDR proposals into action when it established the CSO Bureau.

Bush's pledge, articulated in his February 2, 2005, State of the Union address, \"to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own cultures\" cast the once-discredited concept of building or rebuilding government institutions, economies, and civic cultures in a new light. During the 1990s, many policymakers considered the establishment of new institutions in troubled countries to be an overly expensive, if not futile exercise. The use of U.S. military forces for such activities, particularly in the first half of the decade, was troubling to many Members. The Bush Administration, in response to concerns about the threats posed by weak and fragile states, reframed both U.S. security and international development policy and initiated dramatic corresponding changes in U.S. governmental structures and practices. These changes, the Bush Administration argued, would enable the United States to perform such tasks more efficiently and at a lesser cost, particularly in transitions from conflict and in post-conflict situations.", "A key component of these changes was the establishment and reinforcement of new civilian structures and forces, in particular S/CRS and the civilian response/reserve corps. The Bush Administration made these new civilian entities a prominent feature in two initiatives: the National Security Presidential Directive 44 (NSPD-44) of December 2005 on the management of interagency reconstruction and stabilization operations and the \"transformational diplomacy\" reorganization of State Department personnel and practices announced in January 2006.", "These initiatives were intended to enhance the United States' ability to function effectively on the world scene in the environment created by the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Soon after 9/11, many analysts began to predict that the greatest threats to U.S. security often would emerge within states that are either too weak to police their territory or lack the political will or capacity to do so. To respond to those threats with a new \"whole-of-government\" approach, in 2006 former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice outlined a new U.S. foreign policy strategy focusing on the \"intersections of diplomacy, democracy promotion, economic reconstruction and military security\" and involving extensive changes in government to carry that strategy out. State-building (or nation-building as it is often called) was at the center of this strategy. Both initiatives reinforced the important role that the Bush Administration gave S/CRS in policymaking and implementation dealing with conflict transitions and weak and fragile states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Evolving Perceptions of Post-Conflict Needs5", "paragraphs": ["The creation of S/CRS in July 2004 responded to increasing calls for the improvement of U.S. civilian capabilities to plan and carry out post-conflict state-building operations. Several factors combined after 9/11 to lead many analysts to conclude that such operations were vital to U.S. security and that the United States must reorganize itself to conduct them effectively, in particular by creating new and improving existing civilian institutions to carry them out. Foremost among these factors, for many analysts, was the widespread perception after 9/11 that global instability directly threatened U.S. security and that U.S. interests would be served by transforming weak and failing states into stable, democratic ones. Related to this was the expectation that responding to the threat of instability will require the United States and the international community to intervene periodically in foreign conflicts with \"peacekeeping\" and \"stabilization\" forces at about the same intensive pace as it had done since the early 1990s. Because that pace stressed the U.S. military, many policymakers believed that the United States should create and enhance civilian capabilities to carry out the peacebuilding tasks that are widely viewed as necessary for stability and reconstruction in fragile, conflict-prone, and post-conflict states. Finally, numerous analyses distilling years of experience with multifaceted peacekeeeping and peacebuilding operations (subsequently also referred to as post-conflict operations or stabilization and reconstruction, or S&R missions), raised hopes that rapid, comprehensive, and improved peacebuilding efforts could significantly raise the possibilities of achieving sustainable peace.", "The perception that international terrorism could exploit weak, unstable states convinced many policymakers and analysts of the need to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities to foster security, good governance and economic development, especially in post-conflict situations. The 9/11 Commission and the Commission on Weak States and U.S. National Security found that weak states, as well as unsuccessful post-conflict transitions, pose a threat to U.S. security. These groups argued that such states often experience economic strife and political instability that make them vulnerable to drug trafficking, human trafficking, and other criminal enterprises, and to linkage with non-state terrorist groups (such as the links between the previous Taliban government in Afghanistan and the Al Qaeda terrorist network). Weak states also are unprepared to handle major public health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, that can generate political and economic instability. These commissions, and other analysts, argued for assistance to the governments of weak states and of post-conflict transitions regimes to help them control their territories, meet their citizens' basic needs, and create legitimate governments based on effective, transparent institutions.", "These and other studies perceived a need to enhance U.S. government structures and capabilities for conducting post-conflict operations. Although differing in several respects, the studies largely agreed on five points: (1) the ad hoc system needed to be replaced with a permanent mechanism for developing contingency plans and procedures for joint civil-military operations led by civilians; (2) mechanisms to rapidly deploy U.S. civilian government and government-contracted personnel needed to be put in place; (3) preventive action needed to be considered; (4) the U.S. government needed to enhance multinational capabilities to carry out post-conflict security tasks and to better coordinate international aid; and (5) flexible funding arrangements were needed to deal with such situations. In addition, some urged substantial amounts of funding for flexible U.S. and international accounts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Proposals for New Civilian Forces", "paragraphs": ["A prominent feature of several of the reports on stabilization and reconstruction operations was a recommendation to develop rapidly deployable civilian forces to undertake state-building functions, particularly those related to rule of law, even before hostilities had ceased. Many analysts view the early deployment of rule of law personnel as essential to providing security from the outset of an operation, which they argue will enhance the possibilities for long-term stability and democracy in an intervened or post-conflict country. Many view the development of civilian groups to do so as permitting the earlier withdrawal of military personnel than would otherwise be possible.", "The concept of a cohesive, rapidly deployable unit of civilian experts for stabilization and reconstruction operations dates back at least to the Clinton Administration. In PDD-71, which dealt with strengthening criminal justice systems in peace operations, the Clinton Administration identified such an initiative as a high priority, according to the PDD-71 White Paper. Six studies between 2003 and 2005 endorsed the creation of cohesive, rapidly deployable units of civilian experts for stabilization and reconstruction operations. These include a 2003 report of the National Defense University (NDU); a March 2004 report of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS); an April 2004 report of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP); a book by a USIP analyst; and the Defense Science Board 2004 Summer Study on transitions from hostilities.

Two think-tank studies published in January 2006 disputed the concept that weak and failed states are per se among the most significant threats to the United States. They pointed out that weak states are not the only locations where terrorists have found recruits or sought safe-haven, as they have exploited discontent and operated in developed countries as well. A report of the Center for Global Development stated that many factors beyond the weakness or lack of government institutions\u2014demographic, political, religious, cultural, and geographic\u2014contribute to the development of terrorism. As a result, they argued, an emphasis on weak and failed states could lead the United States to give short shrift to more tangible threats and to areas of greater U.S. interest. The CATO Institute study worried that former Secretary Rice's focus on promoting \"responsible sovereignty\" as an underpinning of transformational diplomacy could provide potential justification for eroding the current international norm of respect for national sovereignty, leading the United States into fruitless interventions.", "In addition, some analysts were skeptical that the problems of weak and failed states could be dealt with through military and political interventions aimed at creating viable government institutions. The effectiveness of past efforts continues to be a subject of debate, with differing views on the criteria for and the number of successes, draws, and failures, as is the best means to achieve success.", "There has been skepticism that state-building efforts will result in success in most instances. In the words of one scholar, \"barring exceptional circumstances (the war against the Taliban after 9/11), we had best steer clear of missions that deploy forces (of whatever kind) into countries to remake them anew.... The success stories (Germany, Japan) are the exceptions and were possible because of several helpful conditions that will not be replicated elsewhere.\" Others, however, point to cases such as Mozambique and El Salvador as examples that state-building efforts can promote peace after civil strife."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Creating Civilian Reconstruction and Stabilization Capabilities: Congressional and Executive Actions, 2004-2007", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The \"Lugar-Biden\" Legislation", "paragraphs": ["On February 25, 2004, Senators Lugar and Biden introduced the Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 \"to build operational readiness in civilian agencies.\" (At the time, these Senators were respectively the chairman and ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [SFRC].)

Although \"Section 1207\" authority was repeatedly extended, Congress allowed it to expire at the end of FY2010. ", "Similarly, defense appropriators signaled their expectation that DOD's Section 1207 funding would not be provided for another year. In their report on the FY2010 Department of Defense Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-118 , H.Rept. 111-380 ), conferees recommended an allocation of $97.09 million (from the overall Defense Security Cooperation Agency appropriation), but stated that the establishment of the Complex Crises Fund \"will enable USAID and the Department of State to meet emergent requirements that fall under their purview without relying on the Department of Defense.\" Nevertheless, they argued for continued DOD participation in the planning process for small-scale security and stabilization projects, directing the Secretaries of Defense and State and the Director of USAID \"to maintain and strengthen the interagency process created from the section 1207 program when formulating, reviewing, and approving future projects that would have been funded through section 1207.\" ", "In creating the Complex Crises Fund, conferees on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ) urged the State Department and USAID to develop additional capacity in order to replace Section 1207 DOD funding with additional Complex Crises funding. \"USAID and the Department of State should continue to establish and bolster crisis prevention and response capabilities in order to assume most, if not all, of the functions currently funded\" by DOD under Section 1207 authority, they wrote. Much like the defense appropriations conferees, the foreign operations conferees also specified that \"USAID and the Departments of State and Defense shall continue to consult on the formulation and implementation of stabilization and security assistance, as appropriate, whether through the utilization of section 1207 or funds appropriated by this Act.\" ", "As noted above, the Administration requested $100 million for the CCF from the FY2011 budget, stating that this will replace funding previously provided under Section 1207 authority. The FY2011 continuing resolutions through March 4 and March 18, 2011, provided FY2011 funding for the CCF at the $50 million FY2010 level, but the final FY2011 appropriations bill provided no CCF funding. FY2012 appropriations for the CCF totaled $40 million: $10 million in the core account in $30 million in OCO funds.

A roster system would be quite different from the original proposal for a civilian reserve akin to the U.S. military reserve (which encompasses the National Guard).", "Plans for a reserve corps were part of the initial 2004 Lugar-Biden civilian stabilization capability legislation (Title XVI, P.L. 110-417 ), embraced by the Bush Administration. In his January 23, 2007, State of the Union address, former President Bush pointed to the need for a civilian reserve corps as a tool in the generational struggle against terrorism. \"Such a corps would function much like our military reserve,\" he said. \"It would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them. It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time.\" ", "In 2008, Congress provided authorization for the establishment of a Civilian Reserve Corps ( P.L. 110-417 , see above) that could substitute for military troops in a wide variety of state-building activities. The Bush Administration's 2008 CSI proposal called for the establishment of a CRC reserve component of 2,000; the Obama Administration's 2009 CSI proposal called for the same. ", "Nevertheless, Congress did not provide funds to establish a civilian reserve. In considering the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2010 ( H.R. 3081 and S. 1434 ), House and Senate appropriators denied the Obama Administration's request for funding for the CSI reserve component. In their respective reports ( H.Rept. 111-187 and S.Rept. 111-44 ), both committees indicated their desire for a gradual build-up of the civilian response corps components, with the focus now on the active and standby components.", "Proponents of the creation of a civilian reserve corps have cited a variety of advantages from the creation of such a corps. DOD promoted the concept on the grounds that it would free military personnel from state-building tasks during military operations, thus increasing the personnel available for combat and other more strictly military tasks. Proponents also view such a corps as a means to enhance prospects for success in S&R operations, as the personnel who would be sent to perform such tasks would in general have a much higher level of expertise and depth of experience than soldiers and could, unlike many military personnel assigned to such tasks, perform at peak efficiency from the outset. Many view this as particularly true at the national level, where extensive experience with developing national-level structures is desirable over the long run. (Although military Civil Affairs officers are largely reservists whose civilian jobs are relevant to state-building tasks, many analysts state that there are too few civil affairs personnel to provide the depth needed to deploy the appropriate person in most circumstances.) Many argue that civilian personnel are also preferable for symbolic reasons, as they may signal a greater commitment to the construction of a democratic state.", "Skeptics look at the concept of a civilian reserve as untested and potentially unfeasible. Some wonder whether qualified experts would sign up in sufficient quantities to make the corps an effective replacement for military troops in S&R operations. Some question whether the existence of such a corps would provide an incentive to interventions of various types that the United States otherwise would not have undertaken. ", "Cost may well have been a major factor in the decision to switch to a roster system. In 2008, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assembled a cost estimate for the Bush Administration's CSI. Its estimate for the recruiting, screening, enrolling, training, and equipping the 2,000 members contemplated by the CSI was $87 million in FY2009 and $47 million in 2010. (The CBO estimate of first-year costs is considerably higher than the Obama Administration's $63.6 million FY2010 request to establish the reserve.) Although some may view the potential cost of the civilian corps as high, some proponents argue that the costs of deploying civilian personnel would result in a net savings to the military. (It is likely, however, that any possible savings would depend on the circumstances in which such civilian personnel were deployed and the effect of their deployment on the number of military personnel needed.) Proponents also maintain that even if high, the monetary cost to maintain and deploy civilian reservists would still be relatively inexpensive when compared to the multiple costs, both tangible (such as money and lives) and intangible (such as domestic and international political support and loss of strategic leverage) of prolonged or failed military interventions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "QDDR Proposal to Establish an Expert Corps Roster", "paragraphs": ["The QDDR proposed replacing the reserve with \"a more cost-effective 'Expert Corps' consisting of an active roster of technical experts.\" According to the QDDR, this Expert Corps roster could be composed of current temporary hires who have served successfully in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere, as well as other civilians with critical skills who have not been previously deployed. Other countries, such as Canada and Germany, and international organizations, such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, use roster systems for civilian deployments to nation-building and post-conflict missions.", "The roster concept is substantially different from the CSI concept of a reserve corps modeled after the military reserves and National Guard. Under that concept, a reserve component of more than 2,000 members, civilians from outside government with various types of expertise, would be in reserve status for four years with a required deployment of up to one year. Unlike the concept for a reserve corps, roster members would not be obligated to deploy to critical conflict zones. However, neither would roster members be provided with re-employment rights, as was contemplated for reserve corps members. ", "The QDDR stated that the Administration would request funding and needed authorities for the Expert Corps. The Administration expected the roster to be less costly than the more elaborate reserve corps. According to the QDDR, the budget would support actual deployments, rather than support and maintenance for a large reserve. Still, some costs, such as equipment acquisition, might remain. And while some savings would most likely accrue from eliminating benefits such as pensions and from the costs of an intensive training regime, some analysts might argue that certain benefits, such as health coverage, should be offered to recruit quality personnel, and that a good training program is essential to effective performance."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
