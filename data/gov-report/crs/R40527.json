Consumer attention and concern were roused by several well-publicized national recalls of various toys and children's products.

The CPSC also has jurisdiction over amusement rides that are not permanently fixed to a site but rather are part of a travelling carnival or show, but does not have jurisdiction over rides that are permanently fixed to a particular site. Furthermore, the CPSC has no jurisdiction to regulate a particular consumer product if the risk of injury associated with that product could be eliminated or sufficiently reduced by actions taken under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (the Energy Research and Development Administration [now Department of Energy] and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission), or under the Clean Air Act (the Environmental Protection Agency).

Until a third-party testing requirement takes effect for a safety standard applying to children's products, a general conformity certification applies to that safety standard. The certification requirement applies to products manufactured on or after November 12, 2008. The third-party testing and certification requirements take effect at different times, on a rolling basis. Both types of certification are required of either the manufacturer (domestic product) or importer (imported product), not of a retailer or distributor.", "The CPSIA added a requirement that the certificates must ''accompany'' each product or shipment of products subject to the certification requirements and be ''furnished'' to each distributor or retailer of the product. In addition, a copy of the certificate must be ''furnished'' to the CPSC upon request.

Aside from the CPSA, these include the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and the Refrigerator Safety Act, miscellaneous statutes providing for specific safety standards. The certification must assert compliance with all standards that apply to a product and must be based on a test of each product or on a reasonable testing program. The manufacturer or importer may conduct the test in-house and is not required to have testing done by a third-party/independent laboratory. The manufacturer or importer may determine for itself what constitutes a reasonable testing program.

The CPSC has not prescribed what constitutes a reasonable testing program for the any of the new standards under the CPSIA.", "The CPSIA did not establish the general conformity certification requirement, but expanded the certification requirement's scope to all safety standards under all statutes enforced by the CPSC. Previously, the requirement only applied to safety standards under the CPSA. Because of the expanded scope of this requirement and the new safety standards under the CPSIA, products that previously were not subject to this requirement now are, to the surprise of some manufacturers and importers. The CPSIA also added products imported for consumption and warehousing to the list of products requiring general conformity certification. Previously, any products imported for distribution in commerce were subject to general conformity certification; products imported directly by the end consumer or imported for holding/storage in a warehouse (not for distribution and sales) did not require general conformity certification.

As noted in the previous section, for the general conformity certification, determining and assuring compliance with safety standards was largely left up to the manufacturer or importer. The Senate report for S. 2045 , the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act of 2007 (originally the Senate counterpart to H.R. 4040 which became the CPSIA), noted that \"the [new third-party testing and] certification requirement would likely impose new costs on all manufacturers of children's products since currently manufacturers either self-certify or do not certify products at all.\"", "However, under the CPSIA, a manufacturer and/or importer must certify compliance of children's products with applicable safety standards based on testing by accredited third-party laboratories. Testing may be done by in-house, proprietary laboratories of a manufacturer only under certain conditions, such as firewalling (insulation and independence from influence and direction of the manufacturer concerning testing) and appropriate accreditation. The CPSIA required the CPSC to issue accreditation requirements for such laboratories and maintain a list of accredited laboratories and set deadlines by which the CPSC was required to publish accreditation requirements based on the type of product being tested by the laboratory. Specific, staggered deadlines for publication of accreditation requirements were established for the testing of lead paint (September 13, 2008, but actually published September 22, 2008), cribs and pacifiers (October 13, 2008, but actually published October 22, 2008), small parts (November 12, 2008, but actually published November 17, 2008), children's metal jewelry (December 12, 2008, but actually published December 22, 2008), and baby bouncers/walkers/jumpers (due March 12, 2009, but not published). The staggered deadlines facilitated gradual phasing in of the new requirements.

The accreditation guidelines and testing and certification requirements have not been published nor implemented for baby bouncers/walkers/jumpers, apparently because the CPSC would have to issue guidelines in accordance with current regulations that are outdated and are not being followed instead of being able to issue guidelines in accordance with up-to-date voluntary standards recognized by the CPSC.

There is no stay of enforcement for certification and testing that had already been implemented or for which the accreditation guidelines had already been published as of the date of the stay.

The CPSC's rules for requesting and determining such exemptions requires its Office of Hazard Identification and Reduction (EXHR) to make an initial recommendation within 30 calendar days, to \"the extent practicable\" or to request an extension from the Executive Director of the CPSC. The rule does not specify any timeline for a final decision by the CPSC and provides that the filing of an exclusion request does not stay the lead standard or related certification or other requirements for the subject of the request pending a final decision by the CPSC. The exclusion request must include the best-available, objective, peer-reviewed, scientific evidence that is unfavorable to the request and that is reasonably available to the requestor, as well as evidence that supports the request. Any initial decision of the CPSC to grant an exclusion request, whether upon or against the initial recommendation of the EXHR, shall be published in the Federal Register for comment. A requestor will be notified of an exclusion denial; an exclusion grant will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register.", "The lead content standards under the CPSIA shall not apply to any inaccessible component parts of a children's product.

Reasonably foreseeable use and abuse shall include to [sic], swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children's activities, and the aging of the product to a child during normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.\" Pursuant to the CPSIA, the CPSC has proposed an interpretative rule to provide guidance with respect to what product components or classes of components will be considered to be inaccessible. The preamble to the proposed rule describes an inaccessible component as one that is inside a product which a child cannot touch and that may be encased in material such as plastic, rubber, or metal. The CPSC sought comments as to whether fabric should be considered a barrier rendering lead inaccessible to a child; a final rule has not been issued, so it is unclear whether fabric will be included as a barrier. Inaccessibility would be determined by the manufacturer using existing use and abuse tests and accessibility probes required under current CPSC regulations.", "If the CPSC determines that it is not technologically feasible for certain electronic devices to comply with the lead standard, it must also issue requirements to minimize exposure or accessibility to lead in those devices.

Specifically, the CPSC concluded that allowing exclusions where \"no meaningful increase\" in lead levels in the human body could occur meant that exclusions would be permissible only in cases where the lead in a product or material will not result in the absorption of any lead into the human body. Thus, the CPSC implied that any exemption for metal parts of products such as ATVs, bicycles, and small motorcycles/dirt bikes may require legislation to amend the CPSIA's exemption language requiring zero absorption of lead by a person.", "Since the CPSC issued the final rule regarding the procedure for applying for and granting exclusions of noncompliant products from the standard or determinations that a material/product is inherently compliant, there have been several applications for exemption or determination. The CPSC has decided only one as of the date of this report, an application by several manufacturers and industry groups with regard to ATVs, which the CPSC denied. The exclusion was denied because metal parts of ATVs are not covered by the statutory exclusion language, consistent with the CPSC position asserted in the Federal Register notice for the final rule on the exclusion procedure. However, the CPSC announced in the Commissioners' statements accompanying the vote that the Commissioners and staff were working to develop a plan to stay enforcement of lead content standards as applied to ATVs.

It defines \"manufacturer\" as \"any person who manufactures or imports a consumer product\" and defines \"manufactured\" as \"to manufacture, produce, or assemble.\"", "The CPSC has asserted that it has no authority to stay the effective date of the actual safety standards for anyone; therefore, there has been no stay of safety standards for small businesses that might suffer a greater economic impact from the requirements of the CPSIA.", "However, pursuant to existing laws, the CPSC generally considers the needs of small businesses in promulgating regulatory standards pursuant.

Some of the petitions are pursuant to the preemption exemption under CPSIA \u00a7106, the toy standard provision.

The CPSC responded with letters explaining these issues, how they are being handled, and the CPSC's views regarding potential solutions, including any need for additional legislation. Relief from the deadlines imposed for CPSC action and increased agency discretion to grant exemptions are a couple of the proposed solutions that may entail legislation; component certification is one of the administrative solutions being studied by the CPSC. Additionally, business stakeholders, including manufacturers and second-hand resellers, have been vocal in demanding legislative action to resolve problems businesses perceive in the CPSIA and its implementation. Consumer advocates generally appear to be pleased with the CPSIA implementation, with the exception of the OGC memorandum permitting the continued sale of inventory that did not comply with the new phthalates standard. They acknowledge the implementation issues that have arisen and the exemptions permitted under the law and have urged the CPSC to issue appropriate guidance and take appropriate steps in its discretion to address these issues. They have also urged the President to appoint a new CPSC Chair.", "Some members have urged that hearings be held to consider implementation problems and whether legislation may be appropriate. The congressional committees with jurisdiction over the CPSC and consumer product safety issues have not yet held hearings with regard to CPSIA implementation issues, apparently preferring to wait for the appointment of a new CPSC Chair and to allow time for the CPSC to address and resolve such issues administratively to the extent feasible.
