The comprehensive law reauthorizes four expiring Food and Drug Administration (FDA) programs and expands the agency's authority to regulate the safety of prescription drugs and biologics, medical devices, and foods. Understanding the way in which FDAAA changed the law governing the agency informs policy discussions aimed at additional FDA reform and reorganization, as well as those related more broadly to the quality, availability, and cost of medical products in the health care system.", "At its core, FDAAA renews the authority for two key user fee programs that were set to expire on October 1, 2007: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA; P.L. 107-188) and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250). In FY2007, the year in which FDAAA was enacted, these programs accounted for 91% of FDA's user fee revenue and 18% of FDA's total budget. Without the reauthorizations, and absent a substantial increase in FDA's annual appropriations, the agency would have lost a significant amount of funding.", "In addition to user fee programs, FDAAA reauthorizes two other FDA authorities related to prescription drugs for pediatric populations, which were also due to expire on October 1, 2007: the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA; P.L. 107-109) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA; P.L. 108-155). These laws provide marketing exclusivity incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of drugs. FDAAA also contains provisions related to drug safety, pediatric medical devices, clinical trial databases, the creation of a new nonprofit entity to assist FDA with its mission, and food safety.", "This report presents a detailed summary of provisions in FDAAA. Each section of the report begins with background information about the FDA relevant to the passage of FDAAA and some references, if appropriate, to the two bills that formed its basis (S. 1082 and H.R. 2900), and a law that amended it (P.L. 110-316); describes FDAAA's contents; and analyzes how FDAAA changed the law.

The law reauthorizes four expiring Food and Drug Administration (FDA) programs and expands the agency's authority to ensure the safety of prescription drugs and biologics, medical devices, and foods. FDAAA represents the most comprehensive FDA legislation since the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA; P.L. 105-115 ).", "The primary impetus for the legislation was the renewal of FDA's authority for two key user fee programs that were set to expire at the end of FY2007: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA, last reauthorized in 2002; P.L. 107-188 ), and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA, enacted in 2002; P.L. 107-250 ). The law also reauthorizes two other expiring authorities, which are related to pediatric pharmaceuticals: the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA, last reauthorized in 2002; P.L. 107-109 ), and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA, enacted in 2002; P.L. 108-155 ).", "In addition to the reauthorizations, FDAAA contains several other FDA-related provisions. These include provisions designed to enhance drug safety, spark the development of pediatric medical devices, expand the types of trials and the substance of information in clinical trial databases, create a new nonprofit entity to assist FDA with its mission, improve food safety, and affect a number of other areas related to public health. Several of FDAAA's provisions contain the authorization to appropriate funding; these are listed in Appendix A . Many create additional responsibilities with deadlines for federal agency personnel; see Appendix B . In addition, several of the authorities have sunset dates in 2012 or early 2013; see Appendix C .", "FDAAA's impact on FDA is important to two ongoing policy discussions. One discussion centers around the possibility of additional legislation to refine or restructure the agency's regulatory role. Understanding current law, as amended by FDAAA, is a good starting point for any such discussion. The second discussion is that of medical products in the health care system. The agency plays a critical role in bringing medical products to market, which is described below. In performing that role, as refined by FDAAA, FDA's regulation of medical products affects their quality, availability, and cost within the health care system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Food and Drug Administration Basics", "paragraphs": ["The FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), regulates the safety of most human foods, all animal feeds, and certain other products such as cosmetics. The agency also regulates the safety and effectiveness of human drugs, biologics (e.g., vaccines), medical devices, and animal drugs. Those products regulated for effectiveness must be reviewed and approved by FDA before they can be placed in commerce, a process called premarket approval . (FDA is tasked with postmarket surveillance for these products as well.) Products regulated only for safety may enter commerce with little FDA oversight, though the agency may inspect production facilities and require that certain good manufacturing practices be carried out. FDA has the statutory authority to withdraw from commerce any product it regulates that it determines to be unsafe.", "Media coverage of issues related to the safety of food (e.g., spinach), drugs (e.g., Vioxx), and medical devices (e.g., cardiac stents) has brought congressional attention to FDA's performance and the funding it has available to carry out its statutory responsibilities. For those products requiring premarket approval, a central issue for Congress is how best to balance the need for the agency to help speed the products it regulates to market if they are safe and effective, and correct them, or keep them from entering or staying on the market, if they are not. For human foods, animal feeds, and other products not requiring premarket approval, key issues relate to FDA's ability to assure product safety and protect public health by preventing health threats from occurring, or by identifying and responding to problems quickly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Background: S. 1082 and H.R. 2900", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the introduction of H.R. 3580 , the bill enacted as FDAAA, each chamber of Congress had passed its own version of comprehensive FDA reauthorization and reform legislation. These were the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act ( S. 1082 ), and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 ( H.R. 2900 ). While most of the bills' provisions were similar, S. 1082 contained some provisions that were not present in H.R. 2900 on the topics of food safety, prescription drug importation, and domestic pet turtle market access. Of those, only the food safety provisions were adopted in FDAAA. See Table 1 for a listing of major topics covered in each bill."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report Roadmap", "paragraphs": ["The remaining sections of this report contain descriptions of the key FDA programs addressed in FDAAA. FDAAA includes eleven titles, each of which is discussed below in its own section of this report. Each section introduces the topic, surveys the ways in which new provisions changed the law, provides links to relevant CRS reports, and presents a detailed table comparing FDAAA-enacted provisions to any existing previous law. The one exception is Title X, Food Safety, which is described briefly in this report, but addressed in more detail in a separate CRS report. In the text and tables, the Commissioner means the FDA Commissioner, and the Secretary means the HHS Secretary. The report uses several other acronyms as well, all of which are spelled out at their first point of use and in Appendix D .", "For clarity, the tables comparing FDAAA with previous law have the following attributes. Table provisions are cited to their location in FDAAA. Where applicable, cites are also included for the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and the United States Code (USC). The USC citations vary in specificity to match the citations listed in FDAAA. When table text extends across previous and current law fields, this indicates one of two things. If an FDAAA cite is present, FDAAA is reauthorizing or restating portions of provisions identical to those of the prior law. If no FDAAA cite is present, a preexisting law interacts with and is fundamental to interpreting FDAAA, but has not been amended by it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Title I. Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007", "paragraphs": ["Title I of FDAAA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007 (referred to as PDUFA IV), provides a five-year extension of FDA's authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of drug and biological products and expands the authorized uses of fee revenue. User fee revenue has provided an increasing proportion of FDA funding since PDUFA was first enacted in 1992. In FY1994, the first year FDA noted PDUFA revenue use in its budget justification documents, the fees contributed 9.7% of the human drug program's budget. At the time of FDAAA's passage, the FY2007 budget showed that PDUFA fees made up 44.7% of the agency's human drug program budget.", "In the years leading to PDUFA's enactment in 1992, FDA, consumers, and manufacturers all sought to shorten the time between a manufacturer's submission of an application and the agency's decision on whether to approve the product. FDA lacked the funding for staff to review those products quickly. With PDUFA, Congress gave FDA a revenue source to supplement direct appropriations. Congress also structured PDUFA to restrict the use of collected funds to new product review, and established a mechanism for agency-industry collaboration to create performance goals that set targets, primarily for review times.", "PDUFA has had a range of effects. New application review times decreased from 29 months in 1987 to 17 months in 1994. PDUFA's restriction of the use of fee revenue to premarket review created what many saw as an imbalance between resources available to premarket and postmarket activities. In its 1997 and 2002 reauthorizations, Congress gave FDA limited authority to use some of the fees for postmarket safety activities.", "During 2004 discussions in preparation for PDUFA IV, several safety problems with aggressively marketed drugs\u2014such as Vioxx\u2014received wide publicity. This heightened the ongoing concern over the balance of attention between premarket review and postapproval safety monitoring. FDAAA reflects that increased focus on postapproval drug safety throughout, but especially in this title, described below, and in Title IX (Enhanced Authorities Regarding Postmarket Safety of Drugs), discussed later in this report.", "Title I of FDAAA addresses types of fees, authorized fee revenue, authorized uses of fees, new fees for the advisory review of direct-to-consumer television advertisements, reauthorization and report requirements, and effective dates, as summarized in the following material.", "Types of Fees. FDAAA reauthorizes the assessment, collection, and use of three types of fees from manufacturers of drugs and biological products. These are application fees, establishment fees, and product fees.", "Authorized Fee Revenue. FDAAA establishes fee revenues, for each fiscal year, of $392,783,000, with various adjustments for inflation, workload, rent and rent-related expenses, and final-year adjustments. Congress added to that base amount fee revenues for drug safety totaling $225 million over the five-year reauthorization.", "Authorized Uses of Fees. The new law expands the list of postmarket safety activities for which the fees could be used. These include developing and using adverse-event data-collection systems, including information technology systems; developing and using improved analytical tools to assess potential safety problems, including access to external data bases; and implementing and enforcing new FFDCA requirements relating to postapproval studies and clinical trials, labeling changes, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and adverse event reports and postmarket safety activities.", "FDAAA also removes the calendar and time limitations on postapproval activities. When Congress first allowed PDUFA revenue use on postmarket activities in 2002, it set a three-year limit from the time of a drug's approval.", "New Fees for Advisory Review of Advertisements. FDAAA creates a new user fee to support FDA's advisory review of prescription-drug television advertising. The program calls for a manufacturer to pay a fee if it voluntarily submits an advertisement for pre-dissemination review. The review is to be advisory. The law authorizes FDA to assess fees only on manufacturers that request such reviews. It further directs that if the Secretary has not received at least $11.25 million in fees by 120 days after enactment, the DTC advisory review user fee program shall not commence and all collected fees shall be refunded.", "Reauthorization and Report Requirements. FDAAA codifies certain core elements of the prescription drug user fee program that, although included in PDUFA I, II, and III, were never placed into the FFDCA. One is the requirement for annual performance and fiscal reports to Congress. The others relate to the Secretary's interaction and communication with various stakeholders. These include public hearings regarding the Secretary's negotiations with industry regarding performance goals; and the requirement that the Secretary, in preparation for the next PDUFA reauthorization, consult with congressional committees, scientific and academic experts, health-care professionals, representatives of patient and consumer advocacy groups, and the regulated industry to develop recommendations for PDUFA V, including goals and plans for meeting the goals.", "Effective Dates.

Congress initially gave the agency the authority to collect such fees in 2002, with the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250 ). MDUFMA established user fees for premarket applications (PMAs), premarket notifications (510(k)s), and other types of requests to market medical devices. The 2002 law incorporated, by reference, performance goals for many types of premarket device reviews. It also enabled third-parties to conduct establishment inspections, and added new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices.", "In FY2007, when FDAAA was enacted, medical device user fees generated $35,202,000. This represents an increase of 144.7% over the amount first collected in FY2003. In FY2007, devices user fees comprised 9.0% of the agency's user fee revenue, and 1.8% of its total budget.", "FDA's authority to collect medical device user fees was due to expire on October 1, 2007.

Fees Related to Medical Devices", "paragraphs": ["Subtitle A of MDUFA 2007 reauthorizes FDA's expiring authority to collect user fees through October 1, 2012, and makes certain other changes to MDUFMA. The primary change is that MDUFA 2007 adds three new types of user fees (annual establishment fees, registration fees, and 30-day fees). The first two are to be paid regularly by establishments with devices on the market, generating a predictable base of device user fee income for FDA. MDUFMA had only enabled the collection of fees for applications related to FDA's approval or clearance of a product, which the agency had noted made the agency's user fee income difficult to predict. This was because the number of applications could vary from year to year. The agency asserted that, by contrast, fees paid annually would result in a revenue stream that was more reliable. This move toward a more predictable funding stream mirrors the approach taken by PDUFA for drugs and biological products.", "MDUFA 2007 lowers the amounts of fees paid by device manufacturers for FY2008, and then includes a subsequent annual increase in fee amounts through FY2012. Despite the FY2008 decrease in the amounts of individual fee amounts, the total fee revenue generated will increase from FY2007 levels; revenue lost in reduced fee amounts will be offset by revenue generated by new types of fees.", "MDUFA 2007 changes some provisions relevant to specific types of fees. Both MDUFMA and MDUFA 2007 generally establish fee amounts for various types of activities by setting them as a proportion of the cost of submitting a PMA. The amount charged for a PMA is therefore also called the base fee . MDUFA 2007 strikes a provision that had required the Secretary to adjust the premarket notification fee amount annually in a unique way, instead it sets it, like other fees, as a percentage of the base fee amount. For a different fee, the FDAAA-created establishment fee, the law gives the Secretary the authority to increase the fee amount in FY2010 if too few manufacturers have paid it.", "MDUFA 2007 changes the law regarding reduced fees paid by small businesses in several ways. Under MDUFMA, entities qualifying as small businesses had certain fees waived and paid others at a reduced rate. MDUFA 2007 further reduces the fee amounts small businesses pay, removes a provision that the assets of partners and parent firms be considered in small business qualification, and enables foreign firms to qualify as small businesses.", "Regarding modular applications, those submitted to FDA in separate pieces, MDUFA 2007 for the first time also affords the possibility of refunds for applications withdrawn at different points.", "MDUFA 2007 extends a trigger requirement beyond FY2007 indefinitely. The trigger, which is designed to ensure that user fees supplement rather than supplant direct appropriations, requires that there be a certain amount of medical device-related direct appropriations in order for the Secretary to assess medical device user fees and be expected to meet performance goals.", "MDUFA 2007 amends a provision regarding the collection of fees in excess of the amount authorized. The previous law required that if fees collected for a fiscal year exceed the authorized appropriation, the excess would be subtracted from the subsequent year's authorization. By contrast, MDUFA 2007 allows excess fees to be carried over to cover shortfalls over the course of several years.", "MDUFA 2007 amends a provision describing how FDA may use the device fees it collects. The new provision in theory could have enabled fees to be expended on postmarket activites, but does not appear, in practice, to have done so. It states that fees will be dedicated toward expediting the process for the review of device applications and for assuring the safety and effectiveness of devices, as set forth in a letter from the Secretary to relevant congressional committees (\"Commitment Letter\"). It is conceivable that assuring the safety and effectiveness of devices could be interpreted to encompass postmarket surveillance, however the Commitment Letter does not list surveillance and enforcement activities. In addition, MDUFA 2007 maintains two separate MDUFMA provisions that articulate and generally limit the expenditure of user fee funds to premarket activities.", "MDUFA 2007 requires the Secretary to continue to file annual performance and fiscal reports through FY2012, and writes these report requirements into the FFDCA. The law also requires that the performance report include information on previous cohorts for which the Secretary had not given a complete response.", "In FDA's development of its performance goal recommendations to the Congress, MDUFA 2007 maintains MDUFMA's requirements that the agency consult with an array of groups, and take specified steps to invite public input. Unlike the previous law, MDUFA 2007 specifies that the recommendations be revised upon consideration of public comments, requires the recommendations' transmittal to Congress, and writes the performance goal-related requirements into the FFDCA.", "Separate from the user fee authorizations, MDUFA 2007 authorizes the appropriation of specific sums from FY2008 through FY2012 for the review of postmarket safety information on medical devices.

MDUFA 2007 restricts the period within which device producers must register with the Secretary. It also reduces from twice to once per year the requirement that those who register with the Secretary provide a list of devices on which they perform specific functions (e.g., the manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding or processing of a device).", "MDUFA 2007 amends electronic registration regulations to require electronic filing as a default, and without necessitating rulemaking by the Secretary as would have previously been required.", "MDUFA 2007 amends two portions of the FFDCA's provisions regarding records and reports on devices . First, it adds a requirement that the Secretary promulgate regulations establishing a unique identification system for medical devices. Second, it modifies the reporting requirements for devices linked to serious injuries or deaths.", "MDUFA 2007 revises the requirements for inspections by accredited third parties in three ways. First, it reduces administrative requirements associated with qualifying for the program. Second, it expands participation in the program. Third, it permits device companies to voluntarily submit to FDA reports by third parties assessing conformance with appropriate international quality systems standards, such as those set by the International Standards Organization. FDA is to consider the information in these reports in setting its inspection priorities.", "MDUFA 2007 requires the Comptroller General to conduct two studies, and the FDA to conduct one. The Comptroller General is required to conduct one study on the appropriate use of the process under FFDCA 510(k) (premarket notification) to determine whether a device is safe and effective. It is required to conduct a second study on nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections associated with medical devices.

Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007", "paragraphs": ["Title III of FDAAA is the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 (PMDSIA). PMDSIA was enacted based upon reports of a critical need for pediatric medical devices that help diagnose and treat diseases and conditions affecting children. Apparently, developing medical devices for children is less profitable and more problematic than developing them for adults. Fewer children need medical devices than adults, and children have physical attributes (e.g., size, biochemistry, growth rates), activities, and environmental influences that are different from those of adults.", "In order to encourage the development of the pediatric devices, PMDSIA creates some new reporting requirements related to certain pediatric devices, offers several types of incentives to manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices, and gives FDA the authority to require postmarket studies of approved pediatric devices to ensure their continued efficacy and safety.", "PMDSIA creates a set of reporting requirements for applications made under FFDCA 515 and 520(m). Section 515 governs PMAs to market class III devices (these require FDA's highest level of safety controls). Section 520(m) governs humanitarian device exemptions (HDEs). An HDE allows a manufacturer with a device aimed at a U.S. patient population of less than 4,000 to market the product without having to demonstrate its effectiveness (only its safety), and to have certain application fees waived. The exemption from proving effectiveness is designed to encourage manufacturers to develop medical devices for these small markets, assisting patients with rare diseases and conditions who might otherwise not be served. PMDSIA creates requirements for both types of applications, inserting a new section, 515A, into the medical device approval regulations.", "Section 515A requires those requesting approval to market a device under 515 and 520(m) to include, if readily available, a description of any pediatric subpopulation with the disease or condition that the devices is intended to treat, and the number of affected pediatric patients. Section 515A also allows the Secretary to conclude that adult data can be used to support a reasonable assurance of effectiveness in pediatric subpopulations, as appropriate. The section also requires the Secretary to report annually to relevant congressional committees, specified information about pediatric devices approved in the preceding year.", "PMDSIA creates one set of incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices by making some modifications directly to the HDE. Primarily, PMDSIA exempts some specified manufacturers of pediatric devices from the general HDE prohibition on selling a device for an amount that exceeds its costs of research and development, fabrication, and distribution. The exemption extends only to specified requests submitted on or before October 1, 2012. PMDSIA gives the Secretary specified pricing-exemption related enforcement and inspection authorities, and creates reporting requirements for adverse events related to devices that qualify for the pricing exemption. The law also requires the Comptroller General to submit a report to relevant congressional committees on the impact of the pricing exemption.", "Regarding funding for research on pediatric medical devices, the PMDSIA requires the Secretary to establish a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. The law authorizes $6 million per year for FY2008 through FY2012 to support the demonstration grants and related activities. The law also requires the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director to designate a contact point to help pediatric medical device developers locate funding. In addition, it requires the Secretary to submit a plan for expanding pediatric medical device research and development to relevant congressional committees.", "Finally, the PMDSIA incorporates certain postmarket surveillance measures related to pediatric medical devices. It expands the conditions under which the Secretary may require postmarket studies as a condition of approval for class II or III devices to include devices expected to have significant use in pediatric subpopulations. These studies may exceed the general 36-month limitation in duration if necessary to assess the impact of the device on pediatric populations' growth and development.

Studies show that, depending on the maturation and development of a child's organs and other factors, some drugs vary in how long they stay in the body, affecting their usefulness. Some side effects are unique to children or children of specific ages, including effects on growth and development.", "Recognizing the obstacles (which could be economic, ethical, legal, or mechanical) that make manufacturers reluctant to conduct research to address these questions, FDA and Congress developed two approaches to facilitate pediatric research. FDAAA continues both programs. The first, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (FDAAA Title IV, discussed in this section) is a mandatory program that requires pediatric assessments as part of every new application regarding a new ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosing regimen, or route of administration. The second, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (FDAAA Title V, discussed in the following section of this report) is voluntary, offering a six-month marketing exclusivity for a product in return for pediatric studies.", "In 1998, FDA published the Pediatric Rule, which mandated that manufacturers submit pediatric testing data, referred to as a pediatric assessment , at the time of all new drug applications. In 2002, a federal court declared the rule invalid, holding that FDA lacked the statutory authority to promulgate it. Congress gave FDA that authority with the enactment of the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA; P.L. 108-155 ). PREA requirements cover all drug and biological product applications or supplements to applications concerning a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regiment, or new route of administration.
