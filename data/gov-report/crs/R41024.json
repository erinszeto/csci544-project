The report criticized the allocation of the pension costs between the USPS and the federal government for employees who had service both as employees of the Post Office Department and later as employees of the Postal Service. ", "The USPSOIG report noted that the Postal Service is currently responsible for meeting all pension costs under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) for employees hired after 1971. For employees with service both before and after 1971, the federal government and the Postal Service share responsibility for CSRS pensions. The federal government pays for service through 1971, and the USPS pays for service after 1971.", "The USPSOIG report contended that the allocation of CSRS costs between the USPS and the federal government is unfair because the Postal Service is fully responsible for increases in pension costs that result from pay raises granted after 1971. Because CSRS pensions are based on both an employee's years of service and the average of an employee's highest three consecutive years of pay, pension costs rise as employee pay rises. As a consequence, the percentage of CSRS pension costs allocated to the USPS for an employee who worked for both the Post Office Department and the USPS is greater than the proportion of the worker's career that he or she spent as an employee of the USPS. The USPSOIG report notes, for example, that for a person who worked for the Post Office Department for 20 years prior to 1971 and for the USPS for 10 years thereafter, the USPS is obliged to fund about half of this person's pension costs. (The other half is paid for by the U.S. government.) ", "The USPSOIG report suggested that the USPS's share of CSRS pension costs should be proportional to employees' length of service as USPS employees relative to their total length of service with the Post Office Department and the USPS. If an employee had spent 15 years as an employee of the Post Office Department and 15 years as an employee of the USPS, for example, the federal government and the USPS each would be responsible for half of the cost of that individual's CSRS pension. The USPSOIG's report estimated that under the current method of allocating the costs of CSRS pensions, the Postal Service has paid $75 billion more into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund than it would have paid if costs were allocated between the federal government and the USPS strictly in proportion to length of service. ", "In 2004, the Postal Service requested that the OPM, which administers the Civil Service Retirement System, reconsider the method by which it allocates CSRS pension expenses between the Postal Service and the U.S. Treasury. The OPM denied the request on the ground that the allocation method it had developed was consistent with federal law. The OPM cited P.L. 93-349 (July 12, 1974), which required the USPS to finance all increases in retirement liabilities that are attributable to salary increases granted by the USPS. The House committee report accompanying the bill that was enacted as P.L. 93-349 ( H.R. 29 , 93 rd Congress) states that the \"purpose of this legislation is to clearly establish the responsibility of the U.S. Postal Service to finance increases in the liability of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, caused by administrative action of the Postal Service, as apart from increases in unfunded liabilities which are incurred by act of Congress.\" The committee report further states that with respect to any increase in CSRS pension expense that results from future pay raises received by USPS employees, \"the cost of this liability should properly and equitably be borne by the Postal Service.\" ", "A reduction in the proportion of CSRS pension expenses allocated to the Postal Service would increase the unfunded liability of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Absent a reduction in the cost of financing CSRS pensions, changing the allocation of CSRS pension expenses between the Postal Service and general fund of the U.S. Treasury is a zero-sum game. A reduction in the amount of CSRS pension expenses allocated to the USPS would result in an equal increase in CSRS pension expenses borne by the U.S. Treasury.

It has said that the current apportionment of the CSRS pension costs is in line with both congressional intent and federal law. Additionally, the OPMIG warned that allowing the USPS to draw back any CSRS pension funds would \"create a dangerous precedent\" by permitting pension funds to be used for purposes other than the payment of benefits owed.
