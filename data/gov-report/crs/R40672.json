As a result, an LEA would receive higher grants per child counted in the formula , the higher its poverty rate or number. The weighting factors are applied in the same manner nationwide; formula children in LEAs with the highest poverty rates have a weight of up to four, and those in LEAs with the highest numbers of such children have a weight of up to three, compared to a weight of one for formula children in LEAs with the lowest poverty rate and number of such children (see Table 2 , below). The higher of its two weighted child counts (on the basis of numbers and percentages) is actually used in the formula for calculating grants for each LEA.

These steps, or quintiles, were based on the actual distribution of Title I-A population factor children among the nation's LEAs, according to the latest available data in 2001 (at the time that the NCLB was being considered).

As with Targeted Grants, EFIG Grants were initially authorized in 1994, but no funds were appropriated for them until FY2002, after the formula was (in the case of EFIG) considerably modified by the NCLB. Beginning in FY2002, all increases in Title I-A appropriations have been allocated as either EFIG or Targeted Grants. Thus, as with Targeted Grants, EFIG Grants constitute a substantial (21% of FY2008 appropriations) and growing portion of total Title I-A grants. They are allocated among a large majority of LEAs (87% in FY2008).", "The distinctive elements of the EFIG formula begin with the fact that the first stage in the process of calculating grants is based on data for states as a whole, not LEAs. LEA grants are determined in a separate, later stage of the allocation process.", "A second major difference is that the EFIG formula includes not only a population factor and an expenditure factor, but also two unique factors. These are an effort factor, based on average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education compared to personal income per capita for each state compared to the nation as a whole, and an equity factor, based on variations in average per pupil expenditure among the LEAs in each state.", "A third distinctive feature of the EFIG formula is that while population factor child counts are not weighted when calculating state total grants, they are weighted in the separate process of suballocating state total grants among LEAs. This intra-state allocation process is based on the same number and percentage scales as used for Targeted Grants, although the weights attached to each point on those scales varies among states, based on the state's equity factor. A final difference between the EFIG Grant and other Title I-A formulas is that the expenditure factor is modified through application of slightly more narrow floor and ceiling constraints for EFIG Grants.", "Thus, state total EFIG Grants are based on each state's share, compared to the national total, of a population factor multiplied by an expenditure factor, an effort factor, and an equity factor, adjusted by a state minimum. Then, each LEA's share of the state total EFIG Grant is based on a weighted population factor count for the LEA, compared to the total for all LEAs in the state, adjusted by an LEA hold harmless provision. These formula factors are described below, followed by a mathematical expression of the formula.", "Population factor \u2014In the first-stage calculation of state total EFIG Grants, this factor is the same as for Basic Grants (see above). In the second-stage suballocation of state total grants among LEAs, as under all stages of the allocation process for Targeted Grants, weights are applied to child counts before they are actually used in the formula. This process is the same as for Targeted Grants with respect to the number and percentage scales used, and use of the greater of the two weighted child counts to calculate LEA grants. However, for EFIG Grants only, the weights attached to each point on the number and percentage scales differs, depending on the state's equity factor (described below). This variation is illustrated in Table 3 , below.", "As indicated in Table 3 , the weights rise more rapidly as the numbers and percentages of population factor children increase in states with higher equity factors. For states with an equity factor below 0.10, the weights are the same as for Targeted Grants. For states with equity factors between 0.10 and 0.20, or above 0.20, the maximum weights are 50% higher, and twice as high, respectively, as for Targeted Grants. As is discussed below, states with higher equity factors have relatively high degrees of variation in average per pupil expenditure among the state's LEAs.", "Factors Not Found in Other ESEA Program Formulas \u2014As noted above, the EFIG formula has two additional factors not found in any other ESEA program allocation formula.", "Effort Factor \u2014The effort factor is based on a comparison of state average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for public elementary and secondary education with state personal income per capita (PCI). More specifically, it is the ratio of APPE to PCI for each state divided by the ratio of APPE to PCI for the nation. The resulting index number is greater than 1.0 for states where the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education to personal income per capita is greater than average for the nation as a whole, and below 1.0 for states where the ratio is less than average for the nation as a whole. Narrow bounds of 0.95 and 1.05 are placed on the resulting multiplier, so that its influence on state grants is rather limited and its importance is largely symbolic.", "Equity Factor \u2014The equity factor is based upon a measure of the average disparity in average per pupil expenditure among the LEAs of a state called the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV is expressed as a decimal proportion of the state average per pupil expenditure. In the CV calculations for this formula, an extra weight (1.4 vs. 1.0) is applied to estimated counts of children from poor families. The effect is that grants would be maximized for a state where expenditures per pupil from a poor family are 40% higher than expenditures per pupil from a non-poor family. Typical state equity factors range from 0.0 (for the single-LEA jurisdictions of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, where by definition there is no variation among LEAs), to approximately 0.25 for a state with high levels of variation in expenditures per pupil among its LEAs; the equity factors for most states fall into the 0.10 - 0.20 range. In calculating grants, the equity factor is subtracted from 1.30 to determine a multiplier to be used in calculating state grants. As a result, the lower a state's expenditure disparities among its LEAs, the lower is its CV and equity factor, the higher is its multiplier and its grant under the EFIG formula. Conversely, the greater a state's expenditure disparities among its LEAs, the higher is its CV and equity factor, and the lower is its multiplier and its grant under the EFIG formula.", "Eligibility threshold \u2014Same as Targeted Grants (see above).", "Expenditure factor \u2014State average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education, subject to a minimum of 85% (not 80%, as in the other Title I-A formulas) and a maximum of 115% (not 120%, as in the other Title I-A formulas) of the national average, further multiplied by 0.40.

In a large majority of cases, the data used to determine which pupils are from low-income families for the distribution of funds to schools are not the same as those used to identify school-age children in poor families for purposes of calculating allocations to states and LEAs. This is because data are not typically available on the number of school-age children enrolled in a school, or living in a residential school attendance zone, with income below the standard federal poverty threshold.

At the level of individual schools, the most commonly used criterion for determining whether pupils are from low-income families is eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunches.

Actual FY2008 Title I-A grants under current law (i.e., based on IY2005 poverty estimates) are compared to estimates under an alternative formula using the average of the latest and the second most recent poverty estimates (i.e., those for IY2005 and IY2004) as the poverty population factor.

Given the underlying reliance of the SAIPE estimation process on sample survey data, the reliability of the estimates should be increased through combination of estimates for multiple years. The most recent poverty estimates would still be used, but introduced more gradually. States and LEAs would be allowed more time to adjust to either increases or decreases in allocations, and program stability would be enhanced.", "However, opponents of a shift from the current practice of always using the latest available poverty estimates would argue that averaging poverty estimates over two years, or choosing the greater of the latest estimates or a two-year average for each LEA, would delay implementation of updates. Under current practice, estimates based on income for calendar year 2007 will be applied to grants for FY2009, the 2009-2010 school year; thus, there is a two- to three-year lag between the income year and the program year. Use of one of the alternatives discussed above under Options 2 and 3 would add, in part, another year to this time lag. Further, the most severe negative impacts of reductions in poverty estimates are already limited by the LEA hold harmless provisions, under which grants may not fall below 85-95% of the previous year amount, with high poverty LEAs offered the greatest degree of protection.

This example is based on state percentage shares, rather than the estimated number, of school-age children in poor families in order to adjust for nationwide increases or decreases in these estimates.

Over 90% of the nation's LEAs receive grants under ESEA Title I-A, largely because the eligibility thresholds for three of the four allocation formulas, as described above, are relatively low. In general, all LEAs receive Title I-A grants except those that have extraordinarily low school-age poverty rates or have extremely few pupils. A few LEAs (including certain charter schools that are treated as separate LEAs under state law) are eligible for relatively small Title I-A grants, but choose not to participate in the program, at least in part because the responsibilities accompanying participation are perceived to exceed the value of the prospective grants.", " Table 13 , below, presents the distribution of Title I-A grants among LEAs grouped by poverty rate quintile. Each quintile contains LEAs with one-fifth of the nation's total estimated number of school-age children in poor families, on the basis of the Census Bureau IY2005 population estimates used in calculating FY2008 grants. Table 13 lists the percentage share (of the national total) of Title I-A grants that are allocated to LEAs in each poverty quintile. These data are provided separately for each of the four Title I-A allocation formulas, as well as for total grants for FY2008.", "As illustrated in Table 13 and Figure 1 , below, the share of Title I-A funds allocated to LEAs in various poverty rate ranges varies significantly among the four allocation formulas. For Basic Grants, the share is similar for each quintile of LEAs, varying only within the narrow range of 19.2%-21.1%. For Concentration Grants, the share of funds allocated to LEAs in each poverty rate range is again similar, with the exception of the lowest-poverty quintile, which receives a much lower share (4.0% of total grants vs. 23.1%-25.2% for the other four quintiles). This reflects the eligibility threshold for Concentration Grants (formula child rate of at least 15% or 6,500 formula children). Overall, the primary pattern for both Basic and Concentration Grants is relatively constant shares of funds for all quintiles of LEAs meeting minimum eligibility thresholds. In other words, grants per poor and other child counted in the Title I-A allocation formulas are approximately the same for all LEAs meeting the initial eligibility criteria for Basic and Concentration Grants, whether those LEAs have high, average, or somewhat below average school-age child poverty rates.", "The pattern of distribution of grants under the Targeted and EFIG formulas is somewhat different. Under each of these formulas, the share of total grants increases steadily from the lowest to the second-highest poverty rate quintile, then is approximately constant for the 4 th and 5 th quintiles. While this partly reflects the slightly higher eligibility threshold for these formulas in comparison to Basic Grants (5% vs. 2% formula child rate), it primarily results from the structure of these formulas. Under both the Targeted and EFIG (within-state) formulas, the grant per formula child continuously increases as either the LEA's school-age child poverty rate, or its total number of children counted in the Title I-A formulas, increases. The share of funds going to LEAs in the 5 th quintile (highest poverty rates) under each of these formulas is not substantially higher than the share going to LEAs with the second highest poverty rates (4 th quintile) primarily because of the strong influence of high numbers of formula children on the allocation of funds, the influence of the expenditure factor, and the cap placed on Targeted Grant formula population weights for Puerto Rico.", "Overall, the share of funds allocated to LEAs in the top two poverty rate quintiles is substantially higher under the Concentration (49.1%), Targeted (49.1%), and especially the EFIG (51.0%) Grant formulas than under the Basic Grant formula (40.0%). As a result, as long as all additional funds (i.e., amounts in excess of the previous year appropriation) continue to be allocated under the Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas, as has been the case each year from FY2002-2009, the degree of targeting on high poverty LEAs for total Title I-A grants would increase. Thus, overall targeting on high poverty LEAs has increased since the enactment of the NCLB.", "While noteworthy, at least by historical standards, these shifts are nevertheless relatively marginal. For example, the share of total Title I-A funds allocated to LEAs in the two highest poverty rate quintiles rose from 42.3% for FY2002 (when Targeted and EFIG Grants were first funded and Basic Grants constituted 69% of total Title I-A LEA grant appropriations) to 45.2% for FY2008 (when Basic Grants constitute 48% of total Title I-A LEA grant appropriations). Another way to evaluate trends in targeting is to compare the share of grants actually allocated to LEAs in the top two poverty rate quintiles for FY2008 with an estimate of this share if FY2008 funds were allocated in the same manner as in the last pre-NCLB year of FY2001, when 84% of Title I-A appropriations was allocated under the Basic Grant formula and 16% under Concentration Grants. Applying that fund distribution from FY2001, 40.6% of FY2008 funds would have gone to LEAs in the top two poverty rate quintiles versus 45.2% for FY2008 actual grants.", "A partial reason why increases in targeting, measured as above, are relatively marginal is that allocations under the Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas are highly influenced by the number, as well as the percentage, of formula children in each LEA, while this sort of targeting analysis identifies high poverty LEAs only in terms of their percentage of formula children. If \"high poverty\" LEAs were defined as those with either high percentages or high numbers of Title I-A formula children, the estimated increase in targeting would be slightly greater. For example, defining \"high poverty\" LEAs as those in one of the top two quintiles in the statutory Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas (i.e., 7,852 or more formula children, or a formula child percentage of 30.16% or higher), 53.4% of actual FY2008 grants went to such \"high poverty\" LEAs compared to an estimated 47.9% under the FY2001 distribution (84% Basic Grants and 16% Concentration Grants). This difference, of 5.5 percentage points, is slightly higher than the 4.6 percentage point differential based on poverty rates alone.", "Finally, while debates regarding the targeting of Title I-A funds have primarily focused on shifting fund distribution toward areas with the greatest concentrations of poverty, some have been concerned about declines in the share of funds going to relatively low poverty LEAs. While low poverty LEAs may be assumed to have less need for Title I-A assistance in general, they are experiencing declines in funding at a time when they are subject to substantial and increasing requirements applicable to all LEAs that participate in Title I-A. In particular, LEAs with a school-age child poverty rate of between 2.0% and 5.0% are generally eligible only for Basic Grants, funding for which has declined by 8.0% in nominal terms since enactment of the NCLB, from $7,169,471,000 for FY2001 to $6,597,946,000 for FY2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Should the Population Weighting Factors of the Targeted and EFIG Formulas Be Modified to More Equally Favor LEAs With Large Numbers of School-Age Children in Poor Families and LEAs With High Poverty Rates?", "paragraphs": ["As is discussed above, both the Targeted and the EFIG Grant formulas are designed to allocate to LEAs increased amounts of aid per formula child as either their school-age child poverty rate or their total number of formula children rises. The scales of steadily increasing weights applied to LEA formula child counts would appear to favor LEAs with high poverty rates, because relatively higher weights are assigned to LEAs with high poverty rates than to those with high numbers of formula children. For example, in the Targeted Grant formula, the highest weight assigned on the basis of numbers is 3.0 while the maximum weight assigned on the basis of poverty rates is 4.0.", "However, in practice, these formulas tend to favor LEAs with either high numbers of formula children as well as those with high poverty rates, and in some respects may seem to favor LEAs with moderately large numbers of formula children over those with moderately high poverty rates. The major reasons for this effect are that (a) a very large LEA will have a much larger share of its formula children weighted at the highest point in the scale than will a LEA with a very high school-age child poverty rate, and (b) LEAs with moderately large numbers of formula children are treated at least as favorably as LEAs with marginally lower numbers of formula children but much higher school-age child poverty rates. ", "One way to view the level of targeting provided under the Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas is to examine the average grant per formula child for high poverty LEAs versus state averages. Table 14 , below, provides the Title I-A grant per formula child, by formula, for the 15 LEAs in the nation with the largest number of formula children for FY2008. The table also provides these statistics for the LEA with the highest poverty rate in these states plus the state average grants per formula child, by formula. LEAs are compared with others in the same state to adjust for variations in grants per child arising from statewide factors including the expenditure factor used in all formulas plus the effort and equity factors of the EFIG formula.", "As seen in Table 14 , Basic and Concentration Grants per formula child are approximately the same for all LEAs in the same state (assuming minimum LEA eligibility criteria are met); variations in grants per formula child result primarily from hold harmless effects. However, LEAs that are among the 15 largest in the nation receive much higher grants per formula child than other LEAs in the same state under the Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas. Targeted Grants per formula child are in many cases more than twice as high as the average for all other LEAs in the state for the largest LEA in the states shown in Table 14 , while EFIG Grants per formula child are in some cases more than three times as high. In most cases, the Targeted and EFIG Grants per formula child are higher than the state average for LEAs in each state having the highest poverty rate , although not as high as for the LEA with the largest number of formula children. This reflects a general pattern whereby the Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas are favorable to LEAs with both high numbers of formula children and high poverty rates, but generally somewhat more favorable to the former. ", "A major reason for this pattern is that LEAs with large numbers of formula children are often able to apply relatively high weights to higher proportions of their formula children than are smaller LEAs with relatively high percentages of formula children. This can be illustrated by the following comparison of Los Angeles, California, a LEA with a very high number of formula children, with the Hidalgo Independent LEA in Texas, that has one of the highest school-age child poverty rates in the nation. The following table shows the number and percentage share of each LEA's formula children for FY2008 to which various weights are applied under the number and percentage scales for Targeted Grants. After each calculation is made for each LEA, the greater of the two is selected for use in the formula; therefore, the numbers scale is ultimately applicable to Los Angeles and the percentage scale to Hidalgo. As indicated below, a large majority of the total formula child count for Los Angeles (85.6%) falls in the highest weight category (3.0) on the numbers scale, while a much smaller percentage of Hidalgo's formula children (39.3%) falls in the highest weight category (4.0) on the percentage scale. ", "Another perspective on the impact of the Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas on different types of LEAs is provided in Table 16 , below. It again focuses on different types of LEAs in the same state, to eliminate the influence of statewide formula factors, especially the expenditure factor. The table compares state average grants per formula child, by formula, with grants per formula child to three types of LEAs: (1) LEAs with relatively large numbers, but relatively low percentages, of formula children, (2) LEAs with relatively large numbers and above-average percentages of formula children, and (3) LEAs with percentages of formula children that are among the highest in the state. LEAs in these categories are compared in three states\u2014Florida, Maryland, and Virginia\u2014that have a number of LEAs in each of these categories. The general pattern seen in Table 16 for these states is that LEAs in both of the first two categories\u2014LEAs with relatively large numbers, but relatively low percentages, of formula children and LEAs with relatively large numbers and above-average percentages of formula children\u2014invariably receive Targeted, EFIG, and total grants per formula child that are significantly above the state average. LEAs that have the state's highest percentages of formula children also receive higher than average grants in Virginia, but not in Florida or Maryland. This is another reflection of the way in which even moderately high numbers of formula children can substantially influence the distribution of Targeted and EFIG Grants, even for LEAs that have very low school-age child poverty rates by national standards.", "Thus, while the Targeted and EFIG Grant formulas cannot be said to be sharply biased against relatively small LEAs with high poverty rates, LEA size (in terms of numbers of formula children) can be said to have somewhat greater influence on allocation patterns than poverty rates. If desired, an adjustment for this pattern could be accomplished through changes in the weights associated with different ranges of LEA formula child numbers and rates. For example, the formula child percentage scale could be left as is under the Targeted Grant formula, while revising the formula child number scale to top out at 2.0 or 2.5, instead of 3.0, with comparable changes made to the three sets of weighting scales used for EFIG Grants. Alternatively, LEAs with relatively large numbers of formula children could be required to have minimum poverty rates in order to benefit from the full formula child weight on the numbers scale. For example, if an LEA has a formula child rate of less than 20% (approximately the national average), its numbers scale weight could be multiplied by its formula child percentage divided by 20%."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Should the Expenditure Factors Continue to Play a Major Role in the Title I-A Formulas?", "paragraphs": ["The state expenditure factors, while little noticed, have a major impact on the distribution of Title I-A grants. As discussed above, they are the same statewide, with no consideration of local variations; they likely provide little incentive to increase state spending on K-12 education; and they reflect differences in ability to raise revenues at least as much as differences in costs. Perhaps the best argument for continuing them is that they partially, roughly, and indirectly compensate for the lack of a geographical cost adjustment for the poverty population factor income thresholds.", "As was discussed earlier, the Title I-A expenditure factor for a given fiscal year is equal to state current expenditures for public elementary and secondary education per pupil in average daily attendance in the third preceding fiscal year. This amount is multiplied by a \"federal share\" of 0.4. Floor and ceiling constraints are placed on this calculation.

Until recently, the expenditure factor floor was adjusted for one jurisdiction, Puerto Rico, that is otherwise treated as a state in the Title I-A formulas. Table 17 , below, presents state expenditure factors that were used in calculating Title I-A grants for FY2008 (school year 2008-2009). ", "As seen in Table 17 , among the 50 states and the District of Columbia (i.e., excluding Puerto Rico), the FY2008 expenditure factor ranges from $2,956 to $4,435, a ratio of 1.5 to 1, for all formulas except EFIG Grants, and from $3,141 to $4,250, a ratio of 1.35 to 1, for the EFIG formula. In effect, the expenditure factor acts as a \"weight\" applied to each formula's population factor, resulting in grants per formula child that are 50% higher in states at the expenditure factor ceiling than for states at the floor under Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants, and 35% higher under EFIG Grants, when all other relevant factors are held constant."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rationale for the Current Expenditure Factor", "paragraphs": ["The Title I-A allocation formulas have included an expenditure factor since the program was initiated in 1965 (P.L. 89-10). Proponents of inclusion of the expenditure factor in the Title I-A allocation formulas have argued that this serves four policy goals:", "It recognizes and compensates for differences in the costs of providing public elementary and secondary education in different areas of the Nation, by providing higher grants per child to areas with higher educational costs. It provides an incentive for states and LEAs to increase spending for public elementary and secondary education, since Title I-A grants would be increased in response to increases in state and local spending. It rewards states that spend relatively high amounts per pupil for public K-12 education. Since no geographic cost of living adjustment is applied to the income thresholds used to calculate estimated numbers of school-age children in poor families, and since (it is argued) such costs of living tend to be correlated with variations in average expenditures per pupil, the expenditure factor helps to treat different regions of the nation more fairly than a reliance on poverty data alone.", "There are limits associated with each of these rationales. A difficulty with the first rationale is that the expenditure factor is based on levels of state and local spending , and is not a measure or index of the costs of providing public elementary and secondary education in the various states. A cost index would measure the relative costs of providing a standardized service in different states or localities. In contrast, the Title I-A expenditure factor measures the average level of expenditures per pupil in each state for public elementary and secondary education services which may vary substantially in nature and quality. State average differences in expenditures per pupil are likely to vary in part due to underlying differences in the costs of providing similar educational services, but also in response to such factors as differences in ability to pay for educational services; the relative priority that a state's population places on elementary and secondary education (as opposed to other public services or tax limitation); the nature of the services provided; and even the relative share of a state's total population that consists of school-age children and youth. Further, since the Title I-A expenditure factor is the same for all LEAs in each state, it could not account for the potentially large differences in the costs of providing public education among the LEAs within states.", "With respect to the second rationale for inclusion of the expenditure factor in the ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas, it is true that for many states, future Title I-A grants would increase in response to an increase in the level of state and local expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education. However, several considerations are likely to significantly limit the impact of the Title I-A expenditure factor as a potential incentive to raise state and local public education spending, including the following.", "An increase in state and local expenditures per pupil would lead to an increase in Title I-A grants only if the rate of increase in expenditures per pupil were greater than the national average increase in expenditures per pupil over the relevant time period. For example, if the national average level of expenditures per pupil increased by 4% from one year to the next, a state would have to increase its level of expenditures per pupil by more than 4% in order to experience any increase in Title I-A grants. If a state's expenditure factor were already significantly more than 120%, or significantly below 80%, of the national average (115% and 85% for EFIG Grants), then an increase in state and local spending might have no effect on the state's Title I-A expenditure factor. For example, if a substantial increase in state and local spending were to increase a state's expenditure factor from 70% to 75%, or from 125% to 130%, of the national average, there would be no significant effect on Title I-A grants to the state. Since the expenditure factor is the same for all LEAs in each state, and is based on aggregate state and local source spending within the state, it is likely to provide little incentive for individual LEAs to increase their level of spending, since such increases might have very little impact on aggregate state expenditures per pupil. Even if the relative level (in comparison to other states) of a state's expenditure factor were to increase, and the state fell between the floor and ceiling parameters, so an increase would have a direct impact on the state's expenditure factor as used in the Title I-A formulas, the amount of the consequent increase in Title I-A grants would likely be very small in comparison to the size of the increase in state and local spending. For example, if California (a state at 86% of the national average for FY2008) were to have increased its average expenditure per pupil for 2005-2006 (the year upon which the expenditure factor for FY2008 grants was based) by $100, and if all other relevant factors (such as the expenditure factors for other states) remained constant, then estimated total Part A grants to California for FY2008 would increase by $10.7 million. This is equivalent to only 1.7% of the $635 million in additional spending of state and local funds that would have been necessary to increase the expenditure factor for California by $100 per pupil for that year. It seems unlikely that such a relatively small \"bonus,\" with a three-year time lag, would provide substantial motivation to states and LEAs in deciding whether to increase their level of spending for public elementary and secondary education.", "Regarding the third rationale noted above, the current expenditure factor certainly does reward states with relatively high levels of spending for public K-12 education per pupil. However, it does not reward effort\u2014expenditures relative to each state's fiscal capacity, i.e., its ability to raise revenues.", "Finally, with respect to the fourth rationale for the current expenditure factor, it is true that the income thresholds used to determine whether or not a family is poor vary only by family size, not by the state or locality in which the family resides. As a result, it can be reasonably argued that the number of school-age children in poor families is underestimated in areas with high living costs, and possibly overestimated in areas with relatively low living costs. Proposals have been made to incorporate a geographic cost of living adjustment to the poverty thresholds, but none of these has yet been adopted by the Federal Government. Nevertheless, there is no widely-accepted measure of variation in state or local costs of living, and no definitive evidence that such costs are closely associated with variations in state average expenditures per pupil."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to the Title I-A Expenditure Factor", "paragraphs": ["Some policy analysts have expressed concerns about the Title I-A expenditure factor, partly because of the limits on the factor's rationale discussed above, and partly because of its \"disequalizing\" effect, since on average it provides higher grants per formula child to states with relatively high average levels of income than to states with relatively lower income levels."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Use the National Average as the Expenditure Factor for All States", "paragraphs": ["The simplest alternative to the current Title I-A expenditure factor provision would be to eliminate the factor completely\u2014i.e, use the national average expenditure per pupil as the expenditure factor for all states. This would follow the example of the other very large federal K-12 education program\u2014the state grant program under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\u2014under which the national average is used as an expenditure factor for all states. Table 18 , below, shows the estimated impact on FY2008 Title I-A grants of totally eliminating a (varying) expenditure factor\u2014i.e., using the national average as the expenditure factor for all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This allocation formula change would significantly affect the estimated level of grants to most states. While there would be no estimated change in grants to states receiving the minimum grant amount under all four formulas (Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming), grants to many states would change substantially. Estimated grants would rise by 10% or more for such relatively low expenditure factor states as Alabama, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Tennessee ; while they would decline by 10% or more for relatively high expenditure factor states such as Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.", "It is worth noting that the \"dividing line\" between gaining and losing states as a result of eliminating the expenditure factor would not actually be the national average expenditure factor, but rather would be somewhat below that, typically approximately 93-95% of the national average. In other words, losing states would include not only all those with average expenditures per pupil above the national average, but also those with expenditures slightly below the average. This is because the national average is, in effect, an average weighted on the basis of the total school-age population in each state, whereas it would be the national average weighted by each state's number of poor and other children counted in the Title I-A formulas that would be relevant to Part A grants. Since many of the states with the greatest concentrations of poor school-age children also tend to have relatively low expenditure factors, the average expenditure factor weighted according to poor children is below the national average weighted according to total school-age children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Replace the Expenditure Factor With a Cost Index", "paragraphs": ["A second alternative to the current Title I-A expenditure factor would involve substituting a cost index for it. This would be conceptually appropriate, assuming that the primary purpose of the expenditure factor is to reflect differences in costs. The major obstacle is the lack of an official, or otherwise widely accepted, index for state or local variations in the costs of providing public elementary and secondary education. Nevertheless, serious efforts have been made to develop such an index, and the results of one such recent project are shown in Table 19 , below. Table 19 compares the current Title I-A expenditure factor (with both sets of floors and ceilings, 80-120% and 85-115%) with a Comparable Wage Index (CWI) that has been developed as a measure for comparing educational costs across states and localities. Both the expenditure factor and the CWI are expressed as index numbers with a national average value of 1.00. No floor or ceiling has been applied to the CWI (as it falls beyond the bounds of 0.80-1.20 in extremely few cases), while the two current combinations of floor and ceiling have been applied to the Title I-A expenditure factor.", "The CWI attempts to measure state and local differences in the costs of providing public K-12 education by focusing on the primary source of such costs, salaries for teachers and other professional staff. Further, in order to minimize the influence of factors that can be influenced by SEA and LEA policies, the CWI is based on wages paid to individuals in professions with similar educational requirements outside of K-12 education. Thus, the focus is on the competitive labor market conditions faced by local school systems in hiring and retaining staff.", "As can be seen in columns E and F of Table 19 , there are numerous substantial differences in relative state values (i.e., state value compared to the national average) for the Title I-A expenditure factors versus the CWI. This has at least two implications: (a) use of the CWI as a substitute for the current expenditure factor would result in very substantial shifts in Title I-A grants among the states; and (b) to the extent that the CWI may be considered to be an appropriate measure of the relative costs of providing public K-12 education, the correlation between this measure and the expenditure factor is very limited. There are several states where the expenditure factor is above the national average but the CWI is below average (Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming), and a smaller number of other states with a relatively low expenditure factor but a CWI that is at or above the national average (California and Washington). It is also clear that variations among the states with respect to the CWI are less than variations in the expenditure factor, even with the application of floors or ceilings to the latter but not the former. Only two states (Montana and South Dakota) have a CWI index for 2005 that is below .80, and only the District of Columbia has a CWI index above 1.20.", "In order to reflect not only interstate, but also intrastate, differences in costs, the CWI has been calculated for individual LEAs, as well as states. However, the CWI is the same for all LEAs in the same metropolitan area.

It is based upon total state and local expenditures for public K-12 education relative to a measure of Total Taxable Resources (TTR) , not just personal income, compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The TTR index is a comprehensive measure of the relative ability of state and local governments to raise revenues.", "Since, unlike the CWI-based cost index, the TTR-based effort index varies among the states approximately as widely as the Title I-A expenditure factor if left unconstrained (from 0.68 for Delaware to 1.43 for Vermont), separate comparisons are made between the two current versions of the expenditure factor and versions of the effort factor using the same limits (80%/120% and 85%/115% of the national average). Thus, Column E represents the percentage difference between the TTR-based effort index with 80% and 120% limits (Col. C of Table 20 ) and the expenditure factor with the same limits (Col. B of Table 19 ), and Column F represents the percentage difference between the TTR-based effort index with 85% and 115% limits (Col. D of Table 20 ) and the expenditure factor with those limits (Col.

In contrast, states where the effort index is much lower (again, at least 10% in one or both comparisons) than the expenditure index include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Wyoming, plus the District of Columbia.

This potential issue will be noted only briefly here, but there may be interest in some degree of consolidation of the four Title I-A LEA allocation formulas. It has never been directly intended that portions of Title I-A appropriations be allocated under four different formulas. The four-formula strategy has resulted from compromises over proposals to replace previous proposals with a single new formula. At the least, the use of four different allocation formulas for portions of each year's Title I-A appropriations leads to complication and occasional confusion.", "Historically, the Tile I-A program has tended to have one formula under which almost all LEAs qualify, Basic Grants, and one or more formulas that are targeted more on LEAs relatively high percentages and/or numbers of school age children in poor families.

Over the decades since enactment of the original ESEA in 1965, the typical pattern of ESEA authorizing statutes has been to specify an authorized level of appropriations only for the first year of the authorization period (if at all) for Title I-A, and to simply authorize \"such sums as may be necessary\" for the remaining years. The NCLB broke with this pattern, specifying authorization amounts for Title I-A for each of FY2002-2007.", "The question of authorized funding levels is closely linked to concepts of \"full funding\" for this program. For Title I-A, many program advocates have argued that the \"full funding\" level should be based on maximum payment calculations under the Basic Grant allocation formula, even in years when no authorization level was explicitly specified. As discussed earlier in this report, the Title I-A Basic Grant formula establishes a maximum payment based on poor and other \"formula children\" multiplied by a state expenditure factor. The total of these maximum payments is understood by a number of analysts to represent the \"full funding\" level for Part A. In contrast, at least during periods when Title I-A authorizations are explicitly specified in statute (e.g., FY2002-2007), many argue that these authorization amounts are the only meaningful concepts of \"full funding\" for Title I-A.", "There is a link between the two alternative \"full funding\" concepts for Title I-A. In the NCLB, Title I-A appropriations authorization levels were specified for each of FY2002-FY2007. Under the automatic extension provisions of the General Education Provisions Act, the FY2007 authorization applied to FY2008 as well. The FY2007 amount was set at a level approximately equal to the level of maximum Basic Grants as of FY2001 (the year preceding enactment of NCLB). Thus, the implicit goal was for funding to increase from the then-current appropriation level to the then-current maximum payment level for Basic Grants over the period of FY2002-2007. In practice, over the FY2002-FY2007 period, the appropriation for Title I-A was below the authorized amount each year, with the gap between authorization and appropriation increasing each year. In addition, by the end of the period to which the NCLB authorizations applied (FY2008), maximum Basic Grants had grown from approximately $25 billion to an estimated $33.2 billion. Thus, the practical impact of specifying authorization amounts for each year may be questioned. In addition, any authorization levels for the Title I-A program thus far may be deemed to be somewhat arbitrary, since there is no precise way to specify the level of additional spending necessary to raise the achievement of low-achieving pupils to a proficient level. ", "At the same time, specified authorizations do provide a goal for those seeking increased funding, and express the judgment of those involved in the authorizing process of an appropriate level of funding. Finally, if authorization issues are to be specified for future years, there may be proposals to link implementation of certain Title I-A requirements to the provision of authorized (or some other specified) levels of appropriations, or even to appropriate the authorized amounts in reauthorization legislation.", " Table 21 , below, provides appropriations for FY2001-FY2009 compared to authorization levels for Title I-A overall, where applicable. Under the automatic extension provisions for the General Education Provisions Act, the Title I-A authorization level for FY2008 was the same as the FY2007 level. For fiscal years beyond FY2008, there is no specific authorization level for Title I-A, until new authorization legislation is enacted.", "For FY2002, the Title I-A authorization was $13.5 billion, and the appropriation was $10.35 billion. This FY2002 appropriation level represented a substantial increase of 17.0% over the FY2001 level for Title I-A. Appropriations also increased significantly, by 14.0%, for FY2003 compared to FY2002. Appropriations continued to increase, but at a declining rate, for FY2004 compared to FY2003 (5.6%). Funding was essentially flat over the period of FY2004-FY2007 for Title I-A. Finally, for FY2008, funding for Title I-A increased by 8.3% over FY2007. For FY2009, regular appropriations are 4.3% over those for FY2008. However, the additional amounts provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) represent a much larger increase, the specific size of which depends on the extent to which these additional funds are considered as FY2009 or FY2010 amounts.", "Another trend is that over the period of FY2002-FY2007, appropriations represented a decreasing share of authorizations for Title I-A each year, although this proportion rose somewhat in FY2008. For FY2002, the first year under the NCLB, the appropriation for Title I-A was 76% of the amount authorized. By FY2007, the appropriation represented 51% of the Title I-A authorization. For FY2008, this proportion rose to 57%.", "If the model of the NCLB were to be followed in reauthorization legislation, and if the latter were to be enacted during FY2009, then explicit authorization levels might increase in steps from the FY2009 appropriation to the estimated FY2008 maximum Basic Grant level of $33.2 billion. An alternative approach might involve stepwise movement toward a level of maximum Basic Grants as projected for the last year of the new authorization period, rather than the year preceding the new authorization period. The second approach would undoubtedly yield substantially higher authorization levels.

More specifically, it is the ratio of APPE to PCI for each state divided by the ratio of APPE to PCI for the nation. The resulting index number is greater than 1.0 for states where the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education to personal income per capita is greater than average for the nation as a whole, and below 1.0 for states where the ratio is less than average for the nation as a whole. Narrow bounds of 0.95 and 1.05 are placed on the resulting multiplier.", "There are two potential issues related to the current structure of this effort factor. First, the rather narrow bounds on the effort factor mean that its impact is quite limited and mostly symbolic. This could be resolved by expanding the bounds, perhaps to the same range (compared to the national average) as the expenditure factor (0.85-1.15 for EFIG grants, 0.80-1.20 for the other three formulas.

An alternative structure would be based on aggregate measures\u2014e.g., total state and local expenditures for public K-12 education and total personal income (or Total Taxable Resources, as discussed earlier with respect to the expenditure factor) in each state. While the concepts are similar, the two different measures of effort have substantially different implications for which states may be considered to exert high versus low levels of effort. The differences are primarily based on state demographic patterns. In many of the states with high expenditures per pupil the share of the population that is school-age (5-17) is relatively low, and vice-versa. Thus, an individual measure of effort tends to favor states with relatively few school-age children, many of them in the northeastern and north central regions, while an aggregate measure would tend to favor states where comparatively high shares of the population are of school age, most of which are in the south and west.", "The difference between individual and aggregate measures of effort is illustrated in Table 22 below. It compares an effort measure based on individual factors to one based on aggregate factors for each state. In order to illustrate the maximum possible effect of using each type of index, the effort measures in Table 22 are shown with no bounds.", "As seen in Table 22 , the differences between individual and aggregate measures of state effort are often quite substantial. For the District of Columbia and states such as Hawaii, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island, Montana, Pennsylvania, and Maine, the aggregate measure of effort is much lower than the individual measure. In contrast, for states such as Utah, Texas, Alaska, and California, the aggregate measure of effort is much higher than the individual measure. However, the impact of the differences depend heavily on whether the bounds on the EFIG formula effort factor remain narrow; if the bounds continue to be 0.95-1.05, then most of the differences seen in Table 22 would be irrelevant, because most states would be held at either the 0.95 floor or the 1.05 ceiling if either effort concept were applied. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Should the Equity Factor in the Education Finance Incentive Grant Formula Be Modified?", "paragraphs": ["As was discussed above, the EFIG formula equity factor is based upon a measure of the average disparity in average per pupil expenditure among the LEAs of a state called the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV is expressed as a decimal proportion of the state average per pupil expenditure. In the CV calculations for this formula, an extra weight (1.4 vs. 1.0) is applied to estimated counts of children from poor families. The effect is that grants would be maximized for a state where expenditures per pupil from a poor family are 40% higher than expenditures per pupil from a non-poor family. Typical state equity factors range from 0.0 (for the single-LEA jurisdictions of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, where by definition there is no variation among LEAs), to approximately 0.25 for a state with high levels of variation in expenditures per pupil among its LEAs; the equity factors for most states fall into the 0.10 - 0.20 range. In calculating grants, the equity factor is subtracted from 1.30 to determine a multiplier to be used in calculating state grants. As a result, the lower a state's expenditure disparities among its LEAs, the lower is its CV and equity factor, the higher is its multiplier and its grant under the EFIG formula. Conversely, the greater a state's expenditure disparities among its LEAs, the higher is its CV and equity factor, and the lower is its multiplier and its grant under the EFIG formula.", "There are two potential issues regarding the current structure of this factor. The first is whether there should be adjustments not only for school-age children in poor families, but also for other \"high cost\" groups of pupils, particularly LEP pupils and pupils with disabilities. In the past, a constraint here has been the availability of data. Although that may have been resolved, concerns about the consistency of data remain. As discussed above, estimates of the number of school-age children in poor families are prepared annually by the Census Bureau through the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program. Data on LEP pupils and pupils with disabilities by LEA are now compiled and published by ED through the National Center for Education Statistics' Common Core of Data program. However, the system for reporting these data, by LEA and state, raises concerns about consistency across the nation, especially with respect to LEP pupils. In addition, if weights for LEP pupils and pupils with disabilities were to be included in the calculation of state equity factors, questions would arise regarding the appropriate weights to apply and possible adjustment for the fact that many pupils exhibit two or more of these characteristics.", "A second potential issue regarding the current structure of the EFIG formula equity factor is whether alternative concepts of equity should be applied in place of the coefficient of variation.

LEAs can generally choose to focus Title I-A services on selected grade levels (e.g., only in elementary schools), but they must usually provide services in all schools, whatever their grade level, where the percentage of pupils from low-income families is 75% or more. Once schools are selected, Title I-A funds are allocated among them (and reserved for services to private school pupils) in proportion to their number of pupils from low-income families, although grants to eligible schools per pupil from a low-income family need not be equal for all schools. LEAs may choose to provide higher grants per child from a low-income family to schools with higher percentages of such pupils. If a LEA provides Title I-A funds to schools with low-income pupil percentages below 35%, then it must provide a minimum amount of funds per child from a low-income family\u2014equal to at least 125% of the LEA's Title I-A grant per child from a low-income family\u2014to each participating school.", "The primary issue that has arisen with respect to intra-LEA allocation of Title I-A funds is whether an equitable share of funds is being allocated to middle and high schools.

First, LEAs have tended to use their discretion to focus funds on selected grade levels (after all schools with 75% or more from low-income families are served) to concentrate assistance on schools serving pupils at grades K-6. Second, both because they tend to serve larger, less homogeneous populations than elementary schools, and because older students are less likely to participate in the free and reduced-price school lunch programs, the percentage of pupils from low-income families tends to be lower for middle and especially high schools than for elementary schools.", "The low Title I-A participation rates for middle and high schools is of concern both because resources may not be equitably distributed in relation to student need, and because corrective actions and other consequences for failure to meet adequate yearly progress standards need only be applied, under federal law, to schools that participate in Title I-A. Thus, there has been increased interest in proposals intended to increase the share of Title I-A funds being allocated to middle and high schools. In its ESEA reauthorization proposal released in early 2007, the Bush Administration proposed that Title I-A funding increases be distributed such that \"Districts will have to give their high schools at least 90 percent of the high schools' proportionate share of the increased funds.\" Details on exactly how this policy would be implemented were not published.", "Another alternative would be to emphasize, encourage, or perhaps even require use of a school selection option that is currently sanctioned by ED policy guidance\u2014use of the \"feeder school\" concept to increase Title I-A funding for middle and high schools. Under current policy guidance, LEAs may project low-income pupil rates for middle and high schools based on the rates for elementary or (in the case of high schools) middle schools whose graduates attend those secondary schools. For example, if all of a middle school's students come from two elementary schools in the same LEA, and those elementary schools have an average (weighted by enrollment) of 60% of their pupils from low-income families, then the middle school may also be deemed to have a 60% low income pupil percentage, even if the directly measured percentage for the middle school is lower than that."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Title I-A Allocation Formula Issues Affecting a Limited Number of States or LEAs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Should the Last Remaining Special Constraints on Grants to Puerto Rico Be Removed?", "paragraphs": ["In recent decades, Puerto Rico has been treated as a state in the Title I-A allocation formulas, but with a few special provisions that resulted in Puerto Rico receiving grants that were somewhat lower than it would receive if it were treated fully as a state. The most significant of these constraints placed a limit on Puerto Rico's expenditure factor that was lower than the minimum expenditure factor for any state. However, the NCLB provided for a gradual phase-out of this constraint, and this was fully implemented with respect to FY2008 grants.", "Two special constraints on Title I-A grants to Puerto Rico remain, each of which affects only one of the four allocation formulas. First, the effort factor under the EFIG formula is set at the minimum level (0.95) for Puerto Rico. However, this provision has limited (if any) impact. As was discussed above, the effort factor has such a limited range (0.95-1.05) that its effect on the grant to any state is marginal. Nevertheless, if the calculated effort factor for Puerto Rico were higher (up to the limit of 1.05), removing this constraint would increase EFIG grants to Puerto Rico.", "Of potentially greater significance for Puerto Rico is the second current constraint on its grant. Under the Targeted Grant formula, a cap is placed on the net, aggregate weight applied to Puerto Rico's formula child count. This cap, of 1.82, was intended to provide to Puerto Rico a share of total Targeted Grants that was equivalent to its share of funds under the previously funded Basic and Concentration Grant formulas. It is substantially lower than the weight that would be applied to Puerto Rico's Targeted Grant formula child count if unconstrained. If unconstrained, the net aggregate formula child weight for Puerto Rico under the Targeted Grant formula would be approximately 2.94, resulting in an increase in the Targeted Grant to Puerto Rico of approximately 60%, and a consequent decrease in the Targeted Grants to the states and the District of Columbia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Should the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) Population Factor Be Eliminated?", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, the TANF population factor is now extremely small (less than 0.1% of all formula children).

During a period in the early 1970s, the children counted under the AFDC factor actually exceeded those counted under the \"poverty\" factor.

In addition, in all except these three areas, Title I-A funds are allocated within each LEA in a manner that treats schools with similar characteristics (e.g., their percentage of pupils from low-income families, among schools at the same grade level) consistently LEA-wide. In almost all cases, Section 1113 of Title I-A requires that schools be selected to receive Title I-A grants using a single poverty standard, based on the percentage of pupils from low-income families, which is the same throughout the LEA. Also in almost all cases, LEAs are required either to allocate to participating schools equal amounts of Title I-A funds per child from a low-income family, or to allocate varying amounts per low-income child only if this results in providing higher amounts per low-income child to schools with higher percentages of pupils from low-income families. In other words, in every LEA except three special cases, there is a single, LEA-wide policy to determine which schools may participate in Title I-A and the level of Title I-A funds per low-income child that will be allocated to participating schools.", "Under the provisions of ESEA Title I, Part A, Section 1124(c)(2), an exception to this general policy is made for one class of LEAs\u2014those which serve two or more counties in their entirety .

For these three LEAs, each county (or independent city) is treated as if it were a separate LEA in the calculation of LEA total grants by ED.", "In the allocation of Title I-A funds to these LEAs, each county unit is treated by ED and the SEA as if it were a separate LEA. The separately-calculated grants under the four Part A formulas are combined into a single, total grant to the LEA. Then, in the allocation of most of these funds to individual eligible schools, instead of applying consistent policies LEA-wide, these three LEAs must insure that the share of the LEA's total grant that is allocated to schools in each county is the same as the county's share of the school-age population counts used by ED in calculating the LEA's total grant. Thus, for example, if one county in a multi-county LEA has 30% of the children counted in calculating the Title I-A allocations for the LEA, then 30% of the Title I-A funds which the LEA allocates to individual schools must be allocated to eligible schools in that county.", "The multi-county LEA provision was added to Title I-A in the 1994 Improving America's Schools Act (IASA, P.L. 103-382 ), and was extended without revision by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA, P.L. 107-110 ). Prior to adoption of the IASA, Title I-A grants were calculated by ED by county, and SEAs suballocated county totals to LEAs. Each county in these multi-county LEAs was treated as a separate entity in the allocation of funds to , although not within , LEAs. The IASA provided that, beginning in FY1999, if certain conditions were met, ED would begin calculating grants by LEA. The multi-county LEA provision was adopted, in part, to preserve the former policy of treating each county separately (at least in the allocation of funds to the LEA) after that transition. Further, with respect to the allocation of funds to schools within these multi-county LEAs, the IASA provision addressed the concern expressed by some that schools in certain counties were receiving a share of Title I-A grants which was substantially lower than the share of LEA total grants generated by their formula population counts.

As shown in Table 23 , total (combining all four formulas) estimated grants to the New York City LEA for FY2008 would be somewhat higher if it were treated as a single LEA in the calculation of LEA grants by ED. This difference is due to the Targeted Grant formula and, to a lesser extent, the Education Finance Incentive Grant formula, under both of which the LEA's estimated total grant would be higher if New York City were treated as a single LEA. Under each of these formulas, LEAs receive higher grants per formula child, the higher is their total number of formula children or their formula child percentage (compared to total school age population). Thus, under each of these formulas, the total grant to New York City would be somewhat higher if citywide numbers of formula children were combined.", "However, for FY2008, these increases in Targeted and EFIG Grants are almost totally offset by estimated deceases in Basic and Concentration Grants to New York City if it were treated as a single LEA. The reason for this is that Basic and Concentration Grants are at a hold harmless level for FY2008 for all Boroughs except Richmond under current law, and for the City overall if treated as a single LEA. As was discussed above, hold harmless percentages (85%, 90%, or 95%) vary among LEAs depending on their poverty rate. When treated as one LEA, the hold harmless rate for New York City is 90%, but if treated as five LEAs, Bronx and New York counties qualify for the higher 95% hold harmless rate. Thus, in periods when the estimated number of formula children is declining significantly for New York City, as is the case for FY2008, the City receives higher grants under the Basic and Concentration Grant formulas when treated as five LEAs rather than one. In contrast, if the City's share of the Nation's estimated number of formula children were steady or increasing, it would receive the same amount under Basic and Concentration Grants, and substantially more under Targeted and EFIG Grants, if treated as a single LEA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact on the Allocation of Title I-A Funds Within the New York City LEA", "paragraphs": ["With respect to the allocation of funds to schools, it would be theoretically possible for the affected LEAs to comply with the multi-county LEA provision of Title I-A by either establishing varying school eligibility thresholds in each county, then allocating the same dollar amount per low-income child to each eligible school, or by setting the same eligibility threshold for schools LEA-wide and allocating varying amounts per low-income child to eligible schools in each county, or a combination of these two types of adjustments. Between 1995 and 2003, New York City, in consultation with ED staff, applied a standard school eligibility threshold citywide, varying only the allocation per low-income child to comply with the Title I-A county provision. As a result, allocations per low-income pupil in Title I-A-eligible schools varied widely among the City's counties.", "However, beginning with the 2003-2004 school year, again in consultation with ED staff, New York City has employed a combination of variations in school eligibility thresholds and allocations per low-income child in order to comply with the county provision. As seen in Table 24 , in the 2008-2009 school year, both the Title I-A funds per low-income pupil and school eligibility thresholds vary among the five counties in New York City. As shown in Table 24 , the school eligibility threshold is slightly lower for Queens county (55.71%), and much lower for Richmond county (37.84%), than for the other 3 counties in New York City (60.00%). At the same time, the amount allocated to schools in each county, per child from a low-income family attending an eligible school, varies from a high of $1,274.33 for New York county to $906.77 for Queens county.", "The last 2 columns of Table 24 also show the estimated effects of applying a standard school eligibility threshold and grant per child from a low-income family citywide. For purposes of illustration, the same total amount is allocated to schools as for 2008-2009 actual grants; i.e., there is no attempt to reflect the effects of potentially increased total grants to New York City if it were treated as a single LEA (as discussed above). It is assumed that a standard school eligibility threshold of 60.0% is applied citywide, with a resulting standard grant per child from a low-income family of $1,765.32. As a result, the amount allocated to schools in Richmond county is estimated to decline by approximately 49% and the amount to Kings county by 11%, while the estimated amounts to the other 3 counties would increase by 2% for Queens county, 3% for Bronx county, and 9% for New York county.", "The primary basis for this variation\u2014between actual grants based on current policy versus estimated grants if the Title I-A multi-county LEA provision were eliminated\u2014is the difference in the distribution among New York City's counties of: (a) total school-age children in poor families , versus (b) school-age children from low-income families who live in areas of concentrated poverty. In general, all LEAs receive Title I-A grants on the basis of all of their children in poor families, but funds are allocated only to schools serving areas of concentrated poverty.", "As shown in Table 24 , for FY2008 (school year 2008-2009), Richmond County has 3.6% of the total school-age children in poor families used by ED in calculating Title I-A grants.

Under this provision, schools in each county receive a share of funds which is proportional to their number of school-age children in poor families.
