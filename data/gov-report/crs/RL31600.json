Military commissions pursuant to the M.O. began in November, 2004, against four persons declared eligible for trial, but proceedings were suspended after a federal district court found one of the defendants could not be tried under the rules established by the Department of Defense. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, Rumsfeld v. Hamdan, but the Supreme Court granted review and reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Military commissions will not be able to go forward until the Department of Defense revises its rules to conform with the Supreme Court's Hamdan opinion or Congress approves legislation conferring authority to promulgate rules that depart from the strictures of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and U.S. international obligations.", "The M.O. has been the focus of intense debate both at home and abroad. Critics argued that the tribunals could violate the rights of the accused under the Constitution as well as international law, thereby undercutting the legitimacy of any verdicts rendered by the tribunals. The Administration responded by publishing a series of military orders and instructions clarifying some of the details. The procedural aspects of the trials were published in Military Commission Order No. 1 (\"M.C.O. No. 1\"). The Department of Defense also released two more orders and nine \"Military Commission Instructions,\" which set forth the elements of some crimes that may be tried, establish guidelines for civilian attorneys, and provide other administrative guidance. These rules were praised as a significant improvement over what might have been permitted under the M.O., but some argued that the enhancements do not go far enough, and the Supreme Court held that the amended rules did not comply with the UCMJ.", "This report provides a background and analysis comparing military commissions as envisioned under M.C.O. No. 1 to general military courts-martial conducted under the UCMJ. A summary of the Hamdan case follows, in particular the shortcomings identified by the Supreme Court. The report provides an overview of legislation (H.R. 6054, S. 3901, S. 3930, S. 3861, and S. 3886). Finally, the report provides two charts to compare the regulations issued by the Department of Defense to standard procedures for general courts-martial under the Manual for Courts-Martial and to proposed legislation. The second chart, which compares procedural safeguards incorporated in the regulations with established procedures in courts-martial, follows the same order and format used in CRS Report RL31262, Selected Procedural Safeguards in Federal, Military, and International Courts, in order to facilitate comparison with safeguards provided in federal court and international criminal tribunals."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Rasul v. Bush , issued by the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of its 2003-2004 term, clarified that U.S. courts do have jurisdiction to hear petitions for habeas corpus on behalf of the approximately 550 persons detained at the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in connection with the war against terrorism, establishing a role for federal courts to play in determining the validity of the military commissions convened pursuant to President Bush's Military Order (M.O.) of November 13, 2001. After dozens of petitions for habeas corpus were filed in the federal District Court for the District of Columbia, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), revoking federal court jurisdiction over habeas claims, at least with respect to those not already pending, and created jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to hear appeals of final decisions of military commissions. The Supreme Court overturned a decision by the D.C. Circuit that had upheld the military commissions, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , holding instead that although Congress has authorized the use of military commissions, such commissions must follow procedural rules as similar as possible to courts-martial proceedings, in compliance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Military Commissions: General Background", "paragraphs": ["Military commissions are courts usually set up by military commanders in the field to try persons accused of certain offenses during war. They are distinct from military courts-martial, which are panels set up to try U.S. service members (and during declared wars, civilians accompanying the armed forces) under procedures prescribed by Congress in the UCMJ. U.S. service members charged with a war crime are normally tried before courts-martial but may also be tried by military commission or in federal court, depending on the nature of the crime charged. All three options are also available to try certain other persons for war crimes. Federal and state criminal statutes and courts are available to prosecute specific criminal acts related to terrorism that may or may not be triable by military commission.", "Military commissions trying enemy belligerents for war crimes directly apply the international law of war, without recourse to domestic criminal statutes, unless such statutes are declaratory of international law.

Critics argued that the tribunals could violate any rights the accused may have under the Constitution as well as their rights under international law, thereby undercutting the legitimacy of any verdicts rendered by the tribunals. The Administration initially responded that the M.O. provided only the minimum requirements for a full and fair trial, and that the Secretary of Defense intended to establish rules prescribing detailed procedural safeguards for tribunals established pursuant to the M.O. The procedural rules released in March 2002 were praised as a significant improvement over what might have been permitted under the language of the M.O., but some continued to argue that the enhancements do not go far enough and that the checks and balances of a separate rule-making authority and an independent appellate process are necessary. The release of the Military Commission Instructions sparked renewed debate, especially concerning the restrictions on civilian attorneys, resulting in further modifications to the rules. Critics noted that the rules do not address the issue of indefinite detention without charge, as appears to be possible under the original M.O., or that the Department of Defense may continue to detain persons who have been cleared by a military commission. The Pentagon has stated that its Inspector General (IG) looked into allegations, made by military lawyers assigned as prosecutors to the military commissions, that the proceedings are rigged to obtain convictions, but the IG did not substantiate the charges.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has released ten \"Military Commission Instructions\" (\"M.C.I. No. 1-10\") to elaborate on the set of procedural rules to govern military tribunals. Those rules are set forth in Military Commission Order No. 1 (\"M.C.O. No. 1\"), issued in March 2002 and amended in 2005. The instructions set forth the elements of some crimes that may be tried by military commission, establish guidelines for civilian attorneys, and provide other administrative guidance and procedures for military commissions. Additionally, Major General John D. Altenburg, Jr. (retired), the Appointing Authority for the commissions, issued several Appointing Authority Regulations, governing disclosure of communications, interlocutory motions, and professional responsibility.", "In August 2005, DOD amended M.C.O. No. 1 to make the presiding officer function more like a judge and to have other panel members function more like a jury. Under the new rules, the presiding officer was assigned the responsibility of determining most questions of law while the other panel members were to make factual findings and decide any sentence, similar to courts-martial proceedings. Other provisions were modified to clarify the accused's privilege to be present except when necessary to protect classified information and only in instances where the presiding officer concludes that the admission of such evidence would not prejudice a fair trial and to require that the presiding officer exclude any evidence that would result in the denial of a full and fair trial from lack of access to the information.", "President Bush determined that twenty of the detainees at the U.S. Naval Station in Guant\u00e1namo Bay are subject to the M.O. and may consequently be charged and tried before military commissions. Six detainees declared eligible in 2003 included two citizens of the U.K. and one Australian citizen. After holding discussions with the British and Australian governments regarding the trial of their citizens, the Administration agreed that none of those three detainees will be subject to the death penalty. The Administration agreed to modify some of the rules with respect to trials of Australian detainees and agreed to return the U.K. citizens, including the two who had been declared eligible for trial by military commission, to Great Britain. The Administration agreed to return one Australian citizen, but another, David Hicks has been charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes; attempted murder by an unprivileged belligerent and aiding the enemy. One citizen from Yemen and one from the Sudan were formally charged with conspiracy to commit certain violations of the law of war (and other crimes triable by military commission). Salim Ahmed Hamdan of Yemen, accused of providing physical security for Osama bin Laden and other high ranking Al Qaeda members and charged with conspiracy to attack civilians, commit murder by an unprivileged belligerent and terrorism, provided the Supreme Court its first opportunity to address the validity of the military commissions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Hamdan v. Rumsfeld", "paragraphs": ["Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who was captured in Afghanistan and is alleged to have worked for Osama Bin Laden as a body guard and driver, brought this challenge to the lawfulness of the Secretary of Defense's plan to try him for alleged war crimes before a military commission, arguing that the military commission rules and procedures were inconsistent with the UCMJ and that he had the right to be treated as a prisoner of war under the Geneva Conventions. U.S. District Judge Robertson agreed, finding no inherent authority in the President as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to create such tribunals outside of the existing statutory authority, with which the military commission rules did not comply. He also concluded that the Geneva Conventions apply to the whole of the conflict in Afghanistan, including under their protections all persons detained in connection with the hostilities there, and that Hamdan was thus entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war until his status was determined to be otherwise by a competent tribunal, in accordance with article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention (prisoners of war).", "Interpreting the UCMJ in light of the Geneva Conventions, which permits the punishment of prisoners of war \"only if the sentence has been pronounced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power,\" Judge Robertson found no congressional authority for Hamdan's trial under the DOD's rules for military commissions. Hamdan, he ruled, was not \"an offender triable by military tribunal under the law of war\" within the meaning of UCMJ art 21. Further, he found the rules established by DOD to be fatally inconsistent with the UCMJ, contrary to UCMJ art. 36 because they give military authorities the power to exclude the accused from hearings and deny him access to evidence presented against him.", "The government appealed, arguing that the district court should not have interfered in the military commission prior to its completion, that Hamdan is not entitled to protection from the Geneva Conventions, and that the President has inherent authority to establish military commissions, which need not conform to statutes regulating military courts-martial. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the government's argument that the federal courts had no jurisdiction to interfere in ongoing commission proceedings, but otherwise agreed with the government. Writing for a unanimous court, Judge Randolph reversed the lower court's finding, ruling that the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable, that even if they were, Hamdan is not entitled to their protections, and that in any event, the military commission would qualify as a \"competent tribunal\" where Hamdan may challenge his non-POW status, within the meaning of U.S. Army regulations implementing the Conventions.", "The appellate court did not accept the government's argument that the President has inherent authority to create military commissions without any authorization from Congress, but found such authority in the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF), read together with UCMJ arts. 21 and 36. The court interpreted art. 36 to mean that military commission rules have only to be consistent with those articles of the UCMJ that refer specifically to military commissions, and not that Congress meant to incorporate procedural rules for courts-martial into those applicable to military commissions. However, because the procedural rules to be used by the military commissions did not, in its view, affect jurisdiction, the court found it unnecessary to resolve the issue at the interlocutory stage of the case.", "With respect to the Geneva Conventions, the D.C. Circuit cited to a footnote from the World War II Eisentrager opinion that expresses doubt that the Court could grant relief based directly on the 1929 Geneva Convention:", "We are not holding that these prisoners have no right which the military authorities are bound to respect. The United States, by the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2021, concluded ... an agreement upon the treatment to be accorded captives. These prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection. It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities. Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention.", "Judge Williams wrote a concurring opinion, agreeing with the government's conception of the conflict with Al Qaeda as separate from the conflict with the Taliban but construing Common Article 3 to apply to any conflict with a non-state actor, without regard to the geographical confinement of such a conflict within the borders of a signatory state. Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts concurred in the opinion without writing separately.", "The Supreme Court granted review and reversed.", "Before reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court dispensed with the government's argument that Congress had, by passing the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), stripped the Court of its jurisdiction to review habeas corpus challenges by or on behalf of Guantanamo detainees whose petitions had already been filed. The government's argument that the petitioner had no rights conferred by the Geneva Conventions that could be adjudicated in federal court likewise did not persuade the Court to dismiss the case. Regardless of whether the Geneva Conventions provide rights that are enforceable in Article III courts, the Court found that Congress, by incorporating the \"law of war\" into UCMJ art. 21, brought the Geneva Conventions within the scope of law to be applied by courts. The Court disagreed that the Eisentrager case requires another result, noting that the Court there had decided the treaty question on the merits based on its interpretation of the Geneva Convention of 1929 and that the 1949 Conventions were drafted to reject that interpretation. Justice Scalia, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, dissented, arguing that the DTA should be interpreted to preclude the Court's review.", "In response to the holding by the court below that Hamdan, as a putative member of al Qaeda, was not entitled to any of the protections accorded by the Geneva Conventions, the Court concluded that at the very least, Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies, even to members of al Qaeda, according to them a minimum baseline of protections, including protection from the \"passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\" Although recognizing that Common Article 3 \"obviously tolerates a great degree of flexibility in trying individuals captured during armed conflict\" and that \"its requirements are general ones, crafted to accommodate a wide variety of legal systems,\" the Court found that the military commissions under M.C.O. No. 1 do not meet these criteria. In particular, the military commissions are not \"regularly constituted\" because they deviate too far, in the Court's view, from the rules that apply to courts-martial, without a satisfactory explanation of the need for such deviation.", "With respect to the authority to create the military commissions, the Court held that any power to create them must flow from the Constitution and must be among those \"powers granted jointly to the President and Congress in time of war.\" It disagreed with the government's position that Congress had authorized the commissions either when it passed the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) or the DTA. Although the Court assumed that the AUMF activated the President's war powers, it did not view the AUMF as expanding the President's powers beyond the authorization set forth in the UCMJ. The Court also noted that the DTA, while recognizing the existence of military commissions, does not specifically authorize them. At most, these statutes \"acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the 'Constitution and laws,' including the law of war.\"", "In addition to limiting military commissions to trials of offenders and offenses that are by statute or by the law of war consigned to such tribunals, the UCMJ provides limitations with respect to the procedural rules that may be employed. Article 36 (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 836) authorizes the President to prescribe rules for \"pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including modes of proof, for cases arising under this chapter triable in courts-martial, military commissions and other military tribunals.\" Such rules are to \"apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts\" insofar as the President \"considers practicable\" but that \"may not be contrary to or inconsistent\" with the UCMJ. In addition, rules made pursuant to this authority \"shall be uniform insofar as practicable.\" The President had determined with respect to the military commissions that \"it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern 'the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts'\" but made no determination with respect to the practicability of applying rules different from those that apply in courts-martial.", "The Court interpreted article 36 to provide the President discretion to determine which federal court rules need not be applied by various military tribunals due to their impracticability. However, the Court read the uniformity requirement as according less discretion to the President to determine what is practicable when providing different rules for courts-martial, military commissions, and other military tribunals. Unlike the requirement for rules to track closely with federal court rules, which the President need follow only insofar as he deems practicable, the Court reasoned, the uniformity requirement applies unless its application is demonstrably impracticable. Thus, less deference was found owing, and the Court found that the government had failed to demonstrate that circumstances make any courts-martial rules impracticable for use in military commissions. Further, the Court found that some of the rules provided in the Defense Department rules set forth in Military Commission Order No. 1 (\"M.C.O. No. 1\"), in particular the provision allowing the exclusion of the defendant from attending portions of his trial or hearing some of the evidence against him, deviated substantially from the procedures that apply in courts-martial in violation of UCMJ article 36."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Defense Rules for Military Commissions", "paragraphs": ["M.C.O.

The Hamdan Court found the rules insufficient to meet UCMJ standards and noted that the review process was not sufficiently independent of the armed services to warrant the Court's abstention until the petitioner's case was finally decided. M.C.O. No. 1 also contains various mechanisms for safeguarding sensitive government information, which the Court found problematic in that they could have permitted evidence to be withheld from the accused but nevertheless considered by the military commission. The Hamdan Court left open the possibility that the rules established by M.C.O.

It has been argued that the constitutional and statutory authority of the President to establish military tribunals does not extend any further than Congress' authorization to use armed force in response to the attacks. Under a literal interpretation of the M.O., however, the President may designate as subject to the order any non-citizen he believes has ever engaged in any activity related to international terrorism, no matter when or where these acts took place. A person subject to the M.O. may be detained and possibly tried by military tribunal for violations of the law of war and \"other applicable law.\"", "M.C.O. No. 1 does not explicitly limit its coverage to the scope of the authorization of force, but it clarifies somewhat the ambiguity with respect to the offenses covered. M.C.O. No. 1 establishes that commissions may be convened to try aliens who are designated by the President as subject to the M.O., whether captured overseas or on U.S. territory, for violations of the law of war and \"all other offenses triable by military commissions.\" Although this language is somewhat narrower than \"other applicable law,\" it remains vague. However, the statutory language recognizing the jurisdiction of military commissions is similarly vague, such that the M.C.O. does not appear on its face to exceed the statute with respect to jurisdiction over offenses. Justice Stevens, joined in that portion of the Hamdan opinion by only three other Justices, undertook an inquiry of military commission precedents to determine that \"conspiracy\" is not a valid charge. M.C.O. No. 1 does not resolve the issue of whether the President may, consistent with the Constitution, direct that criminal statutes defined by Congress to be dealt with in federal court be redefined as \"war crimes\" to be tried by the military, but the Hamdan decision may be interpreted to counsel against such an interpretation.", "By statute, military tribunals may be used to try \"offenders or offenses designated by statute or the law of war.\" There are only two statutory offenses for which convening a military commission is explicitly recognized: aiding the enemy and spying (in time of war). It appears that \"offenses designated by the law of war\" are not necessarily synonymous with \"offenses against the law of war.\" Military tribunals may also be used to try civilians in occupied territory for ordinary crimes. During a war, they may also be used to try civilians for committing belligerent acts, even those for which lawful belligerents would be entitled to immunity under the law of war, but only where martial law or military government may legally be exercised or on the battlefield, where civilian courts are closed. Such acts are not necessarily offenses against the law of war (that is, they do not amount to an international war crime), but are merely unprivileged under it, although courts and commentators have tended to use the terms interchangeably. Justice Stevens opined for the plurality that military commissions in the present circumstances have jurisdiction only for belligerent offenses and that martial law and military occupation courts will not serve as precedent for jurisdiction purposes.", "Some argue that civilians, including unprivileged combatants unaffiliated with a state (or other entity with \"international personality\" necessary for hostilities to amount to an \"armed conflict\"), are not directly subject to the international law of war and thus may not be prosecuted for violating it. They may, however, be prosecuted for most belligerent acts under ordinary domestic law, irrespective of whether such an act would violate the international law of war if committed by a soldier. Under international law, those offenders who are entitled to prisoner of war (POW) status under the Third Geneva Convention [\"GPW\"] are entitled to be tried by court-martial and may not be tried by a military commission offering fewer safeguards than a general court-martial, even if those prisoners are charged with war crimes. In the case of a non-international conflict, Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions protects even non-POWs from the \"passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Subject-Matter Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["M.C.I. No. 2, Crimes and Elements for Trials by Military Commission, details some of the crimes that might be subject to the jurisdiction of the commissions.

The final version appears to have incorporated some of the revisions, though not all, suggested by those who offered comments. The revision clarifies that the burden of proof is on the prosecution, precludes liability for ex post facto crimes, adds two new war crimes, and clearly delineates between war crimes and \"other offenses triable by military commission.\"", "M.C.I. No. 2 clarifies that the crimes and elements derive from the law of war, but does not provide any references to international treaties or other sources that comprise the law of war. The instruction does not purport to be an exhaustive list; it is intended as an illustration of acts punishable under the law of war or triable by military commissions. \"Aiding the enemy\" and \"spying\" are included under the latter group, but are not defined with reference to the statutory authority in UCMJ articles 104 and 106 (though the language is very similar). Terrorism is also defined without reference to the statutory definition in title 18, U.S. Code. Although the Supreme Court long ago stated that charges of violations of the law of war tried before military commissions need not be as exact as those brought before regular courts, it appears that the current Court will look more favorably on prosecutions where charges are fully supported by precedent.", "It appears that \"offenses triable by military commissions\" in both the M.O. and M.C.O. No. 1 could cover ordinary belligerent acts carried out by unlawful combatants, regardless of whether they are technically war crimes. The draft version of M.C.I. No. 2 made explicit that", "Even an attack against a military objective that normally would be permitted under the law of armed conflict could serve as the basis for th[e] offense [of terrorism] if the attack itself constituted an unlawful belligerency (that is, if the attack was committed by an accused who did not enjoy combatant immunity).", "Thus, under the earlier draft language, it appeared that a Taliban fighter who attacked a U.S. or coalition soldier, or perhaps even a soldier of the Northern Alliance prior to the arrival of U.S. forces, for example, could be charged with \"terrorism\" and tried by a military tribunal.", "However, the final version of M.C.I. No.2 substituted the following language:", "The requirement that the conduct be wrongful for this crime necessitates that the conduct establishing the offense not constitute an attack against a lawful military objective undertaken by military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties.", "The change appears to have eliminated the possibility that Taliban fighters could be charged with \"terrorism\" in connection with combat activities; however, under the DOD rules, such a fighter could still be charged with murder or destruction of property \"by an unprivileged belligerent\" for participating in combat, as long as the commission finds that the accused \"did not enjoy combatant immunity,\" which, according the to the instruction, is enjoyed only by \"lawful combatants.\" \"Lawful combatant\" is not further defined. Inasmuch as the President had declared that all of the detainees incarcerated at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, whether members of the Taliban or members of Al Qaeda, are unlawful combatants, it appears unlikely that the defense of combat immunity would be available. It is unclear whether other defenses, such as self-defense or duress, would be available to the accused. M.C.I.

It has not traditionally been applied to conduct occurring on the territory of neutral states or on the territory of a belligerent that lies outside the zone of battle, to conduct that preceded the outbreak of hostilities, or to conduct during hostilities that do not amount to an armed conflict. With respect to the international conflict in Afghanistan, in which coalition forces ousted the Taliban government, it appears relatively clear when and where the law of war would apply. The war on terrorism, however, does not have clear boundaries in time or space, nor is it entirely clear who the belligerents are. The broad reach of the M.O. to encompass conduct and persons customarily subject to ordinary criminal law evoked criticism that the claimed jurisdiction of the military commissions exceeds the customary law of armed conflict, which M.C.I. No. 2 purports to restate. Any military commissions established to comply with Hamdan will likely have a better chance of withstanding court scrutiny if they are supported by ample precedent or explicit statutory definition.", "A common element among the crimes enumerated in M.C.I. No.2 is that the conduct \"took place in the context of and was associated with armed conflict.\" The instruction explains that the phrase requires a \"nexus between the conduct and armed hostilities,\" which has traditionally been a necessary element of any war crime. However, the definition of \"armed hostilities\" is broader than the customary definition of war or \"armed conflict.\" \"Armed hostilities\" need not be a declared war or \"ongoing mutual hostilities.\" Instead, any hostile act or attempted hostile act might have sufficient nexus if its severity rises to the level of an \"armed attack,\" or if it is intended to contribute to such acts. Some commentators have argued that the expansion of \"armed conflict\" beyond its customary bounds improperly expands the jurisdiction of military commissions beyond those that by statute or under the law of war are triable by military commissions. The Supreme Court has not clarified the scope of the \"Global War on Terrorism\" but seems to have demonstrated a willingness to address the issue rather than deferring to the President's interpretation.", "The definition for \"Enemy\" provided in M.C.I. No. 2 raises similar issues. According to \u00a7 5(B), \"Enemy\" includes", "any entity with which the United States or allied forces may be engaged in armed conflicts or which is preparing to attack the United States. It is not limited to foreign nations, or foreign military organizations or members thereof. \"Enemy\" specifically includes any organization of terrorists with international reach.", "Some observers argue that this impermissibly subjects suspected international criminals to the jurisdiction of military commissions in circumstances in which the law of armed conflict has never applied.

The rules also permit the appointment of persons temporarily commissioned by the President to serve as officers in the armed services during a national emergency. The presiding officer is required to be a judge advocate in any of the U.S. armed forces, but not necessarily a military judge.", "The presiding officer is vested with the authority to decide evidentiary matters and interlocutory motions, or to refer them to the commission or certify them to Appointing Authority for decision.

Presumably this power was to include not only military and civilian attorneys but also any witnesses who had been summoned under order of the Secretary of Defense pursuant to M.C.O. No. 1 \u00a7 5(A)(5). The UCMJ authorizes military commissions to punish contempt with a fine of $100, confinement for up to 30 days, or both. Under the UCMJ, a duly subpoenaed witness who is not subject to the UCMJ and who refuses to appear before a military commission may be prosecuted in federal court. To the extent that M.C.O. No. 1 would allow disciplinary measures against civilian witnesses who refuse to testify or produce other evidence as ordered by the commission, M.C.O. No. 1 would appear to be inconsistent with the UCMJ.", "One of the perceived shortcomings of the M.O. has to do with the problem of command influence over commission personnel. M.C.O. No. 1 provides for a \"full and fair trial,\" but contains few specific safeguards to address the issue of impartiality. Under the rules as presently written, the President would have complete control over the proceedings. He or his designee decide which charges to press, select the members of the panel, the prosecution and the defense counsel, select the members of the review panel, and approve and implement the final outcome. The procedural rules remain entirely under the control of the President or his designees, who are vested with authority to write them, interpret them, enforce them, and amend them at any time. All commission personnel other than the commission members themselves are under the supervision of the Secretary of Defense, directly or through the DOD General Counsel.

Trials may be closed only where the following test is met: the party seeking closure demonstrates an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced; the closure is narrowly tailored to protect that interest; the trial court has considered reasonable alternatives to closure; and the trial court makes adequate findings to support the closure.

The provision specifically allows the introduction of such alternative evidence to protect classified \"sources, methods, or activities by which the United States acquired the evidence\" as long as the evidence is \"reliable.\" The military judge may require that the defense and the commission members be permitted to view an unclassified summary of the sources, methods, or activities, to the extent practicable and consistent with national security.
