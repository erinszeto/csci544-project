Operating under the auspices of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the MEP system includes centers in all 50 states and Puerto Rico.", "NIST provides funding to support MEP center operations, with matching funds provided by nonfederal sources (e.g., state governments, fees for services). Initially established with a goal of transferring technology developed in federal laboratories to SMMs, MEP shifted its focus in the early 1990s to responding to needs identified by SMMs, including off-the-shelf technologies and business advice. As MEP evolved, its focus shifted to reducing manufacturing costs through lean production, quality, and other programs targeting plant efficiencies and to increasing profitability through growth. Current MEP efforts focus on innovation and growth strategies, cybersecurity, commercialization, lean production, process improvements, workforce training, supply chain optimization, and exporting.", "In 2017, NIST completed a system-wide revamp of MEP to better align center funding levels with the national distribution of manufacturing activity and to result in a single center in each state and Puerto Rico. Other objectives included aligning center activities to the NIST MEP strategic plan; aligning center activities with state and local strategies; providing opportunities for new partnering arrangements; and restructuring and reinvigorating the boards of local centers.", "As originally conceived, the centers were intended to become self-supporting after six years. The original legislation provided for a 50% federal cost-share for the first three years of operation, followed by declining levels of federal support for the final three years; federal funding after a center's sixth year of operation was prohibited. In 1998, Congress eliminated the prohibition on federal funding after year six. In 2017, Congress authorized NIST to provide up to 50% of the capital and annual operating and maintenance funds required to establish and support a center. Previously, the federal cost-share was limited to 50% for a center's first three years of operation, 40% in year four, and one-third in fifth and subsequent years.", "The MEP program has, at times, been included in discussions surrounding termination of federal programs that provide direct support for industry. Invoking the intent of the original legislation, President George W. Bush proposed in his FY2009 budget to eliminate federal funding for MEP and to provide for \"the orderly change of MEP centers to a self-supporting basis.\" Nevertheless, Congress appropriated $110 million for the program. Proponents assert that SMMs play a central role in the U.S. economy and that the MEP system provides assistance not otherwise available to SMMs. Some opponents have asserted that such services are available from other sources and that MEP inappropriately shifts a portion of the costs of these services to taxpayers.", "Continued federal support for MEP centers remains a point of contention. In his FY2018 budget, President Trump sought to eliminate federal support for MEP centers, requesting $6.0 million for the program's \"orderly wind down.\" The House committee-reported appropriations bill included $100 million for MEP, while the Senate committee-reported bill included $130.0 million.

Reflecting these ideas, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act ( P.L. 100-418 ) established a public-private program, now known as the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, to assist U.S.-based SMMs in identifying and adopting new technologies. The focus on SMMs derived from policymakers' perceptions of their contribution to job creation, innovation, and manufacturing. Research at that time indicated that SMMs produce 2.5 times more innovations per employee than large firms. Program advocates noted the efforts of other nations to provide technical and business assistance to their manufacturing communities through the establishment of manufacturing extension centers (see text box, \"MEP-Like Programs of Other Countries\").", "In 2015, there were 248,000 SMMs in the United States. These firms accounted for 98.5% of the nation's manufacturing enterprises and employed approximately 5.2 million people in 2015, approximately 44.4% of total U.S. manufacturing employment. ", "The improved use of technology by SMMs is seen by policymakers and business analysts as important to the competitiveness of American manufacturing firms. How a product is designed and produced often determines costs, quality, and reliability. Lack of attention to process technologies and techniques may be the result of various factors, including company finances, insufficient information, equipment shortages, and undervaluation of the benefits of technology. A key purpose of the MEP program is to address these issues through outreach and the application of expertise, technologies, and knowledge.", "NIST requires regular reporting by the centers, including the number and types of projects completed. According to NIST, from MEP's inception through FY2017, the program has worked with 94,033 manufacturers, leading to $111.3 billion in sales and $18.8 billion in cost savings, and has helped create more than 985,317 jobs.", "According to NIST MEP, for every dollar of federal investment, the MEP generates nearly $27.30 in new client investment and $27.20 in new sales growth for SMMs. NIST also asserts that MEP creates or retains one manufacturing job for every $1,291 in federal investment.", "A 2018 study performed by the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research using a constrained model (which assumes competition or displacement between firms), estimated that the services and activities of the MEP center added more than 219,000 jobs to the U.S. economy and $22.0 billion to GDP, producing a return of 14.5:1 to the U.S. Treasury, based on data provided by MEP clients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolution of the Program", "paragraphs": ["The MEP program was originally established in 1988 as the \"Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology.\" Over time, the program was referred to by a number of different names, including the Manufacturing Technology Centers program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program. The America COMPETES Reauthorization of 2010 codified the name of the program as the \"Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership\" and the centers as the \"Hollings Manufacturing Extension Centers.\" ", "From its inception through the mid-1990s, the MEP's principal emphasis was on", "establishing the national network\u2014making sure there was a center within reach of all the nation's manufacturers and linking those centers to one another so they could learn from and teach each other about how best to work with manufacturers.", "The first three centers were established in 1989. Four more were added in 1991 and 1992. In 1994, the number of MEP centers expanded substantially when NIST took over support of extension centers originally funded by the Department of Defense's Technology Reinvestment Project. This brought the number of centers to 44. NIST awarded additional centers in 1995-1996, increasing the total to 70 centers. Subsequent consolidation of centers in New York and Ohio brought the number of centers down to 60, including centers in each state and Puerto Rico.", "While the focus on helping SMMs has remained constant, the methods and tools used by MEP have evolved since its creation. An intent of the legislation that created the manufacturing extension effort was to provide cutting-edge technology developed by NIST and other federal laboratories to SMMs. Royalties and licensing fees paid to the centers by the SMMs for the use of these technologies were expected to make the centers self-sufficient after the initial six years of operation. Advanced, federally funded technology, however, did not prove to be what most SMMs needed. Rather, their needs proved to be much more basic, including off-the-shelf technologies and business advice on topics such as management information technology, financial management systems, and business processes. A 1991 assessment of the program by the General Accounting Office (GAO, now the Government Accountability Office) concluded that", "While legislation establishing the Manufacturing Technology Centers Program emphasized the transfer of advanced technologies being developed at federal laboratories, the centers have found that their clients primarily need proven technologies. Thus, a key mandate of this program is not realistically aligned with the basic needs of most small manufacturers [emphasis added]... [A]ccording to officials from professional and trade associations representing small manufacturers and the results of key studies on U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, such advanced, laboratory-based technologies are not practical for most small manufacturers because these technologies generally are expensive, untested, and too complex. ", "In recognition of this situation, the program was reoriented to offer more basic technologies that helped SMMs to improve their productivity and competitive position. By the mid-1990s, MEP was providing \"a wide range of business services, including helping companies (1) solve individual manufacturing problems, (2) obtain training for their workers, (3)\u00a0create marketing plans, and (4) upgrade their equipment and computers.\" As articulated in the NIST Manufacturing Innovation blog, ", "The initial services were focused on solving immediate and short-term problems\u2014point solutions. The philosophy was an engineering one: 'You have a problem. We can fix it.'", "Over time, the MEP's focus moved from point solutions to more strategic, integrated services. In 2010, the \"overarching strategy\" for the MEP program was to reduce manufacturing costs through \"lean, quality, and other programs targeting plant efficiencies\" and to increase profitability \"through business growth services resulting in new sales, new markets, and new products.\" ", "Current MEP efforts focus on innovation strategies, commercialization, lean production, process improvements, workforce training, supply chain optimization, and exporting. One of the key areas of the MEP strategy is technology acceleration. MEP defines technology acceleration as", "integrating technology into the products, processes, services and business models of manufacturers to solve manufacturing problems or pursue opportunities and facilitate competitiveness and enhance manufacturing growth. Technology acceleration spans the innovation continuum and can include aspects of technology transfer, technology transition, technology diffusion, technology deployment and manufacturing implementation.", "Technology acceleration encompasses MEP efforts to assist SMMs in the improvement of existing products, the development of new products, and the development and improvement of manufacturing processes. MEP assists SMMs in this regard through a variety of approaches including technology scouting and transfer; supplier scouting; business-to-business network pilots; lean product development; technology-driven market intelligence; access to capital; cooperative research and development activities with NIST laboratories; and use of other federal programs such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, the Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AmTech) Consortia program, and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI, also known as Manufacturing USA).

At the same time, client fees for service decreased 13.4% between FY2008 and FY2009, the first significant decline since FY1996. Advocates of increasing the federal share noted that such action would permit continued outreach to small manufacturers without pricing the services out of reach for the very small manufacturers. Opponents of this approach argued that the one-third federal contribution was sufficient and that the successful operation of the program was dependent on the financial participation of state and local government as well as the companies utilizing the centers.

Instead, we have identified a number of factors that could be taken into account in considering modifications to the current cost-share structure. Among other things, past GAO work has found that cost-share structures should promote equity by assigning costs to those who both use and benefit from the services.

GAO concluded that it was unable to provide such recommendations as it could not identify criteria or a basis for determining the optimal cost-share structure for this program. However, GAO cited a number of factors that could be taken into account in modifying the existing cost-share structure including promoting equity by assigning costs to those who both use and benefit from the services.

Fifteen percent indicated that there was no effect at all. Among the impacts identified were improved use of technology (63%), better product quality (61%), and expanded productivity (56%). According to GAO, this suggested that manufacturing extension activities \"had some success in achieving their primary goal of helping manufacturers improve their operations through the use of appropriate technologies and through increases in product quality and worker productivity.\" The study also found that companies which used internal funding to implement recommendations offered by extension programs were the most likely to find an overall positive impact. \"Significantly, approximately 97 percent of [these respondents] ... said that they believed that this investment had been worthwhile.\" Those who utilized these organizations noted that practical experience in the field contributed to the success of staff activities, as did the affordability of the assistance. Companies that did not utilize the resources provided by the MEP tended to be those that were unaware of the program and the opportunities associated with it.", "Further refining this information in a March 1996 report, GAO also noted that company size and age were significant factors in business perceptions of the extension program. Smaller (under $1 million gross sales) and newer (established after 1985) firms \"were most likely to report that their overall business performance was boosted by MEP assistance.\" While there were no real differences in perception between extension services offered by NIST and those funded by other institutions, there was a difference in assessments of effectiveness based on whether or not payment was required.
