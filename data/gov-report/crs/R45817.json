It achieved rapid growth following a postindependence civil war (1977-1992), but faces a range of political, economic, and security challenges. These include a political scandal over state-guaranteed, allegedly corrupt bank loans received by state-owned firms, which created public debt that the government did not disclose to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This placed the country's relations with the IMF at risk and has had major negative repercussions for the economy, donor relations, and Mozambique's governance record. Other challenges include unmet development needs, a range of governance shortcomings, organized crime, an ongoing economic slump, and political conflict and violence involving both mainstream political actors and violent extremists. Mozambique is also recovering from two powerful cyclones that hit the country in March and April 2019 (addressed in CRS Report R45683, Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Southeastern Africa: Humanitarian and Recovery Response in Brief ).", "Between 2013 and 2016, the country experienced political violence arising from a dispute between the former socialist majority party, FRELIMO, and the leading opposition political party, RENAMO. (The latter is a former armed rebel group that fought the FRELIMO government during the civil war.) Their recent dispute, prompted by years of varied RENAMO grievances linked to FRELIMO's control of the state, led to numerous armed clashes between government and RENAMO forces. In 2019, the two parties signed a permanent cease-fire and a final political and military accord to end their dispute, but they have yet to fully implement those agreements, and the potential for failure remains. Since late 2017, Mozambique also has faced attacks by a violent Islamist extremist group that is active along its far northern coast. The group\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as Al Sunnah wa Jama'ah (ASWJ), among other names\u00e2\u0080\u0094has killed hundreds, often via beheading.", "The loan scandal has had far-reaching consequences: It has spurred local and U.S. criminal prosecutions, led some donor governments to suspend aid, undermined the state's credibility, and placed the country in debt distress, reducing its access to credit financing needed to help fund development and government operations. The scandal also is widely seen as contributing to a post-2015 slump in economic growth, which had been rapid for most of the post-civil war period. While that growth expanded the economy and contributed to a decline in extreme poverty, the majority of Mozambicans have remained poor, and while some socioeconomic indicators have improved, the country faces a range of persistent socioeconomic challenges. Development gains have remained limited despite large inflows of foreign assistance and foreign direct investment (FDI). Much of this FDI has financed large industrial projects, many of which have been criticized for being poorly integrated with the broader domestic economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which the informal sector and small-scale economic activity prevail\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for generating relatively few jobs or broad reductions in poverty.", "Mozambique's future may be transformed by the development of large natural gas reserves, discovered in the county's north in 2010. Gas exports are expected to begin in the early to mid-2020s and, together with rising exports of coal, to spur rapid economic growth. The U.S.-based firms Anadarko and ExxonMobil, the latter in partnership with Italy's ENI energy firm, lead international oil company consortia developing the reserves, although a merger involving Anadarko is likely to result in the sale of its Mozambique assets to France's Total SA. While the state may face challenges in effectively governing and managing the large anticipated influx of gas revenue, it has taken some steps to address such challenges. The government plans to establish a sovereign wealth fund to preserve gas income, which it intends to allocate, in part, to infrastructure development, poverty reduction, and economic diversification.", "U.S.-Mozambican ties are cordial and historically have centered on development cooperation. U.S. assistance, funded at an annual average of $452 million between FY2016 and FY2018, has focused primarily on health programs. Given recent events, U.S. engagement and aid may increasingly focus on the development of economic ties and security cooperation, notably to counter ASWJ, which is active in the area where large-scale gas processing development is underway. For many years, Mozambique received relatively limited congressional attention, but interest in the country may be growing; the country hosted congressional delegations in 2016 and 2018.

Prior to a resurgence of political tensions and violence in 2013 between FRELIMO and RENAMO, a former armed rebel movement that is now the main opposition party, Mozambique was widely viewed as having made a durable transition to peace after its postindependence civil war (1977-1992). It also made a transition, beginning in the late 1980s, from politically and economically centralized, one-party, socialist rule, to a multiparty democratic system underpinned by a largely market-based economy.

This downturn was preceded by nearly two decades of post-civil war economic expansion underpinned, in part, by inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) tied to large industrial projects. Mozambique has also received large inflows of foreign aid aimed at addressing its myriad development challenges. While there has been marked progress in reducing poverty rates and raising a range of once very low socioeconomic indicators, most Mozambicans (see Figure 1 ) have remained poor, and there are many unmet development needs. There also have been regional and demographic disparities regarding access to the fruits of growth. Large FDI-driven industrial projects prioritized by the state, for instance, have helped speed macroeconomic growth rates, but often have provided relatively few jobs or economic gains for the general population.", "Corruption and elite use of political influence to accumulate private wealth also have grown over the post-civil war period (see below), with worrisome implications for the economy and stability. The post-2015 economic decline followed disclosures that the government had failed to report to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over $2 billion in state-guaranteed debt, which violated the terms of Mozambique's cooperation with the IMF. Two foreign banks provided these loans, in an allegedly corrupt manner, to state-owned firms registered as private entities and controlled by state intelligence officials.", "This set of events, known as the \"hidden debt affair,\" has had far-reaching consequences. It has spurred an ongoing major political scandal, Mozambican and U.S. prosecutions, and aid suspensions by multiple donor governments (albeit not by the United States).

It is gradually overcoming a destabilizing political dispute spurred by long-standing RENAMO grievances over alleged electoral misconduct and continuous de facto FRELIMO control of the state. The dispute turned into a low-level armed conflict between RENAMO and state forces between 2013 and late 2016, when a temporary cease-fire was signed. It was later extended. In 2018, the two parties signed political and military agreements to end their dispute, and in August 2019 they signed a permanent cease-fire prior to signing a comprehensive peace accord. Since late 2017, the country also has faced a brutal insurgency by armed Islamist extremists in its far north, in an area where large-scale gas development operations are underway. Trafficking of persons, wildlife, and illicit drugs, along with other organized crime activity, also poses security challenges.", "Mozambique enjoys cordial relations with the United States and receives sizable U.S. global health assistance, but has received relatively limited congressional attention since the early 2000s. However, the country hosted congressional delegations in 2016 and 2018 that focused on such issues as U.S. health and wildlife aid and the RENAMO-FRELIMO conflict. Recent developments and policy challenges in Mozambique have the potential to draw increased congressional attention. These include increasing U.S. private-sector stakes in the energy sector, the implications of state corruption for the government's integrity and status as a U.S. development and investment partner, U.S. government counterterrorism concerns, and recovery from two powerful cyclones that hit the country in March and April 2019.

In 1977, RENAMO, a guerrilla group initially formed as a proxy of the white minority regime in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), initiated attacks against the socialist FRELIMO-led state, sparking a civil war. The war caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, social displacement, a mass refugee exodus into nearby countries, and widespread destitution. These effects were exacerbated by natural disasters, as well as by FRELIMO's abortive attempts to control the economy, which prompted a turn toward economic liberalization in the late 1980s. After internationally aided peace talks, a new constitution was ratified in 1990. Peace accords signed in 1992 ended the war and, along with U.N.-aided peacebuilding efforts, paved the way for RENAMO's transformation into a political party and multiparty elections in 1994.", "Postwar politics mainly have centered on intra-FRELIMO competition and polarized rivalry between FRELIMO, which has held an electoral majority since 1994, and RENAMO. Broad public postwar support for reconciliation and peacebuilding initially led to a system of informal bargaining among political elites over policymaking, giving RENAMO influence that it might not otherwise have had. Over time, however, FRELIMO increasingly wielded its electoral majority, aided by its strong influence over the electoral system, to marginalize RENAMO. ", "The country's constitution, which concentrates executive power in the office of the directly elected president, augmented FRELIMO's power, as did its influence over the economy and FDI flows. This was notably the case under former President Armando Guebuza (in office 2005-2015), a FRELIMO hardliner who accrued substantial private wealth. He centralized power in the presidency, appointed loyalists to state posts, and reportedly fostered an influential network of relatives and associates, many of whom used political ties to advance their business interests.", "Resentful of FRELIMO's continuous political and economic dominance and of not being allocated governorships in provinces where it claimed electoral majorities\u00e2\u0080\u0094and due to enduring bitterness over a narrow 1999 presidential election loss\u00e2\u0080\u0094RENAMO has routinely engaged in a politics of obstruction and protest.

While RENAMO's approach periodically won it concessions, such as incremental electoral reforms, Dhlakama often appeared to overplay his hand, making weighty demands that the FRELIMO government often rejected, either outright or after parliamentary debate. RENAMO was also considered to be afflicted by internal divisions, poor organization, and erratic leadership under Dhlakama. He also thwarted the emergence of rivals within the party, which helped spur the formation in 2009 of the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) by RENAMO dissidents led by Daviz Simango, the mayor of Beira, a key city. The MDM became the third-largest party in parliament in 2009 and nearly doubled its gains in the 2014 election. It also won four city elections in 2013, but lost all but Beira in 2018.", "Until 2013, periodic warnings by RENAMO that it might resort to coercion or violence to achieve its aims remained only threats, notwithstanding many small-scale, mostly unarmed confrontations between its supporters and authorities. Its potential to employ the force of arms, however, was always a risk, as the 1992 peace accords had permitted Dhlakama to maintain an armed personal protection unit with police-like powers. RENAMO also has long held the loyalty of ex-fighters who were not integrated into the national military at the end of the war, some with access to civil war-era arms caches and abiding postwar reintegration grievances."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "RENAMO-Government Armed Conflict", "paragraphs": ["In late 2012, Dhlakama retreated to his former wartime base and began to marshal a military force. In early 2013, RENAMO\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a manner reminiscent of its civil war tactics\u00e2\u0080\u0094launched armed attacks on police and military personnel, state facilities (e.g., health posts), and some civilian targets. Periodic clashes with state forces led to dozens of fatalities, including of civilians. Conflict waned for a time after a 2014 preelection cease-fire accord. RENAMO, however, dissatisfied with the 2014 election results and other responses to its demands, later abandoned the accord, and hostilities resumed. The renewed conflict, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported, featured \"enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, summary killings and destruction of private property allegedly committed by government forces, and political killings, attacks on public transport and looting of health clinics by alleged RENAMO forces.\"", "Throughout the conflict, there were numerous on-again-off-again peace talks and provisional agreements, but binding accord was stymied repeatedly by violence, brinksmanship, and intransigence by the two sides\u00e2\u0080\u0094and by RENAMO's often shifting demands. At the start of the conflict, these centered on electoral law reforms and equitable party representation on the electoral commission. Later, among other ends, RENAMO sought", "the inclusive and nonpartisan allocation of the fruits of economic growth, including extractive sector earnings; completion of the integration of an agreed number of RENAMO fighters into the military, command posts for RENAMO officers, and related demands; and an end to FRELIMO domination of the state, including through a process of increased political decentralization under which RENAMO would be allocated governorships in areas where it has claimed high rates of electoral support.", "A 2016 cease-fire largely halted hostilities, and in early 2018, President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi and Dhlakama negotiated a framework accord on political decentralization. Uncertainty over prospects for the agreement arose after Dhlakama's death in early May 2018, but weeks later parliament enacted a series of constitutional amendments largely in line with the accord. These provide for elected provincial, district, and municipal assemblies, and for the leading delegate of the party with a simple majority in each assembly to become the chief executive at that level (i.e., governor, district administrator, or mayor.) RENAMO's disarmament has remained a bone of contention for FRELIMO. After the May 2018 decentralization reforms, FRELIMO parliamentarians delayed action on additional legislation necessary to implement the reforms, pending RENAMO's disarmament. In July 2018, however, the government and RENAMO signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on RENAMO military integration and demobilization. Parliament then passed some decentralization laws, and in early August, an agreement for implementing the July military accord was signed. Tensions over RENAMO's claims of fraud in the October 2018 local elections slowed the demobilization process, as did late 2018 disputes over RENAMO integration into the military and police.

The DDR process was conducted by a committee of government and RENAMO military representatives and foreign military observers, including a U.S. officer. Six demobilizing RENAMO members handed over weapons. Why more did not turn in weapons is not clear from news accounts, but this outcome could raise questions over RENAMO's commitment to the process if it resulted from a deliberate decision by RENAMO to defer a more extensive handover of arms. DDR began on the same day that the parliament passed a law providing immunity from prosecution for those accused of crimes related to the post-2013 armed hostilities between the government and RENAMO. On August 1, 2019, President Nyusi and RENAMO leader Ossufo Momade signed an agreement making the 2016 cease-fire permanent, and on August 6 signed a final peace accord. The signing drew widespread international plaudits. During a September 2019 visit to Mozambique, Pope Francis strongly endorsed the accords and the message of reconciliation underlying them. He also warned against corruption and plundering of natural resources.", "On August 21, a parliamentary majority adopted the peace accords as law\u00e2\u0080\u0094though MDM, the third largest party, abstained, and 37 of 89 RENAMO legislators were absent. The law includes the two 2019 agreements accords, the August 2018 DDR agreement, and related documents on implementation and monitoring. Key outcomes are to include the final disarmament and DDR of all armed RENAMO elements, the decommissioning of RENAMO bases, the provision of police protection for senior RENAMO officials, and the integration of selected RENAMO elements into the police and military, including at unit command levels. The accord does not provide for a RENAMO role in the State Information and Security Service (SISE), a longstanding RENAMO demand; RENAMO reportedly views SISE as having played key roles in the government's post-2012 security operations against RENAMO. ", "International funding to support implementation of the accord is anticipated under the accords, which provide for a donor-funded \"basket fund,\" but do not specify which governments would contribute to the fund, the amounts needed, or what the fund would support. Press reports have suggested that an informal side agreement or \"elite bargain\" may exist under which \"significant monetary compensation\" might be paid to RENAMO leaders. Whether provided officially by donors or through unofficial supplementary arrangements, the allocation of funding for the peace process\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly any payments to individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0094could become contentious.", "Successful implementation of the accords would require progress on a number of fronts, including final passage of pending legislation relating to the decentralization of state power, a free, fair, and transparent electoral process, and completion of the DDR process for all of RENAMO's 5,000-plus fighters. Such demobilization could be hindered by internal RENAMO splits (see below) or if armed RENAMO members perceive that they face threats if they proceed with disarmament. The possible salience of the latter concern was underscored by RENAMO's mid-August claim that \"dozens\" of its members had \"been assaulted by police and members of the ruling Frelimo party across the country\" after the August 6 peace agreement was signed. RENAMO has also reported that its members have faced harassment and property arson, as well as removal of party flag displays, which it blames on government elements.", "Another potential hindrance to disarmament\u00e2\u0080\u0094and possibly to RENAMO's electoral prospects\u00e2\u0080\u0094are ongoing intra-RENAMO divisions. Such splits emerged in early 2019 when Momade replaced several top RENAMO civilian and military officials after he was elected president of RENAMO. In June 2019, a group of RENAMO combatants accused Momade\u00e2\u0080\u0094RENAMO's 2019 presidential candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0094of ethnically centered nepotism over the allocation of internal party and military integration posts. They also accused him of cooperating with the state intelligence service and of ordering the execution of two RENAMO officers. They demanded he resign, threatened to kill him if he did not, and asserted that demobilization would not proceed while he was leader. The group, whose members call themselves the RENAMO \"Junta Militar\" (military board), claim to represent RENAMO nationally and consider the peace accords null and void. They elected RENAMO general Mariano Nhongo as their leader in mid-August. A key Junta Militar grievance is their claim that Momade has \"excluded 60%\" of RENAMO forces from the DDR and security service integration process. The group also has called for elections to be postponed to enable Nhongo to compete in the electoral contest. ", "The Junta Militar may not be able to force a postponement of the election or displace Momade as national RENAMO leader. Observers and the opposition MDM party, however, see a need for the Junta's concerns to be addressed, as the group is a potential peace- and electoral-process spoiler. The Junta has threatened to violently halt the 2019 election, and press reports have attributed several attacks by unidentified assailants to the group, which reported in early September 2019 that the national military had attacked a Junta's base.

Prior to the vote, RENAMO threatened to deploy armed men to stop what it asserted were state efforts to rig the results. After the vote, opposition parties launched multiple legal appeals, but local courts reportedly rejected nearly all on technical grounds.

", "Pre-election voter registration in spring 2019 was controversial. Some 90% of voting-age adults reportedly registered to vote, but the process featured indications of possible manipulation by STAE, the election administration secretariat. STAE calculated an unusually high adult population in at least two historically pro-FRELIMO provinces and sent extra registration teams to those areas, while doing the opposite in Zambezia, a RENAMO stronghold. As a result, registration in several key pro-FRELIMO provinces exceeded the number of voting-age adults. On the basis of the larger electorate in Gaza, the national election commission, the CNE, awarded nine additional seats to the traditionally FRELIMO-leaning province. RENAMO appealed the registration in Gaza, but its case was thrown out on a technicality. ", "In August the CNE rejected a private organization's offer to audit the Gaza registration. The Gaza controversy also prompted the resignation of the head of the National Statistics Institute. He had faced sharp criticism from President Nyusi after strongly defending the integrity of the census data at the heart of questions over 2019 voter registrations in the province, thus bolstering questions over the integrity of the voter registration process. Another factor that could work in the government's favor is the impact of the large cyclones that hit the country March and April 2019, primarily in areas where RENAMO is viewed as enjoying positive electoral prospects. Thousands of potential voters in the affected region were displaced and/or lost identification or voter registration papers as a result of the storms and related flooding.

The group generally does not claim its attacks and has issued few statements about its goals. Some researchers report that the group espouses jihad (armed struggle against perceived enemies of Islam), the creation of a Sharia (Islamic law)-based state, and rejection of state institutions and services (e.g., education, taxation, and voting). Its ideas may be influenced by foreign Islamist ideologies, and by trade and social ties to the Swahili Coast, a cultural-linguistic and religious region extending northward to southern Somalia. Some accounts suggest that the group has been influenced, in particular, by Sheikh Aboud Rogo Mohammed, a Kenyan preacher whose Swahili-language teachings circulated widely in East Africa. Rogo, who was subject to U.S. and U.N. sanctions for supporting Somalia's Al Shabaab, was assassinated in 2012.", "ASWJ members reportedly initially proselytized locally to advance their beliefs and build a base of adherents, and later employed a mix of payments and coercion to recruit.

Other notably intense sources of local anger that the group may exploit include the loss of local agricultural and fishing livelihoods, the seizure of land by local and state elites, and nontransparency and corruption in compensation processes associated with the growth of the natural gas and gemstone mining industries. Other sources of local tension are rivalries, including over land and political party affiliation, between the mostly Catholic Makonde and mostly Muslim Mwani people, among other local ethnic groups.", "Some analysts believe that ASWJ is directly involved in illicit activity that is prevalent in the region. Others suggest that the group does \"not control any major contraband trade\" and that the \"illicit economy as a whole provides varied opportunities\" exploited by the group, which in the future could potentially become more deeply involved in illicit trafficking and other networks. Illicit activity in the affected region includes petty corruption (e.g., police and public services bribery), trafficking of heroin, persons, ivory and other poached wildlife items, gold, and gemstones, as well as illicit timber trade and an untaxed cross-border trade in consumer goods. State officials are key reported beneficiaries of such trade.", "State security forces' heavy-handed, arguably often ineffective responses to ASWJ violence also appear to have alienated local populations. Security forces reportedly often arrive at attack sites well after the insurgents have departed and arrest locals whom they identify as linked to the group, often on dubious grounds. Detainees have been beaten or treated inhumanely and illegally detained by military forces, or held by police without charges and beyond the legally permitted period.

In 1996, shortly after the war, 83% of the population lived on less than $1.90 a day (the international comparative poverty line, as measured in constant 2011 dollars); by 2014 (when last measured) 62.4% did so. Mozambicans have remained among the world's poorest people, with an estimated average GDP per capita of $476 in 2018 (current dollars)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the seventh-lowest globally, and down from a peak of $620 in 2014. In addition, income is unequally distributed. Similarly, while multiple social indicators have improved since the war (e.g., rates of child and maternal mortality and access to health care and education), they have advanced from a low starting point, and many remain poor by regional and global standards. Mozambique ranked 180 th among 189 countries assessed on the 2018 U.N. Human Development Index (HDI, a comparative statistical composite measure), and is making limited progress toward achieving most of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.", "Development gains may have remained limited due to a growth pattern in which FDI inflows have centered on large export-oriented industrial projects (e.g., bauxite smelting, power plants, mining, large-scale agriculture, and, recently, natural gas development). While such projects have helped spur high aggregate GDP growth rates, they often have functioned as commercial enclaves with weak linkages to the broader economy. Many such projects have generated relatively few permanent jobs or other benefits for the general population, and some have enjoyed state policy favoritism and tax breaks that tend to benefit project investors, rather than society at large. Financial gains from such activities have strongly favored politically connected elites involved in such projects as investor intermediaries, technical experts, regulators, and local business partners. Some megaprojects, such as large mines, have resulted in loss of farmland and population displacements, sometimes to marginal areas where subsistence farming is difficult. Some large projects, however, may be starting to benefit the broader society, as with extractive sector investment in multiuse infrastructure (e.g., roads and railways). ", "The disjuncture between the local economy and megaproject activity is significant. Most Mozambicans, an estimated 86% or more of the work force, make their living in the informal sector, often as subsistence and cash crop farmers, fishermen, and small-scale manufacturers and traders. Productivity within this large segment of the economy, however, is constrained by little access to credit, business training, or technical expertise. Youth unemployment is a particular challenge. Nearly 68% of Mozambicans are age 25 or younger, and many young people from rural areas, home to 65% of the population in 2017, often gravitate toward cities, where job growth has not kept up with increasing education and training rates\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though these are low.", "Mozambique's socioeconomic development gains have remained moderate, despite sizable inflows of net official development assistance (ODA). Such aid averaged $1.96 billion annually from 2008 through 2017, making the country the 15 th -largest recipient globally in the period, during which the United States provided an average of $367 million annually (19% of net ODA) and was the largest bilateral donor.

FDI peaked at $6.2 billion in 2013 but has since declined steadily, to $2.3 billion in 2017 (latest data), though levels remain far higher than prior to the discovery of gas. Mozambique is a top regional FDI destination; it received the sixth-largest FDI inflows in Africa in 2017. Its total FDI stock is also large; at $37.5 billion in 2017, it was the fourth-largest in Africa. Annual U.S. FDI into Mozambique from 2013 to 2017 averaged $824 million a year (18% of such FDI).", "Agriculture. Agriculture is the backbone of the domestic economy and plays an indirect role in ensuring stability, as a source both of incomes and affordable food for urban consumers. Mozambique has extensive agricultural land and water resources and favorable agro-climatic conditions in many areas, though soil quality is often nutrient-poor, and droughts and floods are frequent. In 2017, the sector employed an estimated 72% of the labor force and contributed about 21% of GDP. The sector is dominated by smallholders (about 90% of producers) but has attracted more than 400 large commercial investment projects over the past two decades. Such projects have centered on food production, sugar, tobacco, cotton, cashew nuts, biofuels, and timber, and attracted at least $6.5 billion in investment between 2002 and 2012. The sector, and notably agro-processing, remains a key source of FDI opportunities. ", "Notwithstanding agriculture's prominence in the economy and in state economic plans, for years the sector has reportedly received relatively limited state funding. Key challenges include low productivity rates and diverse constraints (e.g., relating to transport, input and credit access, and underinvestment in various areas), and contested land rights. The impacts of large FDI agro-projects have been mixed. Some have been given preferential access to prime land by the state and/or displaced smallholders, but a number have created jobs, often via smallholder contract farming involving the provision of technical assistance and inputs. Many also contribute to the national food supply; farming projects targeting local markets have enjoyed particular success.", "Mining . Mozambique is reported to have up to 25.6 billion tons of coal reserves, although the amount that may be recovered on economically favorable terms may be far smaller. Production and exports began in 2010 and have risen rapidly, notwithstanding a price-induced slump in coal export volumes in 2016. Mozambique is now Africa's second-largest coal producer (after South Africa). Coal exports contributed 45% of all export value in 2017 and are expected to rise. Mining of other resources is also growing. Exports of graphite (used in lithium ion batteries), titanium, and related ores (niobium and tantalum) are increasing: these exports contributed 4% of export value in 2017. Mozambique has long exported precious stones (3% of exports in 2017) and has other varied, largely untapped mineral and ore reserves.", "Power Sector . About 27% of Mozambicans had access to electricity in 2017. The power sector is a key focus of FDI and state investment, both for export and local use. Hydropower accounts for about 81% of installed capacity, but there are several coal, natural gas, and solar electricity generation projects underway, primarily for industrial and commercial use, and sizable further generation potential. Key challenges include grid weaknesses, regional domestic access disparities, poverty (i.e., an inability to pay), and regulatory and policy challenges (e.g., a need for price, market, and sector financing reforms). In 2017, the World Bank provided $150 million to upgrade the grid and improve the public utility. Mozambique also receives support under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Power Africa program.", "Natural Gas . Mozambique is estimated to have at least 100 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of proved reserves of natural gas (hereinafter, \"gas\"), placing it among the top 15 countries in terms of reserves. Some sources report far higher estimates, and further exploration and assessment is underway. Energy firms are building gas extraction and processing infrastructure to export output from the main reserves, which were discovered beginning in 2010 in a complex of offshore gas fields in the Rovuma Basin, a geologic zone in Mozambique's far north. Such activity is expected to grow; the IMF has projected that total Rovuma Basin investments may exceed $100 billion.

This failure to report violated its obligations to the IMF and created an ongoing scandal that led some donors to suspend some aid. The funds at issue, loans or securities syndicated by foreign private banks, went to three SOEs owned by the State Information and Security Service (SISE), the Defense Ministry, and other state agencies.

DOJ said the indictees \"created the maritime projects\" to divert parts of the financing to \"pay at least $200 million in bribes and kickbacks to themselves,\" state officials, and others.

No employees of VTB Bank were charged.", "DOJ also charged that \"to hide from the public and the IMF\" the fraud-related \"near bankruptcy\" of the SOEs, the indicted bankers proposed an exchange of Mozambican-issued Eurobonds for Credit Suisse securities sold to fund the Ematum loan. The state and Ematum's investors accepted the exchange in April 2016. The three SOEs then defaulted on their loans. ", "After the debts were revealed, the government resisted disclosing further information about the loans, but was forced to do so as a condition for continuing cooperation with IMF, which has publicly linked the loans to corruption. The IMF and the World Bank demanded an audit, which the independent firm Kroll Associates conducted on behalf of Mozambique's national prosecutor. The government restricted Kroll's access to documents, but the firm was able to identify $713 million in apparent deal price inflation and $500 million in unaccounted-for financing. Mozambique's parliament also investigated the loans, and national judicial authorities are pursuing criminal prosecutions, although local civil society groups have criticized these efforts as slow and selective. Local arrests in the case, including a son of ex-President Guebuza, SISE officials, and other high-profile figures, began only after the U.S. indictment was issued.", "In late 2018, Chang was arrested in South Africa on a U.S. extradition warrant, but South African officials instead accepted an extradition request from Mozambique. In late May 2019, the government and its creditors provisionally agreed to restructure the Ematum Eurobond bonds and $535 million in VTB MAM debts, though further negotiation is likely. The case has generated multiple lawsuits, including a government effort to negate portions of the debt. Two of the indicted bankers have pled guilty to various charges.
