That fund has provided for an additional $250 million annually in mandatory spending to provide airports with grants to airports for accommodating explosives detection equipment. While appropriations debate has proceeded under the assumption that this fund would not be authorized in FY2008, a provision in P.L. 110-53 extended authorization of the Aviation Security Capital Fund through 2028.", "Based on studies of checked baggage explosives detection screening over the next 20 years, the House report ( H.Rept. 110-181 ) expresses considerable concern over the ability to meet long-term spending needs for EDS refurbishing and replacement, next-generation EDS deployment, and modifications to airport infrastructure to accommodate checked baggage screening equipment and operations. The additional funds for EDS procurement and installation specified in the House bill are intended to expedite EDS deployment among all airports, replace aging explosives trace detection (ETD) machines at larger airports, and deploy new ETD machines at any newly federalized small airports and heliports. The House report urges the TSA to further explore consolidating checkpoint and checked baggage screening at smaller airports as a means for improving screening efficiency.", "The House bill also specifies $250 million for checkpoint support, $114 million (84%) above the requested amount, to pilot testing and deployment of advanced checkpoint technologies such as: whole body imaging systems; liquid explosives detectors; and automated explosives detection systems. The additional funding would also support any additional checkpoint infrastructure requirements to carry out a pilot program for screening airport workers at up to seven airports. Under screener workforce funding, the bill also adds an additional $5 million for labor costs associated with this pilot. The total appropriation for the screener workforce is, nonetheless, slightly less than the Administration request reflecting partial funding of the requests for travel document checker and behavior detection screener initiatives. The bill, however, lifts the longstanding cap of 45,000 full-time equivalent screeners, although a minority view printed in the House report expressed concern that without the cap \"TSA will go back to its old ways of solving screener problems by simply adding more people\u2014a very short-sighted and costly solution.\" With regard to private, non-TSA screening, the bill provides roughly $3 million above the requested amount to implement private screening to small airports and heliports that start up commercial air service.", "The bill provides $73 million for air cargo security, $17 million above the President's request.

However, those bills did not consider the additional $250 million in nondiscretionary deposits from passenger security fees to the Checkpoint Screening Security Fund, established under P.L. 110-53 . Nor did the original bills consider the reauthorization of Aviation Security Capital Fund, at its nondiscretionary funding level of $250 million, also from passenger security fees. Adding these sums to discretionary appropriations provided in the Act yields a total of $5,309 million, which is a slight decrease in funding compared with FY2007 base and supplemental appropriations for aviation security, plus the $250 million placed in the Aviation Security Capital Fund, which totaled $5,372 million. The FY2008 appropriations, however, provided the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) with $770 million, $56 million more than the FY2007 enacted level, and $48 million more than the amount specified in the President's request and passed by both the House and the Senate.", "Differences in amounts specified for specific budget activities for aviation security compared with the House-passed and Senate-passed bills largely reflect budgetary shifts created by the reauthorization of the Aviation Security Capital Fund and the creation of the Checkpoint Screening Security Fund. Specifically, EDS/ETD installation and purchase received an appropriation of $294 million, $266 million less than the House-passed amount and $235 million less than the Senate-passed amount. This, combined with the $250 million in collections to be deposited into the Aviation Security Capital Fund, yields a total of $544 million, which represents a rough compromise between the House-passed and Senate-passed funding levels rather than a sizable budget cut. Similarly, to account for the creation of the Checkpoint Screening Security Fund, Division E of P.L. 110-161 eliminated funding for the Checkpoint Support activity, which the House had proposed to fund at the same level this fund provides for (i.e., $250 million), whereas the President's request and the Senate had both specified $136 million for this activity. Thus, the net result on the TSA's budget for checkpoint-related technologies is in line with the House-passed funding amount. The FY2008 appropriations measure provides for slightly higher amounts for screener PC&B and training, largely to support additional hiring and training of Behavioral Detection Officers (BDOs), travel document checkers, and bomb appraisal officers (BAOs).", "Air cargo security funding was increased to $73 million, in line with the House-passed amount. The increase is for additional canine teams, inspectors, development of a certified shipper program, and continued development of cargo screening technologies to meet the requirements of P.L. 110-53 for cargo screening. A general provision of the Act directs the DHS to research and develop screening methods for cargo, and in the interim, utilize existing checked baggage explosives detection equipment to the greatest extent practicable for screening cargo. The provision also directs the TSA to work with air carriers and airports to increase the proportion of cargo that is screened each quarter and report to Congress on the progress being made. An additional $30 million was also appropriated for implementing other requirements set forth in P.L. 110-53 . This money is to be used to fund a wide array of mandated aviation and surface transportation security activities. With regard to surface transportation security, in general, enacted amounts were identical to those specified in the President's request and passed by both the House and the Senate.", "Division E of P.L. 110-161 also included several general provisions related to transportation security. Notably, section 513 continues a longstanding appropriations requirement specifying that the DHS must certify, and the GAO must report to Congress, that all conditions pertaining to privacy protection, data security, and redress have been adequately addressed before Secure Flight or any other successor prescreening program is implemented, other than on a test basis. TSA has indicated that it will finalize plans to implement Secure Flight in FY2008, prompting additional appropriations for this program. Whereas the House and Senate had passed amounts of $25 and $28 million, respectively, the enacted appropriation for Secure Flight was set at $50 million, roughly in line with the President's request. Section 521 specifies that any prior year funds for aviation security that are deobligated or recovered shall be available solely for the purpose of procuring and installing explosives detection systems for checked baggage, carry-ons, or air cargo. Section 542 establishes civil penalties for airport vendors and contractors that fail to collect airport security badges from terminated employees. Section 565 requires the DHS to establish an international registered traveler program within two years. The international registered traveler program is to incorporate technologies such as biometrics and e-passports along with security threat assessments, and it is to complement U.S. VISIT and the Visa Waiver Program. Section 568 appears to have the effect of eliminating the TSA's current acquisition management system, which was based on FAA acquisition management, within six months, bringing the TSA in line with DHS-wide acquisition management regulations and practices. Also, Section 571 specifies that, within 90-days after enactment, participants in the Registered Traveler (RT) program may satisfy checkpoint identification requirements by presenting their biometric RT card in lieu of providing government-issued photo identification.

A GAO assessment of the TSA's screener staffing allocation methodology among commercial passenger airports found that the TSA's underlying assumptions should be reassessed. In particular, the GAO found that many medium and smaller sized airports were staffed at levels either above or below the allocation specified by the staffing methodology. However, at small and medium sized airports, average peak-period passenger wait times in screening queues have consistently met the goal of 10 minutes or less. While the GAO found that all but one major (Category X) airport was staffed at levels consistent with the screener allocation methodology, the average passenger wait times at these airports (12.6 minutes in FY2006) exceeded the target of 10 minutes or less. Among other large airports (Category I), screener staffing was found to be in line with the staffing model at almost 80% of the airports, and average passenger wait times (10.4 minutes in FY2006) were found to be just slightly above the 10-minute target. Observations from these findings include the difficulty in predicting staffing needs at smaller and medium sized airports, where changes in air carrier flight schedules can have a more pronounced impact on screener staffing, and the possible need to more closely examine the persisting difficulties in achieving passenger wait time targets at large airports, particularly among the busiest airports in the country. The joint explanatory statement accompanying Division E of P.L. 110-161 directs the TSA to submit quarterly wait time data for all airports with \"above average wait times\" and for the 40 busiest airports. In these reports, the TSA is to explain any significant changes in wait times at airports.", "While the President's FY2008 budget proposed to eliminate the 45,000 FTE cap for TSOs and add 955 additional screeners, this increase will support the new travel document screening initiative and is not expected to address staffing imbalances or passenger wait time issues. During the FY2008 appropriations debate, screener staffing needs to address these issues may be a topic of particular interest. While neither the House nor the Senate bills retain the longstanding screener cap, a minority view printed in House Rept. 110-181 questioned the removal of this cap, voicing concern that it would lead to poor strategic planning by hiring screeners rather than focusing on technology approaches to streamline screening procedures that could reduce manpower needs. A provision in the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-53 ) explicitly removes the cap and directs the TSA to hire as many personnel as determined necessary to enhance security and reduce passenger wait times to under 10 minutes.", "In addition to screener staffing, workers compensation continues to be a significant expense for the TSA despite initiatives aimed at prevention and intervention strategies to reduce and mitigate workplace injuries. Anticipated costs of worker compensation claims account for $59 million (about 2.3%) of the FY2008 Passenger & Baggage Screening (PC&B) amount. Thus, examining the effectiveness of the TSA's initiatives to address workplace injuries may be an issue of particular interest to appropriators. The Senate report ( S.Rept. 110-84 ) specifically identified $59 million for workers compensation benefits for FY2008, and requests committee briefings on how the TSA's proposed strategies will mitigate on-the-job injuries and associated costs. The final appropriations measure and accompanying joint explanatory statement, however, did not specifically address this issue.", "Provisions in original House-passed and Senate-passed versions of the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 ( H.R. 1 ) would have placed TSA screeners under the same personnel management system as all other TSA employees, thereby extending to TSA screeners the right to collective bargaining. These provisions, however, were excluded from the Conference Report on the bill ( H.Rept. 110-259 ), which became P.L 110-53. When the TSA was established in 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA, P.L. 107-71 ) gave the TSA Administrator discretion to implement an alternate personnel system for screeners, which has, to date, barred screeners from collective bargaining. TSA Administrator Kip Hawley had cautioned that the direct cost to the TSA to set up a collective bargaining program for TSA screeners would be $160 million.", "TSA's application of its performance-based accountability and standards system for employees has been another ongoing issue. In 2006, the TSA initiated a performance-based management system, and under this system compensates screeners and other employees, in part, based on factors related to performance, technical proficiency, level of training and development, and other indicators of job performance. Senate-passed H.R. 2638 includes a provision that would require the TSA to submit a report to the congressional appropriations and oversight committees that examines performance ratings and pay increases for all positions covered under this system comparing performance and pay increases between managers and non-managers and providing data on attrition among employees covered under this system. This language was not included in Division E of P.L. 110-161 .", "The President's FY2008 budget estimates fee collections of about $35 million for the Registered Traveler program's continuation of its initial pilot phase at 10 to 20 airports, with the possibility of nationwide implementation sometime in FY2008 or later.

Appropriated funding specified in P.L. 110-161 , which is in line with the President's request and well above the House-passed and Senate-passed amounts, reflect that this milestone is anticipated and funds have been designated accordingly. Meanwhile, the TSA has indicated that it is culling the lists it currently provides to airlines for passenger prescreening to reduce false matches.

In 2006, the TSA developed an Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) Strategic Plan to optimize screening solutions at the 250 busiest airports with the goal of decreasing life cycle costs for baggage screening technologies. Faced with escalating maintenance costs for baggage screening systems, the effectiveness of this plan and its implementation may be an issue of particular interest for appropriators. Both the House and Senate bills would increase funding for explosives detection equipment procurement and installation above the requested levels. The reauthorization of the Aviation Security Capital Fund and its nondiscretionary funding of $250 million combined with a discretionary appropriation of $294 million for EDS and ETD purchase and installation provides a total of $544 million for the deployment of explosives detection systems.

The creation of the Checkpoint Screening Security Fund established a nondiscretionary funding source, providing $250 million for checkpoint screening technologies.

The air cargo security model is predicated on a risk-based system that relies heavily on the industry-wide known shipper program. In FY2008, the TSA anticipates deployment of an Air Cargo Risk Based Targeting (ACRBT) program that will build upon the known shipper program by including freight forwarder management information, a risk-based freight assessment system, and a certified shipper program.

Under this provision, 50% of all cargo placed on passenger airplanes would have to be inspected within 18 months and 100% of such cargo would have to be inspected within three years of enactment. It is unclear how such a mandate would specifically impact appropriations. This is because the provision does not specifically indicate whether the screening would be a federal function or whether it would be carried out by the airlines as is currently the practice for those cargo items currently inspected. Critics of this measure have argued that the explosives detection technologies needed to meet such a mandate are not yet available. Thus, additional appropriations may be needed to accelerate technology development if this proposal is enacted.

For example, in FY2007 the Administration requested $1,500 million initially for the DRF; supplemental requests added billions more. The request for FY2008 exceeds that for the previous fiscal year by $200 million, to $1,700 million. The Senate set the mark for the DRF at about $1,640 million. The final amount enacted was $1,324 million. While this is a significant amount within the context of FEMA's budget, the actual amount is slightly below FEMA's historical average of DRF spending (excluding outliers such as Hurricane Katrina and the World Trade Center attacks). The smaller amount below requested levels for the DRF was arrived at in the context of the recent DOD Appropriations Act of November 11, 2007 ( P.L. 110-116 ), which added $2.9 billion to the DRF in funding that is available until expended.", "The Senate Committee report addressed the accountability issue for the DRF by requiring that FEMA \"provide a detailed estimate\" of DRF funding needed through September 30, 2008 (not only the end of the fiscal year but toward the end of the hurricane season). The Committee also called upon agency officials \"to firmly establish measurable thresholds for transparent decision making regarding federal fiscal expenditures for disaster response.\" The Omnibus Act also requests from FEMA \"a list of all contracts that were awarded on a sole source or limited competition basis\" as well as an estimate \"of when available appropriations will be exhausted, assuming an average disaster season.\"", "Congress also may be concerned about accountability for DRF expenditures, in particular when relevant programmatic expertise resides in an agency other than FEMA. An example is the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), authorized by the Stafford Act, which provides professional counseling services to victims of a major disaster in order to relieve mental health problems. FEMA and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) share administrative duties for CCP. Though the program is funded through the DRF, it is not clear which agency bears primary or ultimate responsibility for the program, which has been associated with fiscal and programmatic challenges. Similarly, questions have been raised about FEMA's administration of the temporary housing program, also funded through the DRF.", "In past years Congress has authorized or directed the transfer of money from the DRF to other FEMA accounts to address identified needs or shortcomings. Some may contend that the dispersion of money from the DRF reduces the amount needed for disaster relief activities; others perceive the DRF to be an appropriate source of funds to meet special needs related to the mission of the agency. For example, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) has received funds in this manner to conduct audits and investigations into the use of DRF funds. The Senate version of the legislation continues this tradition with the transfer of $14 million to the OIG. The Ominbus Act approved an even larger amount, $16 million, to be transferred to the OIG. The bill also allows for the transfer of up to $48 million to fill agency personnel vacancies and provide further opportunities to enhance the skills of the workforce. The House did not include similar language. The House Appropriations Committee noted its disapproval of the planned transfer of $48 million \"to convert temporary disaster employees into permanent positions.\" The Omnibus Act approved the $48 million figure for 250 positions along with an additional $12 million for \"activities related\" to the Stafford Act. However, of the previous $60 million, the bill stipulates that \"$30 million shall not be available for transfer for management and administration functions until the Federal Emergency Management Agency submits an expenditure plan to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the House regarding the 250 positions.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Post-Katrina Reform Act Measures", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the significant resources needed for FEMA to administer preparedness grants, there are provisions in the Post-Katrina Reform Act that, in seeking to improve the performance of FEMA, necessarily expand the Agency's coverage and areas of responsibility. Many of these changes carry potentially large costs depending on the frequency and scope of future disaster activity. However, they also hold the potential for vastly improved service to disaster victims and their communities. Some of the areas for potentially increased costs include the following.", "Federal contributions for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) for approximately the past five years has been set at 7.5% of the total aid provided in a state after it receives a major disaster declaration. The Post-Katrina Act modifies the HMGP provision to provide 15% (for disasters with total damages under $2 billion), 10% (for disasters with damages between $2 billion and $10 billion), and 7.5% (for disasters between $10 billion and $35.3 billion). The House Committee report noted that HMGP assistance has been \"greatly underutilized\" after Hurricane Katrina and directs FEMA to report on needed policy changes and plans to direct funding as needed. Also related to mitigation, the Senate Committee report makes reference to the recent finding that mitigation activities result in cost savings and encourages incentives for such actions. The Senate-approved version of the legislation includes a provision that exempts certain hazard mitigation projects associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita from pre-certification requirements. This emphasis by the respective Committees is reflected in the increased funding for both map modernization and the pre-disaster mitigation fund. The Public Assistance (PA) program authority has been expanded in several ways that could result in increased federal disaster spending. First, the list of eligible applicants, previously defined by those that provided \"essential services of a governmental nature to the general public,\" can now be expanded by the President. Also, under this 2006 amendment, services do not necessarily have to be available only to the general public. Second, the PA program statutory authority establishes eligibility for some facilities previously identified in regulations. Third, education facilities can apply directly for Stafford Act assistance without first pursuing a Small Business Administration loan. Finally, the post-Katrina Act includes a Pilot Program for Public Assistance that seeks to provide incentives to state and local governments to be more involved in the PA work such as debris removal and repair projects. While one intent of the provision is to reduce costs, the incentives provided could result in an increase in the Federal cost share for participating areas as well as reimbursement for base wages for local hires employed by the state and local governments to accomplish this work. Public Assistance costs will also increase the amounts paid out from the Disaster Relief Fund as a result of P.L. 110-28 , which waived the state and local cost-share for Gulf Coast states that had infrastructure damage due to Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis, and Rita. Other cost-shares for disaster-related costs were also waived in that legislation but will not amount to the significant increases in federal costs inherent in large infrastructure repair projects. Another area of accelerated FEMA involvement that could increase costs concerns expedited federal assistance. This may take the form of earlier, and greater, technical assistance provided to a state for precautionary evacuation measures as well as help with logistics and communications. There are several administrative and service improvement provisions in the Post-Katrina Act likely to result in increased outreach and greater expenditures, including efforts to identify and assist the disabled and disaster victims with limited English proficiency, assist in the reunification of families following a disaster event, and provide increased transportation assistance to victims. Another deficiency identified in the wake of Hurricane Katrina concerned the information systems used by FEMA. The Senate Committee report included expectations that the agency is to adopt \"cutting edge technology\" and ensure that technology is used effectively. To achieve this goal, the Senate Committee included $6 million to be awarded competitively for this purpose. While the Omnibus Act does not specifically address this issue, it may be a part of the additional Stafford Act funding that is transferred from the DRF as previously\u00a0noted. The Explanatory Statement by Congress does reference a direction to FEMA to fund a program \"at no less than $6,000,000, based on competitive award, the completion of the Document Management and Records Tracking System.\" The Post-Katrina Act authorizes case management to be an eligible cost. Given the importance of this service and the potential caseload that could require some of this assistance, higher costs will likely be associated with providing this new form of assistance to major disaster victims.

DHS Appropriations in Context", "Federal-Wide Homeland Security Funding", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been an increasing interest in the levels of funding available for homeland security efforts. The Office of Management and Budget, as originally directed by the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act, has published an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism. Beginning with the June 24, 2002 edition of this report, homeland security was included as a part of the analysis. In subsequent years, this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined, as distinctions (and account lines) between homeland and non-homeland security activities have become more precise. This means that while Table C -1 is presented in such a way as to allow year to year comparisons, they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis, as outlined above.", "With regard to DHS funding, it is important to note that DHS funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts. In fact, while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within DHS, the DHS homeland security request for FY2008 accounts for approximately 49% of total federal funding for homeland security. The Department of Defense comprises the next highest proportion at 29% of all federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Health and Human Services at 7.2%, the Department of Justice at 5.5% and the Department of Energy at 3.0% round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security. These five agencies collectively account for nearly 94% of all federal spending on homeland security. It is also important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities. The legacy agencies that became a part of DHS also conduct activities that are not homeland security related. Therefore, while the FY2008 request included total homeland security budget authority of $29.7 billion for DHS, the requested total gross budget authority was $43.0 billion. The same is true of the other agencies listed in the table."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
