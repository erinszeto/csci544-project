Under the Obama Administration, this assistance has been articulated primarily as the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI), a platform within the President's 2010 Policy Directive on Global Development. The GCCI aims to integrate climate change considerations into U.S. foreign assistance through a range of bilateral, multilateral, and private sector mechanisms to promote sustainable and climate-resilient societies, foster low-carbon economic growth, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and land degradation. The GCCI is implemented through programs at three \"core\" agencies: the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Most GCCI activities at USAID are implemented through the agency's bilateral development assistance programs. Many of the GCCI activities at the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury are implemented through international organizations, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Least Developed Country Fund and Special Climate Change Fund, as well as multilateral financial institutions such as the Global Environment Facility, the Clean Technology Fund, and the Strategic Climate Fund. The GCCI is funded through the Administration's Executive Budget, Function 150 account, for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.", "Congress is responsible for several activities in regard to the GCCI, including (1) authorizing periodic appropriations for federal agency programs and multilateral fund contributions, (2) enacting those appropriations, (3) providing guidance to the agencies, and (4) overseeing U.S. interests in the programs and the multilateral funds. Recent budget authority for the GCCI was $945 million in FY2010, $819 million in FY2011, $857 million in FY2012, $840 million in FY2013, and $834 million in FY2014. Funding for FY2015 has yet to be fully reported by agencies. Funding has been enacted through legislation including the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (H.R. 3288; P.L. 111-117); the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (H.R. 4899; P.L. 111-212); the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10); the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 2055; P.L. 112-74); the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933; P.L. 113-6); the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (H.R. 3547; P.L. 113-76); and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235).

Budget constraints may lead to questions about sustaining high levels of support for international development assistance in general, and international climate change assistance in particular. The burden is exacerbated during times of economic downturn, when the federal government is hard-pressed to generate fiscal resources to adequately address domestic challenges and maintain basic levels of public services and quality of life. Some have suggested that retaining available funds for immediate domestic priorities, such as fostering renewed economic growth and creating jobs, should take precedence over global concerns for which many Americans feel less urgency and responsibility. Potential for Misuse. National and international institutions that dispense financial assistance have been criticized on occasion for inefficient and bloated bureaucracies; their lack of transparency about project procurement practices and operating costs; and the proportion of their funds misused or lost through instances of graft, corruption, and other political inefficiencies. Some suggest revisiting operational guidance of these institutions before further appropriations are made. Uncertain Results . Questions remain regarding the overall effectiveness of international financial assistance in spurring economic development and reform in lower-income countries, and, more specifically, in addressing issues of climate change and the environment. Many studies have examined the effects of international assistance provided to lower-income countries, including both bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, and have returned mixed results, making it difficult to reach firm conclusions that would support or oppose continued contributions. Uncertainties in Climate Science . Prevailing scientific research on the current and future impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the global climate exhibits varying degrees of analytical uncertainty. The lack of definitiveness in some data and in certain model projections has been offered by some as a reason to postpone and/or reconsider both domestic and international climate change assistance policies and programs.", "Some issues that may support providing assistance include the following:", "Commercial Interests. Some maintain that international climate change assistance benefits U.S. businesses, as support for low-emission economic growth may increase trade, commerce, and economic activity in the global marketplace for U.S. goods and services. Increased assistance may allow some U.S. industries to make competitive inroads into rapidly expanding markets, improve the advancement and commercialization of U.S. technologies, mobilize greater investment in related domestic sectors, and enhance job creation in the United States. Decreased funding may cede American influence in global markets to other economic powers still engaged with lower-income countries on environmental and natural resource issues (e.g., the European Union, China). Investment Efficiencies. Some argue that the costs of responding to tomorrow's climate-related catastrophes, instabilities, conflicts, and technological needs may be significantly higher than the costs of preventing them today. Some economists note that lower-income countries account for nearly all of the recent growth in global emissions and represent the cheapest near-term opportunity to mitigate GHG pollution as part of a cost-effective global solution. Natural Disaster Preparedness . Some claim that international climate change assistance is a means to support natural disaster preparedness around the globe. Assistance for adaptation activities to help \"climate-proof\" developing countries' infrastructure and other sectors may help avoid future capital and other losses; minimize the redirection of resources to ad hoc disaster response and urgent humanitarian needs; and avoid chronic humanitarian crises, such as food shortages, particularly for the resource poor in the least developed countries. National Security. Some defend international climate change assistance as a way to address and mitigate risks to national security. According to a 2008 National Intelligence Assessment, the impacts of global climate change may worsen problems of poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, and weak political institutions across the developing world. Some see international climate change assistance as a means to help make lower-income countries less susceptible to these threats, for the benefit of both the country and the security interests of the United States. Internatio nal Leadership. Some see the promotion of international climate change assistance to lower-income countries as a method through which to increase U.S. leadership in global environmental issues. Through such leadership, the United States may be able to influence and set important international economic and environmental policies, practices, and standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
