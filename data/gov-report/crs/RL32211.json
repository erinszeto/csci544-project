Therefore, AGP parties are only committed to apply the agreement to other AGP parties. Presently, in addition to the United States, the AGP has been accepted by the European Communities(EC), each of the 25 EC Member countries, (3) Canada, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein,Netherlands with respect to Aruba, Norway, Singapore, and Switzerland.
