The expeditious removal of such aliens has been a statutory priority since 1986, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its predecessor agency have operated programs targeting criminal aliens since 1988. These programs have grown substantially since FY2005, and deportations of criminal aliens\u2014along with other unauthorized immigrants\u2014have grown proportionally.", "Despite the interest in criminal aliens, inconsistencies in data quality, data collection, and definitions make it impossible to precisely enumerate the criminal alien population, defined in this report as all noncitizens ever convicted of a crime.

The overall proportion of noncitizens in prisons and jails corresponds closely to the proportion of noncitizens in the total U.S. population.", "DHS's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operates four programs designed in part to target criminal aliens: the Criminal Alien Program (CAP), Secure Communities, the \u00a7287(g) program, and the National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP). CAP, Secure Communities, and the \u00a7287(g) programs are jail enforcement programs that screen individuals for immigration-related violations as they are being booked into jail and while they are incarcerated; the NFOP is a task force program that target at-large criminal aliens. This report describes how these programs work and identifies their common features and key differences among them.", "While consensus exists on the overarching goal of identifying and removing serious criminal aliens, these programs have generated controversy, in part because many of the aliens identified by ICE have never been convicted of a crime, or have been convicted only of minor criminal offenses. Thus, the programs focus attention on questions about when\u2014if ever\u2014DHS should exercise \"prosecutorial discretion\" by not asserting its full enforcement authority in certain cases. ICE and DHS officials have testified that resource constraints mean that the department can deport only about 400,000 aliens per year\u2014far fewer than the total number of potentially removable aliens identified. Officials have released a series of memoranda describing criteria to prioritize certain aliens for removal, and to consider exercising discretion in other cases. Some Members of Congress have objected to the Obama Administration's exercise of discretion, and some have proposed legislation that effectively would limit such discretion.", "A second set of questions concerns the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement. Supporters of jail enforcement programs, including the Obama Administration, see them as efficient and even-handed ways to identify criminal aliens. The Administration has particularly focused on Secure Communities, which was deployed in every law enforcement jurisdiction in the country in FY2013. Yet some have raised concerns that jail enforcement programs are not narrowly targeted at serious criminal offenders. Critics also argue that involving state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement may damage police-community relations, may result in racial profiling, and may result in the wrongful detention of people who have not been convicted of criminal offenses and may not be subject to removal. Although ICE and DHS have taken steps to address both sets of questions, they remain topics of legislative interest in the 113th Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress has a long-standing interest in the criminal alien population and has supported efforts since the late 1980s to identify, detain, and remove these individuals.

More generally, all unauthorized immigrants within the United States are potentially subject to removal, and alien removals originating within the United States (i.e., \"interior enforcement\") are a basic element of immigration control.", "The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency operates four key programs to identify and remove criminal aliens and other removable aliens. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) is a screening program that identifies, detains, and initiates removal proceedings against criminal aliens, including within federal, state, and local prisons and jails. Secure Communities is an information sharing program between the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security that screens for removable aliens as people are being booked into jails. Agreements entered into pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7287(g) (\"\u00a7287(g) agreements\") allow DHS to delegate certain immigration enforcement functions to specially trained state and local law enforcement officers, under federal supervision. The National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) pursues known at-large criminal aliens and fugitive aliens.", "Funding for interior enforcement and programs targeting criminal aliens has expanded considerably since FY2005 as has the number of aliens arrested through them. Congress appropriated a total of about $567 million to ICE for these four programs in FY2013, up from $23 million in FY2004 (see \" Appropriations \" below). At the same time, the number of aliens arrested through ICE's major interior enforcement programs increased during these years from about 11,000 to about 270,000 ( Table 6 ).", "While ICE's interior enforcement programs are designed to focus in particular on criminal aliens, the majority of unauthorized aliens in the United States have not been convicted of a crime ( Figure 1 ). Some have criticized these programs because most of the aliens they identify have no criminal record or have committed only nonviolent crimes. Others note, however, that all unauthorized aliens have violated U.S. immigration law and may be subject to removal.", "Partly for these reasons, interior enforcement and programs targeting criminal aliens raise two key policy issues for Congress. First, when, if ever, should DHS exercise its \"prosecutorial discretion\" by not asserting its full enforcement authority? ICE's interior enforcement programs have greatly increased the agency's ability to identify potentially removable aliens, but the Obama Administration has argued that it only has resources to deport about 400,000 aliens per year (see \" DHS Enforcement Priorities and Discretion \"). The Administration has published formal guidelines to prioritize certain types of cases for enforcement and to exercise discretion in other cases. Some Members of Congress have objected to these policies, and some support legislation to limit the exercise of discretion (see \" DHS Enforcement Priorities and Discretion \").", "A second set of questions concerns the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement. While some Members of Congress and some local governments and law enforcement agencies favor a larger role for states and localities in immigration enforcement, others are concerned that such enforcement practices may undermine civil rights and may have a chilling effect on community-police relations. Certain jurisdictions have sought to limit their participation in such programs. But after initially treating Secure Communities as a voluntary federal-local partnership, the Obama Administration no longer permits local jurisdictions to \"opt out\" of it (see \" The State and Local Role in ICE's Interior Enforcement Programs \").

Yet the term \"criminal alien\" is not specifically defined in immigration law or regulation, and people use it to refer to several different types of noncitizen offenders. At the broadest level, a \"criminal alien\" is any noncitizen who has ever been convicted of a crime in the United States . This report adopts this broad definition unless otherwise noted. See Appendix A for a glossary of additional terms related to the criminal alien population.", "Not all criminal aliens are unauthorized or removable, and most removable aliens are not criminals (see Figure 1 ). Three groups of criminal aliens can be distinguished. First, the set of all criminal aliens includes both unauthorized aliens, all of whom are potentially removable, and legal aliens. Second, some criminal aliens who have been convicted of removable criminal offenses are subject to removal under the INA even if they are otherwise legally present. For example, a legal permanent resident (LPR) convicted of cocaine possession is subject to removal, but an LPR convicted of public intoxication is not. Third, a subset of these removable criminal aliens are aggravated felons , and therefore are ineligible for most forms of relief from removal and ineligible to be readmitted to the United States.

Noncitizen arrests for all other federal offenses accounted for a declining share of all federal arrests, from 19% in 2001 to 5% in 2010. The growth of illegal entry cases caused arrests of U.S. citizens to account for a declining share of all federal arrests (from 62% in 2001 to 45% in 2010).", "These trends may reflect changes in enforcement and prosecution policies rather than increased noncitizen criminality. The number of Border Patrol apprehensions has always far exceeded the number of arrests for illegal entry, and DHS and DOJ have adopted policies to seek criminal charges against a higher proportion of such aliens, particularly since 2005 through Operation Streamline and related programs.

Estimates of state and, especially, local incarcerated populations should be interpreted with caution for the reasons noted in Appendix B . As of June 30, 2011, a total of 2,334,381 prisoners (U.S. citizens and noncitizens) were incarcerated: 216,362 in federal prisons, 1,382,418 in state prisons, and 735,601 in local jails ( Table 2 ).

The noncitizens proportion of state prisoners increased more slowly, growing from 4.3% of the total state-level incarcerated population in 2001 to 5.2% in 2011.

The data indicate that for all three years shown, violent crimes made up less than 1% of all crimes committed by criminal aliens, compared to 4.5%-6% of crimes committed by citizens. For noncitizens, immigration crimes grew as a proportion of total federal offenses for which they received sentences, increasing from 50% of all crimes in 2001 to 66% in 2012.

When the analysis expands to include all correctional institutions (not only prisons but also jails, halfway houses, and similar facilities) and to focus on the sub-population most likely to commit crimes (males between ages 18-40) the difference increases, with native-born institutionalization rates 10 times those of the foreign born.

To enumerate the federal prison population, GAO used Bureau of Prison (BOP) data, which are considered relatively reliable and are collected consistently. To undertake the more challenging task of enumerating the criminal alien population in state prisons and local jails, GAO relied on data from the Department of Justice's State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). SCAAP data provide a direct count of cases for which state and local jurisdictions seek reimbursement for correctional officer salary costs incurred for incarcerating \"undocumented criminal aliens\" and thus provide an alternative method for estimating the criminal alien population to that presented by CRS above.

They also worked with the Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review to initiate deportation proceedings against aliens serving sentences for deportable offenses during their period of incarceration.", "The IRP and ACAP focused initially on aggravated felons, a class of serious criminal aliens created in immigration law by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-690 ) and enumerated in \u00a7101(a)(43) of the INA. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act defined aggravated felonies to include aliens convicted of murder, drug trafficking, or illegal trafficking in firearms or destructive devices.

CAP officers conduct biometric and biographic database searches to identify matches in DHS databases; and they interview arrestees and prisoners to identify potentially removable aliens without previous DHS records. When CAP officers identify removable aliens, they may issue an immigration detainer.

By their nature, jail enforcement programs are not highly targeted: they are designed to screen the entire population of people passing through some part of the criminal justice system. Those screened by jail enforcement programs are typically arrested by state and local law enforcement agents for non-immigration offenses. Conversely, task force programs tend to be more targeted operations, pursuing specific serious criminal aliens, fugitive aliens, or other criminals who have been identified by ICE. Under task force operations, ICE agents or other law enforcement officers with specific immigration training are the arresting agents.", "A second, related difference concerns who conducts immigration-related screening and who selects targets for immigration enforcement. Under all but the \u00a7287(g) program, ICE agents conduct immigration screening either in the jail (under CAP) or remotely (under CAP and Secure Communities); and ICE and DHS select the targets for task force operations based on at-large aliens' criminal records and immigration histories. Under the \u00a7287(g) program, local corrections officers with ICE training conduct immigration screenings during the booking process.", "Third, ICE programs target criminal aliens at different points in the criminal justice process.

The 2009 MOAs established a uniform three-level enforcement priority system for the \u00a7287(g) program, which was then superseded by the 2011 agency- and department-wide memos and letter (see \"ICE Memoranda\"). The March and June 2011 guidance memos clarify ICE agents' ability to exercise discretion throughout the immigration enforcement process, and ICE specifically linked the memos to Secure Communities by releasing them in the context of the other June 2011 reforms to that program.", "The reforms also included the creation of a Homeland Security Advisory Council Task Force on Secure Communities composed of law enforcement professionals, ICE agents, and community and immigrant advocates. The task force's goal was to recommend how to focus the program on high-priority offenders and ensure discretion in Secure Communities jurisdictions, among other issues. The task force issued a report with findings and recommendations in September 2011, and ICE published a formal response to the task force in April 2012.", "Second, ICE has developed new record-keeping requirements and other tools to attempt to guard against pretextural arrests and racial profiling. ICE's ENFORCE tracking system has been modified to track data on the circumstances leading to aliens' arrests, information which may improve oversight of ICE's partnership programs. ICE and CRCL reportedly are developing new statistical data to be collected on a quarterly basis to evaluate whether Secure Communities is being implemented in a biased way or otherwise resulting in racial profiling, though such monitoring reportedly remains in the development stage as of July 2013. The new \u00a7287(g) MOA also seeks to prevent pretextural arrests by requiring agencies to pursue all charges for which aliens are initially arrested. ", "Third, ICE and CRCL also have developed new materials to further reduce the risk of racial profiling and misuse of these enforcement programs. New training materials target ICE agents as well as local law enforcement agents involved in these programs. ICE and CRCL have also developed new immigration detainer forms clarifying that individuals should not be detained for more than 48 hours and that law enforcement agencies must provide detainees with information about how to file a complaint if they believe their civil rights have been violated.

For FY2013, DHS proposed to reduce spending on the \u00a7287(g) program from $68 million to $51 million (a 25% reduction). The Senate supported the proposed cuts, but the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, FY2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ) included the House-passed funding level of $68 million. For FY2014, the Administration proposed a larger cut to the program, to $24 million. Some Members proposed additional cuts to the program during the House's floor debate on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2014 ( H.R. 2217 ); but the House-passed version of the bill would continue to fund the program at the FY2012 level of $68 million.", "Secure Communities initially was described as an optional program, and state and local law enforcement agencies only participated after signing a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with ICE. Some Members of Congress opposed the program and called on jurisdictions to suspend their participation, and in 2011 the governors of Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts sought to rescind their Secure Communities MOAs. In contrast with the \u00a7287(g) program, however, Secure Communities operates as an information sharing program among federal agencies, and requires no active participation from local jurisdictions. Thus, ICE has determined that the department has the authority to operate Secure Communities as a mandatory program, and in August 2011, ICE terminated existing Secure Communities MOAs and clarified DHS's position that jurisdictions could not opt out of the program. ", "Following this development, some jurisdictions have limited their participation by refusing to fully cooperate with ICE detainers issued as a result of Secure Communities. Citing concerns over fiscal costs and wrongful detentions, Cook County (Chicago), IL passed an ordinance in September 2011 to require county jails to disregard immigration detainers unless the federal government agreed in advance to pay the associated detention costs. New York City, Los Angeles, Newark, NJ, and Washington, DC also have passed measures limiting their cooperation with ICE detainers. And an August 2013 court settlement requires the Orleans Parish (New Orleans), LA sheriff's office to decline ICE detainer requests unless the subject is being held on certain felony charges; to notify detainees' lawyers prior to allowing ICE to interview detainees; and to prevent ICE from entering certain parts of county jails absent a criminal warrant or court order. At the state level, California Attorney General Kamala Harris issued law enforcement guidance in December 2012 that ICE detainers are not mandatory and directed law enforcement agencies in the state to make their own decisions about whether to honor such requests. And in June 2013, the state of Connecticut enacted a law permitting cooperation with ICE detainers only when detainer subjects have felony convictions, belong to gangs, are on terrorist watch lists, are subject to existing removal orders, or otherwise are considered safety risks.

Among other provisions, the act would authorize states and localities to enact and enforce criminal penalties that mirror federal immigration law, and would permit state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate, identify, arrest, and detain aliens for the purposes of enforcing immigration law to the same extent as federal law enforcement personnel. In support of this authorization, the act would require DHS: to provide states with direct access to federal programs and technology to identify removable aliens; to enter into a \u00a7287(g) agreement with any jurisdiction requesting such an agreement unless DHS has a \"compelling reason\" to deny the request; to provide state and local law enforcement agents with relevant training materials; and to reimburse states and localities for the costs of such enforcement.

Data on Arrests and Incarceration of the Criminal Alien Population", "Data Analyzed", "At the federal level, arrest data are compiled by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Prisoner Tracking System and published by the Department of Justice (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) through its online Federal Justice Statistics Resource Center (FJSRC). Federal incarceration data are published by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and complied by the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics. As of August 2013, the most recent published data available on noncitizen arrests were as of 2010.", "Figures for the federal noncitizen prison population from 2001-2011 are as of year-end and include sentenced as well as non-sentenced inmates, and inmates under jurisdiction as well as inmates in custody. Figures for the state noncitizen prison population from 2001-2011 are as of mid-year and include the same types of inmates as those in the federal figures. Figures for the local noncitizen jail population for all years (2001-2011) are as of mid-year and only include sentenced inmates and inmates in custody. For 2011, however, federal figures for the noncitizen incarcerated population were available only as of midyear. Hence, all 2011 figures \u2013 federal, state, and local \u2013 are as of mid-year. As of August 2013, published data on the noncitizen incarcerated population for 2012 were unavailable at the federal, state and local levels.", "State incarceration data come from annually published BJS reports, Prison Inmates at Midyear. Data for that report come from the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program of BJS, which obtains mid-year and year-end prisoner counts from correctional departments of all 50 states. ", "BJS also conducts an Annual Survey of Jails , from which it creates national-level estimates of the number of inmates incarcerated in local jails. In addition, it conducts a complete count of the local jail population every five years through its Census of Jails . Together, these two local jail counts provide a consistent annual series of the total number of persons incarcerated in local jails, though these local data are problematic, as described below. ", "Data Quality and Limitations", "Several obstacles challenge and limit the ability of researchers to accurately enumerate the criminal alien population or compare its criminal activity to other U.S. populations. For example, while federal BOP data include information on citizenship status, not all state and local criminal justice systems collect such information, creating substantial inconsistencies in data quality and completeness at the state and local level. There is no single and consistent national enumeration of prisoners in the United States similar to the decennial census or the Current Population Survey\u2014much less one that focuses on subpopulations such as noncitizens. Hence, attempts to quantify the U.S. criminal alien population have relied on estimation techniques, assumptions about the criminal alien proportion of the total criminal population, and federal surveys and censuses of prison inmates. This section discusses several data limitations associated with collecting data at the various stages of the criminal justice system. ", "Arrests and Incarcerations Are Imperfect Indicators of Immigrant Criminality", "Arrests and incarcerations are both imperfect measures of criminality. Arrest data overestimate criminality because some individuals who are arrested are subsequently released, or if charged, are not ultimately convicted. And local incarceration data also over-count certain individuals because some people are incarcerated in local jails even though they have not yet been charged or convicted of crimes.", "Conversely, incarceration data generally underestimate the total number of convicted criminals because they exclude persons on parole and persons sentenced to probation. For instance, of the 6,977,700 individuals included by BJS in its 2011 estimate of the total correctional population, 3,971,319 were on probation, 853,852 were on parole, and 2,239,751 were incarcerated in federal and state prisons or in local jails. ", "One also must use caution when examining arrest and incarceration data because greater (or lesser) numbers of arrests and incarcerations do not always indicate an increase (or decrease) in criminal activity. They may indicate changes in enforcement policy. For instance, a reduction in arrests or incarcerations for illegal immigration entry may stem from fewer persons attempting to enter the United States illegally, but it may also reflect changes in resources or enforcement priorities. It is also noteworthy that some crimes are never reported: arrests and incarcerations only reflect the number of offenses known to law enforcement. ", "Inconsistent State and Local Data Reporting", "In addition to these limitations with respect to data validity, efforts to estimate the criminal alien population also confront a significant limit with respect to data availability and reliability. First, there are no recent and complete publicly available data on arrests at the state and local levels that distinguish between U.S. citizens and noncitizens. Thus, this report limits its analysis of arrest data to federal statistics.", "Second, BJS's state and local incarceration data are based on the voluntary participation of each state's department of corrections and local jails. While all states contribute data to BJS on their prison population, states vary with respect to how they define terms, which poses challenges to estimating the size and character of the criminal alien population. For instance, some states report foreign-born prisoners and naturalized U.S. citizens rather than strictly noncitizens, potentially inflating counts of the criminal alien population.", "Local jail reporting practices are likely to be even more inconsistent than state practices given the far greater number of jurisdictions. And not all local jurisdictions even report on their foreign-born criminal populations. For these reasons, GAO concluded in 2005 that \"there [are] no reliable population ... data on criminal aliens incarcerated in all state prisons and local jails.\"", "Additional Sources of Bias", "Several additional factors may impede efforts to quantify the criminal alien population. Because criminal activity can lead to removal, criminal aliens could have strong incentives to lie about their legal status or not to provide such information, although biometric technology increasingly permits authorities to identify certain removable aliens. Furthermore, serious crime is frequently intra-racial and intra-ethnic in nature. Unauthorized alien victims may be particularly reluctant to report crime for fear that contact with the criminal justice system may result in their own removal. Such behavior can have nontrivial effects on crime reporting in some jurisdictions, given the frequent intra-racial and intra-ethnic character of serious crime.", "Presentation of Publicly Available Data", "A separate data-related complication independent of data quality concerns differences between counts of criminal justice data that result from factors such as whether the data come from mid-year or year-end, include persons in privately operated community facilities, include persons convicted in Washington DC, and similar variations. In addition, differences can occur between analyzing raw data and defining criminal aliens with certain decision rules, versus using data published online by BOP that incorporate different decision rules. For instance, figures on federally incarcerated criminal aliens in this report differ slightly from those presented in the GAO report, although it is not clear from the GAO report or from the source for data contained in this CRS report how those different figures would be reconciled."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
