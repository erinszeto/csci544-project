Under MA, private health plans are paid a per-person amount to provide all Medicare-covered benefits (except hospice) to beneficiaries who enroll in their plan. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) risk adjusts the payments to MA plans. The size of the adjustment depends on the demographic and health history of each plan enrollee. The payment adjustment takes into account the severity of a beneficiary's illness, the accumulated effect of multiple diseases, as well as interactive effects\u2014instances where having two or more specified diseases or characteristics results in expected health care expenditures that are larger than the simple sum of the effects. The payments are not adjusted for short-term illnesses because they are assumed to be poor predictors of future health spending.", "MA plans provide information to CMS to justify the risk-adjusted payments; CMS therefore audits the plans to ensure that the risk-adjusted payments that the plans are claiming are in fact supported by the medical record. Based on the audit findings, plans may have to pay back money when the medical record does not provide evidence for the risk-adjusted payment they had received. Alternatively, the audit may reveal additional illnesses that had not previously been taken into account. Previously, MA plans were only required to pay back money (or receive money) based on the findings from the audited enrollee records. CMS has proposed extrapolating the audit findings to apply to all enrollees in the audited plan.", "Some concerns have been raised about risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage and the MA plan audits. First, risk adjustment compensates plans for the average predicted cost of any particular diagnosis. To the extent that MA plans could enroll beneficiaries with below-average expenditures relative to the average for their disease, those plans would be over-compensated by risk adjustment. Second, according to the American Academy of Actuaries, the Medicare fee-for-service data used in the MA risk adjustment model were not audited for accuracy and may contain errors. The audits under MA, however, would apply the risk adjustment factors to data that were validated. The inconsistency of using audited data in one circumstance and non-audited data in another could create uncertainty; however, a for-for-service adjustment factor added by CMS in the final notice of payment methodology may remedy this concern. Third, some plans have expressed concern that recoveries from the audits may place them at substantial financial risk.", "This report describes how CMS pays providers under Medicare Advantage and how these payments are risk adjusted.

In this hypothetical situation, if a payer, such as Medicare, paid the same amount to insurers for covering both men and women, insurers would have a strong financial incentive to enroll men and avoid enrolling women. One mechanism for leveling the playing field , could be to risk adjust the payment to insurers by paying them $100 more for women than for men.

The same monthly payment is made regardless of how many or few services a beneficiary actually uses. The plan is at-risk if costs, in the aggregate, exceed program payments; conversely, the plan can retain savings if costs are less than payments.

A person with an ICD-9-CM code in CC 81 is excluded from being coded in CCs 82, 83, or 84 even if codes that group into those categories were also present.

Moreover, the risk scores can be further standardized such that a risk score of 1.2 reflects an individual with 20% higher costs than an average Medicare beneficiary, for example, or that an individual with a risk score of .8 reflects a beneficiary with 20% lower costs. Therefore, CMS can use these risk scores to adjust payments to plans such that the payments are individualized to reflect health status and demographics and reflective of the likely costs that a plan, on average, should incur in treating a similarly situated Medicare beneficiary (see Table 1 ).

In the purely hypothetical example generated in Figure 4 , the confidence interval is from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. This means that with a certainty of greater than 99%, the error in payment to this hypothetical plan is at least $1,037.50. If the 99% confidence interval includes $0 or is below $0, then the recovery amount would be constrained to $0. If the 99% confidence interval does not include $0, then the lower bound of the confidence interval is modified by a fee-for-service adjuster to establish the amount the plan would be required to reimburse the government.

The R 2 is one measure of how well a model explains why a specified outcome varies\u2014in this case beneficiary expenditures. The range of spending by individual Medicare beneficiaries can be from $0 per year for a very healthy beneficiary who did not use any medical care, items, or medications, to hundreds of thousands of dollars, or more, for a very ill beneficiary.

Taken together, these demographic data explain less than 1% of the variation in Medicare beneficiary expenditures (see Table A -1 ).

In addition to demographic variables, this model took into account, \"the worst principal inpatient diagnosis (principal reason for inpatient stay) associated with any hospital admission.\" Though, as shown in Table A -1 , the PIP-DCG model explained more of the variation in Medicare expenditures than the AAPCC (demographic only) model, it had several limitations. First, illnesses that resulted in higher expenditures but did not result in a hospital admission were not counted in the model. Second, any attempt to reduce hospital admissions through, for example, better management of chronic disease, could potentially result in lower risk-adjusted payments.", "Though the PIP-DCG model was to be phased-in, subsequent legislation held the phase-in schedule at 90% demographic-only method/10% PIP-DCG method through 2003, in part to \"soften the financial impact of risk adjustment on M+C organizations.\"", "CMS\u2013Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) ", "Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model\u2014a model that includes information from hospital inpatient and outpatient settings, physicians visits, and visits with clinically trained non-physicians such as psychologists and podiatrists. The CMS-HCC takes into account the severity of a beneficiary's illness (and only compensating for the most severe manifestation reported), the accumulated effect of multiple (unrelated) diseases, as well as interactive effects\u2014instances where having two or more specified diseases or characteristics results in expected health care expenditures that are larger than the simple sum of the effects. The CMS-HCC model explains nearly 10% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures and is described in detail in the \"Risk Adjustment Under Medicare Advantage\" section of this report. Updates to the CMS-HCC retain the basic structure of the model.", "Version 12 CMS-HCC", "Each year the model is updated to account for changes in the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. In addition, Version 12 was recalibrated with more recent diagnosis and expenditure data. The update increased the percentage of the variation in Medicare expenditures which were explained by the model from just under 10% to nearly 11%.", "Version 21 CMS-HCC ", "Version 21 includes updates to the ICD-9CM diagnosis codes, and recalibration with more recent diagnosis and expenditure data. In addition, version 21 \"underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices, as well as compositional changes within the Medicare population.\" These updates again increased the predictive power of the model to approximately 12.5%. Version 21 is slated to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans.", "Appendix B. CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model"], "subsections": []}]}}
