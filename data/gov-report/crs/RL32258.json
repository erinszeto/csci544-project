The following families automatically qualifyfor CSE services (free of charge): families receiving (or who formerly received) TemporaryAssistance to Needy Families (TANF) benefits (Title IV-A), foster care payments, or Medicaidcoverage. Collections on behalf of families receiving TANF benefits are used to reimburse state andfederal governments for TANF payments made to the family.

The 1996 welfarelaw ( P.L. 104-193 ) repealed the $50 required pass through (3) and gave states the choice to decide howmuch, if any, of the state share (some, all, none) of child support payments collected on behalf ofTANF families to send the family. States also decide whether to treat child support payments asincome to the family. While states have discretion over their share of child support collections, P.L.104-193 required states to pay the federal government the federal government's share of childsupport collections collected on behalf of TANF families.
