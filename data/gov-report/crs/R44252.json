Starting with MDTA, there have been four main federal workforce development programs.", "The MDTA provided federal funding to retrain workers displaced because of technological change. Later in MDTA's existence, the majority of funding went to classroom and on-the-job training (OJT) that was targeted to low-income individuals and welfare recipients. Funding from the MDTA was allocated by formula to local communities based on factors of population and poverty. Grants under MDTA were administered through regional DOL offices and went directly to local service providers.", "The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA; P.L. 93-203 ), enacted in 1973, made substantial changes to federal workforce development programs. CETA transferred more decision-making authority from the federal government to local governments. Specifically, CETA provided funding to about 470 \"prime sponsors\" (sub-state political entities such as city or county governments, consortia of governments, etc.) to administer and monitor job training activities. Services under CETA\u2014which included on-the-job training, classroom training, and public service employment (PSE)\u2014were targeted to low-income populations, welfare recipients, and disadvantaged youth. At its peak in 1978, the PSE component of CETA supported about 755,000 jobs and accounted for nearly 60% of the CETA budget. CETA was amended in 1978 in part to create private industry councils (PIC) to expand the role of the private sector in developing, implementing, and evaluating CETA programs. The composition of PICs included representatives of business, labor, education, and other groups.", "In 1982, changes to federal workforce development policy were made by enactment of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA, P.L. 97-300 ). Major changes implemented under JTPA, which provided classroom and on-the-job training to low-income and dislocated workers, included service delivery at the level of 640 \"service delivery areas,\" federal funding allocation first to state governors and then to PICs in each of the service delivery areas (unlike CETA, which provided allocations directly to prime sponsors), prohibition of the public service employment component, and a new emphasis on targeted job training and reemployment. With a new emphasis on training (rather than public employment), JTPA required that at least 70% of funding for service delivery areas be used for training. Although this percentage was dropped to 50% in the 1992 amendments to JTPA, the emphasis on training remained.", "The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA; P.L. 105-220 ) replaced JTPA and continued the trend toward service coordination by establishing the One-Stop system through which state and local WIA training and employment activities were provided and in which certain partner programs were required to be colocated. WIA replaced PICs with Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs), which were responsible for the design of services for WIA participants. In addition to these changes, WIA enacted changes that included universal access to services (i.e., available to any individual regardless of age or employment status), a demand driven workforce system responsive to the demands of local area employers (e.g., the requirement that a majority of WIB members must be representatives of business), a work-first approach to workforce development (i.e., placement in employment was the first goal of the services provided under Title I of WIA as embodied in the \"sequence of services\" provisions), and the establishment of consumer choice for participants who were provided with Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) to choose a type of training and the particular provider from which to receive training."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Title I\u2014Workforce Development Activities", "paragraphs": ["Title I of WIOA authorizes programs and activities that support job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals.

This system is supposed to provide employment and training services that are responsive to the demands of local area employers. The demand driven nature of WIOA is manifested in elements such as Workforce Development Boards (WDBs), a majority of whose members must be representatives of business, and in the requirement for local plans to identify existing and emerging in-demand industry sectors and occupations. WIOA emphasizes coordination and alignment of workforce development services , through provisions such as a required Unified State Plan for core programs and a comm on set of performance indicators across most programs authorized by WIOA. In addition, WIOA requires regional planning across local areas. WIOA provides local control to officials administering programs under it. Under the state formula grant portion of WIOA, which accounts for nearly 60% of total WIOA Title I funding, the majority of funds are allocated to local WDBs (after initial allotment from ETA to the states) that are authorized to determine the mix of service provision, eligible providers, and types of training programs, among other decisions. The WIOA system provides central points of service through its system of One-Stop centers . The concept of a One-Stop center is to provide a single location for individuals seeking employment and training services, thus making the process of locating and accessing employment services more efficient and seamless. WIOA requires certain programs to be \"partners\" in the One-Stop center, either by physical colocation or other accessible arrangements. Notably, WIOA requires the colocation of Employment Service offices with One-Stop centers. WIOA provides universal access to its career services to any individual regardless of age or employment status, but it also provides priority of service for career and training services to low-income and skills-deficient individuals. WIOA emphasizes sector partnerships and career pathways workforce development strategies by requiring local WDBs to lead efforts to develop career pathways strategies and to implement industry/sector partnerships with employers. WIOA provides consumer choice to participants. As explained later in this report, participants determined to be eligible for training services are provided with Individual Training Accounts (ITAs), with which they may choose a type of training and the particular provider from which to receive training. WIOA implements a performance accountability system based on primary indicators with state-adjusted levels of performance resulting from negotiations between each state and the Secretary of Labor and revised based on a statistical adjustment model.

The objective statistical model is intended to assist states in setting performance levels and in revising state adjusted levels of performance by taking into account the differences among states in actual economic conditions and the characteristics of participants served. In practice, this means an individual state sets its performance goals based on the relative (to other states) economic conditions and characteristics of participants and revises its performance levels at the end of a program year based on the actual economic conditions and characteristics of participants served.", "Glossary of Selected WIOA Terms", "Areas of Substantial Unemployment (ASU) \u2014This concept is used in the Title I state formula grants for Youth and Adult Activities.

For the state formula grants for Youth Activities, \"disadvantaged youth\" is defined (in Section 127(b)(2)(C)) as an \"individual who is age 16 through 21 who received an income, or is a member of a family that received a total family income, that, in relation to family size, does not exceed the higher of the poverty line or 70 percent of the lower living standard income level.\" Similarly, a \"disadvantaged adult\" is defined (in Section 132(b)(1)(B)(v)(IV)) in the same way as a disadvantaged youth with the exception that the individual is age 22 through 72.", "Excess Unemployment \u2014This concept is used in one of the factors for the Title I state formula grants for Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker Activities. For the state formula grants for Youth and Adult Activities, excess unemployment is defined (in Sections 127(b)(2)(D) and 132(b)(1)(B)(v)(VI)) as the higher of \"the number that represents the number of unemployed individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the civilian labor force in the state\" or \"the number that represents the number of unemployed individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the civilian labor force in areas of substantial unemployment in such state.\" For the state formula grant for Dislocated Worker Activities, excess unemployment is defined (in Section 132(b)(2)(B)(iii)) as \"the number that represents the number of unemployed individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the civilian labor force in the state.\" For example, in a state with a civilian labor force of 100,000 and an unemployment rate of 8.0% (which would equal 8,000 unemployed individuals), the \"excess unemployment\" would be 3,500 (8.0% - 4.5% = 3.5%; 3.5% of 100,000 is 3,500).", "Long-Term Unemployment \u2014This concept is used in one of the factors for the Title I state formula grants for Dislocated Worker Activities.

Each formula consists of three equally weighted factors. The factors themselves are based on the concept of the \"relative number\" or \"relative share\" of that factor compared to the analogous number in all of the states. An example from the Dislocated Worker Activities formula\u2014based on the factors of regular unemployment, excess unemployment, and long-term unemployment\u2014will demonstrate this.

Multiplying each of these individuals by 1/3 and summing the results would give Nevada a total share of 1.31% ((1.10%*1/3) + (1.58%*1/3) + (1.25%*1/3)). Finally, multiplying Nevada's share, 1.31%, by the total Dislocated Worker state funding for all states ($1,012,728,000) yields $13,272,377, which Nevada received in PY2015.", "Authorized and Appropriated Funding for Programs Authorized Under WIOA", " Table B-1 , Table B-2 , Table B-3 , and Table B-4 below show the authorized level of appropriations for every program authorized in WIOA.
