{"id": "RL33085", "title": "Trade in Services: The Doha Development Agenda Negotiations and U.S. Goals", "released_date": "2011-03-10T00:00:00", "summary": ["The United States and the other 153 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have been conducting a set or \"round\" of negotiations called the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) since the end of 2001. The DDA's main objective is to refine and expand the rules by which WTO members conduct foreign trade with one another. A critical element of the DDA round is the negotiations pertaining to foreign trade in services. Trade in services has been covered under multilateral rules only since 1995 with the entry into force of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and of the Uruguay Round Agreements creating the WTO.", "The negotiations on services in the DDA round have two fundamental objectives. One objective is to reform the current GATS rules and principles. The second objective is for each member country to open more of its service sectors to foreign competition. The WTO services negotiations have been going on for more than 10 years. However, as with the negotiations in agriculture and non-agriculture market access, the services negotiations have proceeded slowly with missed deadlines and few results.", "The prospects for the negotiations are difficult to evaluate at this point. It is not unusual for negotiations to lag as participants wait to place their best negotiating positions on the table until just before crucial deadlines are reached. In July 2006, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA negotiations, including the services negotiations, because major WTO members could not agree on the terms or modalities for negotiations in agriculture and non-agriculture market access. He resumed the negotiations in 2007. In 2009, negotiators from major groups of developed and developing countries have worked to nail down the basic elements of a draft text; however, they failed so far to reach a consensus on the basic negotiating modalities. 2010 also produced little progress as the services negotiations continued to be hostage to the negotiations on agricultural and non-agricultural market access (NAMA) negotiations, which also showed little progress. In general participants have been reluctant to liberalize services trade much beyond their commitments already established in the GATS.", "Several factors will determine if and when the services negotiations will be completed. One factor is the political will the WTO members can muster to overcome the obstacles that hamper the negotiations. Another factor is to what degree the various participants are willing to compromise on goals in order to reach agreements. And a third factor is how quickly the issues in agriculture and non-agriculture market access are resolved; the sooner they are resolved the sooner negotiators can devote their attention to the services negotiations. This report will be updated as events warrant. Many Members of Congress consider the services negotiations to be a critical part, if not the most critical part, of the DDA round. These Members require strong commitments from U.S. trading partners to remove barriers in trade in services as part of an overall trade agreement they could support.. The DDA negotiations, including the negotiations on services, could be the subject of oversight during the 112th Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The United States and the other 153 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have been engaged in a set or \"round\" of negotiations called the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) since December 2001.

Services are a significant part of the U.S. economy and the source of most U.S. employment. Such is the case also with many other economically advanced countries. For many years, many in Congress and successive administrations have been pressing to make trade liberalization in services a priority in multilateral trade negotiations and a priority in the current round. In so doing, the United States has sought trade opportunities especially in developing countries for a competitive sector of the U.S. economy.", "The U.S. business community considers the DDA negotiations in services critical to providing predictability in global markets for services. Furthermore, the outcome of the services negotiations likely will have a significant impact on the credibility of the GATS, which remains a fledgling system of rules. If the negotiations fail, it would be considered by many observers a setback for U.S. trade policy.", "Congress would have to pass implementing legislation in order for any agreement on services (or for any agreement reached during the DDA) to become part of U.S. obligations under the WTO. However, before the agreement stage, Congress plays a consultative role during the negotiations as required by the legislation granting the President the fast track trade negotiating authority. Under this authority, the President can negotiate trade agreements that would be handled under expedited congressional procedures (limited debate and no amendments). Through consultation, Members can try to ensure that the Administration fulfills negotiating objectives as set out in trade law and is otherwise protecting U.S. economic interests as the Congress perceives them. The current trade promotion expired on July 1, 2007, and will have to be renewed before any DDA agreement would receive expedited congressional consideration.", "Many Members of Congress consider the services negotiations to be a critical part, if not the most critical part of the DDA round.

According to one definition, services are", "a diverse group of economic activities not directly associated with the manufacture of goods, mining or agriculture. They typically involve the provision of human value-added in the form of labor, advice, managerial skill, entertainment, training, intermediation, and the like.", "Services differ from manufactured goods in that they are intangible, cannot be stored and must be consumed at the point of production (trips to the doctor, enjoying a meal at the restaurant). However, rapid changes in technology are reducing even these restrictions on services (computer software that can be stored online, on disks, tape, etc.; accounting services that are provided via the internet). Illustrative examples of services include wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; banking and insurance; professional, scientific, and technical services; education; arts and entertainment; health care and social assistance; food and accommodation services; construction; communication; and public administration.", "Services are an increasingly significant sector of the U.S. economy. \u00a0In 2010, the service sector accounted for 83% of U.S. nonagricultural payroll jobs, for 65% of U.S. GDP (up from 55% in 1976). Many services have not only intrinsic value but are also critical to running other parts of large economies. For example, financial services (banking, investment, insurance) are the means by which capital flows throughout an economy from those who have it (savers, investors) to those who need it (borrowers). Financial services are often called the lifeblood of an economy. Delivery services are critical to ensuring that intermediate production goods and final end-user goods are available when needed. Distribution services (retail and wholesale services) provide the means by which goods are made available to consumers. Inefficiencies in any of these industries could have adverse consequences for the whole economy.", "U.S. trade in services, as customarily measured, plays an important role in overall U.S. trade, albeit, a much smaller role than trade in goods. In 2010 services accounted for 30% of total U.S. exports of goods and services and 17% of total U.S. imports of goods and services.", "Because most services require direct contact between supplier and consumer, many service providers prefer to establish or must establish a presence in the country of the consumer. For example, hotel and restaurant services require a presence in the country of the consumer. Providers of legal, accounting, and construction services prefer a direct presence because they need access to expert knowledge of the laws and regulations of the country in which they are doing business and they require proximity to clients. Thus, cross-border services trade data do not capture all of the trade in services.", "Data on sales of services by foreign affiliates of U.S.-owned companies and by U.S. affiliates of foreign-owned firms help to provide a more accurate, albeit still incomplete, measurement of trade in services. In 2008 (the latest year for which published data are available), U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates (compared to $518 billion in U.S. cross-border exports). Foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States (compared to $366 billion in cross-border imports). Even these two sets of figures do not capture the total value of trade in services. Two other modes of services delivery are through the temporary movement of consumers to the location of the provider and the temporary movement of the provider to the location of the consumer. U.S. data on the sales of services via these two modes of delivery are not readily available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The GATS: The International Rules of Trade", "paragraphs": ["The seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted more than a quarter century ago. In the Trade Act of 1974, the Congress instructed the Administration to promote an agreement on trade in services under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during the Tokyo Round negotiations. The Tokyo Round concluded in 1979 without a services agreement, but the industrialized countries, led by the United States, continued to press for its inclusion in later negotiations. By contrast, developing countries, whose service sectors are less advanced than those of the industrialized countries, were reluctant to have services covered by international trade rules. Eventually services were included as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations launched in 1986. During the Uruguay Round, GATT members agreed to a new set of rules for services, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and a new agency, the World Trade Organization (WTO), to administer the GATS, the GATT, and the other Uruguay Round Agreements, known as the Marrakesh Agreement.", "Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty identifies three main challenges to constructing rules for international trade in services: (1) to target the rules at domestic regulations that are the primary sources of barriers to trade in services; (2) to distinguish the legitimate use of regulations to protect the health and safety of residents from the use of regulations to protect domestic service providers from competition; and (3) to take into account that most services transactions take place behind customs borders rather than at customs border (as in the case of like goods trade). In addition to these, one might identify a fourth challenge: technology advances, such as the introduction of the internet, make once non-tradable services, for example consulting, tradable and also have led to the rapid introduction of services products that can be \"outsourced\" across borders. All of these challenges suggest a set of rules sufficiently flexible to meet them yet sufficiently rigid to provide meaningful discipline to WTO members' activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Four Modes of Delivery", "paragraphs": ["An important element to the structure of the GATS and the negotiations to expand the coverage of the GATS has been the recognition that most services transactions are conducted inside borders and that barriers to trade in services occur inside customs barriers. Effective trade rules would have to take into account the various modes of delivery in order to discern the barriers that foreign providers of services encounter when trying to sell in a trade-partner's market. The GATS divides the modes of delivery of services into four categories. As will be discussed later, the concessions that a member country makes in opening up its services market are largely mode-dependent. The four modes of delivery are:\\", "Cross-border supply (mode 1) \u2014the service is supplied from one country to another. The supplier and consumer remain in their respective countries, while the service crosses the border. For example, a U.S. architectural firm based in Chicago is hired by a client in Mexico to design a building. The U.S. firm does the design in Chicago and sends the blueprints to its client in Mexico. Consumption abroad (mode 2) \u2014The consumer physically travels to another country to obtain the service. A Mexican client travels to the United States to obtain the services of a U.S. architectural firm. Commercial presence (mode 3) \u2014The supplier of a service establishes a branch, agency, or wholly owned subsidiary in another country and supplies services to the local market. A U.S. architectural firm establishes a subsidiary in Mexico to sell services to local clients. Presence of natural persons (mode 4) \u2014Individual supplier travels temporarily to the country of the consumer. A U.S. architect travels to Mexico to provide design services to her Mexican client."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Structure of the GATS", "paragraphs": ["The GATS is an agreement among the 153 WTO members representing many levels of economic development.

The U.S. proposal notes, however, that the initial acquisition of federally owned land is restricted to U.S. citizens. Taxation measures: Foreigners engaged in providing scheduled services are taxed the same as U.S. residents with a few exceptions.", "Besides the horizontal commitments, the United States has offered scheduled commitments in a number of sectors and subsectors: business services, including professional services, accounting and bookkeeping, taxation services, and architectural and engineering services. The format for scheduling commitments requires WTO members to identify any national treatment and market access exceptions for each of the four delivery modes for each of the scheduled sectors and subsectors. In the case of the business services most of the exceptions relate to state restrictions or requirements on foreign service providers.", "In addition to business services, the United States has offered to make commitments in services related to market research and public opinion polling; management consulting; computer and related services; real estate services (that is, services provided to the ownership or leasing of property); services incidental to agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing; express delivery and other delivery services; telecommunication services (with the national treatment exception that foreigners cannot own common carrier or radio licenses); wholesale and retail trade services and franchising; higher education; environmental services; financial services; health related and social services; travel and tourism; recreational, cultural and specialty services; transportation services (except maritime services); energy services; and construction and related services.", "Developing countries have criticized the United States for not offering broader commitments, arguing that the sectors in which the United States has offered commitments, such as express delivery and energy services, are not ones that would be useful to them. The European Union has criticized the United States for not offering to open maritime services and postal services to foreign competition. Developing countries and some developed countries have focused most of their criticism on U.S. commitments and offers under the mode-4 category of delivery, for example, that U.S. offers are restricted to business executives and other personnel and with close ties to foreign companies having a commercial presence in the United States. India argues that it would need access for software specialists, computer experts, and information technology engineers who would not be directly affiliated to an Indian-owned firm in the United States.

The United States and the EU separately proposed that negotiators establish \"benchmarks\" of certain targeted sectors on which WTO members would agree to make commitments. U.S. officials argued for commitments in six core sectors\u2014financial services, telecommunications, energy, express delivery, computer and other information-related services, and audio-visual services. The EU argued for a smaller list and would allow members to choose to make commitments from a certain percentage of the core sectors for all four delivery modes. ", "The \"benchmark\" proposals met with strong opposition from many developing countries who asserted that it was too late in the negotiation to use a different negotiating format and that the established mandate for the DDA negotiations specifically requires the \"request-offer\" format to be used. (Proponents of \"benchmarks\" responded that they would be used as a supplement to the \"request-offer\" approach and not as a substitute.) Some developing countries also argued that benchmarks would probably focus on those sectors that the developed countries favored since they wield the most influence. The U.S. services business community voiced concern that focusing on benchmarks might divert the attention of negotiators and cause additional delays in the process.", "Canada proposed, supported by the United States and other developed countries, changes in the negotiating process in order to provide a jolt to the negotiations on services. For example, the United States has pressed to have countries identify more clearly concessions that they would we willing to put on the table before issues in the agriculture and non-agricultural negotiations are completed. The proposal was intended to address a frustration on the part of those countries that the current \"sequencing\" of negotiations\u2014services to follow agriculture and non-agriculture\u2014has frustrated the services negotiations. Developing countries have rejected the proposal and insist on maintaining the current sequencing. ", "The positive list approach (whereby members list only the sectors and subsectors that are to be covered) to market access commitments has also been criticized. The primary criticism has been that it could be a disincentive to market access liberalization: the default in the negotiations is that sectors and subsectors are not covered by WTO rules unless specifically identified and the schedules of commitments would not cover new sectors and subsectors that emerge in between rounds of negotiations.", "On the other hand, this approach is also viewed as a more conducive way to get reluctant members, particularly developing countries, to participate in the negotiations.

It has divided many developed countries and developing countries, although differing positions have emerged among members of each category. Much of developing country criticism of the United States has been regarding mode-4. It has also created some tension between the U.S. business community and the U.S. government. All of this criticism is despite the fact that mode-4 accounts for less that 1% of world trade in services.", "The controversy arises in part because the issue of mode-4 delivery is closely related to immigration policy in the United States and some other countries, and comes at a time when the United States has tightened restrictions in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001.", "Article I-1(d) defines mode-4 as pertaining to the supply of a service, \"by a service supplier of one [WTO] Member, through presence of natural persons of a Member in the territory of any other Member.\" An annex to the GATS on mode-4 further states that the GATS, \"shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the employment market of a Member, nor shall it apply to measures regarding citizenship, residence or employment on a permanent basis.\"", "Several developing countries have criticized the United States for not offering more on mode-4 commitments. India has criticized the visa restrictions placed on temporary workers entering the United States, particularly workers not directly affiliated with companies located in the United States and has also called for greater transparency of U.S. immigration regulations pertaining to the temporary entry of personnel.", "The mode-4 issue has also manifested itself as an issue of congressional authority. In July 2003, during congressional consideration of the implementing bills for the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Committee objected to the inclusion of changes in U.S. visa policies to allow increases in the quotas of workers entering the United States. They argued that changes in visa rules must be separate from trade legislation that is considered by Congress under expedited (fast-track) procedures. Compromises were reached to allow the two bills to be voted on, but not without bipartisan warnings from both committees that changes in visa policy should no longer be part of bilateral or multilateral trade agreements.", "The U.S. business community has maintained that the United States needs to be more flexible in its mode-4 offers, arguing that failure to do so stalls the negotiations and prevents United States from obtaining useful commitments from developing countries.

One assessment for World Bank concluded the offers that many WTO members, especially the developing countries, have changed little from the commitments that they made under the Uruguay Round and do not reflect the actual levels of openness of their services market. The study indicates that the best offers made to date are, on average, 1.9 times more restrictive than the actual policies. In other words, WTO members have refused to even lock in (bind) the trade in services they have in place but instead want to have the option of applying more restrictions on trade in services without violating WTO commitments. ", "The prospects of the negotiations were set back when WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA, including the services negotiations, indefinitely on July 24, 2006, after a meeting of the G-6 WTO members, consisting of the United States, the European Union, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and India, failed to agree on the basic conditions or modalities, for conducting the agriculture and NAMA negotiations. Although the negotiations resumed in 2007, progress on the services negotiations remains sluggish at best. Even before the suspension, the services negotiations had not been going well. ", "Several possible reasons can be cited for the lack of progress. One is the division between developed countries that have advanced services sectors employing highly skilled labor and the developing countries with less-developed services industries. The former group seeks market opportunities for its services providers and is more willing to open its markets to competition. The latter group is more protective of its domestic services providers.", "The halting progress in the agriculture and NAMA negotiations in the DDA has been a major impediment to the services negotiations. Some developing countries have asserted that they will not improve their offers until the United States and the European Union commit to reduce their agriculture subsidies. The developed countries want commitments from developing countries to reduce the \"water\" in their commitments, that is, the difference between the liberalization they have agreed to (bound) and their actual level of market liberalization.", "A third reason could be the complexity of the agenda of the services negotiations and the number of players involved. \"Services\" includes a broad range of economic activities many with few characteristics in common except that they are not goods. The trade barriers exporters face differ across services sectors making the formulation of trade rules a significant challenge. Furthermore, services negotiations include many participants. In addition to trade ministers, they include representatives of regulatory agencies many of whom do not consider trade liberalization a primary part of their mission.", "The prospects for the negotiations are difficult to evaluate at this point. It is not unusual for negotiations to lag as participants wait to place their best negotiating positions on the table until just before crucial deadlines are reached.", "Several factors will determine if and when the services negotiations will be completed. One factor is the political will the WTO members can muster to overcome the obstacles that plague the negotiations. Another factor is the extent the various participants are willing to compromise on goals in order to reach agreements. And a third factor is how quickly the issues in agriculture and non-agriculture market access are resolved; the sooner they are resolved the sooner negotiators can devote their full attention to the services negotiations.", "From December 13-18, 2005, WTO trade ministers held the sixth WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong. The trade ministers were expected to emerge from meeting with modalities that would accelerate the DDA negotiations to their conclusion by the end of 2006. In the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, WTO members reaffirmed their commitment to complete the services negotiations with special consideration given to the needs of developing and the least developed countries. Annex C to the Declaration provides modalities and parameters for completing the negotiations.", "In September 2007, the chairman of the trade in services negotiations began a process to develop a draft text of an agreement and called on member-country negotiators to submit contributions. However, by the end of 2007, it was clear that the countries were still sharply divided on basic objectives. Developed countries, including the United States, have argued for member-countries at a minimum to commit to binding their current practices on trade in services. Developing countries, including Argentina, argued against such benchmarks and resisted making additional commitments until developed countries commit to greater reductions of subsidies for agriculture. In July 2008, WTO General Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in Geneva to again try to hammer out the modalities for the agriculture and NAMA negotiations. On July 26, 2008, a \"signaling\" conference was held with 32 representatives, including the United States and two representing the EU. The conference was designed to ascertain where participants stood in terms of the offers they were willing to make and the expectation they have of their trading partners. While the conference did bring to light some areas of possible commitment, it did little to move the negotiations ahead. In 2009, the WTO members held \"cluster\" meetings to try to provide some momentum with limited results. There was little accomplished in the services negotiations in 2010, in part because they remained hostage to the agriculture and NAMA and negotiations, but also because many of the participants were reluctant to go beyond current levels of liberalization.", "In a written question submitted to Michael Punke as part of his confirmation hearing to become deputy USTR, ranking member of Senate Finance Committee Senator Charles Grassley said, \"the Doha services negotiations are bogged down.
