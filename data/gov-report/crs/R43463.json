The Travel Promotion Act of 2009 (TPA; P.L. 111-145) first authorized federal funds for Brand USA. The program is funded by a $10 user fee assessed on international visitors from more than three dozen visa waiver program countries and requires annual in-kind and cash matching contributions from the U.S. tourism industry. Brand USA can receive matching federal funds capped at $100 million annually. The program has been controversial, with some Members of Congress characterizing it as an inappropriate use of federal funds to benefit private entities.

A travel industry advocacy group, the U.S. Travel Association (U.S. Travel), estimates the average overseas visitor spends approximately $4,500 domestically on activities such as shopping, dining, and sightseeing. Foreign visitors stay on average more than 17 nights, and their expenditures outpace domestic visitor spending. According to World Bank data, the United States received 6.2% of global tourism arrivals in 2012 and accounted for more than 15% of global spending on travel and tourism, compared with 7.3% and 21%, respectively, in 2000.

After adjusting for inflation, BEA estimates that tourism output rose 3.6% in 2013, the fourth consecutive year of growth following a steep decline in 2009. Even so, BEA approximates that tourism output in 2013 was about 3% lower than in the peak year of 2007, after adjusting for inflation. This finding mirrors other data. For instance, 646 million passengers boarded domestic commercial flights in 2013, 5% below the 2007 peak of 679 million.", "A particular economic attraction of tourism is that it enables state and local governments to generate significant amounts of revenue without taxing their own citizens. Taxes on hotel rooms, automobile rentals, and admission tickets fall heavily on visitors. Annual collections of such taxes cannot be determined; however, according to the Census Bureau, selective sales taxes, including taxes on hotel rooms and rental cars as well as on certain nontourist items, generated $67 billion in 2012, amounting to 5% of state and local governments' tax revenues. Sales taxes on amusements, the only tourism-related category broken out separately, provided an additional $7 billion of revenue.", "In a 2005 study, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service compared more than 300 rural counties that it defined as \"recreation counties\" with counties that had fewer tourism-related activities. The researchers found that during the 1990s, the recreation counties had three times the average population growth and twice the job growth of other rural counties. Additional benefits included rising land prices, less poverty, higher incomes, and more economic diversification. Though housing rental and purchase prices rose, wages tended to rise fast enough to compensate for the higher costs. The study found that \"while other types of growth can have similar benefits, rural recreation and tourism development may provide greater diversification, and, for many places, it may be easier to achieve than other kinds of development\u2014such as high-tech development\u2014because it does not require a highly educated workforce.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Employment and Wages", "paragraphs": ["The travel and tourism sector is labor-intensive, resulting in large employment per dollar spent, and employs many workers with relatively little training or education.

As of that date, tourism employment had still not fully recovered from the 2007-2009 recession, when the industry shed about 750,000 jobs over a three-year period.

In 2012, average compensation per tourism employee in food services and drinking places was $21,300, and in retail trade services was $33,500 (see Table 3 ). These low annual wages often reflect many seasonal or part-time jobs, low barriers to entry, a relatively young workforce, and some large industry segments that require workers with fewer skills than other industries. Worker turnover in travel- and tourism-related businesses tends to be higher than for the labor force as a whole.", "Not all segments of the tourism industry pay low wages, although those that pay more employ far fewer tourism workers than larger segments such as food services, retail trade, and traveler accommodations.

Foreigners are estimated to have accounted for 24% of spending on lodging, 20% of food and beverage demand, and 26% of total passenger air transportation demand in 2012. A likely explanation is that foreigners spend, on average, far more on their U.S. travels than Americans do. U.S. Travel estimates that in 2011, for example, the average Chinese visitor spent $7,107, the average Brazilian tourist $5,605, and the average Indian visitor $6,664.

Some leading, or rapidly developing, areas of tourism include the following:", "Cultural Heritage Tourism. This form of tourism is defined by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as travel \"to experience the places and activities that authentically represent the stories and people of the past and present. It includes historic, cultural, and natural resources.\" Cultural heritage travelers participate in diverse activities such as visiting art galleries or museums, attending a concert, play, or musical, and recreating at national parks or monuments. Congress has established 49 National Heritage Areas in the United States. The Bureau of Land Management, for example, has held workshops and produced educational activities on heritage tourism, recognizing it as a growing activity on federal lands. Sustainable Tourism or E cotourism. Sustainable tourism describes activities that take advantage of natural resources or other natural or cultural attributes while promoting local economic development and avoiding damaging environmental impacts. A number of organizations such as WTTC's greenglobe.org and the Danish organization blueflag.org inspect and verify that hotels and other facilities that bill themselves as eco-friendly meet certain standards. Meetings/C onventions. The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) estimated in 2013 that meetings and trade shows would represent more than 40% of the projected $274 billion spent that year on business travel in the United States. To meet demand, exhibit space in the United States has increased by 50% over the last 20 years, and since 2005, 44 new convention spaces have been planned or constructed. Medical T ourism. Travel to another country or region to access medical services that are more expensive or are unavailable near a consumer's home is known as medical tourism. Data on the actual size of the industry are elusive. Publicly available estimates on the flow of tourists traveling for medical treatments each year run from 60,000 to somewhere between 30 million and 50 million. Agritourism. Agritourism involves supplementing income from farming and natural resource activities with tourism-related activities, from harvest festivals to farm vacations. There is little authoritative information on the size of the market. According to the 2012 U.S. Census of Agriculture, 33,161 farms provided agritourism and recreation services valued at $704 million. Space T ourism . Several private spaceflight companies, including SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, are selling orbital and suborbital flights, and it is possible that the first commercial space passenger service will be launched in 2015. The possibility of space tourism has raised a variety of legal and policy questions, some of which were addressed in a February 2014 hearing of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Space.

Congress steadily increased funding for USTTA until 1997, when it was dissolved.

For example, BEA assumes that 17% of U.S. restaurant meals are purchased by visitors, along with 100% of hotel rooms and 27% of taxi trips. In addition to its estimates of direct spending, defined as goods and services bought by travelers, BEA estimates indirect spending related to travel and tourism. The sum of direct and indirect spending is often cited in public discussions of the importance of travel and tourism.
