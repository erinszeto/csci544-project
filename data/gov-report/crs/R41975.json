Streaming allows a person to view or listen to creative content without first needing to download a data file containing the content onto a hard drive or memory card, assuming the user's electronic device maintains an active connection to the Internet during the duration of the performance of the material. There are many legitimate streaming websites that offer on-demand streams of television programs, motion pictures, live sporting events, and sound recordings. However, so-called \"rogue\" websites willfully stream copyrighted content without the permission of the copyright holder, thus violating the copyright holder's exclusive right to control public performance of the work. By offering consumers an unauthorized alternative for obtaining streaming content, these rogue websites may reduce the number of people who would otherwise visit the legitimate providers of copyrighted material. Such harm to the legitimate market for streaming of copyrighted content may negatively impact the U.S. film and television industries as well as the U.S. economy as a whole. In addition, some believe that rogue websites \"expose consumers to criminals, who routinely collect personal and financial information from unsuspecting targets, subjecting those consumers not only to fraud and deceit, but also to identity theft and other harms.\" ", "To enforce their intellectual property rights, copyright holders may file a lawsuit against those who illegally stream their protected works. They may also file a lawsuit against those who engage in the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works (whether using Internet technologies or traditional methods). In addition to these civil remedies, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has the power to criminally prosecute particularly egregious copyright infringers (repeat and large-scale offenders) in order to impose greater punishment and possibly deter other would-be infringers. ", "However, a disparity exists regarding the criminal penalties available for those who willfully infringe copyrights by means of reproduction and distribution (a felony offense in certain circumstances) and those who infringe copyrights by means of public performance (a misdemeanor). In the digital context, this means that DOJ prosecutors could seek felony penalties for those who engage in willful, unauthorized copying and distributing of copyrighted material using Internet technologies, depending on the specific facts of the allegedly infringing activity; such penalties include imprisonment sentences of up to 10 years. In comparison, prosecutors may only file misdemeanor charges that carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison against those who engage in willful, unauthorized online performance of copyrighted works.

One recent technological change is the illegal streaming of content. Existing law provides felony penalties for willful copyright infringement, but felony penalties are predicated on the defendant either illegally reproducing or distributing the copyrighted work. Questions have arisen about whether streaming constitutes the distribution of copyrighted works (and thereby is a felony) and/or performance of those works (and thereby is a not a felony). These questions have impaired the criminal enforcement of copyright laws. To ensure that Federal copyright law keeps pace with infringers, and to ensure that DOJ and U.S. law enforcement agencies are able to effectively combat infringement involving new technology, the Administration recommends that Congress clarify that infringement by streaming, or by means of other similar new technology, is a felony in appropriate circumstances.", "This report describes streaming technology, explains the disparity in criminal penalties for different forms of infringement committed by electronic means, analyzes legislation in the 112 th Congress that would harmonize penalties for illegal streaming with those available for other forms of online copyright infringement, and summarizes arguments for and against such a legislative change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Brief Overview of Copyright Law", "paragraphs": ["Copyright is a federal grant of legal protection for certain works of creative expression, including books, motion pictures, television shows, photographs, artwork, and music.

Although such technologies have legitimate purposes, they may also be misused in ways that infringe copyrights. Until recently, most forms of online copyright infringement involved violations of the copyright holder's reproduction and distribution rights; for example, rogue websites that offer illegal downloads of copyrighted movies and software, or peer-to-peer file sharing of copyrighted sound recordings, infringe both the copyright holder's reproduction right (through the unauthorized copying of copyrighted content) and distribution right (through the unauthorized dissemination of these unlawfully made copies).", "However, technological advances in recent years\u2014such as increased capacity in network bandwidth, faster broadband connections for consumers, more powerful computer processors, new transmission protocols, and more efficient data compression methods\u2014have made possible the public performances of a wide range of copyrighted works over the Internet, including live content (such as sporting events) or pre-recorded performances (such as television programming and motion pictures). Streaming technology enables such public performance of copyrighted material from a particular source to a destination such as a personal computer, television, smartphone, or video game console. Consumers have many ways of receiving entertainment content and information through legitimate video streaming websites such as Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, HBO GO, MLB.com, and Crackle.

As noted earlier, copyright holders may sue operators of illegal streaming websites to enforce their intellectual property rights. The federal government may also prosecute rogue streaming websites for criminal copyright infringement, although the remedies authorized by law appear to be limited to misdemeanor penalties. ", "The difficulty in criminally prosecuting those who illegally stream copyrighted works is that the law is unclear whether the act of streaming is considered a distribution of a copyrighted work or a public performance of the work. Some claim that this lack of clarity over the availability of felony penalties for unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content has made federal prosecutors \"reluctant to pursue cases against even the most egregious, illegal Internet streaming services\" because they \"tend to focus their limited resources and manpower on prosecuting felony offenses that might result in significant jail time.\" The Register of Copyrights testified before Congress that streaming is \"a lesser crime on the books\" that \"may never be punished at all\" because \"prosecutors have little incentive to file charges for a mere misdemeanor.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Criminal Copyright Statutes Relating to the Internet", "paragraphs": ["In 1997 and 2005, Congress passed laws providing criminal penalties for certain Internet activity that infringes copyrights. The No Electronic Theft Act (NET Act) was enacted in 1997 as a response to a 1994 federal district court decision, United States v. LaMacchia . The defendant in LaMacchia, an MIT graduate student, operated an electronic bulletin board system that allowed users to upload and download infringing software and videogames. The defendant established and operated this BBS for fun and did not seek any personal financial benefit from it. The DOJ could not prosecute him for criminal copyright infringement because, at the time of this case, the criminal copyright infringement statute required willful infringement committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain. Instead, the DOJ charged the defendant with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. However, the federal judge dismissed the indictment against LaMacchia because of a 1985 Supreme Court decision, Dowling v. United States , that ruled that the wire fraud statute could not be used as a copyright enforcement tool. In dismissing the indictment, the judge noted that Congress has the power to change the law:", "This is not, of course, to suggest that there is anything edifying about what LaMacchia is alleged to have done. If the indictment is to be believed, one might at best describe his actions as heedlessly irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values. Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer. One can envision ways that the copyright law could be modified to permit such prosecution. But, it is the legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.", "The NET Act was designed to close the LaMacchia loophole in criminal copyright law. It amended the Copyright Act and the criminal code several ways, including the following:", "1. Expanded the scope of the term \"financial gain\" in the definitions section of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. \u00a7101) to include the receipt (or expectation of receipt) of anything of value, including other copyrighted works. Thus, federal prosecutors need not prove that the defendant received cash as a result of a criminal copyright infringement, but instead that he received (or expected to receive) something of value (for example, he provided infringing copies to others in exchange for other copyrighted works). 2. Created a new criminal copyright offense, 17 U.S.C. Section 506(a)(1)(B), that does not require willful infringement for commercial advantage or private financial gain; instead, the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180 day period, of copyrighted works with a total retail value of more than $1,000, is itself an act that is eligible for criminal prosecution (regardless whether the defendant benefited or expected to benefit from the infringement). 3. Amended the criminal code provision (18 U.S.C. \u00a72319) that specifies punishments for the criminal offenses described in the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. \u00a7506(a)) by adding the words \"including by electronic means\" after \"reproduction or distribution,\" in referring to the felony offense that prohibits the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of 10 or more copies of copyrighted works with a total retail value of at least $2,500, for the purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.", "Notably, the NET Act addressed the types of online infringing activity (unauthorized reproduction and distribution) that were most prevalent at that time; it does not apply to unauthorized public performances of copyrighted works over the Internet.", "Congress enacted the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 that included the Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005 (ART Act). The ART Act created a new statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 2319B, that expressly prohibits the unauthorized recording of motion pictures in a movie theater. In addition, it established a new category of criminal infringement: unauthorized distribution of a pre-release commercial copyrighted work. This provision was intended to address the problem of people knowingly distributing via the Internet unlawfully acquired copies of motion pictures, musical works, software, and sound recordings, before the copyright holder has made them legally available to the public. The two provisions are complimentary in that people may use a camcorder to record a movie being performed in a movie theater and then distribute that recording over the Internet before the movie is distributed by the copyright holder in DVD or downloadable formats. However, like the NET Act, the ART Act did not expand the scope of criminal copyright law to include unauthorized public performances of copyrighted works over the Internet. ", "With the amendments made by the ART Act to the criminal copyright infringement statute, 17 U.S.C. Section 506(a), there are currently three independent bases for criminal prosecution for copyright infringement:", "1.

This disparity creates an \"impediment[] to effective prosecution\" of willful unauthorized streaming websites. The Register of Copyrights has endorsed the idea of creating felony penalties for unauthorized streaming activity, arguing that \"[a]s a matter of policy, the public performance right should enjoy the same measure of protection from criminals as the reproduction and distribution rights; prosecutors should have the option of seeking felony penalties for such activity, when appropriate.\" An organization representing copyright holders explained the need for such legislative changes as follows:", "At a narrow level, the issue of making illegal streaming a felony crime is simply a technical clarification. Illegally disseminating other people's works without their permission should be punished the same way under law regardless of the technology used to accomplish such dissemination.

Even assuming that the public performer is the streamer (the person who uploaded the content), it is unclear, some critics contend, whether the legislation's threshold of \"10 or more public performances\" refers to 10 unique views of the work by end users, or whether the streamer must post the content 10 separate times.", "In the cable and satellite television industry, a business dispute has arisen over whether existing retransmission agreements between cable and satellite companies and copyright holders allow the companies to stream copyrighted content to their subscribers.
