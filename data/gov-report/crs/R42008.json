They can be summarized as protecting the nation's financial system against a host of illicit activities (particularly money laundering and terrorist financing), collecting tax revenue and enforcing tax laws, managing and accounting for federal debt, administering the federal government's finances, regulating financial institutions, and producing and distributing coins and currency.", "At its most basic level of organization, Treasury consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus. In general, the offices are responsible for formulating and implementing policy initiatives and managing Treasury's operations, while the bureaus undertake specific tasks assigned to Treasury, mainly through statutory mandates. In the past decade or so, the bureaus have accounted for more than 95% of the agency's funding and work force.", "With one exception, the bureaus and offices can be divided into those engaged in financial management and regulation and those engaged in law enforcement. In recent decades, the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Financial Management Service, Bureau of the Public Debt, Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, and Office of Thrift Supervision have taken on responsibilities related to the management of the federal government's finances or the supervision and regulation of the U.S. financial system. In contrast, law enforcement arguably has been central to the responsibilities handled by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. With the advent of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, Treasury's direct involvement in law enforcement has shrunk considerably. The exception to this simplified dichotomy is the Internal Revenue Service, whose main responsibilities encompass both the collection of tax revenue and the enforcement of tax laws and regulations.", "The operating budget for most Treasury bureaus and offices comes largely from annual appropriations. This is the case for the IRS, FMS, Bureau of Public Debt, FinCEN, ATB, Office of the Inspector General, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. By contrast, funding for the Treasury Franchise Fund, the U.S. Mint, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Office of the Comptroller of the Treasury, and the Office of Thrift Supervision stems from the fees they receive for the services and products they provide.", "In FY2011, appropriations for the Treasury Department are distributed among 11 accounts, each of which is described briefly below.", "Departmental Offices (DO): covers the salaries and other expenses of offices in the department that formulate and implement policies in the areas of domestic and international finance, terrorist financing and other financial crimes, taxation, international trade, and the domestic economy.

The office was established by the same law that created TARP: the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act ( P.L. 110-343 ).", "Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN): covers salaries and other expenses related to the activities of FinCEN, whose main responsibility is to protect the domestic financial system from illicit uses, such as money laundering and terrorist financing. The legal basis for this role is the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA; P.L. 91-508).

The ways in which the proposed budget addresses each objective are examined below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Repair and Reform the Financial System", "paragraphs": ["According to Treasury budget documents, the FY2012 budget proposal would allow the department to take a variety of steps aimed at encouraging the repair and reform of the financial system. Several deserve brief mention here. One step is the implementation of a few key provisions of the financial regulatory reform bill enacted in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which is widely known as the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the act, Treasury is responsible for managing the creation of two new independent regulatory agencies (the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the Financial Stability Oversight Council) and is required to create two new offices (the Office of Financial Research and the Federal Insurance Office). Another step involves administering two new programs (the Small Business Lending Fund and the State Small Business Credit Initiative) established by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. They are intended to increase the availability of credit to small businesses. In addition, repair and reform of the financial system remains a primary objective of Treasury's continuing efforts to ensure the viability of government-sponsored enterprises such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, promote economic and community development through the CDFI, and manage the TARP program. ", "These initiatives provide part of the rationale for the Administration's request for an additional $20 million in appropriations for DO and an additional $11 million in appropriations for SIGTARP. Of the requested increase in DO funding, $5.5 million would be used to acquire the expertise needed to carry out Treasury's responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank Act.

As has been the case in recent years, the main concern is the size of the gross federal tax gap, which is the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid in full and on time, before collection actions are taken. This gap reached an estimated $345 billion in 2001, the most recent year for which an estimate is available. Recent sharp rises in the federal budget deficit, coupled with a strong congressional interest in finding additional sources of revenue as part of an effort to eliminate projected budget deficits and shrink the burgeoning federal debt, have intensified the pressure on the department to do more to collect delinquent taxes.", "The budget request would improve voluntary tax compliance through the enactment of several changes in the tax code and targeted investments in IRS enforcement activities, taxpayer service, and business systems modernization. These initiatives are intended to boost tax collections by strengthening tax administration, improving business compliance, and expanding information reporting, \"with minimum additional burden on taxpayers.\" Treasury officials estimate that the initiatives could increase tax collection by more than $10 billion over the next 10 years. Of the requested $1.162 billion increase in IRS appropriations for FY2012, $795 million (or about 68% of the total) would be used for new enforcement initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Significantly Increase Paperless Transactions with the Public", "paragraphs": ["Treasury's budget request also assigns a high priority to moving the department closer to the goal of the paperless processing of all transactions, including payments and collections. Starting in calendar year 2012, individuals receiving Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Veterans Administration, Railroad Retirement Board, Office of Personnel Management, and Black Lung benefits will be required to receive the payments electronically, through either direct deposit into a bank account or a Treasury Direct Express debit card. Moreover, Treasury will no longer issue paper savings bonds after December 31, 2011. Once the goal of the complete electronic processing of transactions is reached, Treasury expects to save $525 million and 12 million pounds of paper over the following five years.", "While the FY2012 budget request seems to designate no funds for new initiatives to accelerate the move toward complete paperless transactions, funding remains available for two initiatives that are supposed to commence in FY2011. Treasury's budget request for FY2011 included $22 million in added funding for departmental systems and capital investments. The funds were to be used to create two new programs: Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and the Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT). ECM is intended to establish a common approach among Treasury offices and bureaus to modernizing their \"document-based business processes.\" FIT seeks to develop and expand shared government-wide solutions to issues in financial management, such as invoice processing, cash collections, and interagency agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Noteworthy Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The Treasury Department's budget request for FY2012 would do much more than fund activities aimed at achieving its three strategic goals. A substantial share of the requested funding is intended to enable Treasury's bureaus to meet their statutory responsibilities and core missions even when budget planning is difficult. Of particular concern are satisfying conflicting demands to cut costs and improve or enhance services at the same time. The budget request addresses this concern in two ways: by providing the required services at a reduced cost in some cases, and by meeting a perceived need for expanded operations through an increase in funding in other cases. Several notable examples of each approach can be found in the budget request.", "For instance, the budget request would allow the Treasury Department to reap about $227 million in savings from efficiency improvements and program reductions in FY2012, relative to outlays in FY2011. Planned process improvements at the IRS could yield $190 million in savings; $10.1 million in savings could come from consolidating the administrative and data centers for the FMS; a proposed consolidation of information technology resources at the BPD could provide $6.6 million in savings; consolidating the certification and accreditation operations and data center at TIGTA could produce $2.6 million in savings; $2.1 million could be saved through staffing reductions and improved efficiency in the use of information technology at FinCEN; and planned changes in the departmental offices could provide $15.4 million in savings.", "The FY2012 budget request also calls for $92.6 million in appropriations for Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI), or $7.4 million less than the amount specified for that purpose in FY2011. TFI develops and implements strategies to counter terrorist financing, money laundering, and other financial crimes. It also imposes and enforces trade and financial sanctions on designated countries (e.g., Burma, Iran, and North Korea) in support of foreign policy goals, such as arresting the proliferation of nuclear weapons and combating Islamic terrorism. The proposed reduction in funding for TFI may have little impact on its ability to perform its functions, as the reduction would stem from savings from a cutback in staff travel, the elimination of overseas support for its Brussels liaison, and increased efficiency in the procurement of contracts, information technology licenses, subscriptions, and supplies.", "Appropriations for improving taxpayer services at the IRS would rise by $114 million under the budget request for FY2012. About $44 million of that amount would be used to raise the level of customer service provided through the agency's toll-free telephone services, while $33 million would be invested in a multi-year effort to upgrade the IRS.gov website so it can handle expected growth in taxpayer demand for electronic tax information. ", "In addition, the budget request would permanently cancel (or withdraw) $600 million and transfer of $30 million to FinCEN from the unobligated balances of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF). The fund serves as the receipt account for the deposit of assets held by criminal enterprises that have been seized by five federal agencies, including the IRS and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau at the Department of Homeland Security. Funds in the account normally are used to sustain and improve the capabilities of those agencies to conduct criminal investigations, seizures, and forfeitures, and to cover expenses related to those activities. Still, money may be withdrawn from the TFF to pay for other law enforcement activities undertaken by member bureaus, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Congress must be notified before such a withdrawal can be made.", "The enactment of several tax bills in 2009 and 2010 has placed new demands on the administrative capabilities of the IRS. One such law is proving to be especially challenging: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA; P.L. 111-148 ). According to the IRS, the act contains more than 40 provisions that modify different aspects of federal tax law between 2010 and 2018. Some of the provisions needed to be implemented during the 2010 tax year, including a small business tax credit for health insurance, an expanded adoption credit, and a credit for qualified therapeutic discoveries. In 2011, the IRS is to take on the added responsibilities of administering a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services, an increased penalty for unqualified withdrawals from health savings accounts (HSAs), and a new definition of medical expenses that qualify for flexible spending accounts and HSAs. ", "To implement and administer the tax provisions in the act, the IRS has determined that additional resources are needed to construct new information technology systems; change existing tax processing systems; expand taxpayer services and outreach; enhance notices, collections, and case management systems to address and resolve taxpayer problems in a timely manner; and conduct properly focused examinations. Funding for these resources is spread mainly among three appropriations accounts: taxpayer services, enforcement, and operations support. ", "In FY2010 and FY2011, the IRS is obtaining funds for implementing PPACA provisions through transfers from a fund (the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund) managed by the Department of Health and Human Services; a total of $179 million had been transferred through late July 2011. The IRS reportedly has decided that it will not draw upon money in the Fund after FY2011. For FY2012, the IRS is asking Congress for $473 million in appropriations for PPACA implementation. Most of that amount ($391 million) would go into the budget for operations support and be used for the acquisition and development of information technology and infrastructure; about $51 million would come from funds appropriated for enforcement; the remaining $32 million would come out of funds appropriated for taxpayer services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Noteworthy Assessments of the Administration's Budget Request for the IRS in FY2012", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Oversight Board", "paragraphs": ["The IRS Oversight Board was established by the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 mainly to oversee the IRS's performance in administering the tax laws, managing its operations, and pursuing its strategic goals. Section 7802(d) of the federal tax code requires the board to review and approve the annual budget proposal submitted by the IRS to the Treasury Department. A critical consideration in the assessment is the extent to which the proposal supports the annual and long-term strategic objectives of the agency. The same tax code provision requires the President to submit the board's budget recommendation to Congress together with his budget request for the IRS.", "For FY2012, the board recommends that the IRS receive $13.342 billion in appropriated funds, or $1.220 billion more than the amount enacted for FY2011, nearly $59 million more than the budget request for FY2012, and $1.826 billion more than the amount recommended in the FY2012 appropriations bill ( H.R. 2434 ) reported by the House Appropriations Committee on July 7, 2011. In the board's view, its budget recommendation is the \"minimum imperative for strong and responsible tax administration.\" Of the recommended amount, $2.35 billion would go to taxpayer services, $5.97 billion to enforcement, $4.67 billion to operations support, $334 million to the BSM, and $18 million to the administration of the health insurance tax credit. These amounts are mostly consistent with the budget request. The primary difference is that the board favors putting more resources into upgrading IRS security systems.", "Among its budget recommendations, the board assigns the top priority to boosting funding for the BSM. This includes any funds in the operations support account used for the development of the information technology infrastructure needed to support the maintenance of BSM elements that already have been implemented. In the board's view, increased investment in modernizing the core taxpayer account system for individuals is vital to laying the technological foundation for future advances in IRS operational efficiency, taxpayer service, and tax law enforcement. Nearly 60% (or $157 million) of the recommended BSM budget would go into the Customer Account Data Engine 2 (CADE 2) program. At the current pace of progress, CADE 2 is expected to allow for the daily processing of individual taxpayer accounts beginning with the 2012 filing season. When fully operational, the program will have several tangible benefits for taxpayers, including more timely account balance information and faster refunds to the tens of millions of taxpayers who are due a refund each tax year. ", "Achieving an 80% level of service for IRS's toll-free telephone lines during FY2012 is the board's second-highest priority. The level of service, or LOS, measures the percentage of calls that go through to an IRS customer service representative out of all incoming calls over a period. In FY2008, the LOS reached 53%, but it has been rising ever since and stands at 74% according to the IRS, in FY2011. In the board's estimation, appropriations for taxpayer service should be increased by at least $23.3 million from the amount enacted for FY2011 in order to reach that level of service. Tens of millions of taxpayers still depend on the toll-free telephone service to understand their tax obligations and their eligibility for tax credits and other tax preferences, and to resolve their account balances. Recent changes to the tax laws have boosted demand for the service, a trend that is likely to continue in the next few years, as the IRS begins to implement certain PPACA provisions. ", "In addition, the board agrees with the budget request's estimate that the IRS will require additional funding of $473 million in FY2012 and a staff of 1,269 full-time equivalent employees to implement PPACA provisions.

Under H.R. 2434 , \"not less than\" $5.1 million would be provided for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program, $9.5 million in grants for low-income taxpayer clinics, and $12 million in grants for Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA).

The House committee further recommends that funding for the administration of the health insurance tax credit established by the Trade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ) be folded into appropriations for taxpayer services and that \"not less than\" $15.5 million be used for that purpose in FY2012. In addition, the House committee expresses approval of the IRS's decision not to develop a pre-filled or simple tax return and makes it clear that it expects the IRS to seek specific authority and appropriations from Congress before embarking on the development of a simple tax return pilot program.", "As reported by the House committee, H.R. 2434 would provide $5.227 billion in appropriations for tax law enforcement in FY2012, or $266 million less than the amount enacted for FY2011 and $740 million less than the budget request. Of that amount, at least $60 million would be used to support IRS's involvement in the Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement program. In its report on the bill, the House committee expresses concern over the agency's recent record of improper payments to taxpayers while administering the first-time home buyer tax credit and the earned income tax credit. As a step in the direction of reducing those erroneous payments, the House committee directs the IRS to submit a report within 180 days of the enactment of the bill on steps it has taken in the past year to reduce improper payments, and the steps it is planning to take in the coming year to prevent improper payments related to all refundable tax credits. Another matter of concern to the House committee is IRS's role in the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA). During FY2010 and FY2011, the agency has received transfers totaling over $90 million from the Department of Health and Human Services to implement certain provisions of the act. The House committee prohibits additional transfers. It also prohibits the IRS from using appropriated funds in FY2012 to verify that taxpayers have health insurance and to impose a penalty on those who lack coverage. These prohibitions are included in the bill as Sections 107 and 108 of the administrative provisions for the IRS.", "The House committee recommends that the IRS receive $3.793 billion for operations support in FY2012, or $282 million less than the amount enacted in FY2011 and $827 million less than the budget request. At least $2 million of that amount is intended for the operating expenses of the IRS Oversight Board. In its report on H.R. 2434 , the House committee expresses concern about the security of IRS's information systems, especially their vulnerability to identity theft by hackers trying to steal tax refunds. To address this concern, it directs the IRS to submit a report within 30 days of the enactment of the bill on the number of taxpayers who have had their tax return rejected because someone else improperly used their Social Security numbers to commit tax fraud. The report should include such details as the average time taken to resolve such cases and provide a refund, when one is due, and the number of cases that were not resolved within 45 days.", "H.R. 2434 would provide $330 million in appropriations for the BSM program in FY2012, or $67 million more than the amount enacted for FY2011 but $4 million less than the budget request. As has been the case since the start of the program, the release of those funds is contingent on approval by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees of expenditure plans that have been reviewed the GAO. In its report on the bill, the House committee notes the progress the IRS has made in recent years in developing a new customer account data engine known as CADE 2 and the likely productivity gains among IRS staff that it will make possible. When fully operational, the system would make it possible to store up to 140 million individual taxpayer account records and update them daily, if necessary.", "Other Issues", "In its report on the bill, the House committee expressed concern about two issues related to the Dodd-Frank Act that do not involve direct appropriations under current law. ", "One issue is funding in FY2012 for the operations of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to collect financial data and analyze financial market activities in support of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was also created by the act. While OFR's start-up costs have been covered by transfers of funds from the Federal Reserve, the office has the authority to cover its operating expenses after it begins to operate on July 21, 2011, through assessments on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and on non-bank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. ", "The House committee holds the view that the OFR should not have unlimited power to charge fees and obligate funds for administrative costs. Thus, language is included in H.R. 2434 that restricts OFR's obligations to $64.5 million in FY2012.", "A second issue concerns funding in FY2012 for the newly operational Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) established by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under Section 1017 of the act, the board receives funds for its start-up and operating costs through transfers from the Federal Reserve. These transfers are capped at 10% of the total operating expenses of the Federal Reserve System in FY2011 (or $404 million), 11% of such expenses in FY2012 (or $445 million), and 12% of such expenses in FY2013 and thereafter (or $485 million). The dollar amounts in FY2013 and thereafter are adjusted for any increases in the employment cost index for total compensation by state and local government workers during the 12 months ending on September 30 of the year before the transfer; the index is computed quarterly by the U.S. Department of Labor. Moreover, funding for the CFPB is not subject to review by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Between early July 2010 and early March 2011, the CFPB requested three fund transfers totaling about $60 million from the Federal Reserve. In its budget request for FY2012, the Treasury Department estimates that the bureau's operating budget will amount to $143 million in FY2011 and $329 million in FY2012, as it works to phase in key functions and construct the necessary technological infrastructure.", "Expressing disappointment that the bureau has not been not more \"forthcoming\" about what it plans to do, how it proposes to accomplish those objectives, and how much it will cost to do so, the House committee recommends that fund transfers from the Federal Reserve and the bureau's authority to obligate funds be limited to $200 million in FY2012. In addition, to gain more control over the bureau's budget and operations in the future, the House committee has added a provision to H.R. 2434 that would subject funding for the CFPB to the annual appropriations process beginning in FY2013. The House committee also directs the bureau to submit an operating plan to the House committee within 60 days of enactment of the bill that discusses how the CFPB plans to allocate resources by \"type of financial institution, financial product and service, and consumer.\"", "A third issue, which is unrelated to the Dodd-Frank Act, deals with funding for Treasury's Office of Financial Stability (OFS), which administers the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 ), which created OFS and TARP, no limits are placed on appropriations for the office's administrative expenses. Since the House committee holds the view that no federal agency should have \"unlimited spending authority for administrative expenses,\" it recommends that OFS's authority to obligate funds be limited to $200 million in FY2012. According to the report on H.R. 2434 , this amount should be sufficient to meet the office's operating costs, as the bill would also terminate a program that OFS has been administering: the Home Affordable Modification Program.

Of the $200 million in funding, $36 million would be used for the Bank on USA program, which promotes improved access to financial services and consumer credit for lower-income households; the Senate committee directs CDFI to submit a detailed spending plan for the program within 120 days of enactment of the bill. Another $22 million would be used to fund the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, which is intended to increase the supply of affordable, wholesome foods in urban and rural communities lacking access to such foods.

In its report on S. 1573 , the Senate committee expresses support for current initiatives by the IRS to combat offshore tax evasion by companies and individuals, and to improve income reporting compliance through increased audits of non-corporate (or passthrough) business and high-income individual tax returns. The report also draws attention to two specific compliance issues that may result in substantial losses of revenue. One concerns a series of recent TIGTA reports examining \"fraudulent and erroneous payments in the First-Time Homebuyer and Residential Energy tax credit programs.\" The Senate committee directs the IRS to increase its scrutiny of questionable claims for these and other credits. A second issue is the misclassification of workers as independent contractors. Such an error usually leads to the underreporting and underpayment of employment and payroll taxes by employers and workers. To get a better understanding of the extent of the problem, the IRS is undertaking a three-year study of worker classification and other employment tax issues. Underscoring its concern about the revenue effects from the misclassification of workers, the Senate committee urges the IRS to maintain adequate staffing in a program (SS-8) designed to assist employers in determining a worker's employment tax status. On the matter of collecting overdue individual tax debt, the Senate committee extends a ban on using appropriated funds to administer a debt collection program involving the use of private debt collectors.

She asked that \"Congress take into account the impact of the legislative process and law enforcement on the jurisdiction and workload of the federal courts, and ensure that the Judiciary continues to have the resources required to perform its statutory duties and to address a growing workload.\" She noted that the workload of the federal courts could further increase if the budgets of the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security are increased.

These policies are estimated to save compensation costs by $300 million through FY2019. According to Judge Gibbons, containing information technology costs, such as the consolidation of computer servers at a single location, is expected to save $65 million in cost avoidance.

However, there are numerous restrictions and licensing requirements for these exports. For instance, exporters are denied access to U.S. private commercial financing or credit, and all transactions must be paid for in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. The Bush Administration tightened sanctions on Cuba in February 2005 by further restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid for their product. OFAC amended the CACR to clarify that the term \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the shipment of the goods. This differed from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods, a practice that had been utilized by many U.S. agricultural exporters to Cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001. U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress strongly objected to this \"clarification\" on the grounds that the action constituted a new sanction that violated the intent of TSRA, and could jeopardize millions of dollars in U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. Then-OFAC Director Robert Werner maintained that the clarification \"conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade.\" ", "Since 2002, the United States has been one of Cuba's largest suppliers of food and agricultural products, although the level of U.S. exports has declined in the past two years. Cuba has purchased over $3.6 billion in products from United States since the enactment of TSRA. U.S exports to Cuba rose from about $7 million in 2001 to $404 million in 2004 and to a high of $712 million in 2008, far higher than in previous years, in part because of the rise in food prices and because of Cuba's increased food needs in the aftermath of several hurricanes and tropical storms that severely damaged the country's agricultural sector. In 2009, however, U.S. exports to Cuba declined to $533 million, 25% lower than the previous year, and in 2010, they fell again to $368 million, a 31% drop from 2009. In the first eight months of 2011, U.S. exports to Cuba amounted to about $266 million, almost a 7% drop from the same period in 2011. Analysts cite Cuba's shortage of hard currency as the main reason for the decline. ", "As noted above, Congress took action in FY2010 and FY2011 appropriations measures to define \"payment of cash in advance\" as used in TSRA as payment before the transfer of title to, and control of, the exported item to the Cuban purchaser. This overturned OFAC's February 2005 clarification that payment had to be received before vessels could leave U.S. ports. Both H.R. 2434 (Section 618) and S. 1573 (Section 620) would have continue this interpretation of the term \"payment of cash in advance\" for agricultural and medical exports to Cuba under TSRA in FY2012.", "S. 1573 would have gone further with a provision (Section 624) that would have prohibited restrictions on direct transfers from a Cuban financial institution to a U.S. financial institution in payment for licensed agricultural and medical exports to Cuba. In the 111 th Congress, such a provision was included in H.R. 4645 , a measure reported by the House Agriculture Committee in September 2010 that also would have made permanent the clarification of the definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" and also would have prohibited restrictions on U.S. travel to Cuba. The House Agriculture Committee held a hearing reviewing U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba in March 2010 in which U.S. agricultural exporters argued that a prohibition on direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions for payments for U.S. exports made sales transactions more complicated and costly for U.S. businesses. These views were echoed during September 15, 2011, debate on the provision at the markup of the bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Supporters of the direct transfers provision also argued that U.S. exports to Cuba have declined, while those opposed maintained that the United States should not open up such direct financial linkages while Cuba is on the State Department's list of states sponsoring international terrorism.

Under the George W. Bush Administration, restrictions on travel and on private remittances to Cuba were tightened. In 2003, the Administration eliminated travel for people-to-people educational exchanges unrelated to academic coursework. In 2004, the Administration further restricted family and educational travel, eliminated the category of fully-hosted travel, and restricted remittances so that they could only be sent to the remitter's immediate family. Initially there was mixed reaction to the Administration's 2004 tightening of Cuba travel and remittance restrictions, but opposition to the policy grew, especially within the Cuban American community regarding the restrictions on family travel and remittances.", "Under the Obama Administration, Congress took action in 2009 to ease some restrictions on travel to Cuba by including two provisions in the FY2009 omnibus appropriations measure ( P.L. 111-8 ), which President Obama signed into law on March 11, 2009. The first provision eased restrictions on family travel, which the Treasury Department implemented by issuing a general license for such travel as it existed prior to the Bush Administration's tightening of family travel restrictions in 2004. The second provision eased travel restrictions related to the marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods to Cuba, and required the Treasury Department to issue a general license for such travel. Subsequently, in April 2009, President Obama announced that his Administration would go further and allow unlimited family travel and family remittances. Regulations implementing these changes were issued in September 2009. The new regulations also included the authorization of general licenses for travel transactions for telecommunications-related sales and for attendance at professional meetings related to commercial telecommunications.", "In January 2011, the Obama Administration announced policy changes further easing restrictions on travel and remittances. The measures (1) increase purposeful travel to Cuba related to religious, educational, and people-to-people exchanges; (2) allow any U.S. person to send remittances to non-family members in Cuba (up to $500 per quarter) and make it easier for religious institutions to send remittances for religious activities; and (3) permit all U.S. international airports to apply to provide services to licensed charter flights. These new measures, with the exception of the expansion of eligible airports, are similar to policies that were undertaken by the Clinton Administration in 1999, but subsequently curtailed by the Bush Administration in 2003-2004. ", "The Obama Administration maintains that the policy changes will increase people-to-people contact, help strengthen Cuban civil society, and make Cuban people less dependent on the Cuban state. The changes are being taken at the same time that the Cuban government is laying off thousands of state workers and increasing private enterprise through an expansion of the authorized categories for self-employment. ", "Policy groups in favor of increased U.S. engagement with Cuba largely praised the Administration's action as a significant step forward in reforming U.S.-Cuban relations and as an important means to expand the flow of information and ideas to Cuba and to increase the income of Cubans working in the expanding private sector. The Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) strongly supported the Administration's policy changes. According to CANF President Francisco \"Pepe\" Hern\u00e1ndez: \"A greater ability to send remittances in conjunction with increased contact and communication with those on the island will help to break the chains of dependency that the Castro regime has used to oppress those inside Cuba.\"", "In contrast, policy groups opposed to easing U.S. sanctions have criticized the Administration, maintaining that the policy changes will help prop up Cuba's repressive government when it is most vulnerable because of the difficult economic situation. Opponents of the policy changes argue that sending dollars via increased travel by Americans and increased remittances will actually help the Cuban government maintain in place its repressive policies. They also argue that easing the restrictions on travel and remittances will not bring about respect for human rights in Cuba.", "As noted above, Section 901 of H.R. 2434 would have rolled back President Obama's easing of restrictions on family travel and remittances, remittances for non-family members, and remittances for religious institutions.

Specifically, the House provision would have repealed any amendments to certain sections of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations relating to family travel ( 31 CFR 515.560(a)(1) and 31 CFR 515.561 ), carrying remittances to Cuba ( 31 CFR 515.560(c)(4)(i) ), and sending remittances to Cuba ( 31 CFR 515.570 ) made since January 2009. According to the provision, such regulations would be restored and carried out as in effect on January 19, 2009, \"notwithstanding any guidelines, opinions, letters, Presidential directives, or agency practices relating to such regulations issued or carried out after such date.\" If the measure were enacted: family travel would again be limited to once every three years for a period of up to 14 days to visit immediate family members only, and would require a specific license from OFAC; licensed travelers would be allowed to carry just $300 in remittances compared to the $3,000 currently allowed; family remittances would be limited to $300 per quarter compared to no limits today; non-family remittances restored by the Obama Administration in 2011, up to $500 per quarter, would not be allowed; and the general license for remittances to religious organizations would be eliminated, although such remittances would still be permitted via specific license on a case-by-case basis.", "The White House's Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2434 , issued July 13, 2011, stated that the Administration opposed Section 901 because it would reverse the President's policy on family travel and remittances, and that the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto if the bill contained the provision. According to the statement, Section 901 \"would undo the President's efforts to increase contact between divided Cuban families, undermine the enhancement of the Cuban people's economic independence and support for private sector activity in Cuba that come from increased remittances from family members, and therefore isolate the Cuban people and make them more dependent on Cuban authorities.\"", "The House Appropriations Committee report to H.R. 2434 ( H.Rept. 112-136 ) requires a report from OFAC on the current number of pending applications seeking specific licenses to conduct people-to-people exchanges, that is, educational exchanges not involving academic study pursuant to a degree program under the auspices of an organization that sponsors and organizes such programs to promote people-to-people contact. The report also requires information on the number of these licenses that OFAC has approved to date, its plan for getting through the current queue of license applications, and its plan for expeditiously reviewing those applications in the future. This reporting requirement was added to the report via an amendment offered by Representative Jeff Flake approved by voice vote during the House committee's June 24, 2011, markup of the bill. In early July 2011, OFAC confirmed that it had approved the first licenses for U.S. people-to-people organizations to bring U.S. visitors to Cuba, and the first such trips began in August 2011.
