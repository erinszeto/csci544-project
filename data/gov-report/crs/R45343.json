Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress substantially increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Congress began reversing those increases in light of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011, the drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan beginning in 2012, and budgetary constraints. Congress halted further reductions in Army and Marine Corps end-strength in FY2017, providing slight end-strength increases that year and more substantial increases in FY2018. End-strength for the Air Force generally declined from 2004-2015, but increased from 2016-2018.

An option to consolidate commissaries and military exchanges has been the subject of numerous studies in the last several years. In 2015, the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) recommended consolidating the commissary and three exchange systems into one entity to be called the Defense Resale Activity (DeRA). Other options discussed include expanding commissary and exchange access to all eligible veterans to increase patronage and sales revenue. However, Congress has stopped short of major changes that would significantly reduce or eliminate the commissary subsidy.

", "Congress has expressed significant interest in DOD and VA efforts to develop an interoperable or joint EHR. Section 1635 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act directed DOD and VA to develop an interoperable EHR, accelerate the exchange of health care information between the two departments by September 30, 2009, and create an interagency program office to facilitate these efforts. As directed by law, the DOD/VA Interagency Program Office was established in 2011 to jointly develop an integrated EHR that would replace each department's legacy systems. As an interim solution, the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) was developed to facilitate health care data sharing between each department's legacy systems. While the JLV provides read-only access, it continues to be the primary platform for DOD and VA clinicians to review a patient's medical history and care delivered in both health systems.", "In 2012, DOD and VA committed to developing a new integrated EHR that would be fully operational by 2017. In 2013, DOD and VA announced that they would no longer pursue the development of an integrated EHR; rather, they would invest in separate systems that could meet interoperability requirements. DOD opted to pursue a commercial alternative, while VA decided to modernize VistA.", "On August 25, 2014, DOD issued a request for proposals for a new EHR to replace its legacy systems.

These incidents prompted Congressional inquiry into possible root causes of such accidents. Experts and investigators have pointed to various issues in the Surface Warfare community, including fleet and unit readiness, the seamanship training and qualification processes, ship-board workloads, and operational/personnel tempo. In response to these concerns, the FY2019 NDAA includes several provisions related to Navy training and personnel management issues.", "Discussion: In 2018, a 3-year internal Navy review of junior surface warfare officer (SWO) competency uncovered gaps in basic seamanship and navigation skills. The enacted bill includes provisions that seek to improve training, as well as qualification standards and processes for Navy watchstanders. Section 334 encourages the Secretary of the Navy to establish a comprehensive proficiency assessment process for SWOs and to more closely align watchstander qualification standards with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW). This section would also require a report to Congress on the training curriculum and assessment process for surface warfare watchstanders by March 1, 2019. Section 527 requires reporting on Navy training and qualification standards. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) report also includes language with respect to surface warfare officer initial training, stating,", "The committee believes SWO candidates lack sufficient at-sea training before reporting to their first ships. The committee is concerned that the lack of practical at-sea experience before reporting to their first ships may result in SWOs having gaps in their foundational safety, seamanship, and navigation knowledge, skills, and experience.", "The SASC report further directs the Secretary of the Navy to conduct a review of the adequacy and appropriate balance of training methods, to include the feasibility of expanding use of yard patrol craft as training vessels, and to report to Congress by October 1, 2018. The Comptroller General is directed to provide a review of the Secretary's report within 120 days of the Navy report. Finally, Section 526 of the enacted bill requires the Navy to maintain a career record of watchstanding hours. It is current practice for military pilots to log flight hours; however, this has not been a common practice for surface warfare watchstanders.", "Section 502 of the House bill sought to increase specialization for SWOs by establishing two career paths: (1) ship engineering systems; and (2) ship operations and combat systems. While some foreign navies use this approach for SWO career management (e.g., the British Royal Navy), there is ongoing debate within the U.S. surface warfare community about whether specialization would improve performance and resolve existing problems. The Administration objected to this section, stating that \"Separating SWOs into two career paths would limit mastery of core skillsets that are fundamental in developing a warfighter to lead, fight, and operate complex U.S. Navy warships.\" The enacted bill does not require the Navy to establish separate career paths, but instead requires GAO to conduct a review of SWO career paths and to brief congressional committees by March 1, 2019.", "Another area of concern is that high shipboard workload and personnel tempo could lead to higher risk of human error due to fatigue.

The Navy continues to use an outdated standard workweek that may overstate the amount of sailor time available for productive work. Although the Navy has updated some of its manpower factors, its instruction does not require reassessing factors to ensure they remain valid or require measuring workload while ships are in port.

Other than heavy alcohol use, the prevalence of substance abuse is lower than in the general U.S. population. Since 2009, the number of new alcohol or substance abuse diagnoses per year has been on a declining trend for active duty servicemembers. However, opioid medications are prescribed at a higher rate for servicemembers than the general U.S. population. This higher prescription rate may be attributable to deployment-related effects such as combat exposure and injuries. However, the incidence rate for dependence or abuse among servicemembers declined by 38% between 2012 and 2016. When adjusted for demographics, the opioid death rate among servicemembers is significantly lower than the U.S. population at 2.7 per 100,000 and 10.4 per 100,000, respectively. DOD attributes these trends to its extensive education, prevention, and treatment programs developed over the past decade.", "Discussion: DOD currently operates a prescription drug monitoring program that identifies at-risk beneficiaries and restricts patients from receiving multiple prescriptions for opioids outside of their primary care manager. However, the data exchange that occurs between various TRICARE contractors and military treatment facilities is not shared with state prescription drug monitoring programs. Section 715 of the enacted bill directs DOD to establish a Military Health System Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. The program would allow for bi-directional sharing of patient-specific information regarding prescriptions for controlled substances with state prescription drug monitoring programs.

A majority of these members pursue a post-service career; veterans account for about 6% of the civilian labor force. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds in support of programs that help servicemembers prepare for transition to civilian life by providing them with counseling, resources, and tools for accessing veteran benefits and leveraging their skills, education, and training gained in the service for post-service education and employment opportunities. Some DOD programs are the Transition Assistance Program (TAP); Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL); and the DOD Skillbridge program, which is also known as the Job Training, Employment Skills Training, Apprenticeships, and Internships (JTEST-AI) program. There are also DOD programs to help servicemembers in pursuit of post-secondary degrees, for example, tuition assistance (TA) for off-duty education and the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES).", "Discussion: Congressional concerns about the transition of servicemembers to civilian employment are evident in the number of provisions seeking to enhance or expand transition services, education support, and other transition-related programs. Section 558 of the enacted bill extends the availability of Military OneSource services to members and their families for a minimum period of one year following separation from the military. A broad range of information resources and training programs are available online in an open source format on Military OneSource; however, previously, some counseling and support services were only available to veterans for a period of 180 days following separation. Other House provisions seeking to improve outreach to recently separated veterans through the addition of email addresses to discharge paperwork (Section 525), allowing for discharge information to be transmitted to country veteran service officers (Section 560B), and follow-up phone calls to check on status (Section 560D) were not adopted. ", "A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released in November 2017 found that fewer than half of all eligible servicemembers completed TAP before the statutory deadline of 90 days prior to separation. In addition, the report found that relatively few members were participating in DOD's optional two-day classes on (1) Accessing Higher Education, (2) Career Technical Training, and (3) Entrepreneurship. The SASC raised concerns in its committee report that, \"requiring transitioning servicemembers to opt into a two-day workshop signals to both servicemembers and their commanders that the workshops may be superfluous, thereby discouraging participation,\" and encourages DOD to mandate member participation in one of the workshops. Section 552 of the enacted bill requires that TAP counseling begin no later than 365 days before transition. This provision requires the development of tailored transition pathways depending on the characteristics or needs of different member groups (e.g., rank, term of service, or gender), and would mandate certain elements of the TAP curriculum. Another requirement in this section is that transitioning members and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs are provided with a copy of their Joint Service Transcript upon separation. Congress also requires GAO and DOD reports on the implementation of this law.", "Section 556 of the enacted bill removes the requirement that credentials earned under the authority in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72015 be \"related to military training.\" This will potentially expand a member's ability to use COOL funds to pursue nonmilitary-related credentials. Section 560A of the House bill would have required DOD to report on TAP participants who met with academic or technical training advisors and would also request specific information on equivalent college credit and technical certifications for members of the armed forces. This provision was not adopted. The American Council on Education (ACE), as funded by DOD, provides a military guide with credit recommendations for formal military courses and occupations. This information may be provided to servicemembers and veterans as part of a Joint Service Transcript (JST) or Verification of Military Experience and Training (VMET).
