These actions were not the result of a single policy decision. Instead, they represented many separate decisions taken by the Obama Administration to address a variety of factors affecting the implementation of specific provisions of the law.", "The Administration announced a series of delays and other changes before and during the first (i.e., 2014) open enrollment period and the problematic launch of the federal\u2014and some state-run\u2014exchanges. The second (i.e., 2015) open enrollment period that closed on February 15, 2015, experienced far fewer administrative and technical problems. Other administrative actions largely focused on the ACA's tax provisions. The 2014 tax filing season (deadline April 15, 2015) was the first one in which individuals were required to indicate on their tax return whether they had health insurance coverage that meets the ACA's standards. Those without coverage risked being penalized unless they could claim an exemption. In addition, everyone who enrolled in coverage for 2014 through an exchange and received advance payments of the premium tax credit had to file a federal tax return in which they reconciled those payments with the actual tax credit to which they were entitled.", "In compiling the table, CRS made decisions about which administrative actions to include, and which ones to leave out.

On November 14, 2013, the Administration notified state insurance commissioners of the option to delay enforcement of certain health insurance reforms under the ACA. It encouraged state officials to permit insurers to renew noncompliant policies in the individual and small-group market for policy years starting between January 1, 2014, and October 1, 2014. The Administration subsequently extended this policy for two years.

Individuals can qualify for a special enrollment period as a result of a variety of events that affect their ability to obtain or maintain health insurance coverage (e.g., moving, losing job-based coverage, gaining legal U.S. residency). Special enrollment periods were also established for individuals unable to begin or complete the process of enrolling in an exchange plan before the end of the open enrollment period because of technical problems or other circumstances. State-run exchanges were encouraged to adopt special enrollment periods similar to the ones established for federally facilitated exchanges.", "In addition, the Administration established numerous hardship exemptions from the ACA's \"individual mandate\" penalty. Under the law, most U.S. citizens and legal residents are required to maintain ACA-compliant health coverage beginning in 2014. Those without coverage for three or more consecutive months are subject to a penalty unless they meet one of the statutory exemptions, or qualify for one of the health coverage-related or hardship exemptions established by CMS. In some instances the hardship exemption is tied to qualifying for a special enrollment period. For example, individuals who qualified for a special enrollment period to finish enrolling in an exchange plan after the 2014 open enrollment period closed on March 31, 2014, were granted a hardship exemption so that they would not be penalized for being uninsured for the first four months of the year (see Table 1 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arguments For and Against the Administrative Actions", "paragraphs": ["Opponents of the ACA, who believe that the law is fundamentally flawed, argued that some of the Obama Administration's actions were effectively rewriting the ACA in an effort to make it work and add to the public's confusion about the law.

Instead, they represented temporary corrections necessary to ensure the effective implementation of a very large and complex law. Agency officials pointed to a number of factors that made it difficult to meet various ACA deadlines. Those factors included a lack of appropriations to help fund implementation activities, technological problems including the poorly managed launch of the websites for the federally facilitated exchanges and some state-run exchanges, and the need to phase in the various interconnected parts of the law so as to avoid unnecessary disruption of employment and insurance markets.", "Regarding the delay of the employer mandate, the Administration said that its actions were no different from those taken by previous administrations faced with the challenges of implementing a complicated law. The Administration noted that its decision to grant employers \"transition relief,\" taken pursuant to administrative authority under the Internal Revenue Code to \"prescribe all needful rules and regulations\" to administer tax laws, was part of an established practice to provide relief to taxpayers who might otherwise struggle to comply with new tax law.", "Notwithstanding the Administration's arguments, critics question whether some of the recent delays of ACA provisions exceed the executive's traditional discretion in enforcing law to the point that they represent a blatant disregard of the law.
