About two-thirds of the budget for natural resources programs (the third-largest slice in Figure 1 ) goes to the Forest Service (about $7 billion), which is funded through the Interior appropriations bill. The Forest Service is the only USDA agency not funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill; it also accounts for about one-third of USDA's personnel, with nearly 34,000 staff years in FY2009.", "Comparing USDA's organization and budget data to the Agriculture appropriations bill in Congress is not always easy. USDA defines its programs using \"mission areas\" that do not always correspond to categories in the Agriculture appropriations bill. Spending may not match up between USDA summaries and the appropriations bill for other reasons. For example, foreign agricultural assistance programs are a separate title in the appropriations bill (Title V in Figure 2 ); foreign assistance programs are joined with domestic farm support in USDA's \"farm and foreign agriculture\" mission area (the second-largest slice in Figure 1 ). Conversely, USDA has separate mission areas for agricultural research and marketing and regulatory programs (two of the smaller slices in Figure 1 ), but both are joined with other domestic farm support programs in Title I of the appropriations bill (the second-largest slice in Figure 2 ).

Eligibility for mandatory programs (sometimes referred to as entitlement programs) is usually written into authorizing laws, and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law. Congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility, benefit formulas, and other parameters, not through appropriations. Approximately 80% of the total Agriculture and Related Agencies spending is classified as mandatory, which by definition occurs independently of annual appropriations.", "The 2008 farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246 ) determines most of the parameters for mandatory spending in the Agriculture appropriations bill. The vast majority of USDA's mandatory spending is for the food and nutrition programs (e.g., food stamps), the farm commodity price and income support programs, the federal crop insurance program, and various agricultural conservation and trade programs (nearly all of Figure 1 's largest two pie pieces). Some mandatory spending, such as the farm commodity program, is highly variable and driven by program participation rates, economic and price conditions, and weather patterns. But in general, mandatory spending has tended to rise over time, particularly as food stamp participation and benefits have risen ( Table 1 ).", "Although these programs have mandatory status, many of these accounts receive funding in the annual Agriculture appropriations act. For example, the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs. Supplemental appropriations generally are made if these estimates fall short of required spending. The Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury, but receives an annual appropriation to reimburse the Treasury and to maintain its line of credit.", "The other 20% of the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill is for discretionary programs. Spending for discretionary programs is controlled by annual appropriations acts. The subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees originate bills each year that provide funding to continue current activities as well as any new discretionary programs.", "Major discretionary programs include certain conservation programs, most rural development programs, research and education programs, agricultural credit programs, the supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC), the Public Law (P.L.) 480 international food aid program, meat and poultry inspection, and food marketing and regulatory programs.

Budget authority is how much money Congress allows a federal agency to commit to spend. It represents a limit on funding and is generally what Congress focuses on in making most budgetary decisions. Most of the amounts mentioned in this report are budget authority. 2. Outlays are how much money actually flows out of an agency's account. Outlays may differ from appropriations (budget authority) because, for example, payments on a contract may not flow out until a later year. For accounts that require multi-year contracts for construction or delivery of services, budget authority may be committed (contracted) in one fiscal year and outlays may be spread across several fiscal years. But for many accounts, especially those tied to salaries and normal operating expenses, outlays closely track budget authority. 3. Program levels reflect the activities supported or undertaken by an agency. An agency's program level may be much higher than its budget authority for several reasons. User fees support some activities (e.g., food or border inspection). The agency makes loans; for example, a large loan authority (program level) is possible with a small budget authority (loan subsidy) because the loan is expected be repaid. The appropriated loan subsidy make allowances for defaults and interest rate assistance. Transfers are available from other agencies or funds are carried forward from a previous fiscal year.

The current tension over who should fund certain agriculture programs\u2014appropriators or authorizers\u2014has roots dating to the 1930s and the creation of the farm commodity programs. Outlays for the farm commodity programs were highly variable, difficult to predict and appropriate, and based on multi-year programs that resembled entitlements. Thus, a mandatory funding system\u2014the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)\u2014was created to remove the unpredictable funding issue from the appropriations committee. This separation worked for many decades. But the dynamic changed particularly in the late 1990s and the 2002 farm bill when authorizers began writing farm bills using mandatory funds for programs that typically were discretionary. Appropriators had not funded some of these programs as much as authorizers had desired, and agriculture authorizing committees wrote legislation with the mandatory funding at their discretion. Thus, tension arose over who should fund these typically discretionary activities: authorizers with mandatory funding sources at their disposal, or appropriators having standard appropriating authority. Does creation of the CCC in the 1930s for the hard-to-predict farm commodity programs justify modern mandatory spending on programs that are not highly variable and typically considered discretionary?", "Appropriator-placed limits on mandatory programs have affected conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and research programs.

This is a smaller reduction in mandatory programs than proposed in the Senate-reported bill, which would have reduced 18 mandatory programs by $641 million.

Since appropriators had garnered a reputation for limiting various mandatory programs in the 2002 farm bill, authorizers in the agriculture committees chose to reduce or eliminate those programs when savings needed to be scored during budget reconciliation in 2005. Thus, as the 2002 farm bill ended by the FY2008 appropriations cycle, relatively little authorization was left among the mandatory programs that the appropriators had limited from FY2003 to FY2006.

The FY2009 request included $14 million for the advisory review of direct-to-consumer (DTC) television advertisements for prescription drugs, a new fee program authorized by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, P.L. 110-85). This amount brought the total request for authorized fees to $609 million, which would have been 11% higher than the total FY2008 appropriation. The budget justification documents included two sets of proposed fees, which would require authorization in law before appropriations could be made. One set of proposed fees ($21 million) would provide revenue for FDA to enhance the review of generic human and animal drugs (the latter of which was subsequently authorized and included in FY2009 appropriations). The Administration categorized these as proposed definite appropriations and included the revenue in its fee total, which it presented as $630 million, 15% more than the total FY2008 appropriation. The second set of proposed fees ($27 million), labeled in the request as \"mandatory fees\u2014non-add\" and not included in the request's user fee total, covered reinspection, and food and animal feed export certification. The Senate committee report did not include either set of proposed fees or the newly authorized fee program for DTC advertisement review. The Senate bill, therefore, included $595 million in total fees.", "Consistent with the Administration and congressional committee formats, each program area budget amount in Table 8 includes funding designated for the responsible FDA center (e.g., Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition) and the portion of effort budgeted for the agency-wide Office of Regulatory Affairs to commit to that program area. Table 8 also apportions user fee revenue across program areas as indicated in the Administration's request (e.g., 89% of the animal drug user fee revenue is designated for the animal drugs and feeds program, with the rest going to Headquarters and Office of the Commissioner, GSA rent, and other rent categories).
