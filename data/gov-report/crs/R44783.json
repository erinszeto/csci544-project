EPACT92 created a new class of power generators called Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs). Companies qualify for EWG status if they are exclusively in the business of owning/operating generating facilities and if they sell electricity solely to wholesale customers. EWGs were not subject to regulation as a utility under PUHCA and, as producers of electricity at scale, they were direct competitors to existing utility generation.

", "As state agencies moved towards deregulation of the electricity industry in the 1990s, the electricity transmission facilities often remained under the control of the public utility. On occasion those utilities would discriminate with respect to access to the transmission facilities, preventing certain market participants from transmitting electric power to certain customers. ", "Specifically, Order No. 888 required the utilities to file tariffs for open access nondiscriminatory transmission services. The order mandated that these tariffs, at a minimum, include certain terms and conditions set forth in a \"pro forma\" tariff published by FERC as part of Order No. 888. The order also required the utilities to \"functionally unbundle\" wholesale power services. ", "Under functional unbundling, the public utility must (1) take transmission services under the same tariff offered to others; (2) establish separate rates for wholesale generation, transmission, and ancillary services; and (3) when buying or selling power, rely on the same electronic information network that its transmission customers rely on to obtain information about the transmission system.", "Order No. 888 amplified the industry's shift to a more competitive and restructured wholesale electricity market already initiated by state PUCs, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and previous FERC regulatory actions. However, the expansion of FERC's regulatory authority was not without controversy. A number of parties questioned FERC's assertion of authority over transmission services provided by utilities. FERC responded in the Order by stating that \"the Commission's jurisdiction extends to all unbundled transmission in interstate commerce by public utilities. It is irrelevant to the Commission's jurisdiction whether the customer receiving the unbundled transmission service in interstate commerce is a wholesale or retail customer.\" ", "Several parties continued to question whether FERC had exceeded its authority under the FPA in adopting Order No. 888, ultimately taking the dispute to the United States Supreme Court. In New York v. FERC , the Court held that the plain language of the FPA supported FERC's assertion of authority over transmission service regardless of the customer. The Court noted that the expansion of the industry had eliminated the bright lines between retail and wholesale sales, and that electric energy destined for retail customers often traveled in interstate commerce. The Court recognized that the FPA explicitly limits FERC jurisdiction over retail sales, but found that Order No. 888 amounted to an exercise of jurisdiction over interstate transmission of any electric energy, be it in service of a wholesale or retail transaction, and therefore the order was a legitimate exercise of FERC's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 201(b) of the FPA (16 U.S.C. \u00a7824(b)).", "In addition to the functional unbundling of electricity services and the mandate that utilities provide open access, nondiscriminatory transmission services, Order. No. 888 also encouraged utilities to push for the formation of Independent Systems Operators (ISOs) not affiliated with generators, utilities, or other interested parties to regulate transmission services over a discrete geographic area. In the order, FERC noted that \"we believe that ISOs have great potential to assist us and the industry to help provide regional efficiencies, to facilitate economically efficient pricing, and, especially in the context of power pools, to remedy undue discrimination and mitigate market power.\" FERC thus included eleven principles to guide the formation and administration of ISOs, addressing \"the ISO's governance, independent structure, reliability and operations, efficiency of management, fostering of economic efficiency in use of and investment in generation, transmission and consumption, provision of electronic information systems, regional coordination and dispute resolution process.\" FERC declined to mandate the creation of ISOs in this order; however, it noted that \"if it becomes apparent that functional unbundling is inadequate or unworkable in assuring nondiscriminatory open access transmission, we will reevaluate our position and decide whether other mechanisms, such as ISOs, should be required.\"", "Just a few years later, FERC would strengthen its push for coordinated independent regional transmission in Order No. 2000. Order No. 2000 strongly encouraged the formation of RTOs, a term sometimes used interchangeably with ISOs, usually describing an organization formed pursuant to the direction provided in Order No. 2000 that regulates transmission services; wholesale market-based electricity transactions; and grid reliability. Although a stated objective of Order No. 2000 was for \"all transmission-owning entities in the Nation, including non-public utility entities, to place their transmission facilities under the control of RTOs in a timely manner,\" the order did not mandate creation of specific RTOs or membership in them. However, FERC did require all owners and operators of interstate transmission facilities who were not members of an ISO to file either an RTO proposal or a description of efforts to participate in an RTO, and noted that \"[i]f the industry fails to form RTOs under this approach, the Commission will reconsider what further regulatory steps are in the public interest.\"", "Order No. 2000 set forth four minimum characteristics of RTOs: (1) independence from market participants and an independent decisionmaking process; (2) scope sufficient to allow the RTO to perform required functions, including ensuring reliability and efficient, nondiscriminatory markets; (3) operational authority for all transmission facilities under its control; and (4) ability to ensure short-term reliability.

", "Capacity markets have occasionally been criticized because brownouts or blackouts have still occurred in unusually high demand periods. In RTOs without formal capacity markets (principally those in California and Texas), some have asked whether the additional cost of a capacity market would be justified by the perceived benefits. RTOs generally seek to ensure that power will be available to meet all the demands of the system and still have operating reserves available to cover outages from plants already committed in day-ahead markets, or unexpected high loads. The real-time or \"spot\" market exists to cover at least some of that unanticipated demand.

The need for new or additional capacity is supposed to be indicated by price signals (i.e., sustained high locational marginal prices) in the location zones. FCMs were developed when it appeared that reliance on price signals alone was not inducing new capacity. ", "FCMs have \"capacity obligation and resource procuring\" elements, including the following:", "an obligation on those responsible for serving end-use customers (load) to have sufficient capacity to reliably serve that load; a methodology to determine a capacity reserve margin and future capacity needs for subregions within the RTO and for the entire RTO; a process for soliciting qualified supply (and demand) resources to meet future capacity needs (for constructing an offer or supply curve); some type of benchmark to judge the cost of new capacity; a methodology or approach for creating a \"demand curve\"; and a process (such as an auction) to select resources and determine a capacity \"price.\"", "FCMs were arguably intended to provide revenues to allow new participants in the markets to recover the cost of investment of building new power plants in the high price load zones (although demand response or building a new transmission line are other options). However, despite the existence of FCMs and similar constructs, there has been considerable debate on whether these constructs work because high electricity price load pockets continue to persist in some RTO regions.", "A related issue raised in connection with FCMs in some RTOs has been the question of how to incorporate new generation. The regulatory concept of \"Cost of New Entry\" (CONE) represents the estimated cost of building and connecting a \"reference\" power plant (i.e., typically a natural gas-fired combustion turbine serving peak loads) to the grid in a particular location. CONE may be estimated by the RTO at various places in the RTO with sustained high prices for electricity, or for the entire RTO footprint. ", "CONE refers to the price at which a peaking power plant can recover its fixed costs in the marketplace. This price is set as a benchmark based on the cost of building a peaking unit. When the market needs new resources to meet reliability, the capacity price would rise above CONE to incent generation. When there are sufficient resources to meet reliability needs the price would fall below CONE to show that no new generation is needed.", "With declining costs for natural gas, new natural gas combined cycle generating units could have cost advantages over existing generating plants due to their higher efficiency and lower fuel costs. CONE pricing alleviates concerns raised by existing generators in some RTO markets that some new entrants are deliberately submitting below-market bids which could undermine the competitiveness of markets under capacity market rules. CONE values can be used to help provide a screen for possible exercise of \"buyer\" market power under RTO \"minimum offer price rules\" (MOPR), by screening bids for prices which appear to be uneconomic. FERC allows RTOs to establish MOPR whether low-priced bids from new projects are consistent with the project's costs or not, and are therefore uncompetitive. ", "Former FERC commissioner and chairman Norman Bay was critical of MOPR (in his concurring opinion in Docket No. EL16-92-000), characterizing it as \"unsound in principle and unworkable in practice\" with respect to the growing conflict between federal and state authority:", "[A]s an institutional matter, imposition of the MOPR places the Commission in constant tension with the states. While there are times when the Commission must check state action that impermissibly interferes with the wholesale markets, it should endeavor to do so only when necessary. I believe that respect for federalism requires no less.... Beyond the recurring cost to FERC's relationship with states, it is important to recognize the economic costs of the MOPR as well. While the MOPR is often characterized as a pro-market policy, correcting the intrusions of the states, this assumes that a market can and should be free from out-of-market influences; there is the judgment that such influences are undesirable and that they can be managed through administrative review and mitigation. In point of fact, out-of-market influences are everywhere. Supply-side resources face a diverse range of costs and benefits that are the result of a myriad of public policies and choices by state and federal agencies. In the vast majority of situations, we should let those costs and benefits simply pass through our markets and have an impact on supply and demand.... Instead, the MOPR not only frustrates state policy initiatives, but also likely requires load to pay twice\u2014once through the cost of enacting the state policy itself and then through the capacity market. If states have chosen to provide out-of-market revenue to some resources, the resulting capacity market price should send a signal consistent with the actual capacity needed in light of such revenue. In contrast, a capacity price that is based on an administratively-determined MOPR may not send an efficient signal for entry and exit. Administrative attempts to remove such revenue could result in inefficiently high capacity prices that signal the need for new capacity when no such need exists."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Litigation over State/Federal Jurisdictional Issues54", "paragraphs": ["In EPACT05, Congress established an interagency task force to study competitive markets, since \"under competitive markets, prices are expected to guide consumption and investment decisions, leading to more economically efficient investments and lower prices than under traditional cost of service monopoly regulation.\" ", "The Supreme Court has recently examined the scope and reach of FERC's jurisdiction under the FPA.

As the Court stated", "a FERC regulation does not run afoul of [the FPA's] proscription just because it affects\u2014even substantially\u2014the quantity or terms of retail sales. It is a fact of economic life that the wholesale and retail markets in electricity, as in every other known product, are not hermetically sealed from each other. To the contrary, transactions that occur on the wholesale market have natural consequences at the retail level. And so too, of necessity, will FERC's regulation of those wholesale matters.

Because Maryland's location on the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) RTO grid created some difficulties in importing electricity from elsewhere on the grid, the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) attempted to address these concerns with a state program that would ensure generation companies would be compensated for the generation capacity they would add to the region via a mechanism known as a \"contract for differences.\" Under this program, the state solicited proposals to construct and operate generation facilities and mandated that LSEs enter into a 20-year contract to obtain power from the new generation facility, helping ensure that the generator has a steady purchaser of its electric power capacity at a set price and creating an environment conducive to construction of new generation. However, rather than set up this arrangement via a \"traditional\" bilateral contract for power between a generator and a purchaser, the Maryland program directed the generator to sell its capacity into the PJM capacity auction, with (1) the generator agreeing to \"pay back\" the LSEs if the auction clearing price was above the agreed-upon contract price; and (2) the LSEs agreeing to pay the generator if the auction clearing price was below the agreed upon contract place.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland agreed and granted the request for a declaratory judgment. The decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.", "In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court affirmed the decisions of the lower courts, seemingly relying on an amalgamation of field preemption and conflict preemption principles. Writing for the majority, Justice Ginsburg wrote that the FPA \"allocates to FERC exclusive jurisdiction over 'rates and charges ... received ... for or in connection with' interstate wholesale sales.\" As a result, for the Court, FERC's approval of the PJM capacity auction as \"the sole rate setting mechanism for sales of capacity to PJM\" was an exercise of this exclusive authority. By requiring the generator to participate in the PJM capacity auction but guaranteeing different rates for the sale of capacity, the Maryland program \"invades FERC's regulatory turf,\" wrote Justice Ginsburg.", "Although the Court struck down this particular program because it was preempted by the FPA, it took care to limit the application of the decision. The decision noted that \"[s]tates, of course, may regulate within the domain Congress assigned to them even when their laws incidentally affect areas within FERC's domain.\" The decision seems to also suggest that if the Maryland program had attempted to encourage new generation in the state by setting guaranteed prices through traditional bilateral contracts rather than by adjusting the prices obtained via the capacity auction mechanism, the program may not have run afoul of the Supremacy Clause.

Ten recent cases (brought by FERC in the 2012 to 2014 period) alleging energy market manipulation concluded in settlements with $448 million in civil penalties, and total \"disgorgements\" (i.e., refunds to rate payers) ordered of $243 million.", "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank, P.L. 111-203 ) was passed largely as a response to the recent U.S. financial crisis. Dodd-Frank initiated a number of reforms intended to strengthen oversight of the U.S. financial sector. Dodd-Frank addresses issues related to market manipulation from fraud, stating that \"specific intent\" or \"recklessness\" would trigger a rules violation. FERC for its part indicates that its focus is on anticompetitive \"conduct that threatens market transparency.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Market Power", "paragraphs": ["On September 22, 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry to explore whether it should revise its current approach to \"identifying and assessing\" market power in electric utility transactions. FERC defines market power as \"[t]he ability of any market participant with a large market share to significantly control or affect price by withholding production from the market, limiting service availability, or reducing purchases.\" ", "FERC's rationale for the notice arose from the different ways market power can be analyzed under its rules. For example, under Section 203 of the FPA, FERC reviews industry mergers and other transactions for consistency with the public interest, while pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, FERC considers requests to sell wholesale electric energy and related attributes at market-based rates. It should be noted that the exercise of market power is differentiated from simply having market power. Electricity consumers are not harmed (i.e., by artificially high electricity rates) unless market power is actually exercised. In a competitive market, prices for electricity should essentially reflect the underlying forces of supply and demand. The recent spate of settlements at FERC leads to a lack of clarity about what does and what does not constitute market manipulation. FERC authorizes sellers of wholesale electricity to charge market-based rates if they have demonstrated that they or their affiliates \"lack or have adequately mitigated horizontal market power (percent of generation owned relative to total generation available in a market), and vertical market power (the ability to influence the cost of production for competitive electricity suppliers).\" Alternatively, FERC may authorize cost-based rates for sellers of electricity in wholesale markets.

Technological development is further enabling customer choice, giving electricity consumers a greater the ability to generate their own electricity, and may potentially lead to a distributed generation future for customers, supported by utility base load generation and infrastructure. Congress began to address the move of the electricity utility industry away from the regulatory compact concept by introducing competitive providers to the electric utility industry with PURPA, and reinforced competition as federal policy with EPACT. Congress may want to consider further amendments to the FPA in this competitive era, to ensure that customer choice can continue to develop as an option as new technologies are developed.", "Net metering is an enabling regime for customer choice, allowing customers who generate their own electricity (usually from a renewable source like solar photovoltaic power) to offset that generated power against power purchased from an electric utility in a billing period. However, the electric utility industry has raised specific concerns about state programs for net metering, especially in areas with growing penetration of residential solar PV installations. ", "Net metering is one of several \"states must consider\" standards added to PURPA by EPACT05. Section 1251 of EPACT05 directed electric utilities to consider making net metering available as a service to customers wishing to generate at least a portion of their own electricity needs. Most net metering retail customers rely on PURPA's mandatory purchase requirement to compel local utilities to purchase their energy, since the FPA does not obligate utilities to purchase energy at wholesale prices. Utilities have expressed concerns that their current investment in power generation infrastructure to serve today's customers may not be fully recovered if growing numbers of these customers opt for distributed generation.", "State net metering programs are intended to encourage customers to employ distributed generation by allowing them to reduce their bills based on any power they may generate locally. The issue is one of cost of net metering programs for electric utilities. Net metering requirements are intended to compensate consumers for specific types of self-generation identified by states, or to promote self-generation. For electric customers who generate their own electricity, net metering allows for the flow of electricity both to and from the customer\u2014typically through a single, bi-directional meter. In some states, during times when a customer's generation exceeds the customer's on-site use, electricity from the customer flows back to the grid, offsetting electricity consumed by the customer at a different time. In other states, the customer is paid for power generated at either the utility's full retail rate or at the utility's avoided cost price. The full retail rate can be higher than the market price of wholesale electricity:", "As noted above, the average residential price of electricity (the average bundled rate) is currently around 12.5 cents per kWh.... According to published data as of November 2013, the market price of energy from grid-connected generators is averaging, in most locations, between 2 and 3 cents per kWh during off-peak periods and between 4 and 5 cents per kWh during on-peak periods. Recent sales of grid-connected renewable energy have been priced near or below 3 cents per kWh.

Under the CPP, states must prepare plans that reduce either total CO 2 emissions or emission rates from existing (mostly coal-fired) power plants. Some observers have posited situations in which implementation of the CPP could result in situations whereby reliability of the grid could be impacted, as some power plants may possibly be closed or have generation curtailed if they cannot satisfy the requirements of the CPP, and new infrastructure may take several years to build. However, the Trump Administration has reportedly indicated its intent to either change or not enforce the CPP.", "Under Section 207 of the FPA, FERC is allowed to act to remedy an instance of insufficient interstate service, upon a complaint by a state utility regulatory commission. Also, under Section 202(c) of the FPA, when an emergency exists by reason of a sudden increase in the demand for electric energy, or of a shortage of electric energy, facilities for the generation or transmission of electric energy, or the fuel or water for generating facilities, or other causes, FERC is authorized to temporarily order connections of facilities, and generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electricity as determined to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest.

Furthermore, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has stated that the final CPP rule could result in a transformative shift in resource use, and lead to the need for transmission and gas infrastructure, requiring \"additional time beyond currently proposed targets [in the CPP].\" ", "States will have to coordinate decisions on CPP compliance with other states, power generators, and electric utilities. FPA Section 207 provisions may require formal hearings and determinations, and these may have to be in concert with state utility commission proceedings since FERC has \"no authority to compel the enlargement of generating facilities for such purposes, nor to compel the public utility to sell or exchange energy when to do so would impair its ability to render adequate service to its customers.\"", "Congress acted to specifically address conflicts between FERC emergency reliability orders and utility compliance with environmental laws in the \"Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act\" (FAST; P.L. 114-94 ).

But in the final CPP, EPA chose not to include generation from units under construction in its \"Best System of Emissions Reduction\" (BSER) because such generation does not actually reduce existing levels of CO 2 emissions from affected power plants.

For example, the PJM RTO has restructured its capacity market to ensure that generators perform and are available when needed. This restructuring benefits nuclear power plants. Generators must meet performance obligations or be faced with penalties. Conversely, pricing incentives have also been instituted to ensure that generating resources deliver power when required. However, such incentives may raise energy costs.

Former Illinois Power Agency Director Mark Pruitt thinks the capacity performance reforms could raise capacity prices to $272/MW-day, 118% higher than today's prices. In an analysis for Crain's Chicago Business, Pruitt estimated the changes \"will funnel more than $560 million in additional revenue [in 2020] to five of Exelon's six Illinois nuclear stations.\" (Note that this sort of capacity market change is what Exelon has been saying it needs to keep its nuclear units economic.) Energy prices paid by ComEd customers would climb 1.4 cents/kWh, or 19%, from today's 7.4 cents/KWh, he thinks.
