As such, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and other nations are developing AI applications for a range of military functions. AI research is underway in the fields of intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, command and control, and in a variety of semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. Already, AI has been incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria. Congressional action has the potential to shape the technology's development further, with budgetary and legislative decisions influencing the growth of military applications as well as the pace of their adoption.", "AI technologies present unique challenges for military integration, particularly because the bulk of AI development is happening in the commercial sector. Although AI is not unique in this regard, the defense acquisition process may need to be adapted for acquiring emerging technologies like AI. In addition, many commercial AI applications must undergo significant modification prior to being functional for the military. A number of cultural issues also challenge AI acquisition, as some commercial AI companies are averse to partnering with DOD due to ethical concerns, and even within the department, there can be resistance to incorporating AI technology into existing weapons systems and processes.", "Potential international rivals in the AI market are creating pressure for the United States to compete for innovative military AI applications. China is a leading competitor in this regard, releasing a plan in 2017 to capture the global lead in AI development by 2030. Currently, China is primarily focused on using AI to make faster and more well-informed decisions, as well as on developing a variety of autonomous military vehicles. Russia is also active in military AI development, with a primary focus on robotics.", "Although AI has the potential to impart a number of advantages in the military context, it may also introduce distinct challenges. AI technology could, for example, facilitate autonomous operations, lead to more informed military decisionmaking, and increase the speed and scale of military action. However, it may also be unpredictable or vulnerable to unique forms of manipulation. As a result of these factors, analysts hold a broad range of opinions on how influential AI will be in future combat operations. While a small number of analysts believe that the technology will have minimal impact, most believe that AI will have at least an evolutionary\u2014if not revolutionary\u2014effect.", "Military AI development presents a number of potential issues for Congress:", "What is the right balance of commercial and government funding for AI development?

On July 20, 2017, the Chinese government released a strategy detailing its plan to take the lead in AI by 2030. Less than two months later Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia's intent to pursue AI technologies, stating, \"[W]hoever becomes the leader in this field will rule the world.\" Similarly, the U.S. National Defense Strategy, released in January 2018, identified artificial intelligence as one of the key technologies that will \"ensure [the United States] will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.\" ", "The U.S. military is already integrating AI systems into combat via a spearhead initiative called Project Maven, which uses AI algorithms to identify insurgent targets in Iraq and Syria. These dynamics raise several questions that Congress addressed in hearings during 2017 and 2018: What types of military AI applications are possible, and what limits, if any, should be imposed? What unique advantages and vulnerabilities come with employing AI for defense? How will AI change warfare, and what influence will it have on the military balance with U.S. competitors? Congress has a number of oversight, budgetary, and legislative tools available that it may use to influence the answers to these questions and shape the future development of AI technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AI Terminology and Background5", "paragraphs": ["Almost all academic studies in artificial intelligence acknowledge that no commonly accepted definition of AI exists, in part because of the diverse approaches to research in the field. Likewise, although Section 238 of the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directs the Secretary of Defense to produce a definition of artificial intelligence by August 13, 2019, no official U.S. government definition of AI currently exists. The FY2019 NDAA does, however, provide a definition of AI for the purposes of Section 238: ", "Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets.", "An artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action.", "An artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks.", "A set of techniques, including machine learning that is designed to approximate a cognitive task.", "An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision-making, and acting.", "This definition encompasses many of the descriptions in Table 1 below, which summarizes various AI definitions in academic literature. ", "The field of AI research began in 1956, but an explosion of interest in AI began around 2010 due to the convergence of three enabling developments: (1) the availability of \"big data\" sources, (2) improvements to machine learning approaches, and (3) increases in computer processing power. This growth has advanced the state of Narrow AI, which refers to algorithms that address specific problem sets like game playing, image recognition, and navigation. All current AI systems fall into the Narrow AI category. The most prevalent approach to Narrow AI is machine learning, which involves statistical algorithms that replicate human cognitive tasks by deriving their own procedures through analysis of large training data sets. During the training process, the computer system creates its own statistical model to accomplish the specified task in situations it has not previously encountered. ", "Experts generally agree that it will be many decades before the field advances to develop General AI, which refers to systems capable of human-level intelligence across a broad range of tasks. Nevertheless, the growing power of Narrow AI algorithms has sparked a wave of commercial interest, with U.S. technology companies investing an estimated $20-$30 billion in 2016. Some studies estimate this amount will grow to as high as $126 billion by 2025. DOD's unclassified expenditures in AI contracts for FY2016 totaled just over $600 million, increasing to over $800 million in FY2017. ", "AI has a number of unique characteristics that may be important to consider as these technologies enter the national security arena. First, AI has the potential to be integrated across a variety of applications, improving the so-called \"Internet of Things\" in which disparate devices are networked together to optimize performance. As Kevin Kelley, the founder of Wired magazine, states, \"[AI] will enliven inert objects, much as electricity did more than a century ago. Everything that we formerly electrified we will now cognitize.\" Second, many AI applications are dual-use, meaning they have both military and civil applications. For example, image recognition algorithms can be trained to recognize cats in YouTube videos as well as terrorist activity in full motion video captured by uninhabited aerial vehicles over Syria or Afghanistan. Third, AI is relatively transparent, meaning that its integration into a product is not immediately recognizable. By and large, AI procurement will not result in countable objects. Rather, the algorithm will be purchased separately and incorporated into an existing system, or it will be part of a tangible system from inception, which may not be considered predominantly AI. An expert in the field points out, \"We will not buy AI. It will be used to solve problems, and there will be an expectation that AI will be infused in most things we do.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["A number of Members of Congress have called for action on military AI. During the opening comments to a January 2018 hearing before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, the subcommittee chair called for a \"national level effort\" to preserve a technological edge in the field of AI. Former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work argued in a November 2017 interview that the federal government needs to address AI issues at the highest levels, further stating that \"this is not something the Pentagon can fix by itself.\" Other analysts have called for a national AI strategy to articulate AI objectives and drive whole-of-government initiatives and cross-cutting investments. ", "In the meantime, DOD has published a classified AI strategy and is carrying out multiple tasks directed by DOD guidance and the FY2019 NDAA, including", "establishing a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), which will \"coordinate the efforts of the Department to develop, mature, and transition artificial intelligence technologies into operational use\"; publishing a strategic roadmap for AI development and fielding, as well as guidance on \"appropriate ethical, legal, and other policies for the Department governing the development and use of artificial intelligence enabled systems and technologies in operational situations\"; establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence; and conducting a comprehensive assessment of militarily relevant AI technologies and providing recommendations for strengthening U.S. competitiveness. ", "These initiatives will present a number of oversight opportunities for Congress. ", "In addition, Congress may consider the adequacy of current DOD funding levels for AI. Lieutenant General John Shanahan, the lead for the Pentagon's most prominent AI program, identified funding as a barrier to future progress, and a 2017 report by the Army Science Board states that funding is insufficient for the service to pursue disruptive technology like AI. Although DOD funding for AI has increased in 2018\u2014to include the JAIC's $1.75 billion six-year budget and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) $2 billion multiyear investment in over 20 AI programs\u2014some experts have argued that additional DOD funding will be required to keep pace with U.S. competitors and avoid an \"innovation deficit\" in military technology. ", "Critics of increased federal funding contend that significant increases to appropriations may not be required, as the military should be leveraging research and development (R&D) conducted in the commercial sector. The 2017 National Security Strategy identifies a need to \"establish strategic partnerships to align private sector R&D resources to priority national security applications\" and to reward government agencies that \"take risks and rapidly field emerging commercial technologies.\" In addition, the Office of Management and Budget directed DOD in preparing its FY2020 budget to \"seek to rapidly field innovative technologies from the private sector, where possible, that are easily adaptable to Federal needs, rather than reinventing solutions in parallel.\" Some experts in the national security community also argue that it would not be a responsible use of taxpayer money to duplicate efforts devoted to AI R&D in the commercial sector when companies take products 90% of the way to a useable military application. Others contend that a number of barriers stand in the way of transitioning AI commercial technology to DOD, and that reforming aspects of the defense acquisition process may be necessary. These issues are discussed in more detail later in this report. ", "One impediment to accurately evaluating funding levels for AI is the lack of a stand-alone AI Program Element (PE) in DOD funding tables. As a result, AI R&D appropriations are spread throughout generally titled PEs and incorporated into funding for larger systems with AI components. For example, in the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act, AI funding is spread throughout the PEs for the High Performance Computing Modernization Program and Dominant Information Sciences and Methods, among others. On the other hand, a dedicated PE for AI may lead to a false precision, as it may be challenging to identify exact investments in enabling technologies like AI. The lack of an official U.S. government definition of AI could further complicate such an assessment. ", "Congress may also consider specific policies for the development and use of military AI applications. Many experts fear that the pace of AI technology development is moving faster than the speed of policy implementation. Former Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Representative Mac Thornberry has echoed this sentiment, stating, \"It seems to me that we're always a lot better at developing technologies than we are the policies on how to use them.\" Congress may assess the need for new policies or modifications to existing laws to account for AI developments and ensure that AI applications are free from bias. Perhaps the most immediate policy concern among AI analysts is the absence of an independent entity to develop and enforce AI safety standards and to oversee government-wide AI research. Former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, for example, has suggested the need for an \"AI czar\" to coordinate such efforts. ", "Relatedly, Congress may consider debating policy options on the development and fielding of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS), which may use AI to select and engage targets. Since 2014, the United States has participated in international discussions of LAWS at the United Nations (U.N.) Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). Approximately 25 state parties have called for a treaty banning \"fully autonomous weapon systems\" due to ethical considerations, while others have called for formal regulations or political declarations. Some analysts are concerned that efforts to ban or regulate LAWS could impose strict controls on AI applications that could be adapted for lethal use, thereby stifling development of other useful military\u2014or even commercial\u2014technology. During recent testimony to the U.N., one expert stated, \"If we agree to foreswear some technology, we could end up giving up some uses of automation that could make war more humane. On the other hand a headlong rush into a future of increasing autonomy with no discussion of where it is taking us, is not in humanity's interest either.\" He suggested the leading question for considering military AI applications ought to be, \"What role do we want humans to play in wartime decision making?\" ", "Congress may consider the growth of international competition in the AI market and the danger of foreign exploitation of U.S. AI technology for military purposes. In particular, the Chinese government is reported to be aggressively pursuing AI investments in the United States. Amid growing scrutiny of transactions involving Chinese firms in the semiconductor industry, in September 2017 President Trump, following the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), blocked a Chinese firm from acquiring Lattice Semiconductor, a U.S. company that manufactures chips that are a critical design element for AI technology. In this way, some experts believe that CFIUS may provide a means of protecting strategically significant technologies like AI. Indeed, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS's ability to review certain foreign investments, including those involving \"emerging and foundational technologies.\" It also authorized CFIUS to consider \"whether a covered transaction involves a country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in areas related to national security.\" Congress may monitor the implementation of FIRRMA and assess whether additional reforms might be necessary to maintain effective congressional oversight of sensitive transactions. ", "In addition, many analysts believe that it may be necessary to reform federal data policies associated with AI. Large data pools serve as the training sets needed for building many AI systems, and government data may be particularly important in developing military AI applications. However, some analysts have observed that much of this data is either classified, access-controlled, or otherwise protected on privacy grounds. These analysts contend that Congress should implement a new data policy that balances data protection and privacy with the need to fuel AI development. ", "Closely related, AI development may increase the imperative for strict security standards. As discussed later in this report, AI algorithms are vulnerable to bias, theft, and manipulation, particularly if the training data set is not adequately curated or protected. During a February 2018 conference with defense industry CEOs, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan advocated for higher cybersecurity standards in the commercial sector, stating, \"[W]e want the bar to be so high that it becomes a condition of doing business.\" Some leading commercial technology companies have issued similar calls for increased scrutiny, with Microsoft's president Brad Smith arguing that a lack of regulation in this area could lead to \"a commercial race to the bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market success.\" ", "Finally, commercial companies have long cited the potential loss of intellectual property rights as a key impediment to partnering with DOD. In recognition of this issue, Section 813 of the FY2016 NDAA established a \"government-industry advisory panel\" to provide recommendations on technical data rights and intellectual property reform. The panel's report, released in November 2018, offers a number of recommendations, including increased training in intellectual property rights for acquisitions professionals and a pilot program for intellectual property valuation in the procurement process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AI Applications for Defense", "paragraphs": ["DOD is considering a number of diverse applications for AI. Currently, AI R&D is being left to the discretion of research organizations in the individual services, as well as to DARPA and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA).

Project Maven's inaugural director stated, \"Maven is designed to be that pilot project, that pathfinder, that spark that kindles the flame for artificial intelligence across the department.\" AI is also being incorporated into a number of other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications, as well as in logistics, cyberspace operations, information operations, command and control, semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles, and lethal autonomous weapon systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance", "paragraphs": ["AI is expected to be particularly useful in intelligence due to the large data sets available for analysis.

In this capacity, AI is intended to automate the work of human analysts who currently spend hours sifting through videos for actionable information, potentially freeing analysts to make more efficient and timely decisions based on the data. ", "The intelligence community also has a number of publicly acknowledged AI research projects in progress. The Central Intelligence Agency alone has around 140 projects in development that leverage AI in some capacity to accomplish tasks such as image recognition and predictive analytics. IARPA is sponsoring several AI research projects intended to produce other analytic tools within the next four to five years.

This approach, currently used by the F-35's Automated Logistics Information System, extracts real-time sensor data embedded in the aircraft's engines and other onboard systems and feeds the data into a predictive algorithm to determine when technicians need to inspect the aircraft or replace parts. ", "Similarly, the Army's Logistics Support Activity (LOGSA) has contracted IBM's Watson (the same AI software that defeated two Jeopardy champions) to develop tailored maintenance schedules for the Stryker fleet based on information pulled from the 17 sensors installed on each vehicle. In September 2017, LOGSA began a second project that will use Watson to analyze shipping flows for repair parts distribution, attempting to determine the most time- and cost-efficient means to deliver supplies. This task is currently done by human analysts, who have saved the Army around $100 million a year by analyzing just 10% of shipping requests; with Watson, the Army will have the ability to analyze 100% of shipping requests, potentially generating even greater cost savings in a shorter period of time.

In the immediate future, AI may be used to fuse data from sensors in all of these domains to create a single source of information, also known as a \"common operating picture,\" for decisionmakers. Currently, information available to decisionmakers comes in diverse formats from multiple platforms, often with redundancies or unresolved discrepancies. An AI-enabled common operating picture would theoretically combine this information into one display, providing a comprehensive picture of friendly and enemy forces, and automatically resolving variances from input data. Although MDC2 is still in a concept development phase, the Air Force is working with Lockheed Martin, Harris, and several AI start-ups to develop such a data fusion capability.

In general, few boundaries exist between Chinese commercial companies, university research laboratories, the military, and the central government. As a result, the Chinese government has a direct means of guiding AI development priorities and accessing technology that was ostensibly developed for civilian purposes. To further strengthen these ties, the Chinese government created a Military-Civil Fusion Development Commission in 2017, which is intended to speed the transfer of AI technology from commercial companies and research institutions to the military. In addition, the Chinese government is leveraging both lower barriers to data collection and lower costs to data labeling to create the large databases on which AI systems train.

For example, some analysts characterize the Chinese government's funding management as inefficient. They point out that the system is often corrupt, with favored research institutions receiving a disproportionate share of government funding, and that the government has a potential to overinvest in projects that produce surpluses that exceed market demand.

Over half of the data scientists in the United States have been working in the field for over 10 years, while roughly the same proportion of data scientists in China have less than 5 years of experience.

", "The democratization of AI technology will further complicate the U.S. military's pursuit of an AI advantage. As the 2018 National Defense Strategy warns, \"The fact that many technological developments will come from the commercial sector means that state competitors and nonstate actors will also have access to them, a fact that risks eroding the conventional overmatch to which our Nation has grown accustomed.\" In these circumstances, AI could still influence warfighting methods, but the technology's overall impact may be limited if adversaries possess comparable capabilities. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revolutionary Impact on Combat", "paragraphs": ["A sizeable contingent of experts believe that AI will have a revolutionary impact on warfare. One analysis asserts that AI will induce a \"seismic shift on the field of battle\" and \"fundamentally transform the way war is waged.\" The 2018 National Defense Strategy counts AI among a group of emerging technologies that will change the character of war, and Frank Hoffman, a professor at the National Defense University, takes this a step further, arguing that AI may \"alter the immutable nature of war.\" ", "Statements like this imply that AI's transformative potential is so great that it will challenge long-standing, foundational warfighting principles. In addition, members of the Chinese military establishment assert that AI \"will lead to a profound military revolution.\" Proponents of this position point to several common factors when making their case. They argue that the world has passed from the Industrial Era of warfare into the Information Era, in which gathering, exploiting, and disseminating information will be the most consequential aspect of combat operations. ", "In light of this transition, AI's potential ability to facilitate information superiority and \"purge combat of uncertainty\" will be a decisive wartime advantage, enabling faster and higher-quality decisions. As one study of information era warfare states, \"[W]inning in the decision space is winning in the battlespace.\" Members of this camp argue that AI and autonomous systems will gradually distance humans from a direct combat role, and some even forecast a time in which humans will make strategic-level decisions while AI systems exclusively plan and act at the tactical level. In addition, analysts contend that AI may contest the current preference for quality over quantity, challenging industrial era militaries built around a limited number of expensive platforms with exquisite capabilities, instead creating a preference for large numbers of adequate, less expensive systems. ", "A range of potential consequences flow from the assumptions surrounding AI's impact on warfighting. Some studies point to overwhelmingly positive results, like \"near instantaneous responses\" to adversary operations, \"perfectly coordinated action,\" and \"domination at a time and place of our choosing\" that will \"consistently overmatch the enemy's capacity to respond.\" However, AI may create an \"environment where weapons are too fast, small, numerous, and complex for humans to digest ... taking us to a place we may not want to go but are probably unable to avoid.\" In other words, AI systems could accelerate the pace of combat to a point in which machine actions surpass the rate of human decisionmaking, potentially resulting in a loss of human control in warfare. ", "There is also a possibility that AI systems could induce a state of strategic instability. The speed of AI systems may put the defender at an inherent disadvantage, creating an incentive to strike first against an adversary with like capability. In addition, placing AI systems capable of inherently unpredictable actions in close proximity to an adversary's systems may result in inadvertent escalation or miscalculation. ", "Although these forecasts project dramatic change, analysts point out that correctly assessing future impacts may be challenging. Historians of technology and warfare emphasize that previous technological revolutions are apparent only in hindsight, and the true utility of a new application like AI may not be apparent until it has been used in combat. ", "Nevertheless, given AI's disruptive potential, for better or for worse, it may be incumbent on military leaders and Congress to evaluate the implications of military AI developments and exercise oversight of emerging AI trends. Congressional actions that affect AI funding, acquisitions, norms and standards, and international competition have the potential to significantly shape the trajectory of AI development and may be critical to ensuring that advanced technologies are in place to support U.S. national security objectives and the continued efficacy of the U.S. military.
