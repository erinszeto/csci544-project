Current President Ricardo Martinelli of the center-right Democratic Change (CD) party was elected in May 2009, defeating the ruling center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) in a landslide. Martinelli was inaugurated to a five-year term on July 1, 2009. Martinelli's Alliance for Change coalition with the Paname\u00f1ista Party (PP) also captured a majority of seats in Panama's National Assembly. Panama's service-based economy has been booming in recent years\u2014with a growth rate of 7.6% in 2010 and 10.6% in 2011\u2014largely because of the ongoing Panama Canal expansion project, now slated for completion in early 2015.", "The CD's coalition with the PP fell apart at the end of August 2011 when President Martinelli sacked PP leader Juan Carlos Varela as foreign minister. Varela, however, retains his position as vice president. Tensions between the CD and the PP had been growing throughout 2011, largely related to which party would head the coalition's ticket for the 2014 presidential election. Despite the breakup of the coalition, the strength of the CD has grown significantly since 2009 because of defections from the PP and the PRD, and it now has a majority on its own in the legislature. President Martinelli's strong approval rating diminished in the aftermath of his break with the PP in 2011, but has recovered recently. President Martinelli has been criticized by civil society groups and political opponents for taking a heavy-handed approach toward governing and for not being more consultative. At times, strong public protests have resulted in President Martinelli backing away from unpopular policy initiatives. While Panama's next presidential election is not scheduled until May 2014, the country will be gearing up for the race in early 2013. Martinelli is not eligible to run since Panama's Constitution only allows for a president to return to power after two terms (10 years).", "U.S. Relations", "The United States has close relations with Panama, stemming in large part from the extensive linkages developed when the Canal was under U.S. control and Panama hosted major U.S. military installations.

U.S. bilateral assistance amounted to $3 million in FY2011 and an estimated $2.8 million for FY2012 while the FY2013 request is for $3.7 million.

A complaint on this and broader problems with Panama's judicial system was heard by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in March 2010, with representatives of the Citizens Alliance for Justice (Alianza Ciudadana Pro Justicia). In April 2011, one of the Supreme Court justices appointed by President Martinelli resigned after accusations emerged that he had conspired to unseat former Attorney General Ana Matilde Gomez, who had been appointed by President Torrijos. President Martinelli subsequently replaced the justice with an official who had worked at the Ministry of Economy and Finance as an acting deputy minister. His appointment elicited criticism because of a constitutional provision prohibiting someone from being a justice if they had worked in a position of authority (command or jurisdictional functions) in the executive branch of the current administration. In January 2012, Martinelli nominated two new Supreme Court justices to replace outgoing justices. While the nominations were approved by the National Assembly, some critics raised concerns that their appointment resulted in President Martinelli's increased influence over the judiciary. In 2011, Panama's Supreme Court revived legislation originally approved in 1999 under the P\u00e9rez Balladares government that expanded the court from 9 to 12 judges and established a \"court of constitutional guarantees\" or fifth chamber within the Supreme Court. President Moscoso's government subsequently repealed the legislation expanding the court and the membership of the court returned to 9 members. But in January 2011, the Supreme Court declared the Moscoso government's action unconstitutional so that the court could return to 12 members. Critics maintained that this would give President Martinelli even further influence over the court by having the ability to appoint 3 new justices or a total of 7 out of 12 justices on the Supreme Court. In June 2012, however, strong public protests led President Martinelli to back down and withdraw his proposal for the fifth chamber.", "The president has backed away from other policy initiatives after strong public opposition. For example: ", "In July 2010, Panama experienced labor unrest in response to controversial legislation that would have ended the obligatory payment of union dues and allowed companies to suspend contracts of striking workers and hire replacement workers during strikes. Two striking workers in the banana sector were killed in clashes with police in Bocas del Toro and hundreds were injured. The strike was suspended after the Martinelli government agreed to suspend some of the controversial aspects of the law. In October 2010, the government agreed to repeal the controversial labor provisions as well as provisions that would have relaxed environmental standards. Protests by Panama's indigenous communities in early 2011 resulted in President Martinelli agreeing to repeal a controversial new mining law that would have facilitated foreign investment in the sector. Indigenous communities such as the Ng\u00f6be-Bugl\u00e9 and others have opposed mining and hydroelectric projects in their territories. Continued indigenous protests in February 2012 over existing mining projects and a large planned hydroelectric project led to the death of two protestors, and resulted in the government making further concessions and engaging in talks with the indigenous communities. Protests reportedly could resume if the indigenous groups do not agree with the outcome of the talks. In late October 2012, the Martinelli government agreed to repeal a recently enacted law that would have sold off state-owned land in the Col\u00f3n Free Zone. Protests against the law resulted in three dead in clashes with the police.

Since taking office, President Martinelli has fulfilled his campaign pledge to provide $100 a month to poor seniors. In May 2011, the World Bank approved a $100 million policy loan for Panama to help it strengthen fiscal management, improve tax collection, and expand key social programs.", "The Martinelli government enacted two tax reform measures in 2010 that reduced corporate and personal income tax rates, and offset the loss of revenue by raising the sales tax from 5% to 7% (not including food) and raising other taxes on banks, casinos, airlines, and the free-trade zone, with a projected net increase in revenue. The government maintains that additional revenue from the reform will be used to augment social expenditures (such as scholarships and cash transfers to the elderly), although critics of the measure maintain that the poor will be hit by an increase in the cost of living. The measures prompted protests against the government, with violent clashes between police and demonstrators. The tax measure, however, also led to an upgrading of Panama's investment-grade credit rating.", "In addition to the ongoing Panama Canal expansion project, the Martinelli government also initiated other infrastructure projects, including most significantly the building of an urban metro system for Panama City.

Sellers operate showrooms targeted at small- and medium-sized buyers, who make wholesale purchases of goods for retail sale in their respective countries. CFZ imports include a broad array of luxury goods, electronic products, clothing, and other consumer products, with Hong Kong the largest supplier and Colombia and Ecuador the largest destinations for CFZ exports.", "The U.S. Department of Commerce maintains that the CFZ offers a significant opportunity for U.S. retail companies to export to Latin America. According to the agency, U.S. companies can save time, grow sales, reduce complexity, and reduce financial risk by using the CFZ to export to the region. The CFZ has its limitations, however, including that it only covers consumer retail products (with no perishables and very little capital equipment); it is not suitable for exporting to larger countries such as Brazil and Mexico, which have their own internal buying structures; and some CFZ merchants should be avoided because of their poor reputation related to involvement in illicit activities. ", "On this last point, the Department of State maintains that the CFZ is vulnerable to abuse by criminal groups through illicit financial activities, largely because of Panama's insufficient enforcement of existing controls. It maintains that a new electronic transaction recording information system for the CFZ will improve the capacity to trace transactions when the system is fully implemented.

(See Figure 1 , \"Map of Panama.\") The treaty gave the United States rights in the so-called Canal Zone (about 10 miles wide and 50 miles long) \"as if it were sovereign\" and \"in perpetuity.\" Construction of the Canal was completed in 1914. In the 1960s, growing resentment in Panama over the extent of U.S. rights in the country led to pressure to negotiate a new treaty arrangement for the operation of the Canal. Draft treaties were completed in 1967 but ultimately rejected by Panama in 1970.", "New negotiations ultimately led to the September 1977 signing of the two Panama Canal Treaties by President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian head of government General Omar Torrijos. Under the Panama Canal Treaty, the United States was given primary responsibility for operating and defending the Canal until December 31, 1999. (Subsequent U.S. implementing legislation established the Panama Canal Commission to operate the Canal until the end of 1999.) Under the Treaty on the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, or simply the Neutrality Treaty, the two countries agreed to maintain a regime of neutrality, whereby the Canal would be open to ships of all nations. The U.S. Senate gave its advice and consent to the Neutrality Treaty on March 16, 1978, and to the Panama Canal Treaty on April 18, 1978, both by a vote of 68-32, with various amendments, conditions, understandings, and reservations. Panama and the United States exchanged instruments of ratification for the two treaties on June 16, 1978, and the two treaties entered into force on October 1, 1979.", "Some treaty critics have argued that Panama did not accept the amendments, conditions, reservations, and understandings of the U.S. Senate, including the DeConcini condition to the Neutrality Treaty. That condition states: \"if the Canal is closed, or its operations are interfered with, the United States of America and the Republic of Panama shall each independently have the right to take such steps as each deems necessary, in accordance with its constitutional processes, including the use of military force in the Republic of Panama, to reopen the Canal or restore the operations of the Canal, as the case may be.\" However, others argued that Panama, in fact, had accepted all U.S. Senate amendments. The State Department asserted that Panama expressly accepted all amendments, conditions, and understandings to the two treaties, including the DeConcini condition. The United States and Panama signed the instruments of ratification for both treaties, which incorporated all the Senate provisions. The two countries cooperated throughout the years on matters related to the Canal and established five binational bodies to handle these issues. Two of the bodies were set up to address defense affairs and conducted at least 16 joint military exercises between 1979 and 1985 involving Panamanian and U.S. forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Canal Transition and Current Status", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, U.S. officials consistently affirmed a commitment to follow through with the Panama Canal Treaty and turn the Canal over to Panama at the end of 1999. That transition occurred smoothly on December 31, 1999. The Panama Canal Treaty terminated on that date, and the Panama Canal Commission (PCC), the U.S. agency operating the Canal, was succeeded by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP), a Panamanian government agency established in 1997.", "Under the terms of the Neutrality Treaty, which has no termination date, Panama has had responsibility for operating and defending the Canal since the end of 1999. As noted above, both Panama and the United States, however, in exercising their responsibilities to maintain the regime of neutrality (keeping the Canal secure and open to all nations on equal terms) independently have the right to use military force to reopen the Canal or restore its operations. This is delineated in the first condition of the Neutrality Treaty.", "The secure operation of the Panama Canal remains a U.S. interest since the Canal is important for U.S. ocean-borne trade. The Canal's largest trade route in FY2010 for ocean-borne cargo was between the east coast of the United States and Asia, which comprised almost 41% of total Panama Canal long tons cargo traffic. The Canal's second-largest trade route in FY2010 was between the east coast of the United States and the west coast of South America, which comprised almost 12% of total Panama Canal long tons cargo traffic. The United States provides assistance to Panama to improve its ability to provide security for the Canal and to enhance port and maritime security. U.S. officials have consistently expressed satisfaction that Panama is running the Canal efficiently, and since 2003, the U.S. military has conducted exercises with Panama and other countries to protect the Canal in case of attack.", "Since the ACP has run the Canal beginning in 2000, it has been lauded for increasing Canal safety and efficiency. In September 2012, Jorge Luis Quijano was appointed by the ACP's Board of Directors to become the new Canal administrator for a seven-year term, succeeding Alberto Alem\u00e1n Zubieta who had served as administrator since 1996. Quijano, an engineer, has worked at the Canal since 1975, and led the Canal expansion project beginning in 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Canal Expansion Project", "paragraphs": ["In April 2006, the Panama Canal Authority presented to then-President Torrijos its recommendation to build a third channel and new set of locks (one on the Atlantic and one on the Pacific) that would double the capacity of the Canal and allow it to accommodate giant container cargo ships known as post-Panamax ships. The project would also widen and deepen existing channels and elevate Gatun Lake's maximum operating level. The estimated cost of the seven-year project is $5.25 billion, to be self-financed by the ACP through graduated toll increases and external bridge financing of about $2.3 billion that would be paid off in about 10 years. According to the ACP, the overall objectives of the expansion project are to (1) achieve long-term sustainability and growth for the Canal's financial contributions to the Panamanian national treasury; (2) maintain the Canal's competitiveness; (3) increase the Canal's capacity to capture the growing world tonnage demand; and (4) make the Canal more productive, safe, and efficient.", "President Torrijos and his Cabinet approved the expansion project in June 2006, and the Legislative Assembly overwhelmingly approved it in July 2006, with 72 out of 78 deputies voting for the project. Pursuant to Panama's Constitution (Article 319), the project had to be submitted to a national referendum. The Torrijos government chose to hold the referendum on October 22, 2006, close to the anniversary of October 23, 1977, the date when Panamanians approved the two Panama Canal treaties in a national plebiscite by a two-to-one margin. The expansion project was approved by 78% of the vote, although there was some vocal opposition.", "The Panamanian government officially launched the expansion project on September 3, 2007, with a ceremony that included former President Jimmy Carter, whose Administration negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties. In March 2009, three multinational consortiums placed bids for the multi-billion dollar contract to build the new set of locks. The ACP announced in July 2009 that the consortium Grupo Unidos por el Canal (United for the Canal) led by Spanish construction company Sacyr Vallehermoso was the winner of the contract after posting a bid of $3.12 billion. The consortium also includes Italian, Belgian, and Panamanian companies, as well as two U.S. companies\u2014Montgomery Watson Harza and Tetra Tech\u2014involved as design subcontractors. In January 2010, the ACP awarded the fourth and final dry excavation contract to a consortium made up of Spanish, Mexican, and Costa Rican companies. The excavation work will create an access channel linking the new Pacific locks with the Gaillard Cut, which is the narrowest stretch of the Canal. While the project originally was expected to be completed by 2014, some delays reportedly have pushed the completion to April 2015.", "The Canal expansion is expected to reduce shipping rates between Asia and the U.S. Gulf and East coasts, resulting in significant savings, and will likely increase Latin American trade with Asia as well as intra-Latin American trade. Many U.S. ports are already readying themselves in order to take advantage of the trade expansion. Some analysts maintain that the Canal expansion, which reportedly will allow 90% of the world's liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers to pass through the Canal, will be a boon for the U.S. natural gas industry. Others anticipate that the expansion will make U.S. Midwest grain exports more competitive in Asia."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Background on the 1989 U.S. Military Intervention", "paragraphs": ["The December 20, 1989, U.S. military intervention in Panama, known as Operation Just Cause, was the culmination of almost two and a half years of strong U.S. pressure, including economic sanctions, against the de facto political rule of General Noriega, Panama's military commander. Political unrest had erupted in mid-1987 when a high-ranking Panamanian military official alleged that Noriega was involved in murder, electoral fraud, and corruption, which prompted the formation of an opposition coalition that challenged his rule. The regime nullified the results of May 1989 national elections, which international observers maintain were won by the opposition by a 3-1 margin. It also harassed U.S. citizens in Panama, including the killing of a U.S. Marine lieutenant. President George H. W. Bush ultimately ordered U.S. forces into combat to safeguard the lives of Americans in Panama, to defend democracy, to combat drug trafficking, and to protect the operation of the Panama Canal.", "In early January 1990, with the restoration of democracy and Noriega's arrest to face trial in the United States on drug charges, President Bush announced that the objectives of the U.S. intervention had been achieved. In terms of casualties, 23 U.S. soldiers and 3 U.S. civilians were killed, while on the Panamanian side, some 200 civilians and 300 Panamanian military were killed. While Congress was not in session during the intervention, in general, Members were strongly supportive of the action. In February 1990, the House overwhelmingly approved a resolution, H.Con.Res. 262 , stating the President acted appropriately to intervene in Panama after substantial efforts to resolve the crisis by political, economic, and diplomatic means."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Status of Manuel Noriega", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of the 1989 U.S. military intervention, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was arrested in January 1990 and brought to the United States to stand trial on drug charges. After a seven-month trial, Noriega was convicted on 8 out of 10 drug trafficking charges in U.S. federal court in Miami in 1992, and sentenced to 40 years in prison. That sentence was subsequently reduced to 30 years, and then to 20 years. With time off for \"good behavior,\" Noriega was scheduled to be released from jail on September 9, 2007, but remained in U.S. custody pending appeals of his extradition to France. After exhausting his appeals, Noriega was extradited to France in April 2010. In France, Noriega faced a 10-year prison sentence for his conviction in absentia in 1999 on money laundering charges. He was eligible for a new trial upon his extradition to France, and in July 2010 was again convicted of drug money laundering and sentenced to seven years in prison.", "On January 12, 2011, Panama requested Noriega's extradition from France for the 1989 killing of Major Mois\u00e9s Giroldi, the leader of a failed coup in 1989. According to Panama's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Panama previously had requested Noriega's extradition from France for the 1985 killing of vocal critic Hugo Spadafora. Panamanian courts had sentenced Noriega to at least 60 years in prison for those offenses, although the law only allows him to serve a maximum sentence of 20 years, and according to some reports, his imprisonment in the United States and France could be subtracted from his sentence in Panama. ", "In November 2011, a French appeals court agreed to extradite Noriega, and he ultimately returned to his native country on December 11, 2011, and was imprisoned. In addition to his previous convictions in Panama, Noriega could face additional charges against him in Panama, including the 1970 disappearance and murder of labor activist Heliodoro Portugal. Noriega's return has not had any significant political fallout in Panama. ", "Since his return, the former military ruler has been hospitalized several times, most recently in November 2012. He has suffered two strokes and reportedly has heart disease, prostate cancer, and a benign brain tumor.
