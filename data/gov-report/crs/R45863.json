A blockchain is a digital ledger that enables parties to agree on the current ownership and distribution of assets in order to conduct new business. When applied to cryptocurrencies, the blockchain allows the validation of transactions to occur by a decentralized network of computers. As cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization) have increased in popularity, the energy demand to support cryptocurrency mining activities has also increased. The state of Washington, by some estimates, hosted 15%-30% of all Bitcoin mining operations globally in 2018.

Blockchain networks allow for individuals engaging in transactions to also be the ones to validate them. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, Alpha Coin, and Papyrus provide a means of validating transactions in a decentralized network that is outside of an intermediary, such as a bank for financial transactions or a title company for a real estate transaction. This validation can be done in bulk and at relatively high speeds, making cryptocurrency an attractive avenue for certain financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies are built to allow the exchange of some digital asset of value (the cryptocurrency) for a good or service. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, garnering the largest market share, and Bitcoin arguably initiated the interest in blockchain technology. ", "Blockchain uses a combination of technologies to work. These technologies include encryption and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Transactions are added to a blockchain in an addition-only manner. Once added, a transaction cannot be altered, providing a layer of security and transparency. Transactions are grouped together to form a tranche , or \"block.\" Blocks are added to a blockchain in a manner that links it to the previous block, so any change data in a previous block makes that change known to users immediately as they try to add a new block. Encryption is used to ensure that parties trading assets on a blockchain have rights to that asset, and that data held in the blockchain is tamper resistant. P2P networks are used to distribute information across participating users without a central authority acting as an arbiter of that information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cryptocurrency Mining", "paragraphs": ["There are three primary approaches to gaining ownership of Bitcoin: purchase Bitcoin directly by exchanging conventional money and a paying an exchange fee; earn Bitcoin in return for a product or service; or create Bitcoin through mining . Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies each implement their own blockchain: mining is the creation and publication of a new block in a blockchain. Early cryptocurrency platforms, like Bitcoin, required the use of mining to validate transactions. In blockchain platforms generally, miners\u00e2\u0080\u0094those seeking to add a block to a blockchain\u00e2\u0080\u0094are incentivized to improve their value in that blockchain through either a monetary, reputational, or stake award, for example. New blocks may be added to a blockchain through a variety of methods. ", "For Bitcoin, new blocks are added to the blockchain through proof-of-work (PoW). Under PoW, miners are presented a difficult computational problem, or puzzle. PoW identifies a numeric value (called a nonce), which is used to generate an authenticator (hash value). Hash values are used to ensure the integrity of data, in this case, that a block of data in the blockchain has not been modified. Hashes are determined by submitting the data through an algorithm that will output a string of characters. By inserting the nonce into the algorithm, miners seek to change the hash value. The problem Bitcoin miners are trying to solve is the creation of a hash value for a given block which begins with a certain number of zeros. They add data to the block through changing the nonce in order to change the hash value and discover the solution. Identifying these valid nonces and hashes is computationally intensive, and the essence of mining. The security properties of hash algorithms are such that a miner tests nonces until a valid hash is found for a block. ", "Generally, by solving the problem or puzzle, miners win the opportunity to post the next block and possibly gain a reward for doing so. In the case of Bitcoin, miners who create and publish new blocks in the blockchain are rewarded with Bitcoin. Once the problem is solved and a valid hash is identified, the miner announces it to the community using P2P networking. Other users can validate the solution immediately\u00e2\u0080\u0094without going through the resource-intensive computation process. Once the majority of the community of users validates and confirms the block, it is added to the chain.", "Miners are held to a strict set of rules that maintain the overall market structure. There are a limited number of Bitcoin to be mined, which creates a value attributed to scarcity. For Bitcoin, new blocks are published every 10 minutes. As the rewards for published blocks halve every 210,000 blocks, the reward of new Bitcoin diminishes roughly every four years (e.g., the reward of 50 Bitcoins per block in 2008 was reduced to 25 in 2012). On October 31, 2018, block 548173 rewarded the miner with 12.5 Bitcoins plus approximately 0.2 Bitcoins in transaction fees. On the date that block was generated, trading for 1 Bitcoin closed at approximately $6,343; as of July 29, 2019, trading for 1 Bitcoin closed at approximately $9,507.", "Bitcoin is rewarded on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning whoever solves and publishes the solution first is rewarded with Bitcoin. Miners throughout the network compete against each other in a race to be the first to resolve the PoW and earn the reward. The competition often is a criticism of the PoW system, as there are many more miners expending energy for these \"useless\" calculations than the one miner that wins the race and correctly resolves the PoW."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mining Technology", "paragraphs": ["The technology used by miners has advanced over time. Early miners were able to earn Bitcoin relatively easily with affordable equipment. Bitcoin could initially be mined on a central processing unit (CPU) such as a personal laptop or desktop computer. As interest in Bitcoin mining increased, miners discovered that graphic cards could more efficiently run hashing algorithms and aid in mining. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) then replaced graphic cards, as the circuits in an FPGA could be configured and programmed by users after manufacturing. Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) have replaced these and graphic cards. ASICs are designed for a particular use\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as Bitcoin mining. ", "As more sophisticated equipment has been adopted, miners have also moved away from working individually to working in larger groups. Many miners have determined it is more cost efficient to join \"mining pools\" that help disperse the energy and equipment costs (and the profits) and increase the speed or likelihood of a successful transaction. ASICs used for Bitcoin mining are usually housed in thermally-regulated data centers with access to low-cost electricity. While these developments have transformed Bitcoin mining into a more consolidated industry, they have not resolved the energy consumption issue or the computational \"waste,\" as different Bitcoin mining pools still must compete against one another using the PoW method."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "How Much Energy Is Consumed from Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrency Mining?", "paragraphs": ["Cryptocurrency mining requires energy to (1) operate the devices computing the calculations required to maintain the integrity of the blockchain and (2) thermally regulate the devices for optimal operation.

Devices with greater hashrates can perform more calculations in the same amount of time than devices with lesser hashrates. For example, \"a hashrate of 14 terahashes [14 trillion attempted mining solutions] per second can either come from a single Antminer S9 running on just 1,372 W [Watts], or more than half a million Sony Playstation-3 devices running on 40 MW [megawatts\u00e2\u0080\u0094million Watts].\" ", "There are four main factors that contribute to energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining:", "1. hardware computing power; 2. network hashrate; 3. the difficulty; and 4. the thermal regulation for the hardware.", "These factors, some of which also interact with the price of Bitcoin, can alter the energy intensity of mining. For instance, in December 2017, the price of Bitcoin rose creating an influx of mining. As the mining network grew, the difficulty and hashrate increased. Miners sought out more powerful equipment as the competition increased, which consumed more energy. ", "Several studies have examined the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. While technology advancements in devices used for Bitcoin mining have led to increases in the hashrates of mining devices (i.e., improved device efficiency), the network hashrate has also increased as the popularity of Bitcoin increased. According to one recent estimate, as of \"mid-March 2018, about 26 quintillion hashing operations are performed every second and non-stop by the Bitcoin network.\" Estimating the power consumption of the global Bitcoin network depends upon the efficiency of different hardware, the number of machines in use, and the cooling requirements for large-scale mining facilities. Table 1 presents various estimates for the power required by the Bitcoin network. Generally, these estimates use hashrates and miner hashing efficiencies to determine energy consumption. One study relied upon hardware data derived from initial public offering (IPO) filings to estimate power consumption. Fewer studies have examined power requirements for other cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency platform in both currency in circulation and transactions processed), although those studies have found comparatively lower power requirements than for Bitcoin. ", "Global power requirement estimates for Bitcoin have increased within the last five years. For comparison, the largest estimate of 7,670 MW in Table 1 is nearly 1% of U.S. electricity generating capacity (or approximately 0.1% of global electricity generating capacity). Opinions differ on whether future growth in Bitcoin will significantly impact energy consumption and subsequent carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Some argue that sustainability concerns due to energy consumption are misplaced, and that the competitiveness of Bitcoin mining means that only miners with the most competitive mining hardware and the lowest electricity costs will persist over time. Further, this could lead to fewer miners using energy inefficient hardware, as they may no longer be able to compete effectively. Some anticipate that energy demands will diminish as the reward incentive shifts from discovering new Bitcoin to earning revenue through transaction fees. As a result, some would argue that the energy consumption from mining Bitcoin is a temporary issue. Others recognize the volatility of cryptocurrency markets but observe that network hashrates of several cryptocurrencies have trended upward suggesting that energy consumption (and subsequent CO 2 emissions) will increase. However, these estimates do not include energy required for cooling systems and other operations and maintenance activities associated with cryptocurrency mining. ", "One study on projections of Bitcoin growth considered the potential effects on global CO 2 emissions should Bitcoin eventually replace other cashless transactions. The study found that the associated energy consumption of Bitcoin usage could potentially produce enough CO 2 emissions to lead to a 2 o C increase in global mean average within 30 years. These projections assume that the global portfolio of fuel types (and subsequent CO 2 emissions) used to generate electricity remains fixed according to portfolio profiles from 2014 and does not consider that, in many cases, Bitcoin is often mined in areas with plentiful and affordable renewable energy. Further, the projections do not consider any potential effects of a collapse of Bitcoin prices on hashrates or energy consumption, and whether the capital invested in Bitcoin mining could be used for other cryptocurrencies or for other purposes. Projections of continued growth in energy consumption led some to call for reform in the cryptocurrency industry. Others argue that continued reliance on fossil-fuel-based electricity is the important issue and not the energy intensity of Bitcoin.

However, other protocols, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA) could potentially accomplish validations more energy efficiently. Many other alternative algorithms exist. Each algorithm presents trade-offs; for example, some algorithmic attributes facilitate scalability and others facilitate speed of transactions.

China's share of major mining pools may change substantially in response to regulations and policy actions. In 2013, the Chinese government reportedly restricted Chinese banks from using cryptocurrencies as currency, citing concerns about money laundering and a threat to financial stability. In September 2017, Beijing declared that initial coin offerings (ICO) were illegal and that all mainland cryptocurrency exchanges be shut down. In January 2018, China's Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation submitted a request to local governments to regulate electricity, taxes, and land use for mining companies, and \"guide the orderly exit of such companies from the Bitcoin mining business.\" Since the implementation of these regulatory measures, Bitcoin trading with the Chinese yuan has reportedly dropped from 90% of global Bitcoin trading to under 1%. However, as illustrated in Figure 1 , China, despite changes in regulation, remained a popular location for mining in 2018, partly due to the comparatively low cost of energy. The generation sources that provide low cost electricity to cryptocurrency miners in China vary regionally. In some regions, the electricity likely is provided from fossil fuel sources; for example, in Inner Mongolia where cryptocurrency miners have been active, thermal power represents 63% of the electric capacity.

Hashes are determined by submitting the data through an algorithm that will output a string of characters. By inserting the nonce into the algorithm, miners seek to change the hash value. Identifying these valid nonces and hashes is computationally intensive, and the essence of mining. The security properties of hash algorithms are such that a miner tests nonces until a valid hash is found for a block.

All of the currency is already created, and the amount is stagnant. Forgers earn currency through transaction fees for building a new block (and thereby validating a transaction). A new block is determined by the level of stake (e.g., wealth) a forger has invested in the cryptocurrency. Thus, forgers put their own cryptocurrency investment at risk and therefore would likely only build a block for valid transactions.
