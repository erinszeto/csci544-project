Non-degree programs are postsecondary training and education programs that are most often shorter in duration than a bachelor's or associate's degree program. They generally provide work-based learning or educational instruction to individuals who are beyond the typical age for secondary education to prepare them for a particular occupation. Examples of support have included proposals to expand existing federal programs, create new programs, and improve coordination between existing programs. This report provides an overview of existing federal programs and benefits that support individuals pursuing training and education in non-degree programs.", "A prominent argument for supporting individuals pursuing training and education in non-degree programs is that there is a substantial employer need for individuals with some postsecondary credentials but no degree. In 2018, approximately 72% of jobs in the national economy were in occupations for which the typical entry-level education is less than an associate's degree. Just over 6% explicitly required a non-degree credential, but these credentials could prepare individuals for many jobs that do not require a bachelor's or higher level degree. Mean annual wages for individuals whose highest educational attainment is high school completion are similar to those for individuals with a non-degree credential. Earnings for individuals with only non-degree credentials vary based on differences in occupational field, program duration, and type of educational institution attended.", "Several federal programs provide direct financial support to or on behalf of students to enable them to pursue training and postsecondary education in non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs. None of these federal programs or benefits that provide such support focus exclusively on promoting non-degree program pursuits. The federal programs include the following:", "Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA; P.L. 113-128 ) is the primary federal workforce development statute. The program relies on state and local workforce development boards to enter into contracts with training and education program providers and oversee the quality of the providers. Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA; P.L. 89-329), as amended, authorizes grant and loan programs that provide financial assistance to higher education students. Non-degree program quality assessment is handled by state authorizers, accrediting agencies, and in some instances through Department of Education certification. Education tax benefits, administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), partially offset some of the costs of higher education for eligible taxpayers. Many education tax benefits are only available to individuals enrolled in a degree program, but three education tax benefits can also be claimed for postsecondary non-degree programs: the Lifetime Learning Credit, the Exclusion for Employer Provided Educational Assistance, and tax-advantaged 529 plan education savings accounts. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) were originally intended to help veterans enter the civilian workforce. Post-9/11 GI Bill program quality is primarily overseen by state agencies under contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. VET TEC program quality is assured by withholding 50% of tuition and fees from providers until participants are employed. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment & Training (E&T) provides eligible low-income households with employment and education services. E&T funding is administered by state agencies through contracted providers, which receive funds to cover education and other program costs. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant is best known for providing monthly cash assistance to needy families with children but may be used to support subsidized employment, on-the-job training, and training and education programs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, policymakers, industry stakeholders, and educational institutions have shown an interest in the federal government increasing financial support to individuals who pursue training and postsecondary education in non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs. These are instructional or work-based programs designed primarily for individuals beyond high school age and for which a degree is not conferred upon completion. Such programs include, but are not limited to, apprenticeships (e.g., masonry), college certificate programs (e.g., medical billing), and courses that lead to professional certificates or licensure (e.g., Microsoft certifications). By some accounts, there already is, and will continue to be, demand for workers to fill jobs that do not require a college degree but do require training or postsecondary education (e.g., skilled electrical work, health care support services). In addition, there is some evidence that the percentage of jobs requiring more than a high school diploma but not a degree is increasing. Although the federal government annually makes available over $100 billion in direct financial aid to individuals pursuing postsecondary education, the overwhelming majority of those funds are not available to a significant proportion of the individuals pursuing training and education through postsecondary non-degree programs. As some traditional colleges experience declining enrollment, some schools have shown an interest in creative approaches to increasing enrollment and maintaining revenues, including reaching out to adults who want to pursue completion of short programs that allow quick reentry into the workforce and/or increase earnings. Given the purported demand for workers with certain postsecondary non-degree credentials, Congress may consider viable options for providing direct federal support to students pursuing the completion of non-degree programs.", "Several proposals have surfaced recently that would increase direct federal support to students pursuing training and education in non-degree (short-term) programs. From 2011 to 2017, the Department of Education (ED) experimented with allowing Pell Grants to be received for short-term non-degree postsecondary education programs. In October 2019, the House Committee on Education and Labor ordered reported the College Affordability Act ( H.R. 4674 ), which would comprehensively reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA) and would expand the types of non-degree programs eligible for Pell Grants. In 2018, the President's Council of Economic Advisers presented options for bringing 25- to 64-year-olds back into the workforce with the skills required in the changing economy in an effort to increase the rate of economic growth. These included providing unemployment insurance benefits for individuals while training, providing Pell Grants for some short-term training programs, and developing a new comprehensive program for retraining displaced workers. The President's FY2021 budget request for ED proposed expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs that are not currently Pell-eligible. Several education and business organizations have supported extending Pell Grants, and occasionally Direct Loans, to programs that are shorter in duration than those that are currently eligible. ", "Some stakeholders, however, express concerns about promoting non-degree programs and increasing financial support for students pursuing them. There is concern that some non-degree programs do not increase the employment or earnings of completers compared to individuals whose highest level of education is high school completion. Some concerns focus on how the federal government would ensure the quality of the programs. Other concerns focus on potentially high federal costs associated with supporting the programs, the potential need for student supports and business coordination, and the possibility of perpetuating income inequalities by fostering lower income students to pursue non-degree programs that lead to lower income professions. Some have raised questions about the demonstrated diminishing labor market returns over time for some technical non-degree programs, including apprenticeships. Additionally, some non-degree educational programs intended to prepare individuals for a specific occupation are neither required by nor necessarily preferred by employers, although the programs may be of a high quality. ", "In light of evidence of employers increasingly relying on degrees when establishing hiring requirements, non-degree credential holders may have more difficulties in securing employment over the long term. In addition, adults with degrees currently employed in positions that do not require a degree may be crowding non-degree holders out of some occupations. In 2018, for instance, 28% of employment was in occupations that typically require a degree for entry-level positions, while 42% of the population aged 18 and over had a degree. ", "This report provides an overview of existing federal programs and benefits that support individuals engaged in the pursuit of training and education in non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs. It informs consideration of additional or revised policy approaches aiming to support pursuit of training and education through non-degree programs. The report begins with a brief description of employer demand for individuals who have completed non-degree programs. This is followed by a discussion of the landscape and key characteristics of non-degree programs, from those offered through work-based learning to those offered through more formal instructional means. The report concludes with a detailed description of six federal programs and three tax benefits that currently provide direct financial support to students pursuing training and postsecondary education in non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs. Each program and benefit description highlights potential gaps and limitations in the scope and extent to which the program or benefit supports individuals pursuing non-degree programs, as well as student eligibility requirements and federal administration and oversight.

This section of the report provides data on the proportion of total employment and mean wages earned in occupations by typical entry-level education requirements. This discussion provides a sense of the market for non-degree credentials. It does not offer a comprehensive exposition of labor market returns and social impacts of increased non-degree program completion.", "In May 2018, approximately 6.2% of jobs in the national economy were in occupations for which the typical entry-level education requirement was a non-degree postsecondary credential ( Table 1 ).

", " Table 1 also presents the mean annual wages for occupations by typical entry-level education required. Mean annual wages for occupations that, at entry, require a high school diploma or its equivalent, some college but no degree, or a non-degree credential are all similar. While Table 1 shows differences in mean annual wages across education categories, these wages do not capture differences within the categories, which in many cases may include sizeable earnings differentials. For example, some research has found earnings premiums for individuals attaining long-term certificates, certificates in technical (e.g., electronics) and health fields, certificates in the field in which the individual works, and certificates from community colleges.

Upon completion of a non-degree instructional program, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate, which is a credential awarded by an educational institution based on the completion of a postsecondary instructional program, including coursework, assessment, or other performance evaluations. Individuals pursue non-degree programs for various reasons, including to expand knowledge and skills, to prepare for further education, to prepare for employment, to sustain employment, and when seeking promotion. ", "For purposes of this report, non-degree instructional programs exclude those that lead to postbaccalaureate certificates and exclude transfer programs . Typically, transfer programs do not award a certificate or degree, but provide education for at least two academic years and are acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree.

Credit programs may lead to a variety of vocations.", "Although noncredit programs may offer continuing education units (CEUs) or vocational certificates to program completers, the programs do not proffer these students currency toward the pursuit of credit programs or noncredit programs in other fields. The advantage of noncredit programs is that they often are less expensive for students and educational institutions, cover a broader range of topics, and can be modified more quickly to be attentive to industry and student needs. Noncredit programs may satisfy career entry requirements; may include adult basic education (ABE) and English as a second language (ESL) instruction; may provide personal enrichment; and may be customized training.
