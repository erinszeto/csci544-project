USACE develops civil works projects principally to improve navigable channels, reduce flood and storm damage, and restore aquatic ecosystems. Congress directs USACE through authorizations and appropriations legislation. Congress often considers USACE authorization legislation biennially and appropriations annually. USACE attracts congressional attention because its projects can have significant local and regional economic benefits and environmental effects. This report summarizes authorization legislation, project delivery, authorities for alternative project delivery, and other USACE authorities.", "Authorization Legislation. For USACE studies and projects, congressional study and project authorization generally is required prior to being eligible for federal appropriations. Congress generally considers an omnibus USACE authorization bill biennially. The bill is typically titled a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). Agency action on an authorization typically requires funding; that is, both an authorization and an appropriation would be needed to proceed. Most water resource project authorizations in WRDAs fall into three general categories: project studies, construction projects, and modifications to existing projects. A few provisions in WRDA bills have time-limited authorizations; therefore, some WRDA provisions may reauthorize expired or expiring authorities. Recent authorization bills include:", "America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA 2018; P.L. 115-270), which included Title I, Water Resources Development Act of 2018 (WRDA 2018) which focused on USACE civil works; Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN; P.L. 114-322), which included Title I ,Water Resources Development Act of 2016 (WRDA 2016) which focused on USACE civil works; and Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014; P.L. 113-121), which was largely, but not wholly, focused on USACE civil works.", "In WRRDA 2014, Congress developed processes for identifying site-specific studies and projects for authorization to overcome concerns related to congressionally directed spending (known as earmarks). Congress also used these processes for WRDA 2016 and WRDA 2018.", "Standard and Alternative Project Delivery. The standard process for a USACE project requires two separate congressional authorizations\u2014one for studying feasibility, and a subsequent one for construction\u2014as well as appropriations for both. In recent years, congressional authorization for project construction has been based on a favorable report by the Chief of Engineers (a Chief's report) and an accompanying feasibility report. For most activities, Congress requires a nonfederal sponsor to share some portion of study and construction costs. For some project types (e.g., local flood control), nonfederal sponsors are responsible for operation and maintenance.", "WRRDA 2014, WRDA 2016, and WRDA 2018 expanded the opportunities for interested nonfederal entities, including private entities, to have greater roles in project development, construction, and financing. WRRDA 2014 also authorized, through the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA), a program to provide direct loans and loan guarantees for water projects. Although the WIFIA program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is operational, the USACE WIFIA program for navigation, flood risk reduction, and ecosystem restoration projects has not been implemented.", "Other USACE Activities and Authorities. Congress has granted USACE general authorities to undertake some activities without requiring additional congressional authorization, including emergency actions related to flooding and limited actions in response to drought. Additionally, under the National Response Framework, USACE may be tasked with performing activities in response to an emergency or disaster, principally associated with public works and engineering such as providing temporary roofing and emergency power restoration. In addition to its work for the Department of the Army under USACE's military program, USACE under various authorities also may perform work on a reimbursable basis for other DOD entities, federal agencies, state and local governments, and foreign governments (e.g., USACE manages the construction of multiple border barrier projects on a reimbursable basis for Customs and Border Protection)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is an agency within the Department of Defense with both military and civil works responsibilities.

It began with improving and regulating navigation channels thereby facilitating the movement of goods between states and for import and export. Congress then charged the agency to help in reducing the damages from floods. More recently, Congress has authorized the agency to restore aquatic ecosystems. USACE operates more than 700 dams; has built 14,500 miles of levees; and improves and maintains more than 900 coastal, Great Lakes, and inland harbors, as well as 12,000 miles of inland waterways.

The agency typically is working with nonfederal project sponsors in the development of these water resource projects. The demand for USACE projects typically exceeds the federal appropriations for these projects. ", "Broadly, Congress is faced with considering how well the nation is addressing its water resource needs and what is the current and future role of USACE in addressing those needs. Part of the issue is how effective, efficient, and equitable is the USACE project delivery process in meeting the nation's needs. Unlike with federal funding for highways and municipal water infrastructure, the majority of federal funds provided to USACE for water resource projects are not distributed by formula to states or through competitive grant programs.

A military Chief of Engineers oversees the agency's civil and military operations and reports on civil works matters to the Assistant Secretary for Civil Works. A civilian Director of Civil Works reports to the Chief of Engineers. The agency's civil works responsibilities are organized under eight divisions, which are further divided into 38 districts. The districts and divisions perform both military and civil works activities and are led by Army officers. An officer typically is in a specific district or division leadership position for two to three years; a Chief of Engineers often serves for roughly four years. In 2018, the Trump Administration has expressed interest in the possibility of removing USACE from the Department of Defense; for more information on the status of this proposal, see \" Proposals on Reorganizing USACE Functions \" later in this report. ", "Local interests and Members of Congress often are particularly interested in USACE pursuing a project because these projects can have significant local and regional economic benefits and environmental effects. In recent decades, Congress has legislated on most USACE authorizations through WRDAs. Congress uses WRDA legislation to authorize USACE water resource studies, projects, and programs and to establish policies (e.g., nonfederal cost-share requirements). WRDAs generally authorize new activities that are added to the pool of existing authorized activities. The authorization can be project-specific, programmatic, or general. Most project-specific authorizations in WRDAs fall into three general categories: project studies, construction projects, and modifications to existing projects. WRDAs also have deauthorized projects and established deauthorization processes. A limited set of USACE authorizations expire unless a subsequent WRDA extends the authorizations.", "Generally, a study or construction authorization by itself is insufficient for USACE to proceed. For the most part, the agency can only pursue what it is both authorized and funded to perform. Federal funding for USACE civil works activities generally is provided in annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts and at times through supplemental appropriations acts. Over the last decade, annual USACE appropriations have ranged from $4.7 billion in FY2013 to $7.0 billion in FY2019. An increasing share of the appropriations has been used for operation and maintenance (O&M) of USACE owned and operated projects. In recent years, Congress has directed more than 50% of the enacted annual appropriations to O&M and limited the number of new studies and construction projects initiated with annual appropriations. For more on USACE appropriations, see the following:", "CRS Report R45326, Army Corps of Engineers Annual and Supplemental Appropriations: Issues for Congress , by Nicole T.

For context, annual appropriations for construction funding in FY2018 and FY2019 were $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. Given that USACE starts only a few construction projects using discretionary appropriations in a fiscal year (e.g., five using annual appropriations provided in FY2019), numerous projects authorized for construction in previous WRDAs remain unfunded.

USACE generally requires two types of congressional action to initiate a study\u2014study authorization and then appropriations. Congress generally authorizes USACE studies in WRDA legislation.

USACE also investigates the nature of the water resource problem and assesses the federal government's interest. ", "If USACE recommends proceeding and a nonfederal sponsor is willing to contribute to the study, a feasibility study begins. The cost of the feasibility study (including related environmental studies) is split equally between USACE and the nonfederal project sponsor, as shown in Table 1 . The objective of the feasibility study is to formulate and recommend solutions to the identified water resource problem. During the first few months of a feasibility study, the local USACE district formulates alternative plans, investigates engineering feasibility, conducts benefit-cost analyses, and assesses environmental impacts under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a74321). (For more information on NEPA compliance and cost-benefit analyses, see the box \"USACE Feasibility Studies: National Environmental Policy Act Compliance and Economic Analyses.\") The evaluation of USACE water resource projects is governed by the 1983 Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Resources Implementation Studies (often referred to as the P&G) and by policy direction provided in WRDA bills and other enacted legislation. An important outcome of the feasibility analysis is determination of whether the project warrants further federal investment. Under the P&G, the federal objective in planning generally is to contribute to national economic development (NED) consistent with protecting the nation's environment. A feasibility study generally identifies a tentatively preferred plan, which typically is the plan that maximizes the NED consistent with protecting the environment (referred to as the NED plan). The Assistant Secretary of the Army has the authority to grant an exception and recommend a plan other than the NED plan. In some circumstances, the nonfederal sponsor may support an alternative other than the NED plan, which is known as the locally preferred plan (LPP).

Delayed completion of flood risk reduction projects may prolong a community's vulnerability to certain coastal and riverine floods, thereby contributing to the potential cost of disaster response and recovery. Delayed investment in navigation projects may result in postponed transportation cost savings from improved efficiency and in greater reliance on road and rail transport. Delayed aquatic ecosystem restoration projects may result in missed opportunities to attenuate wetlands loss and realize related ecosystem benefits, such as those for water quality and fisheries.

The Government Accountability Office in a 2013 report summarized its findings regarding cost growth at USACE flood control projects. GAO's detailed review of eight projects found that a factor contributing to cost increases at these USACE-led flood risk reduction projects was funding below the capability level. Other factors included design changes, initial USACE cost estimates being lower than later cost estimates, and differences in contract estimates and actual contract costs. When testifying in 2013, USACE Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations Major General Michael J. Walsh noted that how much funding is put toward a project significantly impacts the duration of project delivery.

Navigation projects include river deepening, channel widening, lock expansion, dam operations, and disposal of dredged material. Flood control projects are intended to reduce riverine and coastal storm damage; these projects range from levees and floodwalls to dams and river channelization. Many USACE projects are multipurpose\u2014that is, they provide water supply, recreation, and hydropower in addition to navigation or flood control. USACE environmental activities involve wetlands and aquatic ecosystem restoration and environmental mitigation activities for USACE facilities. The agency's regulatory responsibility for navigable waters extends to issuing permits for private actions that might affect navigation, wetlands, and other waters of the United States. ", "Navigation and Flood Control (1802-1950s)", "The agency's civil works mission developed in the 19 th century. In 1824, Congress passed legislation charging military engineers with planning roads and canals to move goods and people. In 1850, Congress directed USACE to engage in its first planning exercise\u2014flood control for the lower Mississippi River. In 1899, Congress directed the agency to regulate obstructions of navigable waters (see box titled \"USACE Regulatory Activities: Permits and Their Authorities). During the 1920s, Congress expanded USACE's ability to incorporate hydropower into multipurpose projects and authorized the agency to undertake comprehensive surveys to establish river-basin development plans. The Flood Control Act of 1928 (70 Stat. 391) authorized USACE to construct flood control projects on the Mississippi and Tributaries (known as the MR&T project), and modified a 1917 authority for flood control project on the Sacramento River in California. The modern era of federal flood control emerged with the Flood Control Act of 1936 (49 Stat. 1570), which declared flood control a \"proper\" federal activity in the national interest. The 1944 Flood Control Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7708) significantly augmented the agency's involvement in large multipurpose projects and authorized agreements for the temporary use of surplus water. The Flood Control Act of 1950 (33 U.S.C. \u00a7701n) began the agency's emergency operations through authorization for flood preparedness and emergency operations. The Water Supply Act of 1958 (43 U.S.C. \u00a7390b) gave USACE authority to include some reservoir storage for municipal and industrial water supply in reservoir projects at 100% nonfederal cost.", "Changing Priorities (1960-1985)", "From 1970 to 1985, Congress authorized no major water projects, scaled back several authorized projects, and passed laws that altered project operations and water delivery programs to protect the environment. The 1970s marked a transformation in USACE project planning. The 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a74321) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \u00a71531) required federal agencies to consider environmental impacts, increase public participation in planning, and consult with other federal agencies. Enactment in 1972 of what became the Clean Water Act also expanded the USACE's regulatory responsibilities; for more on the USACE role in implementing Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a71344), see the text box \"USACE Regulatory Activities: Permits and Their Authorities.\" ", "Executive orders (E.O. 11988 and E.O. 11990) united the goals of reducing flood losses and decreasing environmental damage by recognizing the value of wetlands and by requiring federal agencies to evaluate potential effects of actions on floodplains and to minimize wetlands impacts.
