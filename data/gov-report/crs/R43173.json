There are 49 candidate SSA countries with 39 currently eligible for the preference benefits. Congress first authorized AGOA in 2000 to encourage export-led growth and economic development in SSA and improve U.S. economic relations with the region. Its current authorization expires on September 30, 2015.", "Bills to renew the preference program (H.R. 1891/S. 1009) were introduced in the House and Senate in April. H.R. 1891 was reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means without amendment. The Senate Finance Committee reported a related measure, S. 1267, with two amendments. On May 14, the Senate passed the provisions of S. 1267, by including them as an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1295. On June 11, the House passed a further amended version of H.R. 1295. The two chambers must resolve the differences in H.R. 1295 before the AGOA renewal legislation can be sent to the President and become law.", "In terms of tariff benefits and general eligibility criteria, AGOA is similar to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a U.S. trade preference program that applies to more than 120 developing countries. AGOA, however, covers more products and includes additional eligibility criteria beyond those in GSP. Additionally, AGOA includes trade and development provisions beyond its duty-free preferences.", "U.S. imports from AGOA beneficiary countries (AGOA countries) represent a small share (1%) of total U.S. imports and are largely concentrated in energy-related products. Oil is consistently the top duty-free U.S. import from AGOA countries, accounting for 68% of such imports in 2014. Despite remaining the top U.S. import under AGOA, U.S. oil imports from the region have fallen by 80% or nearly $40 billion since 2011. Among non-energy products, apparel is the top export for a number of AGOA countries. U.S. apparel imports typically face relatively high tariffs and are excluded from duty-free treatment in GSP, but are included in the AGOA preferences, giving AGOA countries a competitive advantage over other apparel producers. A handful of countries, primarily Lesotho, Kenya, and Mauritius, make significant use of the apparel benefits. Apart from apparel and energy products, South Africa accounts for the bulk of U.S. imports under AGOA. As the most economically advanced country in the region, South Africa also exports a much more diverse range of manufactured goods than other AGOA countries; vehicles in particular have become a major South African export under AGOA.", "Most observers agree that AGOA has successfully led to increased and more diversified exports to the United States from sub-Saharan African countries. Despite this, Congress may wish to address a number of issues and challenges as it considers possible reauthorization of AGOA. Among these challenges is how current and potential AGOA beneficiaries can better utilize the AGOA program and its duty-free benefits. Studies suggest that even among some countries that do make significant use of the AGOA preferences, the lower-skill apparel production which AGOA has spurred has not led to the production of higher-skill manufactured products. Other issues relate to the nonreciprocal nature of the AGOA preferences. Some argue that the United States should focus more on two-way trade agreements with the region, particularly with more advanced countries such as South Africa, given improving economic conditions in Africa in recent years. The European Union (EU), for example, has negotiated Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with several African countries that provide some reciprocal tariff benefits, potentially placing U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage relative to European firms in some markets."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, Congress passed the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a U.S. trade preference program, in order to help spur market-led economic growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and deepen U.S. trade and investment ties with the region.

Since AGOA was enacted (2001-2013), however, SSA's growth averaged 6.3%, more than 2\u00a0points higher than the 3.9% world average. While the region still contains many of the world's poorest countries and faces significant economic challenges, some observers and policymakers argue that changing economic conditions warrant an evolution in U.S. policy toward SSA, focused more strongly on private sector investment and increasing two-way trade.

AGOA builds on GSP by providing preferential access to the U.S. market for more products, such as apparel, and sets out additional eligibility criteria. AGOA also includes other trade and development components, beyond preferences, that are not part of GSP. ", "AGOA, like other U.S. trade preference programs, is nonreciprocal and unilateral. The preferences apply to U.S. imports and not to U.S. exports, so reauthorization only requires action by the U.S. government. These one-way preferences are granted to developing countries with the goal of enhancing export-led economic growth, and typically exclude items that may be considered import sensitive. This distinguishes them from other U.S. trade liberalization efforts such as free trade agreements (FTAs) or multilateral agreements through the World Trade Organization (WTO), which reduce and/or eliminate tariffs for both U.S. imports and exports. AGOA included a provision requiring the President to explore potential FTA negotiations with interested AGOA beneficiaries, suggesting that Congress envisioned AGOA as a stepping stone to potential broader trade pacts with African countries.

GSP removes the tariff on an additional 3,400 products (4,800 for least-developed countries), and AGOA makes another 1,800 tariff lines duty-free, though a large share of these are included in the GSP benefits for least-developed countries (LDCs). AGOA extends duty-free treatment to certain apparel and footwear products, which are not eligible under GSP (even for LDCs).

Unlike textile production, it typically requires low-skilled labor and minimal capital expenditures, allowing lesser-developed countries to become globally competitive. Some research suggests that success in low-skill and export intensive industries such as apparel may help lead to a more diversified manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, the U.S. apparel sector is deemed \"import sensitive,\" and has some specific safeguards. For example, in U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs), apparel tariff lines typically have \"yarn forward\" general rules of origin (which govern how much of the product must be made in the beneficiary country and longer tariff phase outs), and most preference programs either exclude these articles (GSP) or have caps on duty-free treatment (including AGOA).", "The existing general restrictions on U.S. imports of apparel make AGOA's preferential treatment for these product lines especially advantageous.

Given SSA's abundant natural resources and the already low U.S. tariff on oil ($0.05-$0.10 per barrel), much of this trade would likely occur regardless of the preference program. The discussion that follows focuses on non-energy trade between the United States and SSA. (See the text box below for more information on U.S. oil imports under AGOA.)", "In 2014, U.S. imports from SSA under AGOA and GSP, excluding energy products, were $4.4 billion ( Figure 1 ). These imports have increased nearly three-fold (up from $1.3 billion) since 2001, the first full year of AGOA eligibility. They fell by $500 million from 2013 to 2014, but this was primarily due to lower auto imports from South Africa. Apparel products remain one of the largest non-oil import categories; however, these imports peaked in 2004 prior to the dismantling of the complex multilateral quota system, known as the Multifiber Agreement (MFA). The MFA limited U.S. apparel imports from certain countries, thus eliminating the extent of competition faced by AGOA apparel exporters. Though U.S. apparel imports still face relatively high tariffs, removal of these strict quantitative limitations reduced the AGOA countries' competitive advantage in producing apparel. U.S. apparel imports under AGOA, though very significant for some AGOA countries, represent only 1% of overall U.S. apparel imports. U.S. apparel imports totaled $82.7 billion in 2014, with $30.7 billion from China, $9.2 billion from Vietnam, and less than $1 billion total from AGOA beneficiaries ( Table 1 ).", "While U.S. apparel imports from AGOA countries have declined from their peak in 2004, imports of other products have been rising rapidly.

A handful of countries have made strong use of the preference program and have increased employment in economic sectors that benefited from duty-free treatment under AGOA. For example, the government of Lesotho, one of the major apparel exporters under AGOA, estimates that employment in manufacturing rose from 19,000 in 1999 to 45,700 in June 2011. A peer-reviewed economic study found a direct link between the AGOA preferences and increased U.S. imports from beneficiary countries, and concluded that these increased SSA exports were not merely diverted from other potential export destinations (e.g., the European Union). This relationship was strongest for the apparel sector and other sectors with high U.S. import tariffs.", "Despite these achievements, challenges remain, such as the limited number of countries making significant use of the preferences, and doubts as to whether AGOA countries have been able to translate these short-term preference benefits into transformative changes in their manufacturing capabilities and overall competitiveness. As highlighted above, the majority of AGOA non-oil imports come from South Africa. Among the other countries that have made significant use of the preferences, apparel exports account for most of their AGOA exports. While the apparel sector has been acknowledged as a potential launching point for more advanced manufacturing industries, the manufacturing sectors in many AGOA beneficiary countries remain highly underdeveloped. One study asserts that AGOA apparel production is concentrated in the lowest-skill tasks with little knowledge transfer to local workers and that the global competitiveness of AGOA exporters still depends on their preferential treatment.", "In addition to AGOA's tangible goals related to economic development and trade, AGOA also supports the achievement of other strategic objectives. AGOA serves as a focal point for U.S. economic relations with SSA. If the recent period of high economic growth in much of SSA continues, the United States may have an increasing interest in the region's potential as a consumer market and destination for both U.S. exports and foreign direct investment (FDI). A study by McKinsey estimated that the number of African households making above $5,000 per year, the point where discretionary spending begins, would rise from 85 million in 2008 to 128 million in 2020. Though AGOA focuses specifically on U.S. imports, it spurs dialogue between the United States and SSA countries on two-way trade and investment issues through the annual AGOA Forum. Through the eligibility criteria required for the program, the United States maintains some influence over the political and economic structure of the beneficiary countries.

For example, some recommend more precise targeting for failure to meet mandatory eligibility criteria, such as removal of preferences for a particular industry rather than an entire country. Debate over the timing of the withdrawal of preferences includes both proponents of shorter and longer phase-outs. Some argue that immediate withdrawal of preferences following failure to meet eligibility criteria would be more effective while others suggest a longer phase-out would ensure businesses have time to reallocate resources.

One related goal included in the original AGOA legislation mandates that the Administration seek out possible FTA partners among SSA nations. Subsequent negotiations with South Africa and its regional partners in SACU began in 2003, but were ultimately unsuccessful and postponed indefinitely in 2006.

Yet discussions on AGOA often center on the need for more TCB funding, with many suggesting this amount is inadequate or ineffective. In 2011, GAO reported that USAID needed better evaluation of its TCB programs, and in its most recent AGOA report, GAO argued that USAID could enhance AGOA utilization with a greater focus on and assistance toward the creation of country strategies. Beneficiaries may also be able to improve their utilization of AGOA through the timely implementation of the recent WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. Congress may wish to consider how AGOA-directed TCB funding could support this implementation process.

While a majority of products are covered under AGOA, some of the excluded products are competitively produced in AGOA countries, particularly agricultural products. Though some agriculture products are included in AGOA, those subject to tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) are limited in the amount that may enter duty-free. Congress may wish to examine expanding the products or quantities covered under AGOA, which could potentially allow a greater number of AGOA beneficiaries to make use of the trade preference program. ", "To address related U.S. import sensitivities, some have suggested reassigning current quota allocations as an alternative method to expand agricultural market access for AGOA countries. For some products, such as chocolate, these groups argue, a portion of the quota is not assigned to a specific country and may go unfilled. They assert that allocating this quota to AGOA countries could be politically feasible and also encourage downstream production in some cocoa exporting countries. Others contend that changing quota allocations could require approval from the WTO, limiting its feasibility.

Despite this existing flexibility, restrictions remain, which some groups would like to ease. These stakeholders seek, for example, an increase in the allowable value content attributed to the United States or easing technical constraints on what costs count toward cumulation. In addition, certain AGOA countries have argued that existing rules of origin prevent canned tuna from qualifying for AGOA preferences, and have sought a general modification of the rules or a product-specific exception.

In June 2015, a joint statement released by the United States and South Africa stated that industry and government officials agreed to renew market access in South Africa for U.S. exports of certain poultry products.

For example, in 2014, U.S. import duties on all imports from Cambodia ($460 million) were higher than on those from France ($451 million). Providing broader DFQF access to LDCs would erode some of the competitive advantage AGOA apparel producers currently receive. A recent study estimates that apparel exports from AGOA countries would fall considerably if AGOA-like benefits were expanded to all LDCs. Other studies, however, estimate that a broader DFQF program could actually benefit AGOA LDCs by including protected sectors such as agriculture, despite potential losses in apparel production.
