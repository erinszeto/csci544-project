However, in 1915 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the railroad company violated the terms of the grant. The disposition of these lands was eventually resolved with the O&C Act of 1937, which revested the lands back into federal ownership to be managed by the Department of the Interior \"for permanent forest production\" with the purpose of providing a supply of timber, protecting watersheds, providing recreational opportunities, and contributing to the economic stability of the local communities.

When timber sales and revenues began to decline in the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s, Congress established alternative compensation systems for the county payments: first, the safety net payments specifically for the Pacific Northwest, and then, the broader Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS; P.L. 106-393, as amended).

Therefore, the O&C counties will not receive an SRS payment for FY2014 (to be made in 2015), but the payments will return to 50% of receipts, unless Congress acts to extend, modify, or replace SRS. These payments would likely be significantly lower than previous years' SRS payments.", "The 113th Congress considered legislation to address the management of the O&C lands and federal payment programs to the O&C counties. A House-passed bill (H.R. 1526, the Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act) would have transferred management authority of much of the O&C lands to a governor-appointed panel and established a trust with fiduciary responsibility to the counties, among other provisions related to the management and applicability of federal environmental laws.

The railroad received alternating sections of land for an average of 20 miles on each side of the proposed railroad, resulting in a checkerboard ownership pattern with private, state, local, and federal ownership. As part of the grant, Congress directed the Oregon & California Railroad Company to encourage settlement and development by selling parcels no larger than 160 acres at a maximum price of $2.50 per acre. However, the railroad violated the grant in part by selling larger tracts above the designated price, and also by temporarily halting sales to increase timber prices. In 1908, the United States sued the railroad company, and in 1915 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the railroad violated the terms of the grant.

Management concerns\u2014such as how to compensate the counties for the loss of property tax revenue\u2014persisted, and were addressed with the Oregon & California Railroad Lands Act of 1937 (O&C Act). This act directed that the Department of the Interior (DOI) would administer the lands \"for permanent forest production\" with the purpose of providing timber, protecting watersheds, providing recreational opportunities, and contributing to the economic stability of the local communities. The O&C Act also established a revenue sharing system for the counties. Initially the lands were managed by the DOI General Land Office, but in 1946, the General Land Office was merged with the U.S. Grazing Service to create the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which continues to administer the O&C lands. In FY2014, BLM received $115 million in appropriations to manage the O&C lands.", "The O&C lands are also commonly considered to refer to approximately 472,000 acres of controverted lands managed by the Forest Service and 75,000 acres of the reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) lands.

The statute established a 500 million board feet annual allowable sale quantity (ASQ), which could be adjusted periodically. By 1972, the ASQ peaked at approximately 1.2 billion board feet, aided in part by a 1960s modification which included the intermixed public domain forestry lands in the calculation formula. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the average harvest level regularly exceeded 1 billion board feet per year. Harvest levels began to decline in the 1990s, reaching a low of 13 million board feet in 1994.

However, the CFA first allocated receipts to the Treasury for reimbursement of expenses, which included compensating the O&C Railroad Company for the lands revested to the federal government. Congress (and the DOI) anticipated the O&C lands would generate enough revenue from timber sales that there would be funds available after the federal government was fully reimbursed for the acquisition cost and the tax equivalency payments. Therefore, after reimbursing the federal government, the CFA allocated the remaining receipts to the state for schools (25%); to the counties for schools, roads, and port districts (25%); to the Reclamation Fund (40%); and then to the Treasury (10%).

By 1926, there had not been enough revenue generated to make any payments to the state or counties, and the federal government still had not been reimbursed for the entirety of the 1913-1916 tax equivalency payments. Congress again authorized tax equivalency payments to the counties\u2014for the period of 1916-1926\u2014in the 1926 Stanfield Act. The act also changed the priority for receipts to first pay the counties an annual tax equivalency payment going forward, and second priority to reimburse the federal government any remaining balance for past tax equivalency payments. After those payments, any additional revenue was to be distributed along the same formula established in the CFA, creating both a tax equivalency payment and a revenue sharing payment for the counties. However, timber sale revenue continued to be insufficient to pay the entire calculated tax burden. By 1936, tax equivalency payments to the counties had only been made through 1933, and the U.S. Treasury was still owed approximately $8.4 million for those payments, before disbursal to the state and other federal government accounts under the formula.

For example, both bills would have provided some restrictions on old growth harvests and would have protected portions of the O&C lands through new wilderness designations. However, while H.R. 1526 proposed divesting the management authority of the federal O&C lands to state control, in contrast, S. 1784 would have retained federal authority but with very specific management prescriptions. Both bills attempted to streamline the environmental analysis and planning procedures, but did so in different ways. S. 1784 would have prescribed a long-term, large-scale environmental document with statutorily specified analyses to cover most management actions. H.R. 1526 would have allowed management actions to proceed primarily under existing Oregon state law and would not have required compliance with certain federal environmental laws or regulations. ", "Both bills would have altered the distribution of timber sale revenues and attempted to establish dependable revenue for the 18 O&C counties. Much of the published analytical comparisons of the bills focused on their potential impacts on county compensation. However, comparing revenue projections relies on several assumptions that introduce high levels of variability into the analysis and uncertainty into the conclusions. These assumptions include estimates about harvest volumes, revenues, and management costs. In particular, projecting timber volumes sold and revenues collected relies on factors beyond federal control, such as market behavior in response to the presumed increased supply of federal timber. Other important assumptions include the feasibility and cost of compliance with the implementation timelines proposed in both bills, and the consequences for failing to do so."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Activity in the 114th Congress", "paragraphs": ["The Oregon and California Land Grant Act of 2015, S. 132 , was introduced by Senator Wyden on January 8, 2015.
