For FY2012, a total of about $110.4 million is estimated to be available to this program. Using these funds, the Coast Guard provides grants to states and nonprofit organizations for the development and implementation of a coordinated national recreational boating safety program. In FY2011, about $108.7 million was distributed to individual states through the State Recreational Boating Safety Program.", "(3) The Clean Vessel Act of 1992 (Title V, Subtitle F of P.L. 102-587 ) authorizes a competitive grant program for states to construct pump-out and dump stations to dispose of vessel sewage from recreational boaters. This program annually receives 2% of the annual receipts to the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund; the current authorization for this allocation extends through June 30, 2012. Annual state grants total more than $10 million under this program; in FY2011, a total of about $11.7 million was distributed to states through this program.", "(4) Section 7404(d) of the Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21; P.L. 105-178 ) authorizes a competitive grant program that provides matching funds to states to install or upgrade docking facilities for transient recreational boats 26 feet or more in length. This program, known as the Boating Infrastructure Grant Program, annually receives 2% of the annual receipts to the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund; the current authorization for this allocation extends through June 30, 2012.

The Recreational Boating and Fishing Foundation, a tax-exempt corporation, was established in 1998 to carry out this program to increase participation in recreational boating and fishing and to encourage greater public involvement in aquatic stewardship as mandated in the Sportfishing and Boating Safety Act of 1998 (Title VII, Subtitle D of P.L. 105-178 ). This program provides grants to improve communication with anglers, boaters, and the general public and to reduce barriers to participating in these activities. Annually, more than $10 million has been available for this program; in FY2012, an estimated $11.9 million is to be available.", "(6) The Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program Improvement Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-408 ) authorized a Multi-State Conservation Grant Program.

Sixty percent of each state's share is based on the number of licensed anglers (fishermen) in the state, and 40% on its land and water area. No state receives more than 5% or less than 1% of each year's total apportionment. Puerto Rico receives 1%, and the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and the District of Columbia each receive one-third of 1%. Currently, around $400 million is allocated to states annually through this program; in FY2012, a total of $340.1 million is estimated to be available for distribution to states through the program. State projects funded by this program can include land acquisition, development (including boating access sites), research, operations and maintenance, sport fish population management, and program coordination. Prohibited activities are law enforcement and public relations. To qualify for the funds, states must certify the number of licensed anglers in their state, agree not to utilize their sport fish license funds for purposes other than administration of their fish and game department, and provide a 75% match for most projects.", "Authorized administrative expenses for management of the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund by the Fish and Wildlife Service are identified in 16 U.S.C.

In accordance with Section 10119 of P.L. 109-59 , the Boat Safety Account was terminated and, through FY2010, certain program expenditures from the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund were bolstered by the spend-down of the accumulated assets in the Boating Safety Account.
