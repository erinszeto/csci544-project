On the individual side, the bill's principal focuses are reduction of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and extension of a set of expiring tax benefits. For businesses, the bill couples a substantial cut in the statutory corporate tax rate with a permanent increase in the \"expensing\" benefit for small business investment with a set of revenue-raising provisions. Taken alone, the bill's business provisions would reduce tax revenue by an estimated $8.7 billion over 5 years and $1.0 billion over 10 years.", "The bill's proposed reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate is the largest of its proposed cuts, both in terms of revenue loss and number of businesses affected. Under current law, corporate taxable income is generally subject to a set of graduated rates: 15%, 25%, 34%, and 35%, with the lower rates applying to lower increments of income. The bill proposes to replace the top two rates with a single 30.5% rate. Since the bulk of taxable income in the corporate sector is earned by firms subject to the highest rates, most taxable corporate income would benefit from the rate reduction. Taken alone, the rate cut would reduce revenue by an estimated $151.7 billion over five years\u2014over half the estimated revenue loss from all of the proposed corporate tax cuts combined.", "A second tax cut in the proposal would make permanent a temporary increase in the \"expensing\" benefit for equipment investment by relatively small businesses. In addition, the bill proposes to extend for one year a set of other narrowly targeted temporary business tax benefits, most of which expired at the end of 2007.

Together (and considered apart from the tax cuts), the revenue-raising items would increase business taxes by $164.0 billion over five years. The single largest item is repeal of the 9% deduction for domestic production, which\u2014for income attributable to domestic production\u2014would generally offset 3.15 percentage points of the proposal's 4.5 percentage-point tax-rate reduction. A second sizeable revenue raiser would apply to multinational firms: it would require firms that defer U.S. taxes on foreign-source income to likewise defer deduction of costs attributable to the income.

Taken alone, the revenue-losing and revenue-gaining measures in the conference agreement fell between the House and Senate bills, in terms of their size. The Senate version of the bill provided both for larger tax cuts and revenue offsets than did the House bill.", "The act's final tax cuts were generally, though not exclusively, targeted at small business. A prominent provision was an extension of the \" expensing \" tax benefit for business investment in machines and equipment\u2014a tax benefit provided by Section 179 of the tax code. The provision is linked to small business because it applies only to firms undertaking less than a certain level of investment. The provision is a tax benefit in that it permits firms to deduct (\"expense\") in the first year of service a capped amount of investment outlays rather than requiring the outlays to be deducted gradually in the form of depreciation, as is required with most tangible assets. Permanent provisions of the Internal Revenue Code cap the expensing allowance at $25,000 per year and begin a phase-out of the allowance when a firm's investment exceeds $200,000. However, temporary rules initially enacted in 2003 (and extended on several occasions) increased the annual cap and threshold to $100,000 and $400,000, respectively. The increased amounts are indexed for inflation occurring after 2003; the amounts for 2007 were $112,000 and $450,000. The most recent extension was provided by TIPRA in 2006 and extended the increased allowance and threshold through 2009. P.L. 110-28 extended the increased expensing allowance through 2011 and also increased the allowance to $125,000 and the phase-out threshold to $500,000.", "Another temporary tax benefit the act addressed was the work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) . In general, WOTC permits employers to claim a tax credit equal to a specified percentage paid in first-year wages to members of certain targeted groups, including families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) support, qualified veterans, high-risk youth, and others. Under prior law, WOTC was scheduled to expire at the end of 2007; P.L. 110-28 extended the credit through August 2011 and made several modifications in qualification criteria for the targeted groups.", "The act modified the tax credit employers can claim against social security (FICA) taxes paid for employees who receive tips . The modification was designed to keep the new, higher minimum wage from having the effect of reducing the credit. Under both the act and prior law, the credit is equal to the employer's FICA tax on tips in excess of those meeting the minimum wage requirement. Absent other changes, an increase in the minimum wage reduces the tax credit, by increasing the threshold over which the tax credit is earned.", "P.L. 110-28 increased the minimum wage to $7.25 from prior law's $5.15 and would have reduced the tax credit, absent other changes. However, the act provided that the credit will continue to be calculated based on prior law's minimum wage. The act also provided that both the FICA credit and WOTC can offset a taxpayer's alternative minimum tax.", "The act contained two principal revenue-raising provisions. One increased the scope of the \" kiddie tax \" \u2014a provision that taxes children under the age of 18 at their parents' tax rate on unearned income exceeding a certain threshold. The act increased the applicable age by one year (i.e., under age 19), or under 24, if full-time students.

The benefits tend to be tax incentives: provisions designed to encourage certain types of investment or activity thought to be economically or socially desirable. As targeted tax incentives, the benefits tend to raise a similar policy question: according to traditional economic theory, smoothly functioning markets and undistorted prices generally allocate the economy's scare resources in the most efficient way possible. Absent market malfunctions\u2014failures that economists believe are more the exception than the rule\u2014economic theory indicates that tax benefits or penalties that interfere with the market reduce economic efficiency and reduce overall economic welfare. The question with each extender, then, is whether there is a market failure or socially desirable goal that makes the incentive's intervention in the market desirable.", "One extender is the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit, which was first enacted in 1981, and which has been renewed on numerous occasions. The credit provides businesses a tax benefit that is linked to the firms' increase in research outlays in the current year over a statutorily defined base period. The credit is based on economic theory's notion that free markets do not operate smoothly in the case of research and development\u2014that absent government support, firms would not spend as much on research as is economically efficient. (It could also be argued, however, that the amount of support provided by the R&E credit and several other extant research subsidies more than compensate for the theoretical shortfall in research.)", "The R&E credit's most recent extension was provided by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA; P.L. 109-432 ) in December 2006, and it expired at the end of 2007; the 2006 extension included an additional, alternative method that firms can use to calculate the credit, which may result in additional tax savings for firms in certain circumstances. There has been interest in the current Congress, however, in making the tax credit permanent.", "The extenders in general have been a continuing issue for Congress\u2014in part because their temporary nature necessitates periodic action if they are not to expire, and in part because of the strong support for many of the benefits. As noted above, an element of the Tax Reduction and Reform Act ( H.R. 3970 ) that was introduced in October 2007 proposes a one-year extension of a number of expiring tax provisions, including the R&E tax credit. On October 30, Chairman Charles Rangel of the House Ways and Means introduced a bill ( H.R. 3996 ; the Temporary Tax Relief Act) devoted only to extending expiring provisions and providing a \"patch\" that would reduce the individual alternative minimum tax for one year. The alternative minimum tax bill that Congress enacted in December, however, did not contain tax provisions other than those pertaining to the alternative minimum tax.", "The extenders have continued to receive congressional attention in 2008.

Their focus appeared to be two-fold: a revenue-raising, scaling-back of tax cuts that were enacted in recent years for the petroleum firms and enactment of a new set of incentives aimed at energy conservation and promotion of alternative energy sources. Those goals were addressed, in part, in an energy bill ( H.R. 6 ) the House passed in January 2007. The bill contained both tax and non-tax provisions. Its tax measures restricted several tax benefits as they apply to oil and gas production, and provided that the resulting tax revenues were to be used to fund a reserve for energy efficiency and renewable energy.", "In June, the Senate began consideration of its own, amended, version of H.R. 6 , which included a wide-ranging, non-tax (\"policy\") component. While the Senate Finance Committee approved a tax package of revenue-raising items and provisions to promote conservation and alternative energy sources, the tax plan was not added to the policy component of H.R. 6 because of opposition to its revenue-raising provisions\u2014especially a tax on oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico and restrictions on leasing transactions involving foreign property.", "The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill ( H.R. 2776 ), on June 20, that\u2014unlike H.R. 6 \u2014was restricted to energy tax provisions. Like the Finance Committee measure, it contains a mix of revenue raisers and tax benefits. The bill was approved by the House on August 4, 2007.", "In broad outline, the Finance Committee legislation and House bills are similar in certain respects, with their conservation and alternative fuels measures partly offset by revenue-raising items. They differ, however, in the exact make-up of the respective components and in the magnitude of their revenue effects. Specifically, the Finance Committee bill contains revenue-losing items estimated to reduce revenue by a total of $32 billion over 10 years, and revenue-raisers expected to increase revenues by the same amount, thus achieving approximate revenue neutrality on a net basis. The House bill is likewise estimated to achieve revenue neutrality, but the expected magnitude of its respective revenue raisers and revenue-losing provisions is smaller, totaling $15 billion over 10 years in each case.", "Prominent among the tax benefits in both bills is extension and modification of the tax credit for production of energy from renewable sources provided by Section 45 of the tax code, although the Finance Committee's version would result in a larger revenue loss. The remaining revenue-losing items in the two bills differ considerably.", "A large revenue-raising item common to both bills is the denial of the tax code's Section 199 domestic production deduction to certain oil- and gas-related income. The deduction was first enacted with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ) and it applies to the domestic U.S. manufacturing, extractive, and agriculture industries in general, not just to the petroleum industry. The deduction is phased in, with a rate equal to 6% of domestic production income in 2007-2009, and a permanent rate of 9% in 2010 and thereafter. The House bill would deny the deduction to all domestic production of oil and gas; the Finance Committee measure would deny the deduction to integrated oil companies.", "In December, the Senate failed to take action on an energy bill containing the tax provisions advocated by the Finance Committee, and Congress instead approved comprehensive energy legislation stripped of most of its tax elements (The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, P.L. 110-140 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Shelters", "paragraphs": ["Corporate \"tax shelters\" are another area where Congress may look for tax increasing revenues. They concern policymakers because of their corrosive effect on tax equity and popular perceptions about the tax system's fairness. In popular usage, the term \"tax shelter\" denotes the use of tax deductions or credits produced by one activity to reduce taxes on another: the first activity \"shelters\" the second from tax. In economic terms, a tax shelter can be defined as a transaction (for example, an investment or sale) that reduces taxes without resulting in a reduced return or increased risk for the participant. But the term is so vague and general in most usages that it could also be defined simply as a tax saving activity that is viewed as undesirable by the observer using the term. Under most definitions, tax shelters can be either illegal and constitute \"tax evasion\" or legal, comprising \"tax avoidance.\"", "Congress has evinced considerable interest in tax shelters in recent years, and has enacted some restrictions into law.

In part, the act's provisions were directed at specific tax shelters\u2014for example, leasing activities and the acquisition of losses for tax purposes (\"built in\" losses). In addition, the act included provisions\u2014for example, revised penalties and reporting requirements\u2014designed to restrict sheltering activity in general.

Generally, the economic substance doctrine disallows tax deductions, credits, or similar benefits in the case of transactions not having economic substance. The Senate version of TIPRA would have integrated aspects of the doctrine into the tax code itself. A similar measure was contained in the Senate version of the AJCA, but was not adopted.", "Several bills in the 110 th Congress have included codification of the economic substance doctrine as a revenue-raising \"offset\" for tax cuts elsewhere in the tax code.

Taxes can, however, alter the extent to which firms engage in overseas operations rather than domestic investment. Under current law, a tax benefit known as \"deferral\" poses an incentive for U.S. firms to invest overseas in countries with relatively low tax rates. Deferral provides its benefit by permitting U.S. firms to postpone their U.S. tax on foreign income as long as that income is reinvested abroad in foreign subsidiaries. The benefit is generally available for active business operations abroad, but the tax code's Subpart F provisions restrict deferral in the case of income from passive investment. If made, proposals to restrict deferral may consist of expansion of the range of income subject to Subpart F.", "In recent years, however, the thrust of legislation has been more in the direction of expanding deferral and cutting taxes for overseas operations. For example, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 cut taxes on overseas operations in several ways, while in 2006, TIPRA restricted Subpart F in the case of banking and related businesses receiving \"active financing\" income and in the case of the \"look through\" treatment overseas operations receive from subsidiary firms. Further, several analysts have recently argued that attempts to tax overseas operations are either counterproductive or outmoded in the modern integrated world economy.

Does the reduced tax burden increase the supply of capital and saving, thus increasing long-run growth? Or, is the economy's supply of capital relatively fixed, meaning the investment incentives simply interfere with the efficient allocation of investment? Were the enacted business tax cuts effective in stimulating the economy in the short run, thus aiding recovery from the 2001 recession? Or, do planning lags and other factors make business tax cuts ineffective as a fiscal stimulus, meaning the relation between the business tax cuts and economic recovery was serendipitous? What was the effect of the business tax cuts on the overall fairness of the tax system? Did the reductions accrue primarily to relatively high-income stockholders and corporate creditors, or were any reductions on tax progressivity outweighed by positive employment effects? How did the business tax cuts affect U.S. economic competitiveness? Have provisions such as the domestic production deduction helped revitalize domestic manufacturing, or do the deduction and other competitiveness provisions interfere with the efficient and flexible participation of U.S. businesses in the world economy?", "Enacted Legislation", "The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (JCWA; P.L. 107-147 ) contained temporary \"bonus\" depreciation provisions that permitted firms to deduct an additional 30% of the cost of property in its first year of service rather than requiring that portion to be depreciated over a period of years. The provision generally applied to machines and equipment (but not structures) and was limited to property placed in service after September 11, 2001, and before January 1, 2005. JCWA also temporarily extended the net operating loss \"carryback\" period (the years in the past from whose income a firm can deduct losses) to five years from two years. The provision only applied to losses in 2001 and 2002. JCWA also temporarily extended a set of expiring tax benefits (the \"extenders\" discussed above), many of which applied to business taxes.", "While a principal thrust of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA; P.L. 108-27 ) was accelerating the effective date of individual income tax cuts enacted in 2001, the act also contained a number of business provisions. JGTRRA's tax cuts for dividends and capital gains applied to individual income taxes, but nonetheless reduced the tax burden on stockholders' corporate-source income. Under the U.S. classical method of business taxation, corporate source income is taxed twice: once under the corporate income tax and once under the individual income tax\u2014an instance of double-taxation that is thought by economists to inefficiently restrict the flow of capital to the corporate sector. JGTRRA's reductions were an incremental step in the direction of removing the double-taxation\u2014a reform economists term tax \"integration.\" The reductions were temporary, and were originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2008.", "In addition to its capital gains and dividend reduction, JGTRRA increased bonus depreciation to 50% and extended its coverage to the period between May 5, 2003, and January 1, 2005. JGTRRA also temporarily (for 2003, 2004, and 2005) increased the \"expensing\" allowance for small-business investment from $25,000 to $100,000.", "The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357 ) grew out of legislation designed to end a dispute between the European Union (EU) and the United States over a U.S. tax benefit for exporting (the extraterritorial or ETI provisions) that had been determined to contravene the World Trade Organization agreements' prohibition on export subsidies. The EU objected to the ETI benefit, and imposed countervailing tariffs authorized by the WTO. AJCA repealed ETI, but also enacted a set of new WTO-legal business tax cuts designed, in part, to offset the impact of ETI's repeal on domestic businesses. However, the scope of AJCA substantially transcended ETI and its offsets, and the act was, in its final form, an omnibus business tax bill.", "Aside from ETI's repeal, AJCA's most prominent provisions were a new domestic production deduction equal to 9% of income from domestic (but not foreign) production, and a set of tax cuts for multinational firms, including more generous foreign tax credit rules governing interest expense. AJCA also temporarily extended the $100,000 small business expensing allowance (through 2007).", "The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 (TIPRA; P.L. 109-222 ) extended JGTRRA's reduced rates for dividends and capital gains for two years, through 2010. TIPRA also extended JGTRRA's $100,000 small-business expensing-allowance for two years, through 2009. (In early 2007, P.L. 110-28 extended the increased expensing allowance through 2010.)", "The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA; P.L. 109-432 ) was passed in the post-election session of the 109 th Congress. Many of the extenders had expired at the end of 2005, and TRHCA extended them, generally for two years (through 2007)."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
