To achieve long-term financial sustainability and ensure that flood insurance rates more accurately reflect the actuarial risk of flooding, the new law gradually phases out subsidized premiums and grandfathered policies for approximately 19% (or about 1.1 million policyholders) of the program's total number of policyholders.", "Under the Biggert-Waters Act, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) began imposing premium rates based on the property's \"elevation rate,\" which, in turn, is based on the property's lowest floor elevation relative to the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) for existing homes and businesses built prior to the community's initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Since 1973, these so-called pre-FIRM structures had been shielded from higher premium rates. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-448; 82 Stat. 572) included a provision for subsidizing pre-FIRM structures by charging less than full risk-based premiums for flood insurance because their construction took place before the application of the NFIP construction standards. These structures are also exempt from the NFIP's mitigation requirements unless they become substantially damaged or substantially improved.", "Thus, with the elevation of the property now being a factor in the rating process, owners of certain properties\u2014that is, those property owners with federally insured mortgages residing in government-designated, flood-prone areas\u2014now face relatively larger flood insurance premium rate increases. Importantly, this transition toward full-risk premium rates for generally older and more risky properties has occurred before FEMA's completion of a congressionally mandated affordability study", "The impact of moving to full-risk premiums by eliminating the pre-FIRM premium subsidies, as required by the Biggert-Waters Act, is being felt in virtually all 21,000 NFIP communities across the nation. The impact of elimination of the subsidies on non-principle residential properties (i.e., second homes), business properties, and new or lapsed policies has been particularly felt in communities with a relatively high proportion of high-risk flood-prone pre-FIRM properties. In addition to its impact on property owners, the elimination of the subsidy affects local community economic development as well as debates concerning how to equitably distribute the burden of recovering from flood events.", "Opponents of eliminating subsidized rates argue that the Biggert-Waters Act does not explicitly address the affordability concerns of existing policyholders in high-risk flood zones and FEMA does not have sufficient data on policyholders' ability to pay; however, the agency has begun implementing sharply higher flood insurance rates for some policyholders.", "Proponents of eliminating subsidized rates maintain that Congress explicitly found that ensuring the long-term financial stability of the NFIP is in the public interest and the Biggert-Waters law seeks to further this goal by transitioning subsidized rates to actual risk-based rates. Removal of premium subsidies and grandfathered policies would reduce taxpayer costs associated with a fiscally unsound government insurance program while reducing the arguably hidden financial incentives that encourage building in flood-prone and environmental sensitive coastal areas.", "The key policy questions facing Congress with respect to the post-reform NFIP issues include", "addressing the affordability issue; deciding whether, how, and when to privatize flood risk; exploring options for improving flood risk analysis and maps; and finding innovative new approaches to financing the nation's increasing exposure to hurricane-induced catastrophic floods and coastal hazards.", "On January 17, 2014, President Barack Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (Division F, Title V, Section 572 of P.L. 113-76), that prohibits FEMA from implementing Section 100207 (the \"grandfather\" provision) of the Biggert-Waters Act, codified at Section 1308(h) of the 1968 Act, during FY2014.

The program collects about $3.5 billion in annual premium revenue. According to FEMA, the program saves the nation an estimated $1.6 billion annually in flood losses avoided because of the NFIP's building and floodplain management regulations.", "Flood insurance premium rates were initially set \"based on consideration of the risk involved and accepted actuarial principles.\" In 1973, Congress amended the 1968 Act to: (1) authorize FEMA to set rates at less than full-risk rates, which FEMA refers to as subsidized rates, and (2) prohibit FEMA from offering subsidized rates to properties that were constructed or substantially improved after December 31, 1974, or after the date upon which FEMA published the first Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, whichever was later. Therefore, by statute, premium rates charged on pre-FIRM structures are explicitly lower than what would be expected to cover expected costs. ", "The availability of subsidized flood insurance was intended to allow floodplain residents to contribute in some measure to pre-funding their recovery from a flood disaster instead of relying solely on federal disaster assistance. In essence, insurance could distribute the financial burden among those protected by flood insurance and the public. However, the statute's provision creates an inability to collect the full risk-based premiums on about 1.1 million of the program's 5.6 million policies and has, arguably, eroded the program's long-term ability to pay future claims made by all policyholders. ", "The actuarial shortfall from charging less than full-risk (or actuarial premiums) has drawn greater scrutiny as a result of (1) the catastrophic flood events from 2005 through 2012, (2) uncertainty surrounding future flood risk, especially in coastal hazard areas, and (3) the budgetary consequences of frequent ad-hoc emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief on the deficit and the program's solvency. ", "Prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the NFIP had been able to cover its cost, borrowing relatively small amounts from the U.S. Treasury to pay claims, and then repaying the loans with interests. However, in the wake of the unexpected need for significant intergovernmental borrowing from the U.S. Treasury to pay claims, and the recognition among policymakers of the nation's increasing vulnerability to hurricane-induced catastrophic flood events in coastal hazard areas, Congress passed legislation in 2012 to address the program's long-term solvency.

Flood risk is highly uncertain and potentially catastrophic in nature.

Moreover, before Congress passed Section 572 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-76 ) to prohibit FEMA from implementing the phase-out of grandfathered policies, FEMA expected that another 715,000 policies (i.e., primary residence homes) would have been affected in 2014; however, this phase-out still occurs immediately if the policy lapses or if the home is sold. The availability of flood insurance provides communities leverage to adopt and enforce NFIP flood mitigation requirements. However, the leverage could be diminished by adopting an actuarial rating for all pre-FIRM non-principal residences, all non-residential properties, and properties whose ownership changes or the owner refinanced a mortgage. Eliminating FEMA's policy of grandfathering properties in a previous zone or elevation class is also of concern to property owners and local communities. The adverse effects of elevation rating could be mitigated if the property owner obtains and submit an elevation certificate to FEMA. P roperty values and property tax revenues .

Some of the key differences in H.R. 3370 and S. 1926 include", "1. H.R. 3370 takes a different approach, compared to S. 1926 , to addressing flood insurance affordability. It would: a. Permit premium subsidies on policies covering properties not insured (as of July 6, 2012), or new purchases after July 6, 2012, by repealing 42 U.S.C Section 4014(g(1) and (2)) that requires the Administrator of FEMA to not permit premium subsidies for such new policies. b. Repeal Section 100207 of the Biggert-Waters Act that phases-out grandfathered policies. c. Allow purchasers of a property that, as of the date of such purchase, is covered under an existing flood insurance policy to assume the existing policy and coverage at subsidized rates for the remainder of the term of the policy. The subsidized rates would continue until the later of (1) the expiration of the assumed policy, or (2) implementation of the full Act by the Administrator. d. Authorize the Administrator of FEMA to create a flood insurance policy that offers the insured the option of a high loss-deductible policy to cover property in various amounts, up to and including $10,000. By opting for the higher annual loss deductible, the policyholder could presumably take advantage of lower expected premium rates. In contrast, S. 1926 would delay the rate increases required under the Biggert-Waters Act. e. Reduce the annual premium rate increase that FEMA could charge from 20% to 15%, but not less than 5% of the average of the risk premium rates for such properties. 2. H.R. 3370 would also: a. Refund annual premiums of policyholders who have paid the new premium rates that became effective January 1, 2012, and October 1, 2013. b. Impose and collect a new premium surcharge of $25 each year for residential properties and $250 each year for non-residential properties. c. Implement a flood mapping approach for the NFIP that, when applied, results in technically credible flood hazard data in all areas where FIRMs are issued whereas S. 1926 requires this as a condition to allow the expiration of the rate freeze. d. Permit FEMA to transfer flood risk to private reinsurers and the capital market at rates and on terms determined by the Administration to be reasonable and appropriate, in an amount sufficient to maintain the ability of the program to pay claims. e. Allow states to regulate private flood insurance. 3. H.R. 3370 does not include language to create the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers. 4. Section 103 of S. 1926 would delay implementation of Section 1308(h) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, regarding premium adjustments to reflect current risk of flood, until FEMA meets specific requirements.

This affordability issue has raised congressional concerns about the cost effectiveness of balancing affordability against the need to ensure the NFIP's long-term fiscal solvency. Policy makers might also consider innovative approaches to minimize future flood damages. For example, Congress might examine ways to strengthen FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) programs that provide funds for projects that reduce the risk to individuals and property from natural hazards. Under the FEMA HMA program, local community officials develop projects that reduce flood damage and submit grant applications to the states\u2014and eventually FEMA for funding.

Resolving the actuarial, financial, and social tensions surrounding the affordability of flood insurance coverage would arguably require a three-pronged approach to policy analysis.", "The first policy analysis approach is to determine the scope of the affordability problem associated with the transition toward full-risk rates. In other words, could existing and potential policyholders afford the higher actuarial rates? But how do policy makers determine what is affordable and at what level of income? To address these policy questions, policy makers might choose to consider best practices in quantifying and mapping flood risks, including risk that accounts for future conditions, where to assign the risk (using \"Elevation Rating\" methods), and what behavior should be changed to reduce future flood losses and, thereby, strengthen the NFIP's long-term financial solvency. ", "The second policy analysis approach to addressing the affordability issue could be to find ways to reconcile the NFIP's long-standing ratemaking procedures that distinguished between the full-risk rated actuarial premiums paid and the subsidy premium amounts that will be eliminated to address the long-term solvency of the NFIP. Given the expected increases in premium rates associated with pre-FIRM structures when elevation is used in the calculation, it is questionable whether means-tested vouchers designed to address the affordability concerns of low- to moderate-income households might be sufficient to make the insurance policies marketable. Traditional principles of insurance suggest that for an insurance market to exist the policy must be marketable to policyholders\u2014that is, people who want to purchase the coverage and have the financial means to do so.
