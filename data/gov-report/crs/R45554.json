{"id": "R45554", "title": "Considerations for Implementing a Small Business Disaster Grant Program", "released_date": "2019-02-26T00:00:00", "summary": ["Throughout the years, Congress has expressed interest and concern for businesses recovering from disasters. For nearly a century, the federal government's policy for providing disaster assistance to businesses has been limited primarily to low interest loans rather than grant assistance. More recently, Congress has contemplated whether grants should be made available to small businesses after a major disaster. During this debate, some have questioned why small businesses are not eligible for disaster grants when residences, nonprofit groups, and state and local governments are eligible. In addition to concerns about equity, proponents of small business disaster grants argue that small businesses should be eligible for grant assistance because of the important role they play in the national economy. Major disasters can severely disrupt economic activity by causing immediate losses of output, income, and employment. While reports vary on the number of small businesses that fail after a disaster, even the low estimates could be considered significant. The Institute for Business and Home Safety found that 25% of businesses that close following a disaster fail to reopen, and a study on businesses in New Orleans recovering from Hurricane Katrina found that 12% of businesses remained closed 26 months after the storm. The number of failing businesses after a disaster reported by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are higher. According to FEMA, \"roughly 40%-60% of small businesses never reopen their doors following a disaster.\"", "To some, these findings suggest that the federal government should play a greater role in business disaster recovery. As part of this expanded role, Congress could consider providing grants to businesses to help them rebuild and recover from disasters. Changing the federal government's approach to business disaster policy, however, could be complex and require some careful decisionmaking. Steps would need to be taken to avoid and remedy potential grant and loan duplication. Congress would also have to determine under what circumstances and situations the grant program would be put into effect. Eligibility requirements would need to be developed to determine under what situations and circumstances grants would be provided as well as what types of businesses should be eligible to receive grants. Similarly, Congress might consider whether grants could be used for rebuilding, mitigation, or economic loss, in addition to other recovery activities. In addition to these concerns and others, Congress may want to investigate the potential cost implications of a small business disaster grant program.", "This report examines the historical development of federal disaster assistance to help explain possible reasons why businesses are currently provided disaster loans rather than grants. This is followed by a discussion of policy considerations and options related to a potential disaster grant program for small businesses, including", "how to minimize duplication of operations and benefits; whether to authorize the program in the Small Business Act, the Stafford Act, or other statute; the potential cost implications of a small business disaster grant program; and eligibility requirements (such as business size standards, eligible activities, and grant award amounts).", "Alternatively, Congress could explore other policy options to support small businesses struggling to recover from a disaster, including", "loan forgiveness; decreased interest rates; and establishing programs to help small (and large) businesses develop disaster and business continuity plans."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , hereinafter the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to issue a major disaster declaration in response to natural or man-made incidents that overwhelm state, local, or tribal capacities. The declaration makes a wide range of federal activities available to support state and local efforts to respond and recover from the incident. Major disaster declarations also authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grant assistance to state, local, and tribal governments, residences, and certain private nonprofit (PNP) facilities that provide critical services. ", "Businesses that suffer uninsured loss as a result of a major disaster declaration are not eligible for FEMA grant assistance, and grant assistance from other federal sources is limited. On some occasions, Congress has provided assistance to businesses through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The CDBG program provides loans and grants to eligible businesses to help them recover from disasters as well as grants intended to attract new businesses to the disaster-stricken area. In a few cases, CDBG has also been used to compensate businesses and workers for lost wages or revenues. CDBG assistance, however, is not available for all major disasters. Rather, it is used by Congress on a case-by-case basis in response to large-scale disasters. The United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce are also authorized to provide assistance to certain types of businesses such as agricultural producers or fisheries. While these programs are important sources of assistance following a disaster, they are generally limited in scope (available for only certain types of businesses) or provide limited grant amounts. Most businesses will need to apply for a Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan if they want assistance from the federal government for uninsured loss resulting from a disaster.", "SBA is authorized to provide grants to SBA resource partners, including Small Business Development Centers, Women's Business Centers, and SCORE (formerly the Service Corps of Retired Executives), to provide training and other technical assistance to small businesses affected by a disaster, but is not authorized to provide direct grant assistance to businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of SBA Business Disaster Loans", "paragraphs": ["As indicated above, federal assistance to businesses that suffer uninsured loss as a result of a disaster is mainly limited to SBA disaster loans.

Alternatively, Congress might implement a small business disaster grant program and continue to provide loan assistance through the SBA.

Small agricultural cooperatives and most private and nonprofit organizations that have suffered substantial economic injury as the result of a declared disaster are also eligible for EIDLs.", "Businesses can secure both an EIDL and a Business Physical Disaster loan to rebuild, repair, and recover from economic loss.

According to FEMA, \"roughly 40-60% of small businesses fail to reopen following a disaster.\" The Institute for Business and Home Safety found that 25% of businesses that close following a disaster never reopen. Businesses that do recover often take a long time to resume operations. A study on businesses in New Orleans recovering from Hurricane Katrina found that 12% of businesses remained closed 26 months after the storm. The same study indicated that smaller businesses had lower reopening probabilities than larger ones. And while SBA provides low-interest disaster loans with loan maturities up to 30 years for uninsured loss, some see a 30-year loan as an additional burden to full recovery. Finally, proponents argue that the need to recover and reopen quickly is not only important to small businesses\u2014it is also important to local governments because they rely on these businesses for tax revenue. Congress could use small business disaster grants to help vulnerable businesses recover and rebuild following a disaster. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Protecting the Economy", "paragraphs": ["Advocates could also argue that grant assistance could help counteract negative economic outcomes associated with disasters by helping businesses keep people employed and recover from economic loss. When major disasters take place, they not only cause immense damage to public infrastructure, they also severely damage the stock of private capital and disrupt economic activity. The typical economic pattern following large-scale disasters consists of large immediate losses of output, income, and employment. Small businesses play a significant role in the national economy. For example, in 2013, small businesses employed 56.8 million people (48% of the private workforce) in the United States. These small firms accounted for 33.6% of the nation's total known export value and produced roughly 46% of the nation's nonfarm gross domestic product (GDP). ", "Opponents of a small business disaster grant program could point out, however, that studies suggest that market mechanisms may restore economic order without grant assistance. According to these studies, the long-term economic benefits of rebuilding from a major disaster can offset their initial economic disruption. For example, research on Hurricane Sandy recovery found that the storm initially resulted in net negative effects on state GDP, employment, income, and tax revenues. According to the study, spending on large-scale cleanup and repair efforts not only offset, but exceeded the initial economic negative effects.

Advocates for small business disaster grants might counter argue that other sectors are also responsible for insurance coverage yet are still eligible for grant assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Implications", "paragraphs": ["Opponents could also argue that providing disaster grants to small businesses could be very expensive. SBA disaster loans are designed to be repaid, and though the interest rates are relatively low and some of these loans are not repaid due to defaults, the cost to the federal government for providing loans is much less than the cost of providing grants. Grants are not repaid to the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Stafford Act", "paragraphs": ["As discussed later in this report, opponents might consider the Stafford Act to be an inappropriate vehicle for providing disaster assistance to businesses. To support this argument, they would point out that Section 101(b) of the Stafford Act states that it \"is the intent of the Congress, by this Act, to provide an orderly and continuing means of assistance by the federal government to state and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage which result from such disasters....\" They may therefore conclude that if the federal government were to provide disaster grants to businesses, those grants should be provided under the Small Business Act or some other authorization statute.

A review of congressional hearings, bill reports, agency reports, academic journals, and other authoritative sources did not identify specific language explaining why Congress distinguishes between the types of disaster assistance that should be provided to businesses while not applying the same restrictions to other sectors.", "It appears that current federal policy on business disaster assistance first emerged in the 1930s. At that time, the United States had no overarching federal disaster policy or permanent program in place to respond to major disasters. Response, repair, and recovery activities were generally organized and carried out under local auspices and financial assistance was typically provided by states, municipalities, churches, and other nonprofit organizations such as the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. When Congress did provide financial assistance, it was generally on an ad hoc basis. Further, Congress wanted the measures limited to relieving \"human distress and for such things as food, clothing, shelter, medicine and hospitalization\" rather the reconstruction of buildings, businesses, or anything else. ", "The Great Depression also heightened concerns about federal costs. Thus, Congress sought to keep federal costs to a minimum by limiting assistance to individuals and households, and, to the extent possible, returning the federal expenditures back to the Treasury. ", "For example, in 1933, Congress debated whether to provide funding to the American Red Cross (the main source of disaster assistance at that time) in response to an earthquake in Long Beach California. The Red Cross sought the funding because it could not meet assistance needs through its traditional fundraising efforts. Businesses, which were already struggling because of the Great Depression, suffered a great deal of damage as a result of the incident. While sympathetic to struggling businesses, Congress was resolute that federal assistance for the earthquake be limited to immediate needs such as food and clothing. During a hearing before the Subcommittee of House Committee on Appropriations, the Vice Chairman in charge of Domestic Operations for the American Red Cross clarified that Red Cross did not have a role in business recovery:", "There will always arise the question as to business rehabilitation, businesses and factories that have been affected. Then, there is the question of the solvency or insolvency of public corporations, schools, school boards, and so forth, and the replacement of their losses. For that reason I made the statement at the outset delimiting the scope of Red Cross work to family problems as against those of business and government.", "Congress decided that it would make disaster loans available to nonprofit organizations with loan maturities not to exceed 10 years through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). The restriction that limited loans to nonprofit organizations was removed in 1936, and RFC was \"authorized to make disaster loans to corporations, partnerships, individuals, and municipalities or other political subdivisions of states and territories.\" The RFC continued to make disaster loans available until Congress dissolved the RFC and transferred its disaster loan authority to SBA in 1953 (P.L. 83-163). ", "Around the same time, Congress passed the Federal Disaster Relief Act of 1950 (P.L. 81-875). The Disaster Relief Act established a permanent authority that committed the federal government to provide specific types of assistance to states and localities (but not businesses) following a major disaster declaration. It appears that the creation of a separate authority to provide assistance to states and localities may have placed them on a separate policy trajectory from businesses. Though interlaced to a degree, assistance to businesses remained in the form of loans, while the scope and nature of federal assistance to other entities expanded as the Disaster Relief Act was amended in the 1960s, 1970s, and replaced in the 1980s by the Stafford Act.

For example, in his testimony before the Subcommittee, Representative Steve King of Iowa stated that \"we have structured ... federal government relief in grant form for every sector of our economy ... except for private enterprise, and the ones that are the most vulnerable are small businesses.\" Later in the hearing, Chairwoman Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, DC, asked: \"how are we to convince for the first time since the Stafford Act was passed ...

The selection and authorization debate could, to some extent, resemble policy discussions Congress had during FEMA's formation. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed Executive Order 12127 which merged many disaster-related responsibilities of separate federal agencies into FEMA. Congress determined that SBA would continue to provide disaster loans through the Disaster Loan Program rather than transfer that function to FEMA. At the 1978 hearing before a subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations, Chairman Jack Brooks questioned the rationale for keeping the loan program outside of FEMA. According to James T. McIntyre, Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the rationale was as follows:", "[O]ne of the fundamental principles underlying this proposal is that whenever possible emergency responsibilities should be an extension of the regular missions of federal agencies. I believe the Congress also subscribed to this principle in considering disaster legislation in the past. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 provides for the direction and coordination, in disaster situations, of agencies which have programs which can be applied to meeting disaster needs. It does not provide that the coordinating agency should exercise direct operational control.... [I]f the programs ... were incorporated in the new agency we would be required to create duplicate sets of skills and resources.... [S]ince the Small Business Administration administers loan programs other than those just for disaster victims, both the SBA and the new agency [FEMA] would have to maintain separate staffs of loan officers and portfolio managers if the disaster loan function were transferred to the new Agency.... [O]ne of our basic purposes for reorganization ... would be thwarted if we were to have to maintain a duplicate staff function in two or more agencies.", "Similarly, Congress may consider whether issuing small business disaster grants either through FEMA or SBA would duplicate skills and resources in one or the other agency.

The criterion used to determine whether to issue this type of declaration is generally the presence of at least 25 homes or businesses (or some combination of the two) that have sustained uninsured losses of 40% or more in any county or other smaller political subdivision of a state or U.S. possession. When the SBA Administrator issues a physical disaster declaration, both SBA disaster loan types become available to eligible homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofit organizations within the disaster area or contiguous counties and other political subdivisions (see Figure 1 ). If SBA physical disaster declarations were to be applied to a small business disaster grant program, the grants could be made available to small businesses for incidents that do not meet the damage threshold of a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. 2. The SBA Administrator may make an EIDL declaration when SBA receives a certification from a state governor that at least five small businesses have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of a disaster. Alternatively, the SBA Administrator may issue an EIDL declaration based on the determination of a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture. The SBA Administrator may also issue an EIDL declaration based on the determination of the Secretary of Commerce that a fishery resource disaster or commercial fishery failure has occurred. Only EIDLs are available under this type of declaration (see Figure 1 ). EIDL assistance helps businesses meet financial obligations and operating expenses that could have been met had the disaster not occurred. Loan proceeds can only be used for working capital necessary to enable the business or organization to alleviate the specific economic injury and to resume normal operations. The assistance is designed to help businesses that did not suffer direct damages, but rather businesses that have suffered economic loss as a result of an incident. For example, disasters such as hurricanes can disrupt tourism. In such cases, there may have been some businesses that did not suffer direct damages, but still lost tourism revenue as a result of the hurricane. If EIDL declarations were to be applied to a small business disaster grant program, the grants could be used to provide similar economic assistance to businesses suffering from economic loss as a result of a disaster. ", "A comparison of Stafford Act declarations (including designations) and SBA declarations from 2008 to 2017 provides context to the SBA declarations outlined above. As shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 , during this period, 2,869 declarations were issued under the Stafford Act and the Small Business Act. A total of 791 declarations were issued under the Stafford Act. Of these, 194 (6.8% of total declarations) included IA and PA assistance, while 597 (20.8% of total declarations) were PA-only. ", "In contrast, during the same period, a total of 2,078 (72.4%) declarations were issued under the Small Business Act. Of these, 512 (17.8% of total declarations) were SBA physical disaster declarations, 97 (3.4%) were EIDL declarations, and 1,469 (51.2%) were EIDL declarations based on the determination of a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture. There were no declarations issued during the 10-year period based on the determination of the Secretary of Commerce that a fishery resource disaster or commercial fishery failure had occurred.", "The following applies various types of declarations and designations to a potential small business disaster grant program to the above data to draw some inferences on how many businesses might get grants in certain situations.", "If the small business disaster grant program is only triggered by Stafford Act declarations that designate IA and PA, then roughly 6.8% of the declarations (194) issued in Figure 2 and Table 1 would have made disaster grants available to small businesses. That could be a concern for those who want to provide small business grants for incidents that are too small to qualify for assistance under the Stafford Act. As mentioned previously, SBA declarations often provide assistance to incidents that impact a locality or a region but do not cause enough state-wide damage to warrant a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. If the small business disaster grant program is triggered by the SBA Administrator issuing a physical disaster declaration, then roughly 17% of the declarations (512) issued in Figure 2 and Table 1 would have made disaster grants available to small businesses. This type of declaration could arguably make more incidents eligible for grant assistance because the 512 incidents in Figure 2 and Table 1 were presumably issued for incidents that did not meet the per capita threshold for a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. It should be noted, however, that the number of grants made available under an SBA Administrator physical disaster declaration would likely depend on whether the grants would only provide assistance for repairing and rebuilding damaged structure or if they would also provide assistance for economic loss. Policymakers could consider making the grants available through either an SBA Administrator physical declaration or an EIDL declaration so that the grants could be used for repairs and rebuilding or for economic loss. If so, then 2,078 declarations during the time period could have made the small business disaster grants available. It could be argued that the greatest number of businesses would benefit from small business disaster grants by applying the existing declaration framework under the combined authorities and making the grants available for either physical damages or economic loss. In other words, the same conditions under which SBA disaster loans are made available. Doing so would make small business disaster grants available in all of the declarations in Figure 2 and Table 1 with the exception of the PA-only Stafford Act declarations, under which only private nonprofit organizations are eligible (see Figure 1 ). ", "While some may favor making small business disaster grants available for a wide-range of incidents others may want to limit their use. For example, those concerned about the cost implications of a small business disaster grant program may prefer Stafford Act declarations over SBA declarations. As mentioned previously, the thresholds used to determine SBA declarations are lower and generally based on (1) at least 25 homes or businesses (or some combination of the two) sustaining uninsured losses of 40% or more in any county or other smaller political subdivision of a state or U.S. possession; or (2) at least three businesses in the disaster area sustaining uninsured losses of 40% or more of the estimated fair replacement value of the damaged property (whichever is lower). The lower thresholds help provide disaster loans for incidents that are locally damaging, but do not cause enough widespread damage to warrant a major disaster declaration.", "In contrast, the threshold used by FEMA under the Stafford Act to a recommend major disaster declaration is significantly higher. In general, public infrastructure damages must meet or exceed $1.43 per capita (based on the most recent census figures) to be recommended for major disaster assistance. Applying the per capita threshold to a small business disaster grant program could help ensure that grants are only provided in cases of large-scale disasters.", "SBA declaration thresholds might be lower than FEMA thresholds because federal costs associated with loans (which are supposed to be repaid) are less than grants. If costs are a concern, policymakers might consider using criteria similar to FEMA's per capita threshold used for major disaster declarations to issue small business disaster grants. ", "Finally, another factor to consider is whether the declaration is properly aligned with the agency administering the small business disaster grant program. For example, it could be problematic if small business disaster grants are triggered by SBA declarations but administered by FEMA. SBA would essentially be putting another agency's program into effect. Consequently, it could be argued that a small business disaster grant program should be administered by FEMA if Stafford Act declarations are used to trigger the program, or administered by SBA if SBA declarations are used to put the program into effect.

", "In addition, if Congress decided to allow disaster grants to be used for mitigation, Congress could consider whether to provide the grant prior to a disaster or without a declaration. For example, Congress could model small business mitigation grants on the Pre-Disaster Mitigation pilot program. P.L. 106-24 amended Section 7(b)(1) of the Small Business Act to include a Pre-Disaster Mitigation pilot program administered by SBA during fiscal years 2000 through 2004. The program allowed SBA to make low-interest (4% or less) fixed-rate loans of no more than $50,000 per year to small businesses to implement mitigation measures (such as relocating utilities, grading, and building retaining or sea walls) designed to protect the small business from future disaster-related damage.

One option could be using SBA's size standards. ", "The SBA uses two measures to determine if a business qualifies as small for its loan guaranty and venture capital programs: industry specific size standards or a combination of the business's net worth and net income. For example, the SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program allows businesses to qualify as small if they meet the SBA's size standard for the industry in which the applicant is primarily engaged, or a maximum tangible net worth of not more than $19.5 million and average after-tax net income for the preceding two years of not more than $6.5 million. All of the company's subsidiaries, parent companies, and affiliates are considered in determining if it meets the size standard. For contracting purposes, firms are considered small if they meet the SBA's industry specific size standards. Overall, the SBA currently classifies about 97% of all employer firms as small. These firms represent about 30% of industry receipts.", "The SBA's industry size standards vary by industry, and are based on one of the following four measures: the firm's (1) average annual receipts in the previous three years, (2) number of employees, (3) asset size, or (4) for refineries, a combination of number of employees and barrel per day refining capacity. Historically, the SBA has used the number of employees (ranging from 50 or fewer to no more than 1,500 employees) to determine if manufacturing and mining companies are small and average annual receipts (ranging from no more than $5.5 million per year to no more than $38.5 million per year) for most other industries. ", "Congress, however, may want to limit disaster grant assistance to small businesses that have fewer employees that are particularly vulnerable to disaster. For example, it could consider providing grants only to businesses of 10 or fewer employees to target \"mom and pop shops.\" As mentioned previously, H.R. 6641 (the Small Business Owner Disaster Relief Act of 2008) would have allowed businesses with 25 or fewer employees to receive grants to repair, restore, or replace damage facilities. Based on data compiled by SBA on business disaster loan applications from FY2013 to FY2017, Figure 3 provides a rough estimate of how many businesses over a five-year period could potentially receive a small business disaster grant under several different size standards.", "Based on the FY2013 through FY2017 SBA data, if small business disaster grants were limited to businesses of 10 employees or fewer, roughly 10,000 businesses over a five-year period could be eligible for a small business disaster grant. Over that same time period, nearly 11,000 small businesses could be eligible if the cap were 25 employees or fewer employees. That number would not change substantially if the cap were 50, 75, or 100 or fewer employees (see Figure 3 ).", "Finally, SBA applications for disaster loans currently rely on self-reporting of their number of employees.

", "On the other hand, it could be argued that providing relief to businesses through reduced interest rates or loan forgiveness as opposed to grants may not provide timely assistance because providing relief on a case-by-case basis would require Congress to debate and pass legislation before the relief could be provided.

The first threshold is $1 million in public infrastructure damages. This threshold is set \"in the belief that even the lowest population states can cover this level of public assistance damages.\"", "The second threshold used by FEMA is determined by multiplying the state's population (according to the most recent census) by a specified statewide per capita impact indicator\u2014currently $1.43. In general, FEMA will recommend a major disaster declaration that includes PA if public infrastructure damages exceed $1 million and meet or exceed $1.43 per capita. The underlying rationale for using a per capita threshold is that tax revenues that support a state's disaster response capacity should be sufficient if damages and costs fall under the per capita amount.", "Localized Impacts", "FEMA also considers impacts to localities (e.g., counties, parishes, boroughs). While capacity to respond to, and recover from, an incident are evaluated on the state level, PA and IA are provided only to the specific counties designated in a declaration. As specified in FEMA regulations", "The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate also has been delegated authority to designate the affected areas eligible for supplementary federal assistance under the Stafford Act. These designations shall be published in the Federal Register. An affected area designated by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate includes all local government jurisdictions within its boundaries.", "To this end, FEMA uses a countywide per capita impact indicator of $3.61 per capita in infrastructure damage to assess localized impacts. In general, it is expected that a locality that meets or exceeds the $3.61 per capita threshold will be designated by FEMA for PA funding.", "Insurance Coverage", "Insurance coverage is considered in PA determinations when reviewing a governor's or tribal chief executive's request for major disaster assistance. As part of the assessment of disaster related damage, FEMA subtracts the amount of insurance coverage that is in force or that should have been in force as required by law and regulation at the time of the disaster from the total estimated eligible cost of PA for units of government and certain private nonprofit organizations.", "Hazard Mitigation", "FEMA encourages hazard mitigation efforts by considering how previous measures may have decreased the overall damages and costs following an incident. This could include rewarding states that have a statewide building code. If the requesting state can prove, by way of cost-benefit analyses or other related estimates, that its per capita amount of infrastructure damage falls short of the statewide per capita impact threshold due to mitigation efforts, FEMA will consider that favorably in its recommendation to the President. In these instances, FEMA may also consider whether the mitigation work has been principally financed with previous FEMA disaster assistance funding through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), through the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, or by state or local resources.", "Recent Multiple Disasters", "If a state or tribal nation has suffered multiple disasters\u2014whether declared or not\u2014in the previous 12 months, FEMA considers the financial and human toll of those recent incidents in its consideration of whether to recommend PA. For example, if a state has responded on its own to a series of tornadoes, FEMA may consider a request for a declaration more favorably than they would have otherwise.", "Programs of Other Federal Assistance", "FEMA also considers whether other federal disaster assistance is available when reviewing a major disaster request. In some cases, other federal programs are arguably more suitable for addressing the types of damage caused by an incident. For example, damage to federal-aid roads and bridges are eligible for assistance under the Emergency Relief Program of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Other federal programs may have more specific authority to respond to certain types of disasters, such as damage to agricultural areas. Assistance may also be provided under authorities separate from the Stafford Act with or without a Stafford Act declaration. For example, assistance for droughts is frequently provided through authorities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) can provide assistance to states in response to a public health threat without the President's involvement via Stafford Act authorities. ", "Individual Assistance Factors", "Concentration of Damages", "According to FEMA regulations, highly concentrated damages \"generally indicate a greater need for federal assistance than widespread and scattered damages throughout a state.\" The assumption that underlies this regulation is that the local support networks available to recover from an incident are increasingly undermined as more members of those local support networks become survivors of the incident. The dispersion of damage, however, is not necessarily an indication of total individual and household needs. Rural incidents, in particular, can be more difficult to assess because damages tend to be geographically less concentrated. As mentioned under the factors considered for PA, Congress has sought to address the challenges posed by rural incidents in receiving major disaster declarations and assistance packages.", "Trauma", "FEMA regulations cite three conditions that indicate a high degree of trauma to a community: (1) large numbers of injuries and deaths; (2) large-scale disruption of normal community functions and services; and (3) emergency needs such as extended or widespread loss of power or water.", "FEMA considers the trauma caused by injuries and loss of life in determining whether IA, or specific programs under IA, is warranted in an affected area. For IA-eligible medical and funeral expenses under Section 408 of the Stafford Act, this factor can carry some weight in making a determination. ", "Large-scale disruption of normal community functions and emergency needs such as extended or widespread loss of power or water are also indicative of trauma and are considered when evaluating a governor's or chief executive's request. Assessing these indicators can be problematic because they are not currently defined in law or regulation. Consequently, discretionary judgments are significant aspects of the evaluation of IA needs for large-scale disruptions of normal community functions and extended or widespread emergency needs.", "Special Populations", "FEMA considers the unique needs of certain demographic groups within an affected area when evaluating an IA request. These \"special populations\" include low-income and elderly populations, and American Indian and Alaskan Native tribal populations. Although special populations are a distinct factor in the consideration of a governor's or chief executive's request, special populations may also contribute to the overall number of IA-eligible households in an affected area.", "Voluntary Agency Assistance ", "As with PA, FEMA considers whether state, local, or tribal governments \"can meet the needs of disaster victims\" prior to offering supplemental assistance through IA. Additionally for IA, FEMA considers the extent to which voluntary agency assistance can meet those needs.", "Insurance", "Similar to insurance coverage of public and certain private, nonprofit facilities for PA, insurance coverage of private residences is an important consideration for IA. Per FEMA regulation, \"by law, federal disaster assistance cannot duplicate insurance coverage .\" Therefore, the calculation of IA-eligible losses must deduct those losses covered by insurance.", "FEMA assumes owner-occupied homes with a mortgage are insured against many natural disasters under their homeowner insurance policies. Under that assumption, FEMA uses census data to determine homeowner insurance penetration. Further, if the home is located in a flood - prone area then purchasing insurance for those disasters is often a legal requirement if the owner h as a federally-backed mortgage. FEMA administers the N ational F lood I nsurance P rogram (NFIP) which allows officials to more directly determine the status of flood insurance in communities and the number of policies in place in an affected area.

More specifically, regulations published in 1999 include a table of the average amount of IA per disaster, by state population, from July 1994 to July 1999 (reproduced as Table A-1 ). FEMA stresses that these averages are not to be used as thresholds but rather as a guide that \"may prove useful to states and voluntary agencies as they develop plans and programs to meet the needs of disaster victims.\" It should be noted that some have questioned the relevance of this factor given the amounts have not been updated since 1999 and are based on 1990 census data."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
