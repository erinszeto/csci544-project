Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region, with about 68% of the world's HIV-positive population, 90% of all HIV-infected children, and more than 11 million children who have lost one or both parents to the virus. UNAIDS anticipates that in 2007, about 420,000 children will contract HIV, due in large part to inadequate access to drugs that prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission; about 8% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries have access to PMTCT services.", "In January 2003, President George Bush proposed that the United States spend $15 billion over five years to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The President proposed concentrating most of the resources ($9 billion) in 15 countries, where the Administration estimated 50% of all HIV-positive people lived. The proposal allotted $5 billion of the funds to research and other bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, and $1 billion for contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund). The President estimated that from FY2004 to FY2008, PEPFAR funds would support the purchase of anti-retroviral treatments (ARV) for 2 million people; the prevention of 7 million HIV infections; and care for 10 million people affected by HIV/AIDS, including children orphaned by AIDS.", "In May 2003, Congress passed the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-25), which authorized funds for PEPFAR and created the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) to manage U.S. funds aimed at addressing the three diseases in 15 Focus Countries. As of March 31, 2007, PEPFAR has supported the treatment of 1.1 million people; and as of September 30, 2006, supported PMTCT service provision during more than 6 million pregnancies and facilitated care for nearly 4.5 million people, including more than 2 million orphans and vulnerable children. From FY2004 to FY2007, Congress provided nearly $13.5 billion for U.S. global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. In FY2008, the President requested $5.8 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts; the House and Senate proposed spending almost $6.2 billion and nearly $6.1 billion, respectively.", "On May 30, 2007, President Bush requested that Congress authorize $30 billion to fund PEPFAR an additional five years. The President asserts that from FY2009 to FY2013, the plan would support treatment for 2.5 million people, prevent more than 12 million new infections, and care for more than 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children. Supporters of the Administration's plan applauded the President and congratulated him for leading global efforts to address HIV/AIDS. Critics asserted that PEPFAR could treat more than 2.5 million HIV-infected people and that PEPFAR's spending requirements should be eliminated.

Research has shown that in Africa, married girls and women are more likely to contract HIV than their single counterparts. For example, 30% of married adolescents' spouses were HIV-positive in Kenya, while 11.5% of the partners of their unmarried counterparts were infected with HIV. Similarly, in Zambia, 31.6% of married girls' partners were found to carry HIV, while 16.8% of unmarried girls' boyfriends were HIV-positive.

WHO and UNAIDS have endorsed the practice to be added to HIV prevention initiatives. The organizations warn, however, that the practice should not be seen as a \"magic bullet,\" as it does not prevent men from acquiring the virus, it only reduces the risk of infection. As a result, health experts urge those who perform the surgeries to counsel the men and explain that they must maintain other protective practices, such as abstaining from sex, reducing their number of sexual partners, and using condoms.", "Some observers argue that the studies should not yet be widely embraced, particularly since only a few trials have been conducted. A number of scientists question the validity of the studies since they were terminated early; a practice, critics contend, that skews the results. Dissenters argue that there may be other explanations for the drop in transmission. Skeptics contend that circumcision reduces the incidence of genital symptoms, allowing men to receive fewer unsafe injections and other blood exposures during treatment. Also, in sub-Saharan Africa, circumcised virgins and adolescents are reportedly more likely to be HIV-infected than their uncircumcised counterparts. Researchers suspect that unhygienic circumcision procedures might be a large factor in this phenomenon.", "Critics and advocates of the practice agree that additional studies need to be conducted and a number of precautions must be taken should the practice be implemented on a larger scale. Additional research is needed to determine how the procedure might impact HIV transmission to women, the most affected population in Africa. There is consensus that male circumcision must be considered part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package, which includes treatment for sexually transmitted infections; the promotion of safer sex practices; and the provision of male and female condoms and promotion of their correct and consistent use. HIV/AIDS advocates maintain that men and their sexual partners must also be counseled to prevent them from developing a false sense of security and engaging in high-risk behaviors that could undermine the partial protection provided by male circumcision. Health experts agree that African health systems need to be strengthened in order to ensure safe and clean operations. Circumcision must be done under hygienic conditions by trained personnel with access to sterile surgical instruments and anaesthesia. Many facilities on the continent, however, lack sufficient supplies, such as gloves, clean needles, and antiseptics.

In 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PEPFAR's spending requirements limited the flexibility with which prevention funds could be spent. GAO estimated that in order to meet the 33% proviso, between FY2004 and FY2006, OGAC increased spending on prevention by almost 55% and mandated that country teams spend half of prevention funds on sexual transmission prevention and two-thirds of those funds on abstinence/faithfulness (AB) activities.

Some in Congress have supported legislation that was introduced to remove the spending provisions. The HIV Prevention Act ( S. 1553 ) and the Protection Against Transmission of HIV for Women and Youth Act ( H.R. 1713 ) would strike the 33% abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement from P.L. 108-25 .

The Administration argued that since WHO is not a regulatory body, its adherence to stringent FDA standards could not be ensured. This policy sparked a debate with critics contending that the process was unnecessary and delayed the distribution of ARVs. In January 2005, GAO reported that the policy limited the selection of ARV products available, did not fully support the treatment strategies of the focus countries, and was not optimally coordinated with other multinational initiatives. GAO indicated that \"better coordination with the Focus Countries and with other treatment initiatives could facilitate more rapid implementation of the Emergency Plan. Moreover, given the intended scale of the plan, lower prices for ARVs could result in savings of hundreds of millions of dollars, which could be used to treat additional patients or to support other aspects of the program.\"", "In March 2007, IOM found that in many of the Focus Countries, a number of those implementing HIV/AIDS programs complained that the U.S. treatment policy complicated national treatment efforts. The Institute recommended that OGAC work to support WHO prequalification as the accepted global standard for assuring the quality of generic medications and work with other donors to support strengthening the process. According to OGAC's third annual report to Congress, OGAC has strengthened its coordination with WHO, by sharing information on the WHO-approved generics.

If patients do not consume adequate amounts of nutritious food, they can suffer significant side effects while taking ARVs and the drugs can be less effective. At the 2006 International AIDS Conference, one AIDS advocate cited a study that showed that patients who were malnourished when they started ARV therapy were six times more likely to die than well-nourished patients, and were more likely to suffer side-effects, which often caused them to stop taking the treatments.

On August 22, 2007, British Prime Minister [author name scrubbed] and German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced their intention to launch an International Health Partnership (IHP) aimed at accelerating progress towards reducing child and maternal mortality, combating infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, and strengthening health systems. The leaders acknowledged in their statement that the fragmented method of applying global health aid has reduced the effectiveness of aid, in large part because donors compete for limited trained staff and implement the projects without considering the countries' priorities and structures. According to DFID, there are more than 40 bilateral donors and 90 global health initiatives each maintaining their own reporting requirements and most focusing on specific health issues, such as HIV/AIDS. DFID asserts that few global health efforts focus on activities that would strengthen struggling health systems, such as training doctors and nurses, building clinics, or supporting basic health services. Parties of the IHP commit to improving donor coordination, focusing on health systems rather than specific diseases or health issues, and supporting the health plans of recipient countries.

In HIV/AIDS programs, health systems research could help administrators develop effective forecasting and distribution systems for drugs and other commodities and make stock-outs and shortages of contraceptives, ARVs, and other commodities less frequent. Advocates assert that health systems research could improve retention of health personnel, because they would have sufficient tools to perform their jobs.

In many of the countries with health worker shortages, there are thousands of unemployed health workers. While Kenya has a shortage of some 10,000 nurses in the public sector, for example, thousands of unemployed nurses are leaving for Britain to find jobs, as the Kenyan government is under a recruitment freeze due to World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) stipulations. Health sector reform, critics argue, has led to a decline in the quality of education and training opportunities for medical students, a perpetual shortage of health supplies and equipment (e.g., sanitation gloves and hyperdermic needles), insufficient medicine and vaccine stocks, and \"brain drain\" of African health workers. According to WHO, on average each year, the 57 countries with severe shortages of health workers spend an average of about $33 per person on health ( Table 6 ). The entire continent of Africa spends about 1% of the world's expenditure on health, the WHO contends. Comparatively, each year the United States spends approximately $5,711 per capita on health.", "Some analysts have expressed concern about the extent to which countries rely on the World Bank to fund their health programs. The Bank estimates that it has lent $15 billion in health, nutrition, and population funds from 1997 to 2006; an average of about $1.5 billion per year. Observers worry that the loans add to significant debt loads that many countries already face and to which they commit considerable portions of their annual gross national products. In some countries, governments are reportedly paying more on debt service than public health programs. Oxfam estimates that of the 26 countries participating in the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, half are still spending 15% or more of government revenues on debt payments.

Children who have been orphaned by AIDS may be forced to leave school, begin working to supplement lost income, suffer from depression and anger, or engage in survival sex, an activity that heightens their risk of contracting HIV. Children who live in homes that take in orphans may see a decline in the quantity and quality of food, education, love, nurturing, and may be stigmatized. Impoverished children living in households with one or more ill parent are also affected, as health care increasingly absorbs household funds, which frequently leads to the depletion of savings and other resources reserved for education, food, and other basic needs. A number of HIV/AIDS advocates call for increased spending on programs, such as skills building, microcredit lending, daycare subsidization, and education, for caretakers of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS.

Congress did not appropriate funds for these activities. A number of HIV/AIDS advocates encourage Congress to appropriate funds to make permanent and bolster the power and influence of the Special Advisor.
