The U.S. livestock sector, where feed costs account for 50% to 80% of cash operating expenses, has seen its profit margins steadily squeezed and its share of U.S. agricultural cash receipts decline. Since June 2010 feed cost increases have outpaced livestock price increases, squeezing the profitability of livestock and poultry producers. When profit margins turn unfavorable, producers are more likely to retain fewer breeding animals or to liquidate herds. Near-term liquidation means smaller future herds or flocks and ultimately higher retail prices for beef, pork, poultry meat, eggs, and dairy products. Persistent upward feed price movements could result in substantial and long-lasting consequences for livestock product prices throughout the marketing chain.", "USDA forecasts that U.S. corn stocks will approach historic low levels relative to demand by the end of summer 2011.

This persistent trend is primarily the result of five factors: rapid growth of U.S. corn-based ethanol production (whose share of the U.S. corn crop in 2011 is forecast to exceed feed use for the first time), limited supply of available U.S. cropland to expand production, prolonged weakness of the U.S. dollar which has made U.S. agricultural exports competitive in foreign markets despite high prices, strong income growth in China and other international markets which has increased demand for livestock products and the feedstuffs (feed grains and protein meals) needed to produce them, and a substantial decline in the price responsiveness of both supply and demand in agricultural commodity markets. The convergence of these factors has resulted in falling grain and oilseed stocks, record or near-record prices for most feedstuffs\u2014grains, oilseeds, hay, and pasture\u2014in 2011, and increasingly volatile commodity prices. These factors are expected to persist for several more years, thus maintaining strong demand for feed grains and strong upward pressure on prices for all commodities that compete for farm land.", "Issues surrounding feed use and availability are likely to be of growing interest to Congress as the House and Senate Agriculture Committees monitor the financial health and well-being of the U.S. livestock and poultry sectors, as well as any future ramifications for retail food price inflation.

Three principal types of feedstuffs are used in livestock and poultry rations\u2014energy feeds (primarily from feed grains such as corn and sorghum), protein feeds (primarily from oilseed meals), and roughage (primarily from grazing pasture and rangeland or from cut hay and silage). "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Finding the Right Feed Nutrient Balance", "paragraphs": ["Livestock and poultry producers are always looking for the most cost-effective feed sources to achieve maximum weight gain, egg production, and milk output from their herds and flocks. For overall animal health and productivity all commercial livestock and poultry species require a balanced nutrient intake of energy, protein, and roughage, supplemented by essential vitamins, minerals, and other minor additives. Fortunately, producers can use a wide variety of natural feed ingredients to satisfy the nutritional requirement of their livestock and poultry. ", "The choice of feedstuff depends critically on the type of livestock or poultry production activity, since each animal or bird species has different abilities to use any or all of the various feed types based on their digestive capabilities (e.g., ruminant versus monogastric versus avian), as well as the age, sex, breed, health, and reproductive status of the individual animals in a herd or flock. As a result, livestock producers must carefully balance their animals' nutritional needs with the cost and availability of feed supplies. ", "In particular, ruminant animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats are able to break down and digest the cellulose in high-fiber roughages. In contrast, monogastric species (e.g., hogs) or avian species (e.g., poultry) are not able to easily digest cellulosic material and will become ill if their feed rations are too high in fiber. As a result, swine and poultry producers rarely use pastures and ranges in their feeding operations. Instead, swine and poultry are the major consumers of both feed grains and protein meals, while cattle and dairy cows are the major consumers of roughage. For example, the hog industry is such a voracious consumer of the U.S. corn crop that a mapping of U.S. hog inventories very closely mirrors a mapping of corn production ( Figure A-1 ). Similarly, the rapid growth of U.S. poultry meat production which has occurred in recent decades is one of the primary factors behind strong growth in U.S. protein meal consumption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Feed Costs Dominate Livestock and Poultry Production", "paragraphs": ["Livestock and poultry producers have some flexibility in which feeds they use based on the specific nutritional needs of their livestock or birds, and the relative availability and price of the various feed alternatives.

", "Changes in feed grain supply, primarily due to weather variations, cause most of the short-term market price changes. The total supply of feeds also depends on many other factors including producer planting choices, agricultural policies, climate, soil type, availability of processing and storage facilities, and international market conditions.

Often, the proximity of livestock and poultry operations to a particular feed source is as important in the feed choice as are relative feed prices and the specific nutrient requirements of each animal or poultry species. Because nutrient needs and feed availabilities usually shift with the seasons, a producer is constantly challenged to plan three to six months or more in advance to avoid being caught in a cost-price squeeze (i.e., product prices fall while feed costs rise) by an unforgiving marketplace. ", "Prices for various feed grain are linked by their relative feed values and their competition for cropland. As a result, feed grain prices are highly correlated and tend to respond to the same market factors such as weather conditions and changes in international supply and demand. However, because of corn's dominant role in U.S. and world feed grain markets, the price of other feedstuffs tends to follow corn price changes ( Figure 2 ). ", "Swine and poultry producers are generally more corn-dependent than cattle producers, at least until the cattle have been placed on feed as the final stage prior to marketing. When the hog-corn or steer-corn price ratio turns unfavorable\u2014either due to a corn price upswing, a meat price downturn or some combination\u2014producers are more likely to market their stock earlier to minimize feed costs or to reduce the number of breeding animals that they retain to minimize future herd sizes and feed needs. Depending on the stage of the livestock cycle, changes in breeding activities can affect future market conditions. It can take several years for cattle producers to fully respond to grain market conditions due to the lengthy gestation (nine months) and growth cycle of cattle.

These stocks are referred to as pipeline supplies. Although there is no hard and fast rule on what volume of stocks represents minimum pipeline levels for the major grain and oilseed crops, a stocks-to-use ratio below 7% clearly raises market concerns.

National Weather Service officials predict that the severe drought conditions in Texas and Oklahoma are likely to persist into early next year, and it will likely take months and a wet winter for the pasture land to recover according to a cattle market professional. This would be crucial because if the drought persists into October, it will likely result in lower winter wheat plantings in Texas and Oklahoma. A decline in winter wheat plantings would be a further blow to ranchers, who would lose key pasture lands. Southern Plains cattle often are permitted to graze on early growth of winter wheat through the winter and into early spring. At that time, depending on the relationship between livestock and wheat prices, either the cattle are allowed to continue grazing and no wheat crop is produced, or they are removed and the wheat is allowed to fill out for eventual harvest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ethanol's Growing Share of U.S. Corn Usage", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. agricultural landscape has changed dramatically since 2004 with the ascendancy of the U.S. ethanol sector.

In 2004/2005, national ethanol production used 1.3 billion bushels and accounted for 12% of total U.S. corn use; in 2010/2011 it used 5.1 billion bushels (or about 38% of total use) to produce an estimated 13.6 billion gallons of ethanol.

First, the slow start-up of the cellulosic ethanol industry serves to keep both the biofuels and renewable-energy focus on corn-based ethanol because it is essentially \"the only game in town.\" Second, current congressional interest in finding budget savings has led to several proposals to trim back or eliminate federal support for the development of new biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol, further reinforcing the emphasis on existing corn-based ethanol technology."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "International Demand Growth Led by China", "paragraphs": ["Since 2004, global demand for wheat and coarse grains has risen by over 15% while production has grown by only 10%.

This tremendous economic growth has pulled millions of people out of poverty and into higher income strata.

However, limited domestic availability of both arable land and water has compelled China to turn increasingly to the international marketplace to meet its domestic needs and fend off domestic food-price inflation. For example, China's share of world soybean imports has risen dramatically from negligible imports in the early 1990s to nearly a 60% share of world soybean imports by 2009 ( Figure 8 ). Stock building accounts for a substantial share of China's soybean imports. USDA estimates that China's sobyean stocks now account for a relatively high 23% of usage.

The United States is also the world's leading consumer (38% of world use) and exporter (60% of global exports) of corn. Since 2001, the United States has exported approximately 18% of its corn crop (about 2 billion bushels annually) to other countries. U.S. corn is prized in international markets for its nutritional profile and superior palatability. For example, egg producers in the Middle East value corn over other feedstuffs for its enhanced yellowing of egg yolks which adds value in retail markets.", "In addition to its role as the world's most important feed grain, corn is also processed into a multitude of food and industrial products including starch, sweeteners, corn oil, beverage and industrial alcohol, and fuel ethanol. All of these alternate uses compete in the marketplace with livestock and poultry feeders for existing corn supplies. Traditionally most of the U.S. corn crop has been used as the main energy ingredient in livestock feed. However, since 2004 an increasing share of the U.S. corn crop has been consumed by the ethanol industry. In 1999 less than 6% of the U.S. corn crop was used for ethanol production and feed byproducts; this share has grown to over 40% in 2010.

By March, most pastures and ranges are flush with new growth and cattle ranchers take advantage by shifting some of their animals onto the green forages. During the summer months hay and other roughages are more abundant and compete in feed rations of ruminants. Corn use also varies substantially by region.

In the past decade sorghum has accounted for about 3% of feed grain use compared with 1% shares for both oats and barley. The tremendous growth in corn yields (and significant improvements in its genetic adaptation to varying agro-climatic settings) relative to other field crops has allowed corn to expand into non-traditional areas at the expense of minor feed grains, wheat, and oilseed crops. As a result, corn's planted acreage and output has been steadily increasing since the early 1980s, while sorghum, barley, and oats have been on the decline ( Figure 11 ).", "Sorghum is a drought- and heat-resistant crop grown primarily in the Central and Southern Plains regions where the climate is often impractical for non-irrigated corn ( Figure A-2 ). Most sorghum is consumed as a feed grain in Southwestern cattle feedlots. Sorghum also rivals corn as a potential ethanol feedstock and is used to produce biofuels in a few ethanol plants located close to sorghum growing regions. The United States is the world's leading sorghum exporter, shipping about 46% of annual production (or about 188 million bushels), primarily to Japan and Mexico.", "Barley production is concentrated in the Northern Plains ( Figure A-2 ). Its most valued use is as a source of malt for the brewing industry. However, poor barley quality (usually related to growing conditions or excessive harvest-time moisture) and relative feed grain price differentials can lead to substantial barley feeding to cattle and sheep.", "Oats production (and its use for feed) in the United States has declined steadily since the 1950s for a variety of reasons including its lower feed value and price relative to other feed grains. Since the mid-1980s the United States has become the world's largest importer of oats, primarily for use as horse feed. During the past decade, the United States has imported nearly 48% (or about 98 million bushels) of its annual oats consumption.", "Feed Wheat: Varies with Quality and Market Conditions", "Wheat is generally grown as a food crop, but may also be used as a livestock feed since its feed value is comparable to that of corn. Wheat's traditionally higher price relative to corn is a major factor in determining the extent to which wheat is used as a livestock feed. However, weather-related damage to wheat, particularly excessive moisture at harvest time, can render the grain unsuitable for milling uses and leave feeding as the only option. During the past decade, about 7% of the annual U.S. wheat crop has been fed to livestock. However, wheat feeding can vary substantially from year to year depending on crop size and its price relative to corn. For example, in 1990 about 20% of the crop was fed to livestock, while in 2007 less than 1% was used as feed. In general, supply tightness of traditional feed grains (whether from drought or heavy export demand) or abundant wheat supplies can price wheat into greater feed use. ", "Wheat feeding is most common in corn-deficit areas such as the Southern Plains, where little corn and much hard red winter wheat are grown ( Figure A-2 ). As a result, beef cattle on Southwestern feedlots have been the traditional consumers of feed wheat, although poultry in Southeastern operations are also occasionally fed wheat. ", "Protein Meals", "Protein supplements are needed to correct the protein deficiencies of an all-grain diet. However, protein meals are usually more expensive than feed grains. Most protein concentrates used in the United States are oilseed meals (61% share)\u2014derived from the pulp residue left over from the crushing process used to extract vegetable oil from oilseeds, for example, soybeans, cottonseed, rapeseed or canola, peanuts, and minor oilseeds (sunflowers, linseed, sesame, and mustard). Additional protein meals are obtained from byproducts from processing grains (34% share including DGS), animals (4%), and marine species (< 1%). ", "Soybeans are the major source of protein meal in both the United States and the rest of the world. Globally, soybean meal (or soymeal) represents between 65% to 70% of all protein meals produced, while in the United States soymeal represents 85% of all oilseed meals and 53% of all protein meals fed to U.S. livestock and poultry. ", "The rapid growth of poultry meat production and its higher feed efficiency relative to other species has changed the nature of concentrated feed use in the United States. Poultry require less feed to produce a pound of meat than other animals ( Table A-1 ). However, poultry production required increasing quantities of protein as the industry expanded significantly since the 1970s. Poultry's consumption share of high-protein feed ingredients in the United States has risen from a 40% share in the early 1970s to 57% during the past decade. Hogs' share of high-protein feeds has held fairly steady at about 22% over the past 40 years, while dairy and beef cattle have seen their shares drop from around 12% to 13% in the early 1970s to 7% for dairy and 9% for beef cattle in recent years. ", "Oilseed Meals", "Most protein meals are derived from the pulp residue left over from the crushing process used to extract vegetable oil from oilseeds\u2014for example, soybeans, cottonseed, rapeseed or canola, peanuts, and minor oilseeds (sunflowers, linseed, sesame, and mustard). Soybeans are the major source of protein meal in both the United States and the rest of the world. Globally, soybean meal (or soymeal) represents between 65% to 70% of all protein meals produced, while in the United States soymeal represents 85% of all oilseed meals and 53% of all protein meals fed to U.S. livestock and poultry. ", "Soymeal comprises the largest part of a soybean\u2014about 75% of the volume and 60% of the processed value. In contrast, soybean oil or soyoil accounts for about 19% of volume and 39% of the processed value. The value share can vary from year to year such that in some years the price of oil is high enough relative to meal that it commands a majority of the total processed oil and meal value. Both the oil and meal have positive market characteristics that make them very competitive with other vegetable oils and meals. ", "Soybeans are a high-yielding, broad-leaf leguminous oilseed plant that fits well in rotation with corn to control plant pests and diseases. As a result, the Corn Belt has the largest concentration of soybean acreage in the United States ( Figure A-1 ), although genetic improvements have helped to expand U.S. soybean production into the Northern Plains. Soybeans require less water than corn and, as a result, tend to have a larger growing zone that also includes the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Central Plains. ", "Other oilseed crops tend to be both lower yielding and less profitable per acre to produce than soybeans. As a result, most other oilseeds are relegated to agro-climatic zones where soybeans do not grow well. The oil-to-meal ratio varies considerably across oilseeds. For example, rapeseed is about 40% oil and 60% meal. But most of the meals derived from other oilseeds (in particular, cottonseed, canola, and sunflower) are higher in fiber and tougher to digest than soymeal. This means that they have a lower digestible energy content for swine and poultry. As a result, most other oilseed meals are used predominantly by the cattle industry. Other oilseed meals account for about 9% of total protein meals fed in the United States.", "Animal Meals", "Many feeds make use of the byproducts generated in the meat, poultry, milk, and fish processing industries. Organic materials that would otherwise go to waste can be rendered into valuable, high-quality protein products that are useful as supplements to other energy and protein concentrates to achieve a balance of essential vitamins and amino acids.", "Meatpacking byproducts include meat, bones, blood, and animal fat which can be used to produce meat and bone meal and blood meal. Their use represents about 4% of total protein meal use in the United States. However, stringent feed-use restrictions related to potential transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have been placed on certain animal byproducts which limit both their current marketability and their growth potential.", "Roughages", "Roughage (i.e., cellulose-based) feedstuffs are vegetative plants that are bulky, high in crude fiber, and low in digestible nutrients. The major groups of roughage include pasture and range plants, hays, and silages. Dry roughage is obtained from cutting and harvesting hay (i.e., legumes, grasses, or grain crops cut at an early growth stage to maximize nutrient yield) grown on rotated cropland or pasture. Green forages include silage which is a type of forage (often based on chopped hay or grain crops) that is fermented in a silo, or grazing the crops (i.e., wheat and rye), grasses, or wild plants on cultivated pasture or rangeland. An advantage of silage is that it preserves a succulent forage for winter feeding. ", "Roughages are most suitable for use by ruminants\u2014for example, cattle, sheep, and goats\u2014which have micro-organisms in their digestive tracts that secrete enzymes which break down the cellulose in plant fiber. Ruminants actually require a high level of fiber in their diets to maintain a rumen environment favorable for the synthesis of nutrients. Insufficient fiber in a ruminant's diet can lead to acute digestive disorders. Roughages supply as much as 55% to 60% of the annual feed consumption by dairy and beef cows and sheep; however, roughages do not fully replace feed grains and protein meals in a commercial feeding operation because they cannot supply the high levels of net energy and protein needed to produce rapid weight gains and high milk yields. ", "Since 2001, dairy cows have consumed about 18% of U.S. roughage production, while beef cattle operations account for about 70% of all roughage in the United States. ", "Corn and sorghum are the most important silage crops because they have the highest per-acre yields of digestible nutrients. However, when corn and sorghum are used for silage, the entire plant\u2014stalk, leaves, and grain\u2014is harvested, chopped, and often mixed with other silage. Most silage is produced and used on-farm. Marketing silage is uncommon because it is costly to transport and loses its quality quickly once removed from the silo.", "Pasture and Range Flexibility ", "Livestock is the residual claimant on agricultural land. If any other farm activity can be successfully undertaken on a piece of land, it usually takes priority over livestock grazing. As a result, pastures (or participation in the Conservation Reserve Program ) may be the best use of marginal land unable to profitably grow cash crops. (For example, compare the location of cattle, dairy, and sheep populations of Figure A-3 with the location of major field crops in Figure A-1 and Figure A-2 .) In primary crop production areas such as the Corn Belt, pastures are increasingly being retained only for the use of dry dairy cows, calves and replacement heifers, and breeding beef cows or sheep. This pattern has accelerated over the past several years in response to higher crop prices. ", "Ranges\u2014located predominantly in Western States\u2014are less productive than cultivated pastures because they usually have lower rainfall, poorer soils, shorter growing seasons, and steep topography. Both pastures and ranges are more productive in the spring and early summer when young, leafy plants are higher in moisture and lower in fiber, making it more palatable and digestible to livestock than later summer stages when it is coarser and stemmier. The period of pasture and range fertility is closely linked to weather conditions and can be extended into the summer or curtailed in early spring based on rainfall patterns. ", "Having access to good quality pasture, rangeland, or small grain crops for grazing provides substantial flexibility for ranchers to reduce their costs by purchasing fewer commercial feed concentrates, while minimizing their operating expenses for growing, harvesting, feeding, and storing grains or silage. When feed grain prices increase, many producers will graze cattle longer before placing them into feedlots at heavier weights to save on finishing costs, provided that there is sufficient forage. The ongoing drought in the Southern Plains and Southeast has severely limited grazing opportunities for cattlemen.", "Using Feed Grains", "Feed grains may be purchased commercially or produced and used directly on the farm. ", "Commercial Feeds", "Commercial feed concentrates offer the advantage of ready-to-eat form and precise nutrient composition, but are generally more expensive than home-grown feeds. Different milling procedures are used to prepare feed grains for animal consumption. Grinding the grain reduces the animal's expenditure of energy in chewing and exposes a greater surface for improved digestion. The desired fineness of the grind depends on the type of livestock and other components being blended in the ration. Cracking grain is sufficient for cattle; fine grinds are better for poultry. Grinding also assists in handling and pelleting (compressing into pellets), but adds cost to every bushel of grain.", "On-Farm Feeding", "Farmers that produce both livestock and feedstuffs (whether grains, hay, or silage), will normally feed with their own-farm-produced feedstuffs before turning to commercial feed grain markets. Substantial on-farm feeding of own-produced feedstuffs occurs throughout the Corn Belt, Lake States, and Northern Plains where surplus production of feedstuffs exists. In feed-deficit regions, commercial feed markets and feed-pasture decisions tend to play a much larger role.", "The amount of on-farm feeding from own-production can also be influenced by the quality of the crop. When late planting delays crop maturity, or an early frost or substantial harvest-time rain occurs, farmers may be confronted with the choice of expensive crop drying or on-farm storage of high-moisture (20% to 30% moisture) grain. Under proper storage conditions, high-moisture grain is a high-valued feed. However, because of its high-moisture content, it is not readily marketed off the farm due to rapid spoilage. As a result, a commitment to store on-farm high-moisture grain is also a commitment to feed it on farm rather than sell it in commercial markets.", "Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)", "In animal husbandry, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) is a measure of an animal's efficiency in converting feed mass into increased body mass. Animals that have a low FCR are considered efficient users of feed. ", "Grain Milling Byproducts", "Feed grain byproducts originate primarily from milling grains and include corn, wheat, and rice mill feeds and a variety of miscellaneous feed byproducts such as hominy feed, oat mill feeds, and screenings. This group of other feed grain byproducts is fairly small, but not insignificant, accounting for about 4% total feed concentrates.", "Corn milling byproducts have grown in importance with the rapid growth of the corn-based U.S. ethanol industry. Two primary corn milling processes, wet and dry milling, are used to produce fuel ethanol. Both processes also produce several categories of important byproducts that are attractive animal feed alternatives, particularly as both energy and protein concentrates. ", "Corn wet-milling is designed to extract starch, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), glucose and dextrose, and ethanol from corn. Wet-milling byproducts include corn gluten feed (CGF) and corn gluten meal (CGM). Corn dry-milling is used to produce distilled liquor and ethanol (fuel alcohol). Dry-milling byproducts include distillers grains and solubles (DGS). ", "Distillers Grains and Solubles (DGS)", "Since mid-2005 all new corn milling plants built in the United States have been corn dry milling plants such that dry milling production of ethanol and its byproducts now dominates the U.S. ethanol industry. As a result, production of distillers grains and solubles (DGS)\u2014the major co-product of the corn-starch ethanol industry\u2014has expanded very rapidly in the last six years with the explosive growth in corn processing for ethanol ( Figure 5 ), rising from about 1 million metric tons (mmt) in the 1999/2000 corn marketing year (Sept. -Aug.) to 33.2 mmt in 2010/2011. ", "DGS is a valuable feed alternative. DGS is a medium-protein (approximately 30% protein content) feed ingredient that replaces corn, soybean meal, and other sources of phosphorus and calcium. In addition, its percentages of fiber, protein, oil, and other nutrients are concentrated to almost three times the percentages found in corn. Initially, the U.S. livestock and poultry industry was slow to adopt DGS into feed rations and instead required a time lag in order to develop systems for efficiently transporting, handling, and feeding this product. However, feeding of DGS is now widespread in the United States, especially in the beef cattle and dairy industries. When DGS is sold to distant domestic feed markets or for export, it must first incur a drying cost and then is sold as dried distillers' grains and solubles (DDGS). In the last few years, DDGS exports have grown rapidly as foreign livestock and poultry producers became familiar with its potential cost savings and ways of effectively using it as a replacement for corn and soymeal. ", "Where ethanol plants are located close to feedlots, a portion of the DGS output typically is sold as wet or partially-dried DGS, and is moved directly to cattle feedlots. Wet and partially dried distillers grains have limited storage life, since they contain 70%-75% and 50%-55% moisture, respectively. As a result, wet DGS is sold at a discount to costlier DDGS giving a cost advantage to livestock feeders located within close proximity of a dry-mill ethanol plant ( Figure A-4 ). ", "DDGS is best suited for feeding to ruminant animals (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats). The digestive system of these animals allows them to convert DGS fiber into energy while at the same time using the protein and other nutrients. Use of DDGS in hog and poultry rations is somewhat more limited, in part because of its fiber content. When DDGS is fed to these species, supplementation of some amino acids also is needed. Pork producers report that feeding high levels of DDGS during the feeding period can cause soft bellies that in turn cause problems in bacon production.", "Recommended maximum DDGS percentages of the ration for swine and poultry are considerably lower than for cattle because of differences in their digestive systems ( Table A-2 ).\u00a0As a result, beef cattle are the largest market for DDGS by a considerable margin, followed by its use for dairy cows, hogs, and poultry in that order. Replacement ratios in substituting DDGS for corn and soybean meal also vary with the species of animal or bird being fed. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
