SBA disaster loans include (1) Home and Personal Property Disaster Loans, (2) Business Physical Disaster Loans, and (3) Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL).

These include two types of presidential declarations as authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) and three types of SBA declarations. While the type of declaration may determine what types of loans are made available, declaration type has no bearing on loan terms or loan caps. The SBA Disaster Loan Program becomes available when:", "1. The President issues a major disaster declaration, or an emergency declaration, and authorizes both Individual Assistance (IA) and Public Assistance (PA) under the authority of the Stafford Act. When the President issues such a declaration, SBA disaster loans become available to homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofit organizations located within the disaster area. Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) may also be made for survivors in contiguous counties or other political subdivisions. 2. The President makes a major disaster declaration or emergency declaration that only provides the state with PA. In such a case, a private nonprofit entity located within the disaster area that provides noncritical services may be eligible for a physical disaster loan and EIDL. It is important to note that Home Physical Disaster Loans and Personal Property Loans are not made available to renters and homeowners under this type of declaration. Additionally, Business Physical Disaster Loans, and EIDLs are generally not made available to businesses (unless they are a private nonprofit entity) if the declaration only provides PA. 3. The SBA Administrator issues a physical disaster declaration in response to a gubernatorial request for assistance. When the SBA Administrator issues this type of declaration, SBA disaster loans become available to eligible homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofit organizations within the disaster area or contiguous counties and other political subdivisions. 4. The SBA Administrator may make an EIDL declaration when SBA receives a certification from a state governor that at least five small businesses have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of a disaster. This declaration is offered only when other viable forms of financial assistance are unavailable. Small agricultural cooperatives and most private nonprofit organizations located within the disaster area or contiguous counties and other political subdivisions are eligible for SBA disaster loans when the SBA Administrator issues an EIDL declaration. 5. The SBA Administrator may issue a declaration for EIDL loans based on the determination of a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture. These loans are available to eligible small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, and most private nonprofit organizations within the disaster area, or contiguous counties and other political subdivisions. Additionally, the SBA administrator may issue a declaration based on the determination of the Secretary of Commerce that a fishery resource disaster or commercial fishery failure has occurred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Many Declarations Are Issued by Type?", "paragraphs": ["As demonstrated by Figure 3 , from calendar year 2000 to 2014, the Secretary of Agriculture issued the greatest number of declarations (58%). The SBA issued 15% of the declarations for the period. Presidential declarations for PA and presidential declarations for IA and PA were 14% and 10% respectively. EIDL declarations account for 15% of the declarations issued during this period. The fewest declarations issued were based on the determination of the Secretary of Commerce (only two were issued during the time period)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is the Difference Between Loan Approvals and Loan Disbursements?", "paragraphs": ["Loan approvals are often used in performance reviews and budget justifications. Some might argue that loan disbursals more accurately reflect program usage because not all approved applicants accept the loans. From 2000 to 2014, approximately 72% (380,450 loans) of approved disaster loans during the time period, amounting to roughly $15.5 billion, were actually disbursed to businesses and households. Figure 4 displays the percent of all approved loans that were disbursed each year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Can Disaster Loans Be Used in Conjunction with Insurance or Other Types of Assistance?", "paragraphs": ["Disaster loans may be used in conjunction with other types of assistance including insurance but only to the extent to which there is no duplication of assistance.

An individual receiving federal assistance for a major disaster is liable to the United States when the assistance duplicates benefits provided for the same purpose.", "FEMA regulation 44 C.F.R. 206.191 establishes policies and procedural guidance to ensure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits, including a \"delivery sequence\" of disaster assistance provided by volunteer organizations and certain federal agencies. According to the regulation, the agency or organization that is lower in the delivery sequence should not provide assistance that duplicates assistance provided by a higher level agency or organization.", "SBA regulation 13 C.F.R. 123.101(c) prohibits applicants from receiving a home disaster loan if their damaged property can be repaired or replaced with the proceeds of insurance, gifts, or other compensation.

SBA noted that its lower performance in FY2013 was largely due to increased loan volumes following Hurricane Sandy.

In some cases, after large-scale disasters (such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy), Congress has appropriated additional funds for the program through supplemental appropriations. It is not uncommon for Congress to carry funds left over from these supplemental appropriations to the next fiscal year and forego an annual appropriation (see Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1 , from FY2005 to FY2015 the average annual appropriation to the SBA Disaster Loan Program was $120 million. The average supplemental appropriation for the same time period was $623 million.
