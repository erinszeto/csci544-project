{"id": "RL34116", "title": "Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS): Background and Debate Over a National Requirement", "released_date": "2007-12-05T00:00:00", "summary": ["Under a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS), retail electricity suppliers (electric utilities) must provide a minimum amount of electricity from renewable energy resources or purchase tradable credits that represent an equivalent amount of renewable energy production. The minimum requirement is often set as a percentage share of retail electricity sales. More than 20 states have established an RPS, with most targets ranging from 10% to 20% and most target deadlines ranging from 2010 to 2025. Most states have established tradable credits as a way to lower costs and facilitate compliance. State RPS action has provided an experience base for the design of a possible national requirement.", "RPS proponents contend that a national system of tradable credits would enable retail suppliers in states with fewer resources to comply at the least cost by purchasing credits from organizations in states with a surplus of low-cost production. Opponents counter that regional differences in availability, amount, and types of renewable energy resources would make a federal RPS unfair and costly.", "In Senate floor action on H.R. 6 in the 110th Congress, S.Amdt. 1537 proposed a 15% RPS target. The proposal triggered a lively debate, but was ultimately ruled non-germane. In that debate, opponents argued that a national RPS would disadvantage certain regions of the country, particularly the Southeastern states. They contended that the South lacks a sufficient amount of renewable energy resources to meet a 15% renewables requirement. They further concluded that an RPS would cause retail electricity prices to rise for many consumers.", "RPS proponents countered by citing a study by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The report examined the potential impacts of the 15% RPS proposed in S.Amdt. 1537. It indicated that the South has sufficient biomass generation, both from dedicated biomass plants and existing coal plants co-firing with biomass fuel, to meet a 15% RPS. EIA noted further that the estimated net RPS requirement for the South would not make it \"unusually dependent\" on other regions and was in fact \"below the national average requirement....\" Regarding electricity prices, EIA estimated that the 15% RPS would likely raise retail prices by slightly less than 1% over the 2005 to 2030 period. Further, the RPS would likely cause retail natural gas prices to fall slightly over that period.", "In House floor action on an RPS amendment (H.Amdt. 748) to H.R. 3221, key points and counterpoints of the Senate RPS debate were repeated. The RPS was added (220 to 190), and the bill passed the House (241 to 172). The RPS amendment would set a 15% target for 2020, and would allow up to 4 percentage points of the requirement to be met with energy efficiency measures. After House action, informal bipartisan House-Senate negotiations began. The House RPS provision (\u00a79006) continues to be key issue. On December 1, 2007, the Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee stated that the House Leadership's intent to include an RPS led him to cease negotiations.

Some of the states with this newly \"restructured\" system established an RPS as a way to create a continuing role for renewable energy in power production. Some states without a restructured industry also began to adopt an RPS. The total number of states with an RPS has grown steadily. In June 2007, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reported that 23 states and the District of Columbia had an RPS in place, collectively covering about 40% of the national electric load. Mandatory state RPS targets range from a low of 2% to a high of 25%. However, most targets range from 10% to 20% and are scheduled to be reached between 2010 and 2025. Although this emerging \"tapestry of state programs\" continues to spread to more states, the majority of recent actions have been to increase and accelerate previously established standards. Most states have a similar definition of eligible renewable resources that covers wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and several forms of water-based power, including hydropower, current, wave, tidal, and ocean power. At least 19 of the 23 states allow some form of credit trading. Non-compliance penalties range from about one cent per kwh to 5.5 cents per kwh. There are significant regional differences in resource availability. As shown in the previously cited FERC map, most states in the Southeast and Midwest regions do not have an RPS requirement. Several states have broadened their RPS provisions to allow certain energy efficiency measures and technologies to help satisfy the requirement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Electricity Production Targets", "paragraphs": ["Most state RPS programs employ an annual renewable energy target that is set as a percentage of total projected electricity production. With a percentage requirement, the amount of mandated renewable energy will increase or decrease in proportion to changes in end-use electricity sales. In general, the targets increase gradually, in a step-wise fashion, over a period of several years. The scheduled rise of the annual target, and its peak value, are intended to create predictable long-term purchase obligations that drive new development and economies of scale. The graduated schedule is intended to allow time for competition to emerge among eligible resources. Also, to create stability that allows for long-term contracts and financing that can help keep renewable energy costs down, the peak target often is designed to remain in place for several years after it is reached. Most state targets include only generation from new renewable energy facilities, placed in service after the RPS standard is enacted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tradable Credits", "paragraphs": ["Many states have created tradable credits as a way to lower costs and facilitate compliance. Typically, the owner of a qualified renewable energy facility receives one credit for each kilowatt-hour of electricity produced. The credits are treated as a product separate from generated power. Credits are a purely financial product that represents the attributes of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. The owner may bundle the credits for sale with its electrical energy. Alternatively, the owner may sell the credits and power separately. The power would be sold in the electricity market, and the credits would be sold in a secondary credit trading market.", "Each year, RPS requires all retail suppliers to show that they have acquired a number of credits equivalent to the percentage target for the previous year. The retail suppliers have options for meeting this requirement. Suppliers can choose to build a renewable energy facility, purchase renewable power bundled with credits, or buy credits separately through the trading market. They are also free to choose the types of renewable energy to acquire, the price paid, and the contract terms offered. Further, they can choose whether to enter into long-term credit and/or renewable power purchase contracts or to purchase these commodities on the spot market. If a supplier cannot obtain sufficient credits through these means, it can achieve \"alternative compliance\" by purchasing additional credits from the state regulatory agency. For a supplier that otherwise fails to meet the credit target, most states require that it purchase additional credits at a higher penalty price."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credit Flexibility Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["Spreading credit requirements over a longer time period can make a credit trading market more flexible. Many credit trading systems provide a \"true-up\" (reconciliation) period after the RPS compliance year. During this period, retailers that are short on their obligation can buy additional credits and those with excess credits can sell them. \"Credit banking\" can reduce retailer risk and promote economies of scale by allowing credits to be carried forward to one or more future years. \"Deficit banking\" allows a retailer to defer making up a credit shortage to a future year."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Federal RPS Action and Debate", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal RPS Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Legislative proposals to establish a federal RPS date back to the 105 th Congress.

Our retail electricity customers will end up paying higher electricity prices, with nothing to show for it.", "Further, a fact sheet prepared by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) elaborated on the point about the potential impact on electricity prices:", "A federal RPS requirement could cost electricity consumers billions of dollars in higher electricity prices, but with no guarantee that additional renewable generation will actually be developed. Because many retail electric suppliers will not be able to meet an RPS requirement through their own generation, they will be required to purchase higher cost renewable energy from other suppliers or purchase renewable energy credits.
