Over the course of negotiations for FY2019 appropriations, the Administration asked Congress to appropriate $5.7 billion to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for that purpose. When Congress appropriated $1.375 billion to DHS for border fencing, the President announced that his Administration would fund the construction of border barriers by repurposing funds appropriated to the Department of Defense (DOD) and transferring funds from the Department of the Treasury. The Administration asserted that these funding transfers were authorized by a combination of the following federal laws:", "National Emergenc ies Act (NEA) . The NEA establishes a framework for the President to declare national emergencies. The NEA does not itself appropriate or authorize the transfer of funds, but the declaration of a national emergency triggers other statutory provisions that allow certain executive departments to repurpose existing appropriations. 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 2808 . Section 2808 becomes available upon the President's declaration of a national emergency under the NEA. This provision authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use unobligated military construction funds for the construction of otherwise unauthorized military construction projects. Section s 8005 and 9002 of the 2019 D OD Appropriations Act . Sections 8005 and 9002 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act authorize the transfer of up to $6 billion appropriated in that act for \"military functions\" arising from \"unforeseen military requirements.\" Funds may be transferred under these authorities only for \"unforeseen military requirements\" where the item for which funds will be transferred \"has [not] been denied by the Congress.\" 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2 284 .

Some plaintiffs also argued that the construction of border barriers was subject to the environmental assessment requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).", "Though a federal court in California initially entered an injunction prohibiting the Trump Administration from using the funds to initiate construction of border fencing, the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately stayed that injunction. The California federal district court's injunction would have prohibited the Administration from using Sections 8005 and 9002 to transfer funds for border barrier construction. The court did not rule on the lawfulness of the Administration's other proposed funding sources, though it did determine that waivers issued by DHS under Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act rendered NEPA inapplicable to the proposed border projects. But following the Supreme Court's stay of the district court's injunction, DOD was able to use funds transferred under Sections 8005 and 9002 for barrier construction purposes while litigation in the case continues. A second federal district court in Texas has enjoined the use of Section 2808 for border barrier construction purposes. A third lawsuit challenging the Trump Administration's funding initiatives is ongoing in the District of Columbia, though that court has not ruled on the merits.", "Meanwhile, both houses of Congress have continued to move through the annual appropriations process. Although the House of Representatives initially passed a version of the DOD Appropriations Act for FY2020 that would have expressly prohibited the use of funds for the construction of border barriers, these limitations were not included as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (which included DOD appropriations and $1.375 billion for construction of a barrier system along the southwest border), or the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act as they were passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["P resident Trump has long advocated for the construction of additional fencing, walls, and other barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border to deter unlawful border crossings. Less than a week after taking office, the President issued an executive order directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border.\" This policy has engendered a robust debate in the public sphere, and a conflict has also made its way to federal court, with various plaintiffs challenging the lawfulness of the Trump Administration's initiatives to pay for the construction of border barriers by reprogramming funds from existing appropriations. At their core, these lawsuits concern whether the Administration's funding initiatives exceed existing statutory authorization and conflict with Congress's constitutionally conferred power over federal funds. ", "Article I of the Constitution provides that \"[n]o money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" As Justice Joseph Story noted in his Commentaries on the Constitution , the appropriations power was given to Congress to guard against arbitrary and unchecked expenditures by the executive branch and to \"secure regularity, punctuality, and fidelity, in the disbursement of the public money.\" \"In arbitrary governments,\" he expounded, \"the prince levies what money he pleases from his subjects, disposes of it, as he thinks proper, and is beyond responsibility or reproof.\" To avoid giving the President such \"unbounded power over the public purse of the nation,\" the Framers designated Congress \"the guardian of [the national] treasure\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094giving to it \"the power to decide, how and when any money should be applied[.]\" This \"power to control, and direct the appropriations,\" Justice Story explained, serves as \"a most useful and salutary check upon profusion and extravagance, as well as upon corrupt influence and public speculation.\" Justice Story's sentiments echoed those of James Madison, who in The Federalist No. 58 described the legislature's \"power over the purse\" as \"the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\"", "The Trump Administration's early efforts to secure funding for border barriers focused on negotiating with Congress to secure appropriations specifically designated for that task. In his FY2018 budget proposal, President Trump requested that Congress appropriate $1.57 billion for border barrier construction. Similarly, President Trump's FY2019 budget request sought $1.6 billion \"to construct approximately 65 miles of border wall in south Texas.\"", "Congress did not appropriate the amounts requested for either fiscal year. For FY2018, Congress appropriated $1.375 billion for new or repaired fencing and other forms of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as $196 million for border monitoring technology. As FY2019 began, Congress and the President negotiated, inter alia , the amount of funding to provide the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for border barrier construction for FY2019. Ultimately, Congress and the President did not agree on funding levels, leading to a 35-day lapse of appropriations for DHS and other portions of the federal government. During the partial government shutdown, President Trump increased his request for border barrier funding from $1.6 billion to $5.7 billion. Congress did not grant this request. Instead, in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (CAA 2019), Congress appropriated $1.375 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094$4.325 billion less than was ultimately requested\u00e2\u0080\u0094for \"the construction of primary pedestrian fencing\u00c2\u00a0. . . in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.\"", "President Trump signed the CAA 2019 on February 15, 2019, that same day announcing that his Administration would \"take Executive action\" to \"secure additional resources\" to construct barriers along the southern border. In particular, President Trump announced that his Administration had identified \"up to $8.1 billion\" from three additional funding sources \"to build the border wall.\" It remains to be seen whether the Administration will identify further funding sources from the FY2020 budget cycle.", "Several plaintiffs filed lawsuits in federal courts in California, the District of Columbia, and Texas to prevent the Trump Administration from taking this action. These plaintiffs assert that the Administration's funding initiatives are not authorized under existing law and thus violate the constitutional and statutory provisions requiring that federal money be spent only for the purposes, and in the amounts, specified by Congress. In May 2019, a federal district court in California concluded that one of the Administration's funding initiatives was unlawful and prohibited the Administration from using that authority to repurpose funds for border barrier construction. Though the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the Administration's request to stay the injunction, the Supreme Court granted that request, thus allowing the Administration to begin contracting for construction of border barriers while litigation in the case continues. A second federal district court in Texas has separately enjoined the use of military construction funds for border barrier construction. Meanwhile, the federal district court in the District of Columbia ruled that the plaintiff in that case\u00e2\u0080\u0094the U.S. House of Representatives\u00e2\u0080\u0094did not have standing to sue and dismissed the suit.

In addition to this mileage, CBP described DOD as funding in FY2019 \"up to approximately 131 miles of new border barriers in place of dilapidated or outdated designs, in addition to road construction and lighting installation.\" In total, CBP stated that some 336 total miles of barriers (including both replacement barriers and barriers deployed in new locations) would be deployed using funds from FY2017 through FY2019.", "This report addresses the litigation surrounding the Trump Administration's initiatives to repurpose existing appropriations for the construction of border barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.

These authorities are described in more detail below.", "First , Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) as amended generally authorizes DHS to construct barriers and roads along the international borders in order to deter illegal crossings at locations of high illegal entry, and further directs the agency to construct fencing along no less than 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. This law also authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive \"all legal requirements\u00c2\u00a0. . . necessary to ensure expeditious construction of . . .

President Trump proposed to direct the DOD to use its authority under Section 284 to support DHS's \"counterdrug activities\" through the construction of fencing across drug trafficking corridors at the southern border. These support activities would be funded by $2.5 billion in DOD's Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities Account (Drug Interdiction Account), which would be transferred to that account using the transfer authority in Sections 8005 and 9002 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act. These authorities authorize the transfer of up to $6 billion of DOD funds for \"unforeseen military requirements\" but only \"where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by Congress.\" Fourth , the Treasury Forfeiture Fund contains funds that are confiscated by, or forfeited to, the federal government pursuant to laws enforced or administered by certain law enforcement agencies, and unobligated money in this fund may be used for obligation or expenditure in connection with \"law enforcement activities of any Federal agency.\" The President proposed to withdraw $601 million in unobligated funds from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund ( TFF) to pay for border barrier construction.

By 1973, Congress had enacted more than 470 statutes granting the President special authorities upon the declaration of a \"national emergency,\" but these statutes imposed no limitations on either the President's discretion to declare an emergency or the duration of such an emergency. The Senate Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers (previously named the Senate Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency) (\"Special Committee\") was apparently concerned that four presidentially declared national emergencies remained extant in the mid-1970s, the earliest dating to 1933.", "In 1973, the Special Committee concluded that the President's crisis powers \"confer[red] enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal constitutional process,\" and so Congress enacted the NEA in 1976 to pare back the President's emergency authorities. ", "The NEA does not define \"national emergency.\" Rather, the NEA established a framework to provide enhanced congressional oversight and prevent emergency declarations from continuing in perpetuity. To accomplish these goals, the NEA terminated all then-existing presidentially declared emergencies. The NEA also established procedures for future declarations of national emergencies, requiring the President to", "specify which statutory emergency authorities he intends to invoke upon a declaration of a national emergency (unlike the pre-NEA regime, under which the declaration of an emergency operated as an invocation of all of the President's emergency authorities); publish the proclamation of a national emergency in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress; maintain records and transmit to Congress all rules and regulations promulgated to carry out such authorities; and provide an accounting of expenditures directly attributable to the exercise of such authorities for every six-month period following the declaration.", "The NEA further provides that a national emergency will end (1) automatically after one year unless the President publishes a notice of renewal in the Federal Register , (2) upon a presidential declaration ending the national emergency, or (3) if Congress enacts a joint resolution terminating the emergency (which would likely require the votes of two-thirds majorities in each house of Congress to override a presidential veto). While the NEA directs each house of Congress to meet every six months to consider whether to end a national emergency by joint resolution, Congress has never met to consider such a vote under that deadline prior to this year.

As a result, they have also contended that the Administration's funding initiatives violate constitutional separation of powers principles and the Appropriations Clause's directive that money may be withdrawn from the Treasury only \"in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" Finally, some plaintiffs have asserted that IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102 does not empower DHS to waive the requirements of NEPA for the border barrier projects being constructed with DOD's assistance because IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102's waiver authority extends only to projects undertaken by DHS.", "After bringing suit, certain plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction, asking the courts to prohibit DOD from implementing its funding initiatives while the litigation was ongoing. On May 24, 2019, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued decisions in the two cases pending in that court\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sierra Club v.

Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094resolving one of the issues presented by the plaintiffs' motion: whether Sections 8005 and 9002 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act authorized the transfer of funds for border barrier construction. ", "The district court determined that it did not for two reasons. It first concluded that this would violate Section 8005's prohibition on transferring funds where \"the item for which funds [were] requested ha[d] been denied by Congress.\" The court also ruled that the Administration's proposed use of Section 8005 was unlawful because DOD's purported need for additional border barrier funding was not an \"unforeseen military requirement,\" as required by Section 8005. Based on this ruling, the court in Sierra Club issued a preliminary injunction barring the Administration from using Section 8005 to transfer funds for border barrier construction while litigation proceeded. The court declined to also issue a preliminary injunction in the California case because (with the Sierra Club injunction in place) the plaintiffs in California could not establish that they would be irreparably harmed by the denial of an injunction.", "Because the plaintiffs' lawsuit preceded DOD's May 9 decision to transfer $1.5 billion to the Drug Interdiction Account, the preliminary injunction applied only to the initial, February 25 transfer of $1 billion to fund projects in New Mexico and Arizona. But in a later decision, the district court applied the reasoning from its initial ruling to conclude that the $1.5 billion transfer, like the first, was not authorized by Section 8005 or Section 9002. The court then issued an order permanently prohibiting the Administration from using either of these provisions to transfer any of the $2.5 billion for border barrier construction.", "The Trump Administration appealed the district court's permanent injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and asked that court to stay the injunction pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied that request, agreeing with the district court that Section 8005 does not authorize the transfer of funds for border barrier construction. However, the Supreme Court subsequently issued an order staying the injunction during the pendency of the litigation. As a result of the Supreme Court's order, the Trump Administration may use Section 8005 to transfer funds for border barrier construction. The district court subsequently issued a permanent injunction against the use of military construction funds as well, but stayed the injunction pending appeal.", "The Texas lawsuit, El Paso County v. Trump , also resulted in a permanent injunction against the Trump Administration's funding scheme for border barrier construction using Section 2808. The district court determined that the use of those provisions to fund border barriers clashed with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (CAA 2019), provision that prohibits the use of appropriated funds \"to increase . . . funding for a program, project, or activity as proposed in the President's budget request for a fiscal year\" unless it is made pursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of an appropriations Act.", "This section discusses the various arguments raised in these lawsuits regarding the lawfulness of the Trump Administration's initiatives for funding border barrier construction. It also discusses the judicial decisions that have resolved, or otherwise opined on, the lawfulness of the Administration's funding initiatives.

Trump concluded that Section 8005 does not authorize the transfer of funds for the construction of border barriers because the transfer was for an \"item\" for which funds had been denied by Congress and, in any event, because the asserted need for the construction of border barriers was not \"unforeseen.\"", "The district court first addressed whether the proposed transfer was for an \"item\" for which Congress had denied funds. In its briefs, the Trump Administration had argued that the relevant \"item for which funds [were] requested\" was DOD's assistance to DHS under 10\u00c2\u00a0U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0284 for \"counterdrug activities,\" not (as the plaintiffs urged) the construction of border barriers generally. Thus, the Administration urged, because Congress had not \"denied\" a request for appropriations for DOD \"counterdrug\" assistance under Section 284, transferring funds for that purpose was not prohibited by Section 8005.", "The district court rejected that argument, concluding instead that the historical context leading up to the transfer\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the previous disagreement between the Administration and Congress on the appropriate funding for border barriers that led to an extended lapse in appropriations\u00e2\u0080\u0094showed that the \"item for which funds [were] requested\" was the construction of border barriers generally, regardless of which agency would undertake construction or the statutory authority on which it might rely. \"[T]he reality is that Congress was presented with\u00e2\u0080\u0094and declined to grant\u00e2\u0080\u0094a $5.7 billion request for border barrier construction,\" the court explained. Thus, \"[b]order barrier construction, expressly, is the item [the Administration] now seek[s] to fund via the Section 8005 transfer, and Congress denied the requested funds for that item.\"", "The court also relied on portions of Section 8005's legislative history to support this conclusion. In particular, the court cited portions of a House report from 1973, which explained that Congress originally adopted the \"denied by Congress\" language to \"'tighten congressional control of the reprogramming process''' and to \"'prevent the funding for programs which have been considered by Congress and for which funding has been denied.'\" In the court's view, an interpretation of Section 8005 that would allow the Administration to transfer money for border barrier construction, despite Congress's refusal to appropriate the amount of money requested for that purpose, would undermine Section 8005's objective.", "The court also determined that Section 8005's transfer authority was unavailable because the Administration's proposed border barrier construction was not an \" unforeseen military requirement[].\" The Administration had argued that the proposed border barrier construction (i.e., the \"military requirement\") was \"unforeseen\" because the need for DOD to provide support to DHS through Section 284 was not known until DHS had requested that assistance\u00e2\u0080\u0094which occurred after the President's budget request and after Congress had passed the DOD appropriations bill with less funding for barrier construction than the Administration had requested.", "The district court rejected this interpretation of Section 8005. On this theory, the court explained, \" every request for Section 284 support\" would be unforeseen because the need to rely on that particular statutory authority would only ever arise when another agency requests DOD's assistance under that provision. The district court also asserted that \"[the Administration's] argument that the need for the requested border barrier construction funding was 'unforeseen' cannot logically be squared with the Administration's multiple requests for funding\" for a border wall.", "Finally, the court invoked the canon of constitutional avoidance to support its reading of Section 8005. Under this rule of statutory interpretation, when there are two possible interpretations of a statute, one of which would raise serious constitutional concerns, courts should adopt the interpretation that avoids the constitutional difficulties. According to the district court, the Administration's interpretation of Section 8005 would \"pose serious problems under the Constitution's separation of powers principles\" because it would allow the executive branch to \"render meaningless Congress's constitutionally-mandated power\" to control federal expenditures by \"ceding essentially boundless appropriations judgment\" to the executive branch. Avoiding these potential pitfalls was, in the court's view, another reason to reject the Administration's broader interpretation of Section 8005.", "On these grounds, the court decided that the plaintiffs would likely succeed on their claim that the Administration could not lawfully use Section 8005 to transfer funds for border barrier construction. Thus, after finding the remaining preliminary injunction requirements satisfied, the court entered an order temporarily prohibiting the Administration from using the $1 billion of funds transferred under Section 8005 to construct the specified border barriers in New Mexico and Arizona.", "After issuing this decision, the parties submitted additional briefing on the lawfulness of the Administration's May 9 decision to use Sections 8005 and 9002 to transfer another $1.5 billion to the Drug Interdiction Account for the construction of border barriers in four additional locations in California and Arizona. On June 28, the district court issued a decision adopting the same reasoning as its earlier opinion.

In reaching that conclusion, the Ninth Circuit first agreed with the district court that the construction of a border barrier was not an \" unforeseen military requirement,\" as required by Section 8005. Like the district court, the Ninth Circuit declared that the relevant \"requirement\" was the construction of border barriers\u00e2\u0080\u0094not, as the Administration contended, the need for DHS to request support from DOD under Section 284.

But even if Section 284 could be read otherwise, the plaintiffs contended that it should not be read broadly here given \"the more specific and recent judgment by Congress\" to appropriate only $1.375 billion for DHS border barrier construction. If there is a \"specific policy embodied in a later statute,\" they argued, that later statute \"should control judicial construction of the earlier broad statute, even though [the latter statute] has not been expressly amended.\"", "Second , the plaintiffs argued that Section 284 does not authorize DOD's proposed border barrier projects because the portion of Section 284 relied on by DOD applies solely to \"block[ing] drug smuggling corridors.\" By contrast, the plaintiffs argued that DOD intended to use \"Section 284\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. as a tool to create a contiguous border wall, not to address specific corridors.\"", "Third , the plaintiffs pointed to a neighboring statutory provision requiring an agency receiving DOD support \"to reimburse [DOD] for that support,\" though DOD may waive this requirement if its support (1) \"is provided in the normal course of military training or operation,\" or (2) \"results in a benefit\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that is substantially equivalent to that which would otherwise obtain from military operations or training.\" The plaintiffs argued that DOD has breached this requirement\u00e2\u0080\u0094thus rendering Section 284 unavailable\u00e2\u0080\u0094because DHS had \"requested support on a 'non-reimbursable basis,'\" but neither of the two exceptions to the reimbursement requirement was met.", "Finally , the plaintiffs argued that DOD's reliance on Section 284 \"violates the core principle that executive branch agencies may not mix and match funds from different accounts to exceed the funding limits Congress imposed.\" In particular, the plaintiffs noted the general rule of appropriations law that \"specific appropriations preclude the use of general ones even when the two appropriations come from different accounts.\" Here, the plaintiffs contended, \"Congress ha[d] allocated a specific amount of funding\" for border barrier construction, precluding \"the government [from] cobbl[ing] together other, more general sources of money to increase funding levels for that same goal.\"", "The Administration responded that the plaintiffs in Sierra Club and California had misconstrued Section 284. The Administration first argued that Section 284 contemplates that DOD may assist with projects other than \"small scale construction,\" as certain provisions in Section 284 \"refer to\u00e2\u0080\u0094but are not limited to\u00e2\u0080\u0094'small scale' or 'minor' construction.\" As to the reimbursement requirement, the Administration asserted that Section 284 itself makes the reimbursement requirement inapplicable to DOD's counterdrug activities, providing that \"[t]he authority provided in this [S]ection [284] for the support of counterdrug activities\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. by [DOD] is\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not subject to the other requirements of this chapter.\" Next, the Administration contended that its proposed border barrier projects satisfied Section 284's \"drug smuggling corridor\" requirement, as the proposed project areas were \"known to have high rates of drug smuggling between the ports of entry.\" Finally, the Administration rejected as \"without merit\" the plaintiffs' argument that its use of Section 284 violated the principle that agencies \"must use the [most] specific appropriation to the exclusion of [a] general appropriation.\" This principle, the Administration contended, applies only when both sources of funding belong to a single agency, not where the appropriations at issue are to different agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, Section 8005 and Section 284 to DOD and $1.375 billion to DHS in its appropriations bill.", "However, the district court in Sierra Club and California ultimately did not resolve this issue because it concluded that Section 8005 does not authorize the transfer of funds to be used by DOD under its Section 284 authority. And, with no district court ruling to review, the Ninth Circuit in Sierra Club also did not address this authority.", "The district court in El Paso County agreed with the plaintiffs on the basis that Congress's appropriation of funds for border barrier construction is a specific statute that should be given precedence over more general statutes. The court stated that \"[a]n appropriation for a specific purpose is exclusive of other appropriations in general terms which might be applicable in the absence of the specific appropriation.\" Moreover, the court held the use of Section 284 funds for border barrier construction was precluded by Section 739 of the CAA 2019, which prohibits the use of appropriated funds to increase funding for a program, project, or activity proposed in the President's budget request beyond what Congress had provided except through reprogramming or transfer actions pursuant to an appropriations act. Because the President had requested $5.7 billion for FY2019 \"for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border\" but Congress had appropriated $1.375 billion to be made on \"construction . . . in the Rio Grande Valley Sector\" alone, the court found that the use of Section 284 funds for the border project amounted to an unlawful increase in funding for that activity using appropriated funds. The court noted that Section 284 is not an appropriations statute and its use was thus not eligible for the exception in Section 739 of the CAA 2019 for reprogramming provisions.

The plaintiffs noted that IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102's waiver authority may be used only for the \"construction of the barriers and roads under this section .\" Because the Administration was relying on DOD authority and appropriations (i.e., Section 284 and the Drug Interdiction Account) to construct the border barriers, the plaintiffs contended that those projects did not meet the statutory requirement and thus were not covered by an IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102 waiver. By contrast, the Administration argued that by requiring DHS to take \"such actions as may be necessary\" to construct additional border barriers, IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102 authorized DHS to request DOD's assistance, and thus the waiver authority applied.", "Ruling for the Administration, the district court in Sierra Club and California held that IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102's waiver authority extends to border projects undertaken by another agency on behalf of DHS, and thus DHS's waivers rendered NEPA inapplicable to the challenged border barrier projects. \"DOD's authority under Section 284 is derivative,\" the court explained, as it may invoke \"its authority [under Section 284] only in response to a request from [another] agency.\" \"Plaintiffs' argument would require the court to conclude that even though it is undisputed that DHS could waive NEPA's requirements if it were paying for the projects out of its own budget, that waiver is inoperative when DOD provides support in response to a request from DHS.\" The court rejected this approach because it found it \"unlikely that Congress intended to impose different NEPA requirements on DOD when it acts in support of DHS's IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102 authority in response to a direct request under Section 284 than would apply to DHS itself.\" The court thus ruled that DHS's waivers applied to the challenged border projects\u00e2\u0080\u0094and all parties agreed that \"the waivers, if applicable, would be dispositive of the NEPA claims.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Forfeiture Fund", "paragraphs": ["The state plaintiffs in California v.

Though the district court declined to grant a preliminary injunction because the plaintiffs had not demonstrated irreparable harm from the Administration's as-yet undetermined plans to divert the funds, the court did express doubt that the definition of \"military construction\" in Section 2808 encompassed border barriers.", "As noted previously, Section 2808 permits reprogramming of funds for \"military construction\" necessary to support the use of the Armed Forces in a national emergency. Military construction is defined to \"include any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military installation,\" which means a \"base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity \" under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department. The Administration relied on the term \"other activity\" and the nonexhaustive word \"includes\" in the definitions related to \"military construction\" to argue that Congress had meant the term \"military construction\" in Section 2808 to be construed broadly. In other words, the government interpreted the definition of military construction to include any sort of construction related to a military installation. This would include any \"other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department,\" which could conceivably include border barriers constructed by DOD.", "The court in Sierra Club rejected that view, explaining that \"the critical language of Section 2801(a) is not the word 'includes,' it is the condition 'with respect to a military installation.'\" Further, the court rebuffed the Administration's reliance on the term \"other activity.\" That language, the court explained, is not unbounded but should be interpreted in context of the words that immediately precede it\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"a base, camp, post, station, yard, [and] center.\" Applying the rule of statutory interpretation that \"a word is known by the company it keeps,\" the court concluded that \"other activity\" refers to similar discrete and traditional military locations.

And because the district court did not rule on this issue the Ninth Circuit did not address it either.", "On December 11, 2019, however, the district court determined that the government's formulation of plans to allocate the military construction funds for 11 border barrier projects made the issue ripe for decision in both the California and Sierra Club cases. Although the court declined to take on the question of whether an emergency requiring the use of troops in fact exists, it found the question of whether the specific projects are \"military construction projects\" that are \"necessary to support such use of the armed forces\" to be suitable for adjudication.", "With respect to the first issue, the court reaffirmed its earlier assessment based on the statutory definitions that such projects have insufficient connection with any military installation to be permissible military construction projects, notwithstanding the government's argument that its taking of administrative jurisdiction over the land for them and assigning it to Fort Bliss in Texas created such a connection. The court was", "not persuaded that Congress intended \"military construction\" to have no stronger connection to a military installation than Defendants' own administrative convenience. If this were true, Defendants could redirect billions of dollars from projects to which Congress appropriated funds to projects of Defendants' own choosing, all without congressional approval (and in fact directly contrary to Congress' decision not to fund these projects).

Goldwater range, are not \"'carried out with respect to a military installation' within the meaning of Section 2808.\"", "The court next addressed whether the 11 barrier projects are \"necessary to support the use of the armed forces,\" and found the government's arguments unconvincing.

This appears to defy the purpose of Section 2808, which specifically refers to construction that is necessary to support the use of the armed forces, not to construction that the armed forces will not use once constructed. Again, Defendants' argument proves too much. Under their theory, any construction could be converted into military construction\u00e2\u0080\u0094and funded through Section 2808\u00e2\u0080\u0094simply by sending armed forces temporarily to provide logistical support to a civilian agency during construction.", "The court concluded that there was \"simply nothing in the record . . . indicating that the eleven border barrier projects\u00e2\u0080\u0094however helpful\u00e2\u0080\u0094are necessary to support the use of the armed forces.\" The court entered a permanent injunction against the 11 proposed border construction projects, but stayed the injunction pending appeal.

Rejecting that argument, the district court in Sierra Club and California held that the plaintiffs had established an \"actual or imminent\" injury that was \"fairly traceable\" to the Trump Administration's proposed transfer of money. The court explained that the supposedly distinct actions of (1) transferring funds and (2) using those transferred funds to construct border barriers were both part of a single objective\u00e2\u0080\u0094the construction of border barriers. And because a sufficiently concrete injury followed from the attainment of that objective, the plaintiffs had standing to challenge government action that was part of the chain of events leading to the injury.

Separately, the House-passed H.R. 2740 would also have limited the general transfer authority under either Sections 8005 or 9002 from being used to transfer funds into or out of the DOD Drug Interdiction Account, and the bill would reduce the overall amount of general transfer authority available under Section 8005 from $4 billion to $1 billion.

Relying on the \"ordinary meaning\" of the term \"deny\" as well as previous decisions by the Comptroller General, GAO concluded that a denial of funds for purposes of Section 8005 required that Congress \"actively refuse\" funds for an item, rather than merely fail to appropriate the full amount requested for that item. Applying this standard, GAO asserted that it could not identify any statutory provision that prohibited DOD from using funds to build border barriers pursuant to its Section 284 authority.
