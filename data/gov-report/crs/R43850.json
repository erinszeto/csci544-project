{"id": "R43850", "title": "Out-of-Pocket Costs for Medicaid Beneficiaries: In Brief", "released_date": "2015-01-07T00:00:00", "summary": ["The federal Medicaid statute and accompanying regulations include provisions that states can apply to certain program beneficiaries with respect to out-of-pocket cost-sharing, including premiums that may be required on a monthly or quarterly basis, enrollment fees that may be applied on an annual or semiannual basis, and point-of-service cost-sharing (e.g., a co-payment to a Medicaid participating provider for a specific covered service received). To implement these options, states must submit Medicaid state plan amendments (SPAs) detailing these provisions to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for approval. This report provides an overview of these federal authorities and includes some state-specific examples."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that, in FY2012, financed the delivery of primary and acute medical services, as well as long-term services and supports, to nearly 57 million people and cost states and the federal government a total of $431 billion. Each state designs and administers its own version of Medicaid under broad federal rules. As a result, there is significant variation across states in terms of who is eligible for coverage, what services are available, and which subgroups of beneficiaries are subject to out-of-pocket costs. Cost-sharing requirements may include participation-related cost-sharing, such as monthly premiums or annual enrollment fees, as well as point-of-service cost-sharing such as co-payments\u2014flat dollar amounts paid directly to providers for services rendered. Similar types of out-of-pocket cost-sharing can apply to individuals enrolled in private health insurance, although the amounts to which such beneficiaries may be subject can be higher than the amounts allowed in Medicaid.", "The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA 1982, P.L. 97-248 , Subtitle B) added to the federal Medicaid statute the authority for states to impose enrollment fees, premiums, or similar charges as well as point-of-service cost-sharing. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ) made additional, major changes to cost-sharing requirements that could be applied to Medicaid beneficiaries, including allowing states to permit providers to deny services when a co-payment requirement is not met. In July 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued new regulations for Medicaid premiums and cost-sharing. ", "Today, participation-related cost-sharing (e.g., premiums) in Medicaid tends to be limited to certain subpopulations, and states use point-of-service cost-sharing more broadly. States can require certain beneficiaries to share in the cost of Medicaid services, but there are limits on (1) the amounts states can impose, (2) the beneficiary groups that can be required to pay, and (3) the services for which cost-sharing can be charged. In general, premiums and enrollment fees are often prohibited. However, premiums may be imposed on enrollees with income above 150% of the federal poverty level (FPL). A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in state fiscal year (SFY) 2013, 39 states had at least one group able to participate in Medicaid by paying a premium, with a total of 59 different premium programs.", "States can also impose point-of-service cost-sharing, such as co-payments, coinsurance, deductibles, and other similar charges, on most Medicaid-covered inpatient and outpatient benefits. However, they cannot impose cost-sharing for emergency services or family planning services and supplies. Some subgroups of beneficiaries are exempt from cost-sharing (e.g., children under 18 years of age and pregnant women). The cost-sharing amounts that can be charged vary with income. In SFY2013, 46 states (including the District of Columbia) reported having co-payment requirements. Higher beneficiary cost-sharing is allowed in certain circumstances, and federal regulations modified some of these provisions. ", "Medicaid premiums and service-related cost-sharing incurred by all individuals in a Medicaid household cannot exceed an aggregate limit of 5% of family income applied on either a monthly or quarterly basis, as specified by the state Medicaid agency. States can use either Medicaid state plan amendments (SPAs) or Section 1115 waiver authority in the Social Security Act to establish both premiums and point-of-service cost-sharing. This report includes examples of both types of beneficiary out-of-pocket spending in Medicaid. ", "Other federal regulations (issued October 1, 2013) address out-of-pocket costs for Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans. State contracts with Medicaid managed care plans must follow the same federal regulations applicable under the state Medicaid plan, and they also must comply with specific regulatory requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Participation-Related Cost-Sharing", "paragraphs": ["To obtain health insurance, certain Medicaid enrollees may be subject to monthly premiums, the most common form of participation-related cost-sharing. Such charges are prohibited under Medicaid for many eligibility subgroups.", "Enrollment fees, premiums or similar charges must adhere to the following rules: a minimum charge of at least $1.00 per month is imposed on (a) one- or two-person families with monthly gross income of $150 or less, (b) three- or four-person families with monthly gross income of $300 or less, and (c) five- or more person families with monthly gross income of $350 or less. Any charge related to gross family income that is above these minimums may not exceed the standards shown in Table 1 :", "Different federal regulations apply to certain Medicaid subgroups for families with income exceeding 150% FPL (see Table 2 ). Except for premiums applicable to Medicaid beneficiaries classified as medically needy, the state Medicaid agency may choose to terminate individuals' Medicaid coverage on the basis of failure to pay for 60 days or more. ", " Table 2 provides information about optional premiums that states can choose to apply to specific Medicaid subgroups with income that exceeds 150% FPL. For several of these subgroups, states are allowed to set premiums on a sliding scale based on family income. Other caveats apply to specific subgroups, also identified in this table. As of SFY2013, a total of 39 states indicated that at least one group participated in Medicaid by paying premiums, and 11 states and the District of Columbia did not require premiums under Medicaid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Service-Related Cost-Sharing", "paragraphs": ["Beneficiary out-of-pocket payments to providers at the time of service can take three forms. A deductible is a specified dollar amount paid for certain services rendered during a specific time period (e.g., per month or quarter) before health insurance (e.g., Medicaid) begins to pay for care. Coinsurance is a specified percentage of the cost or charge for a specific service delivered. A co - payment is a specified dollar amount for each item or service delivered. Deductibles and coinsurance are infrequently used in Medicaid, but co-payments are applied to some services and groups.", "Federal rules place limits on which services cost-sharing can be applied to (including which specific services are exempt, discussed below) and what amounts can be charged. Cost-sharing can be charged for allowed services regardless of income, but the maximum amount can be substantially higher for individuals with incomes greater than 100% FPL. Table 3 provides a comparison of the maximum charges allowed for service-related cost-sharing applicable to outpatient services and inpatient stays for three family income subgroups.", " Table 4 provides a comparison of maximum allowable charges for service-related cost-sharing for prescription drugs (preferred and non-preferred) as well as nonemergency use of an emergency department, also based on family income. Some services are exempt from co-payments, including, for example, emergency use of emergency departments.", "Apart from point-of-service cost-sharing for drugs and nonemergency services provided in an emergency department (described in Table 4 ), federal regulations specify that the maximum allowable cost-sharing dollar amounts will increase annually, beginning October 1, 2015, for certain Medicaid enrollees. Specifically, for individuals with income at or below 100% FPL, the maximum allowable cost-sharing amounts must increase each year by the percentage increase in the medical care component of the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) for the period of September to September of the preceding calendar year, rounded to the next higher 5-cent increment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Optional Targeted Cost-Sharing for Specific Medicaid Subgroups", "paragraphs": ["Federal Medicaid regulations allow states to target cost-sharing to specific subgroups.

Five states (Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Texas) had no co - payment requirements. Two states indicated that co - payments were enforceable (e.g., providers are allowed to deny services when a co - payment requirement is not met). In Arkansas, such enforceability applies to co - payments for adults with income over 100% FPL (pending waiver approval). Maine plans to make pharmacy co -p ayments enforceable for those with income over 100% FPL.

Higher co - payment amounts for a non-preventive physician visit applied to children in families with income at 201% FPL and ranged from a low of $0.50 in Georgia to a high of $25 in Utah and Texas.
