A reasonable interpretation of this definition suggests that to be considered an electronic communication service provider under 18 U.S.C. 2510(15), a library must independently operate the means by which transmission, routing, and connection of digital communication occurs. In contrast, a local county library likely has a service contract with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to furnish the library with the electronic communication service, as many businesses and individuals do; the fact that the library has set up a computer with Internet access for the use of its patrons probably does not, by itself, turn the library into a communications service \"provider.\" Under this characterization, the actual \"provider\" of Internet access is the ISP, not the library. Therefore, a public library offering \"basic\" Internet access would likely not be considered an electronic communication service provider, at least for purposes of being an entity subject to the NSL provisions in 18 U.S.C. 2709."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Oversight of NSLs", "paragraphs": ["Section 118 of the Act requires that any reports to a Congressional committee regarding NSLs shall also be provided to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.

Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to authorize the installation and use of multipoint, or \"roving,\" wiretaps, for foreign intelligence investigations. A roving wiretap order applies to the suspect rather than a particular phone or computer that the target might use, and thus allows law enforcement officials to use a single wiretap order to cover any communications device that the target uses or may use. Without this authority, investigators must seek a new FISA court order each time they need to change the name of the location to be monitored, as well as the specified person or entity that is needed to assist in facilitating the wiretap.", "Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act permits a general command for the assistance of third parties (for example, common carriers and Internet service providers) for the installation and use of these multipoint wiretaps, where the target of the surveillance has taken steps to thwart the identification of a communications company or other person whose assistance may be needed to carry out the surveillance. Thus, if the FISA court finds that the target's actions may have the effect of thwarting specific identification, section 206 temporarily authorizes FISA orders that need not specifically identify the communications carriers, landlords or others whose assistance the order commands.", "Prior to the enactment of the Act, a FISA roving surveillance order had to specify the identity of the target only if it was known; otherwise, it was sufficient for the order to describe the target. Section 108 of the Act amends the FISA roving surveillance authority to require that an application for an order, as well as the wiretap order itself, describe the specific target of the electronic surveillance if the target's identity is not known. It also clarifies that the FISA court must find that the prospect of a target thwarting surveillance is based on specific facts in the application. Furthermore, if the government begins to direct surveillance at a new facility or place, the nature and location of which were unknown at the time the original surveillance order was issued, the government must notify the FISA court within 10 days after such change, of the following information:", "the nature and location of each new facility or place at which the surveillance is directed, the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify the applicant's belief that each new facility or place is or was being used, or is about to be used, by the target of the surveillance, an explanation of any proposed minimization procedures that differ from those contained in the original application or order, if such change is necessitated by the new facility or place, and the total number of electronic surveillances that have been or are being conducted under the roving surveillance order.", "The Act also enhances congressional oversight over the use of all foreign intelligence electronic surveillance authority, by adding the Senate Judiciary Committee as a recipient of the semi-annual FISA reports that the Attorney General currently must submit to the House and Senate Intelligence committees, and by modifying the FISA report requirements to include a description of the total number of applications made for orders approving roving electronic surveillance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delayed Notice Search Warrants", "paragraphs": ["A delayed notice search warrant, or \"sneak and peek\" warrant, is one that authorizes law enforcement officers to secretly enter a home or business, either physically or virtually, conduct a search, and depart without taking any tangible evidence or leaving notice of their presence.

At the time, the courts were divided over whether the failure to provide contemporaneous notice, in the absence of exigent circumstances, constituted a constitutional violation or a violation of the Rule, and over the extent of permissible delay in cases presenting exigent circumstances. Section 213 of the USA PATRIOT Act created an express statutory authority for delayed notice search warrants in any criminal investigation, not just those involving suspected terrorist activity. Delayed notification of the execution of a sneak and peek search warrant is permissible for a reasonable period of time (with the possibility of court-approved extensions for good cause shown), if:", "the court that issued the warrant finds reasonable cause to believe that contemporaneous notice of the search may result in adverse consequences (flight, destruction of evidence, intimidation of a witness, danger to an individual, serious jeopardy to an investigation, or undue trial delay), and the warrant prohibits the seizure of any tangible property, any wire or electronic communication, and any stored wire or electronic information, except where the court finds reasonable necessity for the seizure.", "Responding to concerns that the \"reasonable period\" for delaying notification of a search warrant is an undefined and indefinite standard under current law, section 114 of the Act establishes a specific limitation on the length of the delay, requiring notice to be given no more than 30 days after the date of the warrant's execution, with the possibility for 90 day extensions if the facts of a case justify. Several Members of Congress have criticized this 30-day delayed notice provision, arguing instead for notice to be given to the target of the search warrant within 7 days. However, it should be noted that the Act's 30-day delay period was itself a compromise between the House and Senate-passed versions of the Reauthorization Act; the House bill allowed 180 days, while the Senate limited the delay to 7 days.", "In addition, section 114 removes \"unduly delaying a trial\" as one of the \"adverse consequences\" that justifies delayed notification. Some commentators have noted that \"seriously jeopardizing an investigation,\" which is retained by the Act as a ground for permitting delayed notice, is an overly broad \"catch-all\" provision that law enforcement officials could abuse. There may also be some question of whether it qualifies as a constitutionally acceptable exigent circumstance. However, Justice Department officials defend this provision, observing that before the delayed notice can be approved, a federal judge must agree with the government's evaluation of the circumstances that indicate that contemporaneous notice of a search might seriously jeopardize an ongoing investigation.", "Finally, section 114 enhances oversight of delayed notice search warrants, by requiring that no later than 30 days after the expiration or denial of such a warrant, the issuing or denying judge must notify the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts of:", "the fact that the delayed notice search warrant was applied for, the fact that the warrant was either granted, modified, or denied, the length of time of the delay in giving notice, and the offense specified in the warrant or the application.", "Beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, the Director of the Administrative Office is required to transmit a detailed, annual report to Congress that summarizes the use and number of warrants authorizing delayed notice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emergency Disclosures by Service Providers", "paragraphs": ["Section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act permits electronic communications service providers to disclose voluntarily the contents of stored electronic communications to a Federal, State, or local governmental entity in emergency situations involving a risk or danger of death or serious physical injury to any person.
