If a family is using a voucher to lease an apartment but funding is notsufficient to renew it, then the family will lose its assistance and likely lose its current housing. Priorto FY2004, HUD funded PHAs based on the number of vouchers they were using and the cost ofthose vouchers. If costs went up or PHAs were able to use more of their vouchers, they receivedadditional funds to cover those costs.

This new formula was designedto contain the growing cost of the program. Many PHAs and low-income housing advocatesopposed the new formula, arguing that it left many agencies with inadequate funding to maintaintheir programs.

Unlike the House bill and the President's request, the Senate bill would not havefunded agencies based on the funding they received in FY2005 plus inflation. Rather, agencieswould have received renewal funding based on their voucher costs and leasing over the past 12months, plus inflation, and pro-rated to fit within the amount appropriated. Low-income housingand PHA groups advocated for this use of more recent data.

Beginning in FY2003, at Congress's direction, HUDchanged the way it distributed administrative fees, providing agencies with a pro-rata share of theamount appropriated for administrative fees, based on what they had received in the previous year.

The proposed increase was attributed partly to the needs of the HOPE VI program andpartly to a new rule that HUD stated would be published in 2005 that would permit the Secretary ofHUD to require the conversion of public housing to vouchers, a practice called MandatoryConversion. The report accompanying the House-passed version of H.R. 3058 expressed doubt that the mandatory conversion rule would be implemented before the end ofFY2006, and therefore proposed to fund tenant-protection vouchers at roughly the same level as lastyear (an increase of about 3%). The Senate version expressed the same doubt about the mandatoryconversion rule and noted that, for many of the units that would be subject to the rule, HOPE VIremains a viable option.

The accompanying conference report directs the Secretary toreport to the Appropriations Committee 30days before taking funds from other accounts.", "Voucher Reform Legislation. Beyond funding levels,the FY2006 budget documents also stated that the President intends to introduce a new proposal toreform the tenant-based voucher program. One purpose for this reform proposal is to contain, if notreduce, the cost of the program. According to the President's budget summary: \"Section 8's programcosts are cannibalizing every HUD program -- at the same time waiting lists of families seekinghousing continue to grow.\" The Congressional Budget Justifications state that this new proposal willprovide additional flexibility to PHAs, which will enable them to run their programs more effectivelyand efficiently and better respond to the current budget-based funding structure in the program. Reform proposals were also submitted as a part of the FY2004 and FY2005 budgets, althoughcongressional action was not taken on either.

It would replace the current voucher program with a new program,called the Flexible Voucher Program, which would have fewer rules and regulations than the currentprogram, would provide for greater discretion in administering the program for both the Secretaryof HUD and for PHAs, and, low-income housing advocates contend, would also provide fewerresources and protections for very poor families.
