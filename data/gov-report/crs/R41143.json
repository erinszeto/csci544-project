{"id": "R41143", "title": "Europe\u2019s Preferential Trade Agreements: Status, Content, and Implications", "released_date": "2011-11-15T00:00:00", "summary": ["Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) comprise a variety of arrangements that favor member parties over nonmembers by extending tariff and other nontariff preferences. PTAs, particularly free trade agreements (FTAs), have proliferated in recent years. In the post-war period, the European Union (EU), which is a PTA itself, has developed the largest network of PTAs in the world. The main findings of this report are as follows.", "Historically, Europe's PTAs have differed among its partners in terms of provisions and commitments and they have been characterized by relatively modest ambition in terms of market-opening. In comparison, the U.S. approach has been more standardized in terms of its provisions and more focused on achieving reciprocal market access. These differences in approaches, however, have significantly narrowed since the EU adopted its more commercially oriented Global Europe strategy in 2006. EU PTAs cover nearly twice as much trade (exports) in percentage terms (70% versus 40%) and seven times as much in value terms ($3.4 trillion versus $0.52 trillion) than U.S. PTAs. These numbers can be used to support the argument that U.S. firms may face more discrimination and possibly reduced sales than EU firms. At the same time, the data may overstate the degree of discrimination because the amount of trade covered by PTAs is not the same as the amount of trade conducted on a preferential (duty-free) basis. Concerns about trade discrimination have been a factor in U.S. and EU efforts to negotiate and implement separate but similar PTAs with five trading partners (Israel, Mexico, Morocco, Chile, and Jordan). Based on market share data analyzed, neither side appears to have gained a competitive advantage from having negotiated a PTA. This, however, does not mean that individual firms and workers have not benefitted or that exports have not risen at faster rates after the PTA became effective. In the past, Europe's PTA program has not been a major factor affecting U.S. FTA policy, which currently is in flux. However, Europe's recently completed FTA with South Korea raises the concern that U.S. exports will be disadvantaged due to the duty-free price advantage European-based producers will gain in the Korean market. The United States has also negotiated an FTA with Korea, which awaits approval in Korea parliament (Congress approved the agreement in 2011). Ongoing negotiations between the EU and Canada over a comprehensive FTA could also affect the U.S. FTA debate. If a robust agreement is reached, the EU and the United States would then both have FTAs with Canada and Mexico, making the absence of a FTA between the United States and EU all the more glaring after years of discussion.", "It is not clear where Europe's PTA policy is headed. There are only a few remaining major developed countries that fall outside the EU's network of PTAs, including the United States, China, Japan, Russia and Australia. While PTA negotiations with these countries could yield large economic benefits and provide a big impact (for good or ill) on the world trading system, some of these countries would likely demand liberalization of European agriculture and services, areas where there is widespread opposition in Europe."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) comprise a variety of unilateral, bilateral, or regional arrangements which favor member parties over nonmembers by extending tariff and other nontariff preferences. The most prevalent PTA today is a free trade agreement (FTA), such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the U.S.-Australian FTA. PTAs are excepted under certain circumstances from the nondiscrimination clause of the multilateral world trading system. The World Trade Organization (WTO) permits countries to enter into PTAs under certain conditions, but the criteria are very elastic, and the examination by the WTO as to their consistency with WTO rules has not been rigorous.", "The main dispute is whether PTAs serve as a building block or a stumbling block for further multilateral trade liberalization. If PTAs, on balance, create more trade (by allowing production to shift to the more competitive producers in the agreement) than they divert (by shifting trade from lower-cost non-PTA members to higher-cost members because of tariff preferences extended to members), they are said to be a building block or complement for the world trading system. On the other hand, if the converse is true, PTAs are considered to be a stumbling block for the multilateral trading system. However, it is very difficult to determine quantitatively whether trade creation or trade diversion dominates in any particular PTA. This is because the effects of the agreements on the patterns of trade and investment can depend on the content of the PTA as well as the size and magnitude of the barriers being reduced.", "What is not disputed is that PTAs have grown and become the centerpiece of world trade diplomacy as countries seek to improve access to foreign markets for their exporters and investors. With weakening momentum for multilateral trade liberalization, PTAs, particularly FTAs, have proliferated markedly in recent years. The annual average number of PTA notifications since the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995 has been 20, compared to less than 3 per year during the 1948-1995 period under the GATT. Many more bilateral and regional agreements are being negotiated\u2014an estimated 60 PTAs in Asia alone\u2014in all parts of the world. The share of world trade now covered by PTAs is estimated to be around 50%. ", "In the post-war period, the European Union (EU) has been central to the proliferation of PTAs. The EU itself, initially established in 1957 as the European Economic Community, is the world's largest preferential agreement. Of the 199 PTAs in force and notified to the WTO by December 2008, or to its predecessor organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 35 involved the EU, making the EU's network of PTAs the largest in the world. ", "As a result of its widespread PTAs (including unilateral preference programs), the EU trades with only 10 WTO members where the most-favored-nation (MFN) regime applies in its entirety. These 10 WTO members (Australia, Canada, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States) accounted for 43.9% of the EU's total merchandise imports in 2009, up from 40.4% in 2008. ", "After imposing a moratorium on negotiating new PTAs from 1999-2006, the EU in 2007 began negotiating a new generation of more ambitious or comprehensive FTAs. These agreements are intended to obtain greater commercial and trade benefits than previous FTAs, as well as to be comprehensive in scope and \"WTO-Plus\" (going beyond current WTO commitments). If the EU's new FTAs follow this template, they are likely to be more similar to the FTAs negotiated in recent years by the United States\u2014FTAs which are often referred to as state-of-the art or \"gold standard\" agreements.", "As outlined in its 2006 Global Europe strategy, the EU targeted a number of larger countries and regions for negotiations, including South Korea, India, Canada, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Others had already started at a point in time (MERCSUR) or were subsequently added (Canada). Whether the EU will be successful with a more ambitious and comprehensive agenda of FTAs remains to be seen. ", "Coincidentally, the EU change in FTA strategy has come at a time when the U.S. FTA policy has moved toward a \"holding pattern\" or \"pause.\" Legislation granting the President authority to negotiate FTAs expired in July 2007 and has not been renewed by Congress. All four FTAs negotiated or under negotiation in 2007\u2014South Korea, Panama, Columbia, and Peru\u2014have been approved by Congress so the Obama Administration's major current trade initiative has been to engage in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement negotiations. In the meantime, calls from the U.S. business community sector have increased for a more activist U.S. FTA policy, much out of fear of losing export sales and market share to EU competitors who may be gaining more favorable access to larger foreign markets as a result of new PTAs. Given the need for the U.S. economy to rely on an increase in exports for faster growth, these concerns have also resonated in Congress and the Obama Administration.

The second compares the content and trade coverage of Europe's PTAs to U.S. PTAs.

A fourth category involves more distant countries and regions where the primary EU objective is to neutralize potential discrimination against EU exports and investments resulting from FTAs between third countries or to secure commercial benefits via preferential access to foreign markets. ", "Unlike the United States, the EU has not used a standard model for its PTAs. The EU's web of PTAs is characterized by different trade liberalization agendas and trading rules. All agreements appear to be negotiated in a flexible manner to suit the EU and its partners in each specific case. ", "The EU's PTAs are also negotiated under a range of different kinds of agreements. The most typical is an Association Agreement (AA), which creates a framework for cooperation on a range of political, security, economic, trade, and human rights issues.

As suggested by the LSE study, \"the objective of obtaining reciprocal market access drives the [U.S.] process and there is little scope for asymmetry of commitments.\" ", "Until completion of its recent FTA with South Korea, Europe's PTAs have been characterized by differentiation, flexibility, and relatively modest ambition in terms of market-opening. The EU has differentiated among its partners in terms of provisions and commitments. The content of EU agreements has varied depending on a number of factors, including the level of development of its partners, how important they are for European security, and in which sectors they constitute a competitive challenge. For example, near neighbors and potential accession states were expected to sign up to the full acquis communanutaire . Euro-Med partners were offered free trade in industrial goods, but were provided exclusions for sensitive agricultural products. Agreements with the ACP states provided preferential access to the EU market, long transition periods, and financial assistance. On the other hand, agreements with emerging markets tend to match what the United States or other countries have achieved through PTAs.

On a range of issues, the EU, for example, has been willing to accept modest commitments on the part of its developing country PTA partners.

The most prominent example is a reduction of tariffs on industrial and agricultural products going beyond what is already committed to in the WTO context. Examples of other provisions that can be WTO-plus include obligations concerning customs administration, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, technical barriers to trade (TBT), trade remedies (countervailing duty and antidumping), services (obligations covered by the General Agreement on Trade in Services or GATS), government procurement, state trading enterprises, state aid, and intellectual property rights (IPR) that fall under the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement. Table 1 provides a list and description of 14 such WTO-plus provisions that have been incorporated into U.S. and EU PTAs.", "The Bruegel analysis of WTO-plus provisions contained in 28 different agreements (14 U.S. PTAs and 14 EU PTAs) found a \"fairly high degree of similarity\" of coverage in the two sets of agreements. Both sets of agreements contained obligations covering substantially the same areas. Differences in terms of coverage related mainly to services, trade-related investment measures, and the enforceability of the provisions. Trade-related services obligations were included in all U.S. agreements, but in only four EU agreements. Most U.S. agreements included trade-related investment obligations, but none of the EU agreements did. The U.S. agreements also had substantially more legally enforceable obligations concerning trade-related investment measures, technical barriers to trade, and services, while the EU agreements contained significantly more obligations of this kind concerning state trading enterprises.", "The LSE analysis, based on a smaller sampling of PTAs, focused more on substantive differences in WTO-plus provisions. On the central issue of tariffs, the U.S. FTAs provided for almost 100% elimination of U.S. tariffs by the end of a transition period for industrial products. While this was very nearly the case for agricultural products, there remained some U.S. tariff-rate quotas. In return, the U.S. PTA partners agreed to a gradual elimination of all tariff lines. U.S. PTA partners, however, make use of more extensive transition times to protect sensitive industries. ", "Compared to the United States, according to the LSE analysis, the EU's tariff cuts also approach nearly 100% coverage of industrial products, but they exclude relatively more agricultural lines. Significant parts of EU agricultural products such as beef, poultry, dairy, olive oil, rice, barley, wheat, rye, sugar, and wine are often excluded from tariff reductions or liberalization. The EU-South Africa PTA, for example, excluded over 280 agricultural tariff lines. Coverage also varies from PTA partner to PTA partner, reflecting potential competition for EU agriculture. The EU agreements also tend to be more flexible towards partner countries, including provision for the PTA partner to reintroduce tariffs if they are needed as part of an infant industry strategy.", "According to the LSE analysis, U.S. PTAs tend to be significantly WTO-plus in the coverage of services and IPR. In terms of services, U.S agreements are judged to go beyond the GATS obligations in both financial services and telecommunications services. U.S. sector coverage of services is also based on the more liberalizing \"negative\" list approach compared to the GATS approach of a combination of positive and negative lists. Regarding IPR protection, U.S. PTA's are also seen as WTO-plus, progressively extending the 50-year terms of copyright to 75 years required by the TRIPS Agreement and the minimum term of trademark protection from 7 to 10 years. ", "The EU treatment of services and IPR, according to the LSE study, is less ambitious than the U.S. approach. On services provisions, the EU uses a positive-list approach that provides the flexibility to exclude sensitive sectors both for itself and its trading partners. On IPR provisions, the EU tends to stress compliance with existing international standards of protection for IPR, rather than pressing for provisions that go beyond specific WTO-plus obligations (i.e., TRIPs.) The EU also, according to the LSE report, seeks to use PTAs to promote its case for TRIPs-plus protection for geographical indicators, a policy initiative that has faced considerable opposition from the United States and other trading partners.", "In some provisions, the LSE study determined that both the U.S. and EU PTAs have remained WTO-consistent and not WTO-plus. This is generally the case for trade remedies such as countervailing duty and antidumping measures where neither side allows PTAs to impose any additional disciplines on these procedures. At the same time, U.S. PTAs have consistently applied time limitations on the use of safeguard actions that are tighter than those found in the WTO. ", "In one area involving SPS measures, the LSE study considered the EU approach to be WTO-minus. This was because the EU agreements call for an interpretation of the WTO SPS agreement that allows for social as well as science-based risk assessment and risk management (i.e., an interpretation of WTO SPS agreement that is less science focused). By taking nonscientific considerations into account, particularly in its interpretation of the \"precautionary\" principle, the EU approach arguably could be used to more easily restrict trade on public-health and safety grounds.

Of the 28 agreements analyzed, the Bruegel study determined that the 14 EU agreements contain almost four times as many instances of WTO-extra provisions as do the 14 U.S. agreements. The study also judged that there has been an increasing tendency to this effect as more recent EU agreements have incorporated an even greater number of WTO-extra provisions.", "The Bruegel study also found that only 8 of the 38 WTO-extra provisions included in either U.S. or EU PTAs involved legally enforceable obligations. Three of these eight areas are included in both U.S. and EU agreements: intellectual property rights, investment, and movement of capital. Three areas concern mostly or solely U.S. agreements: anti-corruption, environment, and labor. Two areas involve EU agreements only: competition policy and social matters. Provisions relating to terrorism, illegal immigration, visa and immigration, and illegal drugs appear in only some EU agreements.", "Although both sets of agreements contain a significant number of WTO-extra provisions, the number of legally enforceable WTO-extra provisions contained in either the U.S. or EU PTAs is quite small. Provisions that can be regarded as breaking new ground compared to existing WTO agreements, according to the Bruegel study, are limited to the environment and labor standards for the U.S. agreements and competition policy for the EU agreements. These provisions all deal with regulatory issues, many of which have been the subject of previous U.S. and EU attempts to incorporate into the WTO rules, often against the wishes of developing countries. Based on the fact that the new, legally enforceable WTO-extra provisions all deal with regulatory issues, the Bruegel study concludes that EU and U.S. agreements effectively serve as a means for the two sides to export their own regulatory regimes to their FTA partners.

Any evaluation depends heavily on whether one uses as a basis of comparison the EU's exports to the world (extra-EU27 trade) or the EU's total exports (extra-EU27 trade plus intra-EU27 trade).", "Concerning the first argument that U.S. firms are falling behind, a case can be made that the EU's total trade (extra plus intra-EU27 exports) is an appropriate measure. This is because the EU itself is a PTA that discriminates against U.S. exporters as well as all nonmembers. Thus, it is possible to maintain that the EU's PTAs cover nearly twice as much exports in percentage terms (70% versus 40%) and seven times as much in value terms ($3.4 trillion versus $0.52 trillion) than U.S. PTAs. At the same time, this argument may be overstated because the data are upwardly biased due to the fact that the amount of trade covered by preferential agreements is not the same as the amount of trade that is conducted on a preferential basis. ", "Concerning the second argument that the EU's participation in PTAs may allow it to gain more control of the international trade agenda, a case can be made that EU exports to the world (extra-EU27 trade) is the more appropriate measure. This is because both the EU and United States are free to set their own regulatory standards, and the fact that the EU is a PTA provides no discriminatory advantage. Thus, it is possible to maintain that EU exports to the world are the most appropriate measure. Under this situation, the regulatory extension argument is basically a wash given that the U.S. and EU share of exports covered by existing PTAs are nearly identical in value terms ($520 billion for the U.S. and $511 billion for the EU).

The underlying premise may have been that smaller countries or regions would be willing to deliver cuts in their own protective barriers on a nonreciprocal basis because the EU offered a much bigger market that would facilitate increases in export volume.", "To move forward, these same observers maintain that the EU should examine the idea of targeting bigger economies for bilateral negotiations. These would be the handful of remaining countries that fall outside the EU's network of PTAs, namely the United States, China, Japan, and Australia. PTA negotiations with these countries, it is argued, could yield significant economic benefits and provide the biggest impact (for good or ill) on the world trading system.

Rejecting the notion that opening export markets will strengthen the competitiveness of European companies, these observers advocate placing greater emphasis on unilateral liberalization of protected sectors and domestic market reforms. In addition to reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, these economists propose completing a single market for services by ending barriers that member states still impose against suppliers from other member states on the grounds of regulatory differences. They argue that the absence of a more dynamic European-wide services sector raise the prices of services relative to goods, and prevents the EU from trading off its agricultural protectionism for better access for its industrial and services firms. If Europe is not prepared to extend improved market access to exports of services and agriculture, foreign countries are likely to maintain barriers against Europe's industrial and services firms.

For the United States the possibilities include intensified regulatory cooperation with the goal of developing common standards, sector specific initiatives to remove barriers to trade, or the elimination of all tariffs on manufactured goods. For China, where negotiations with the EU currently take place under the rubric of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCA), an improved PCA is put forth by some observers as an alternative way (from a multilateral agreement or a FTA) of dealing with bilateral trade tensions and negotiating better market access for European companies.", "In considering alternative trade liberalization approaches, many stakeholders in Europe no doubt will emphasize a need to place renewed emphasis and priority on concluding multilateral agreements.
