However, each provision in current law applies to different federal agencies and/or funds. ", "The earliest provision, and the only one that is permanent law, applies to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As initially enacted, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ) generally barred DHS from contracting with any \"foreign incorporated entity\" that met the definition of inverted domestic corporation given by the act. (See \" Can the restrictions be waived? \" for a discussion of waivers of this prohibition.) Subsequently, Section 835 was amended ( P.L. 108-334 , \u00c2\u00a7523) to bar contracting with subsidiaries of inverted domestic corporations, as well as the corporations themselves.", "Subsequent measures have generally been modeled on the Homeland Security Act, although their restrictions apply only to specific funds. Initially, the measures reached funds \"appropriated or otherwise made available\" to specified agencies under particular acts, such as the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006 ( P.L. 109-115 , \u00c2\u00a7724).

However, an entity is not treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, post-inversion, the foreign corporation and its expanded affiliated group (the companies connected to it by at least 50% ownership) have \"substantial business activities\" in its home country when compared to the group's total business activities. There are analogous rules for partnerships.", "This definition of \"inverted domestic corporation\" is based on Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which treats corporations meeting these criteria as domestic corporations for U.S. tax purposes, thus significantly limiting the tax benefits of the inversion. However, there are differences between the contracting restrictions and the IRC provision. For example, the IRC provision applies only to inversions completed after March 3, 2003, while the contracting restrictions contain no such limitation. Another key difference is that, while both have the 80% ownership threshold, the IRC provision also captures situations where the former shareholders of the U.S. corporation own between 60% and 80% of the foreign corporation after the inversion (in these cases, the entity is treated as foreign but limited in its ability to claim credits and deductions). Furthermore, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has promulgated regulations defining and clarifying certain terms and concepts for purposes of IRC Section 7874, which are not applicable to the contracting prohibitions. For example, IRS regulations define \"substantial business activities\" to mean that at least 25% of the expanded affiliate group's employees, employee compensation, assets, and income must be in or derived from the foreign country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Can the restrictions be waived?", "paragraphs": ["All the restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations have provided for waivers, although the circumstances in which such waivers are permitted have varied in different enactments. Initially, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ) provided that the prohibition \"shall\" be waived if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that a waiver is required \"in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that it would otherwise not incur.\" However, Congress subsequently amended the waiver provisions of the Homeland Security Act in 2003-2004, first by striking the provisions about job loss and additional costs ( P.L. 108-7 , \u00c2\u00a7101(2)) and later by changing \"homeland security\" to \"national security\" ( P.L. 108-334 , \u00c2\u00a7523). The Homeland Security Act's waiver provisions, as amended, generally served as a model for later provisions, although Congress in 2005 ( P.L. 109-115 , \u00c2\u00a7724(b)(2)) added a requirement that agencies waiving the prohibition on contracting with inverted domestic corporations on national security grounds report such waivers to Congress.

Under FASA, as amended, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (Council) has arguably broad discretion as to which laws to list in Subpart 12.5.

This is because, prior to December 15, 2014, FAR \u00c2\u00a79.108-2 expressly referenced the FY2012 appropriations act, but did not mention any later provisions.

Agencies use both responsibility determinations and exclusion in an effort to avoid nonresponsible contractors , or contractors who may be unlikely to perform the contract work on time and in a satisfactory manner. However, responsibility determinations and exclusion involve different processes, and contractors' rights in these processes also differ. ", "A responsibility determination is a contract-specific determination as to whether a prospective awardee meets certain criteria prescribed by statute and elaborated upon by regulation (e.g., adequate financial resources; satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics). One of these criteria is that the contractor be \"otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.\" This criterion encompasses the so-called \"collateral requirements,\" or other provisions of law specifying when contractors are disqualified from or ineligible for awards. The prohibitions upon contracting with inverted domestic corporations discussed in this report are such provisions, making them collateral requirements of responsibility. ", "Agencies generally may not award a contract to a contractor who is non-responsible under the relevant criteria. However, determinations as to responsibility are made on a contract-by-contract basis. Once an entity can satisfy the criteria\u00e2\u0080\u0094including any collateral requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094it could be found to be affirmatively responsible. In other words, it is not barred from contracting with the government for any period of time, unlike with exclusion, as discussed below. ", "Exclusion , in contrast, is imposed for certain causes specified by statute or regulation (e.g., fraud in obtaining or performing a government contract, intentional misuse of the \"Made in America\" designation), and generally lasts for a prescribed period of time. Specifically, debarments under the FAR last for a \"period commensurate with the seriousness of the cause(s),\" generally not exceeding three years, while suspension lasts as long as any agency investigation of the underlying conduct or ensuing legal proceeding. Contractors who are excluded are generally barred not only from new contracts (or other purchases) from any government agency, but also from serving as a subcontractor on certain contracts or as an individual surety on a government contract. ", "Another important distinction between responsibility determinations and exclusion is that contractors have generally not been seen as entitled to due process, in the form of notice and an opportunity for a hearing, when they are determined nonresponsible, while they have been found to be entitled to due process when they are excluded. However, the legal rationale underlying this distinction\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, that a determination of nonresponsibility applies only to an individual contract\u00e2\u0080\u0094could potentially be called into question by collateral requirements like those as to inverted domestic corporations. Other collateral requirements arguably either pertain to conduct that is contract-specific (e.g., failure to agree to an acceptable subcontracting plan as a term of a particular contract ), or that would not serve to effectively bar entities from doing any business with the federal government (e.g., felons prohibited from participating in the contract security guard program of the Federal Protective Service) .

Presidents have, for example, relied on their authority under FPASA to bar federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin (Executive Order 8802, June 25, 1941), and to require them to take affirmative action to ensure that job applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin (Executive Order 11246, October 12, 1965, as amended). Sections 201 and 205(a) of FPASA could similarly serve as the basis for executive action to restrict contracting with inverted domestic corporations.", "A few actions have, however, been found to have been outside the President's authority under FPASA, either because their link to economy and efficiency in procurement was too attenuated, or because they were specifically barred by a federal statute. Here, at least one commentator has suggested that executive action barring agencies from contracting with inverted domestic corporations could perhaps be said to be barred by the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA, P.L. 98-369 ) of 1984, as amended. CICA generally requires agencies to \"obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures\" when awarding contracts, and defines full and open competition to mean that \"all responsible sources are permitted to submit sealed bids or competitive proposals on the procurement.\" Thus, an argument could be made that barring agencies from awarding contracts to inverted domestic corporations runs afoul of CICA by effectively excluding these sources from the competition. On the other hand, federal law defines a responsible source as one that is, among other things, \"qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.\" Thus, an argument could also be made that, if the President barred the award of contracts to inverted domestic corporations, such corporations would not be responsible sources because they would no longer be eligible for award under the applicable regulations (i.e., the regulations promulgated to implement the executive action).

Where it applies, the Buy American Act generally requires that any \"end products\" or \"construction\" materials be mined or produced in the United States, in the case of unmanufactured items ; or manufactured in the United States \"substantially all\" from items mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, in the case of manufactured items . The regulations implementing the Buy American Act further provide that items are manufactured \"substantially all\" from items mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States if either (1) at least 50% of the costs of their components are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, or (2) the item is a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item. End products or construction materials that satisfy the act's requirements qualify as \"domestic,\" regardless of the offeror's nationality. Purchases of services are generally not subject to the Buy American Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What about other restrictions on contracting with foreign corporations?", "paragraphs": ["Foreign corporations\u00e2\u0080\u0094or corporations that are not incorporated or legally organized within the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not per se excluded from contracting with the U.S. government. There are certain provisions of federal law that expressly or effectively preclude some or all foreign corporations from performing specific contracts. For example, Section 836(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1993 ( P.L. 102-484 , codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72536) prohibits the Departments of Defense and Energy from awarding contracts under a \"national security program\" to entities \"controlled\" by foreign governments if that entity would need to be given access to a \"prescribed category of information\" (e.g., special access information) in order to perform the contract. Similarly, Sections 402 and 406(c) of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-399 , codified in 22 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a74852) limit certain construction projects abroad to \"U.S. persons\" or \"U.S. joint venture persons,\" and exclude entities that have \"business arrangements\" with Libya. However, as these examples illustrate, restrictions on contracting with foreign corporations are not synonymous with the current or proposed restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations.
