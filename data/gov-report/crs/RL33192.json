Among other provisions, the agreement would allow for uranium enrichment up to a level less than 20% U-235 and Chinese reprocessing of U.S.-obligated material at safeguarded facilities. The required congressional review period ended on July 31.", "Such agreements are often called \"123 agreements\" because they are required by Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (P.L. 95-242). They are a prerequisite for any significant nuclear cooperation with another country, such as exports of nuclear power plants and components and the transfer of nuclear material. Since the original agreement was concluded before China was a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), some changes to the text were required. The recently submitted renewal agreement complies with the relevant provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and therefore was subject to a review period totaling 90 days of continuous session. If no resolution of disapproval is passed into law before that deadline, then the agreement may enter into force. No resolution of disapproval was passed.", "Almost 13 years passed between the time President Reagan submitted the current 123 agreement to Congress in July 1985 and its implementation in March 1998 under President Clinton.

P.L. 99-183 required a presidential certification and a report followed by a period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress. After the 1989 Tiananmen Crackdown, Congress enacted sanctions in P.L. 101-246, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, suspending nuclear cooperation with China and requiring an additional presidential certification on the PRC's nuclear nonproliferation assurances.", "Ahead of a summit with the PRC, President Clinton, on January 12, 1998, signed certifications (as required by P.L. 99-183) on China's nuclear nonproliferation policy and practices. Clinton also issued a certification and waived a sanction imposed under P.L. 101-246. Congressional review ended on March 18, 1998, allowing the agreement to be implemented.", "U.S. nuclear commerce with China has expanded in the past decade. On February 28, 2005, Westinghouse submitted an initial bid to sell four nuclear power reactors to China, as supported by the Bush Administration.

The first four Westinghouse reactors under the deal are now being constructed, with six more planned and as many as 30 more proposed.", "At the same time, some Members of Congress continue to question whether China is fulfilling its nonproliferation commitments, particularly regarding transfers to North Korea by Chinese entities. Proliferation sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals remain in place, and the United States cooperates with China in improving export control and detection systems. In addition, China continues to develop its own nuclear arsenal.", "Along with the text of the agreement, the President submitted a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement that evaluates these issues.

The U.S. firm Westinghouse (now mostly owned by Toshiba of Japan) signed a contract in 2007 to supply its most advanced reactor, the AP1000, to China. Westinghouse also agreed to transfer its reactor technology to China so that Chinese firms could eventually build them.", "Some in Congress expressed concern about the technology transfer arrangement, but the AP1000 technology transfer is now well underway. The first four Westinghouse reactors are under construction, and 32 more are planned, with Chinese firms to take over an increasing share of the work. China has developed a larger version of the AP1000, as allowed by the Westinghouse technology transfer agreement, and is reportedly about to start construction of the first unit.", "The PRC's nuclear power expansion program is the most aggressive in the world. Although China's 26 operating power reactors currently account for less than 2% of the country's electric generating capacity, the PRC has an additional 23 reactors under construction and plans to build up to 100 more by 2030. For comparison, the United States has a total of 99 power reactors as of June 2015.", "The PRC announced in December 2014 that it would spend about $11.2 billion annually on reactor construction during the next 10 years, providing a large potential market for nuclear equipment suppliers around the world. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the major U.S. nuclear industry trade association, called \"timely renewal\" of U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements with China and other countries \"critical to continuation of nuclear trade between U.S. firms and firms in these nations.\"", "A December 2014 study by the Department of Commerce ranked China as the top export market for U.S. nuclear goods and services. According to the study, \"Although there is strong foreign competition, the size of China's market is so large and the pace at which it is building new reactors and facilities is so swift that China will remain a strong and dynamic market for U.S. exports for years to come in all areas of the civil nuclear supply chain.\"", "The value of U.S. nuclear exports to China and resulting U.S. employment are difficult to quantify. According to NEI, \"Major Chinese contracts awarded to U.S. nuclear suppliers have created billions in U.S. exports and tens of thousands of American jobs,\" as well as employment providing engineering, construction, and other services. ", "Westinghouse's 2007 sale of four AP1000 reactors to China was announced at a value of $8 billion. Under an engineering and procurement agreement and a separate technology licensing agreement, \"Westinghouse will provide nuclear fuel and safety-related major components, as well as information on design, operation and plant maintenance,\" according to the law firm Baker Donelson, which represents the nuclear industry.

U.S. firms initially provided most of the nuclear-related components of the plants supplied under the deal, valued at several hundred million dollars per reactor, and by 2006, U.S. firms were continuing to provide about $100 million in components and services for each new South Korean reactor, according to Westinghouse. South Korea's $20 billion sale of four of its U.S.-derived reactors to the United Arab Emirates in 2010 included $2 billion in U.S. participation.", "According to Baker Donelson, ", "Currently Westinghouse is in discussions in China for contracts for the next wave of up to 20 additional AP1000 units. This would result in 2,000 to 2,500 direct jobs and 5,000-6,000 in indirect/induced USA jobs, for a total of 7,000-8,000 jobs in the U.S. Although China has indigenized significant manufacturing capabilities as part of their self-reliance program, a key reason for renewing the Section 123 agreement is that certain products and services necessary to fulfill that program cannot be procured solely in China. This means that the Chinese will have to use some of the suppliers that were used on the initial AP1000 plants, many of whom are located in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chinese Re-export of U.S. Reactor Technology", "paragraphs": ["China's plans to export nuclear power plants based on Westinghouse technology have raised a number of concerns. A key question is the level of U.S. control that would continue to be exercised over the export of reactors based on U.S. designs and the use of nuclear materials produced by those reactors. The potential for Chinese dominance of the world nuclear power market with U.S. help is also an issue. A related area of concern is the extent to which U.S. nuclear power technology could be transferred to the Chinese naval reactor program, particularly the unique sealed pumps used by the AP1000. (See \" Naval Reactors \" section, below.)", "According to Baker Donelson, the Westinghouse technology transfer agreement for the AP1000 reactor grants the Chinese only a \"nonexclusive license to use that technology in China,\" with Westinghouse retaining all its intellectual property rights. The agreement allows the Chinese to modify the AP1000 design but they cannot export such variants \"unless they do so with Westinghouse under a marketing alliance.\"", "However, the Westinghouse agreement does give China the right to export a \"large passive plant,\" essentially a larger version of the AP1000. Such plants could be sold to any country except the United States and Japan, subject to U.S. export control laws, according to Baker Donelson. Westinghouse would have the right to participate in such export projects to the extent that they incorporated AP1000 technology. If China did not include Westinghouse in such exports, then Westinghouse would have to be compensated for any of its technology that was used. China is currently developing a \"large passive plant,\" as envisioned by the Westinghouse agreement. The first of these reactors, called the CAP1400, is to begin construction in China in 2015, with exports planned to follow.", "Aggressive Chinese exports of nuclear technology, particularly to countries that do not currently have nuclear power, could pose proliferation risks. China's policies for ensuring that countries that import its reactors are fully compliant with international safeguards will be of particular concern. Moreover, even fully safeguarded nuclear power programs could raise U.S. concerns if they create a perceived need to develop fuel cycle facilities such as uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing plants, which can be used to produce nuclear weapons material. Without Westinghouse's advanced reactor technology, China was not generally believed to have a reactor that could compete in world markets. Therefore, the AP1000 technology transfer appears to be crucial to China's planned nuclear export program.", "Transfers of nuclear technology to a foreign country require authorization by the Secretary of Energy under 10 C.F.R.

On carbon emissions, NEI asserted, \"Nuclear power is planned to carry the largest share of China's non-emitting generating capacity additions through 2030. Ending U.S. nuclear cooperation would disrupt China's nuclear development plans and set back its efforts to limit carbon emissions.\"", "The Westinghouse AP1000 reactor technology that is being transferred to China incorporates \"passive\" safety features that are intended to reduce the likelihood of radioactive releases by orders of magnitude below that of existing commercial nuclear power plants. In approving the design in the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission noted that it \"includes many features that are not found in the designs of currently operating reactors,\" most significantly \"the use of safety systems for accident prevention and mitigation that rely on passive means, such as gravity, natural circulation, condensation and evaporation, and stored energy.\"", "To the extent that the AP1000 and larger reactors derived from it would displace older designs in the Chinese nuclear power program, the likelihood of accidents could be reduced. A probabilistic risk assessment by Westinghouse asserted that the risk of nuclear core damage in the AP1000 would be 1% of the level of risk at existing nuclear power plants and 5% of the risk considered acceptable for advanced reactor designs.", "Targets for controlling carbon emissions were jointly announced by China and the United States on November 11, 2014. The United States agreed to cut its net emissions of greenhouse gases by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, while China agreed to halt its rapid rise in carbon dioxide emissions by no later than 2030. In addition, China agreed to increase its non-fossil-fuel energy share to 20% by 2030, which \"will require China to deploy an additional 800-1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other zero emission generation capacity by 2030,\" according to the White House. The agreement could provide further impetus to China's already-ambitious nuclear growth.", "However, the potential safety and environmental benefits of expanded nuclear power in China are questioned by some environmental groups and analysts. They contend that efforts to reduce carbon emissions should be focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy, which avoid nuclear power's risks of radioactive releases, waste management issues, and nuclear weapons proliferation. Analysts point out that Chinese installation of new wind and solar capacity currently exceeds nuclear: announced capacity additions for 2014 totaled \"56.6 GW [gigawatts] of non-fossil fueled generating capacity, comprising 20 GW of hydro, 18 GW of wind, 10 GW of solar, and 8.6 GW of nuclear power.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Diversion", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Plutonium Separation from U.S.-Origin Reactor Fuel", "paragraphs": ["Article 6 of the new Section 123 agreement gives consent for conversion, enrichment to less than 20% U-235, fabrication of low-enriched uranium fuel, post-irradiation examination, and blending or downblending of uranium to produce low enriched uranium.

This type of prior agreement is generally referred to as \"advance consent.\" This kind of permission for reprocessing U.S.-obligated spent fuel has been included in Section 123 agreements with India and Euratom. As with the agreements with India and Euratom, any reprocessing of U.S.-obligated material could take place only at facilities that are under or are eligible for IAEA safeguards. This agreement also includes provisions for tracking the material, data exchange, and visits to sites (see \" Highlights of New Agreement \").", "China now plans to reprocess most of its spent fuel domestically for reuse as mixed oxide (MOX) fuel and is now building commercial reprocessing facilities.

", "Some analysts have raised concerns that the possible reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from reactors built under the U.S.-China 123 agreement could help increase Chinese stockpiles of plutonium for weapons purposes. This was a key issue in the congressional debate when Congress first reviewed the agreement. Under the 1985 Section 123 agreement, China could potentially have sought agreement to reprocess spent fuel from U.S.-designed reactors for peaceful purposes, but no such arrangements were made. Section 5(2) of the agreement said the parties \"will consult immediately and will seek agreement within six months on long-term arrangements for such activities.\" The Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) that accompanied that agreement's submission to Congress interprets Article 5(2) as follows: \"China cannot unilaterally proceed with reprocessing, enrichment, or alteration in the face of U.S. objection.\" ", "As detailed below, Congress was concerned that the language in the agreement did not clearly state U.S. consent rights. One of the presidential certifications required in P.L. 99-183 said that \"the obligation to consider favorably a request to carry out activities described in Article 5(2) of the Agreement shall not prejudice the decision of the United States to approve or disapprove such a request.\" In President Clinton's certification, he said, \"The U.S consent rights provided for in Article 5(2) of the Agreement satisfy this standard because the specific language used ensures that the United States must exercise an approval right before the activity in question is carried out.\"", "As noted, U.S. nuclear technology transferred to China is to be used only for peaceful purposes and reprocessing must be done at safeguarded or safeguard-eligible facilities. However, some observers point out that if China in the future decided to disregard those restrictions or change the safeguards status at particular facilities, China could potentially use plutonium produced during the normal operation of commercial reactors for weapons. Such \"reactor grade\" plutonium has high levels of plutonium isotopes that are undesirable for weapons, but it is widely accepted that such use is possible. Alternatively, U.S.-designed commercial reactors (as well as any other reactor in China) could be refueled more frequently than normal to minimize the buildup of undesirable isotopes, resulting in plutonium better suited for weapons.", "This point of view was summarized in a recent issue paper from the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center (NPEC), which questioned whether \"it is sound policy to allow reprocessing of material generated in U.S. designed reactors in China if there is reason to believe that timely warning of a massive military diversion of weapons-usable plutonium from China's 'civilian nuclear sector' is not possible even if the reprocessed separated plutonium is under IAEA safeguards or is otherwise inspected.\" This study purports that over the next 30 years, China may want to accelerate a nuclear weapons build-up. ", "However, such a scenario appears to be improbable. If China were to cease implementation of its IAEA safeguards agreement, China and the United States would consult and establish a mutually acceptable alternative,\" according to Article 9(3) of the nuclear cooperation agreement. Under Article 12, if a dispute cannot be settled, then cooperation under the agreement could cease or be temporarily suspended. Moreover, China seems unlikely to use nuclear material from U.S.-supplied reactors for its nuclear arsenal for several reasons. First, China will likely not increase its nuclear arsenal significantly in the near future. According to a 2015 report from the Department of Defense, \"China will likely continue to invest considerable resources to maintain a limited, but survivable, nuclear force.\" Second, Beijing has sufficient amounts of fissile material for nuclear weapons; according to a 2001 Defense Department report, \"China currently is not believed to be producing fissile material for nuclear weapons, but has a stockpile of fissile material sufficient to improve or increase its weapons inventory.\" Beijing's military stockpile of plutonium is an estimated 1.8 metric tons. Moreover, China mines and imports uranium, so it is unclear that it would need additional sources of uranium. Last, it is worth noting that the U.S. reactors likely to be exported to China would be light water reactors; no country has used these types of reactors to produce plutonium for their nuclear weapons. As noted, reactor-grade plutonium is undesirable for nuclear weapons.", "Indeed, some analysts argue that it would not be necessary for China to use spent fuel for weapons plutonium. Carnegie Endowment analyst Mark Hibbs writes, \"China since 1964 is a nuclear weapons state with inventories of military-grade plutonium and uranium that were produced in dedicated Chinese military reactors and reprocessing plants. It is extremely unlikely that China would violate a bilateral accord with the United States to divert U.S.-obligated civilian nuclear materials to produce future nuclear weapons.\" This weapons plutonium was produced by two reactors: the oldest was shut down in 1984 and the second is believed to have produced plutonium through 1991. ", "Australia's experience with uranium exports to China is perhaps instructive. According to the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office's most recent report, all Australian-obligated nuclear material is \"satisfactorily accounted for\" and no such material \"was used for non-peaceful purposes in 2013.\" Past such reports conclude similarly. Australia's nuclear cooperation agreement with China entered into force in February 2007.", "The agreement provides for new bilateral monitoring measures on U.S.-obligated material that did not exist under the previous agreement.

Since the original nuclear cooperation agreement was concluded, China has joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and made nuclear security improvements to its civilian sector. As noted, its civilian reactors are under voluntary International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In the past decade, China has also cooperated with the United States on the detection of illicit nuclear materials at ports and border points. However, there are still concerns about China's nonproliferation record, especially its ability to prevent Chinese-based companies and individuals from exporting dual-use goods relevant to nuclear weapons programs, particularly to Iran and North Korea.", "The Chinese government apparently ended its direct involvement in the transfer of nuclear- and missile-related items, although entities in China have, according to the U.S. government, continued to transfer such items. In the past, the Chinese government has transferred nuclear and missile technology, which has raised proliferation concerns. For example, China exported missiles to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. \"Chinese firms\" also \"provided some important missile-related items and assistance to several countries of concern, such as Iran, Libya, and North Korea,\" according to a 2001 Department of Defense report. China has also provided assistance to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. The 2001 Defense Department report states that \"China supplied Pakistan with nuclear material and expertise and has provided critical assistance in the production of Pakistan's nuclear facilities.\" China may also have provided \"nuclear weapons design information\" to Pakistan. ", "China previously engaged in nuclear cooperation with Iran, although such cooperation appears to have ended. China supplied Iran with two small nuclear reactors for research in the early 1990s, but also provided nuclear technology to Tehran that drew U.S. proliferation concerns. For example, China supplied gaseous uranium hexafluoride in 1991, which Iran used to conduct research on centrifuges to be used for enriching uranium.

Other Chinese nonproliferation efforts included pledging in 1994 to refrain from transferring certain longer-range missiles and curtailing sensitive nuclear cooperation with Iran.", "According to U.S. government reports and official statements, China subsequently increased its restraint regarding WMD (weapons of mass destruction)-related transfers and has improved its export controls.

As noted, China agreed in 1997 to cancel the transfer of a uranium conversion facility to Iran. Beijing also suspended the sale of two nuclear power reactors to Iran and pledged to refrain from engaging in new nuclear projects with that country. A review of public U.S. intelligence community reports covering 1997-2011 regarding the proliferation of items related to weapons of mass destruction indicates that neither Chinese entities nor the Chinese government engaged in nuclear cooperation with Iran during that period. ", "However, Chinese entities have continued to engage in proliferation. The Defense Intelligence Agency warned in February 2015 that \"China will continue to be a source of dual-use WMD applicable goods, equipment, and materials to countries of concern, like Iran, North Korea, and Syria.\" Furthermore, the NPAS states that ", "Despite updates to regulations and improved actions in some areas, proliferation involving Chinese entities remains a significant concern. The U.S. Government has sanctioned multiple Chinese companies and individuals for proliferation activity since 1997. Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) ... have been sanctioned for proliferation on multiple occasions. SOEs have improved their proliferation records, though private small- and medium-sized companies make up the majority of Chinese firms currently subject to proliferation sanctions, most of which are proliferating dual-use materials and technologies.", "Regarding current missile proliferation concerns, Deputy Assistant Secretary Van Diepen stated in a June 2012 interview that \"there's a substantial problem of Chinese entities providing missile technology to programs in places like Iran and North Korea.\" A 2014 State Department report stated that \"Chinese entities continued to supply missile programs in countries of concern\" in 2013. Also, the 2011 Director of National Intelligence Worldwide Threat Assessment said, \"North Korea and entities in Russia and China continue to sell technologies and components in the Middle East and South Asia that are dual use and could support WMD and missile programs.\"", "With respect to Chinese export controls, Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman stated during a May 12, 2015, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that China does not \"yet have the level of political commitment that will enable them to spend the resources you need to effectively control the export from the second biggest economy in the world,\" adding that Beijing \"does not have currently the bureaucratic enforcement capability, and does not yet have all the legislation it ought to have in order to adequately control dual-use exports.\" Beijing \"has the ability to decide to devote more resources, efforts, and priority to crack down on these activities,\" according to Van Diepen. While some experts assess that Chinese government-owned companies have improved strategic export controls since a national law was passed in 2002, Chinese individuals and companies remain under U.S. sanctions related to proliferation of WMD.
