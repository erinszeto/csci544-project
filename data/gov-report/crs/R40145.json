Although the agency and the Obama Administration have consistently said that they would prefer that Congress pass legislation to address climate change, EPA has begun to develop regulations using its existing authority. On December 15, 2009, the agency finalized an \"endangerment finding\" under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which permits it (in fact, requires it) to regulate pollutants for their effect as greenhouse gases for the first time. Relying on this finding, EPA finalized GHG emission standards for cars and light trucks, April 1, 2010. The implementation of these standards will, in turn, trigger permitting requirements and the imposition of Best Available Control Technology for new major stationary sources of GHGs in January 2011.", "It is the triggering of standards for stationary sources (power plants, manufacturing facilities, etc.) that has raised the most concern in Congress: legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate aimed at preventing EPA from implementing these requirements. The legislation has taken several forms, including the introduction of resolutions of disapproval for the endangerment finding itself under the Congressional Review Act, and stand-alone legislation that would forestall specific EPA regulatory actions. Meanwhile, EPA has itself promulgated regulations and guidance that will limit the applicability of Clean Air Act GHG requirements, delaying the applicability of requirements for all stationary sources until 2011 through guidance published April 2, 2010, and focusing its regulatory efforts on the largest emitters while granting smaller sources at least a six-year reprieve through what it calls the Greenhouse Gas \"Tailoring Rule.\"", "The endangerment finding and EPA's other actions, which were triggered by a 2007 Supreme Court decision, came as Congress struggled with climate change and energy legislation. On June 26, 2009, the House narrowly passed H.R. 2454, a 1,428-page bill addressing a number of interrelated energy and climate change issues. The bill would have established a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, beginning in 2012. In the Senate, both the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported bills (S. 1733 and S. 1462), but action subsequently bogged down, while a trio of Senators began negotiating a climate bill from scratch. As the clock wound down on the 111th Congress, it became less likely that climate legislation would be enacted, and more likely that EPA's actions would be the principal U.S. response to climate issues for now.", "Besides addressing climate change, EPA has taken action on a number of conventional air pollutants, generally in response to the courts. Several Bush Administration regulatory decisions were vacated or remanded to the agency: among them, the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR)\u2014a rule designed to control the long-range transport of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants, by establishing a cap-and-trade program\u2014and the Clean Air Mercury Rule, which would have established a cap-and-trade program for power plant mercury emissions. EPA will address these court decisions through new regulations\u2014the agency proposed a replacement for CAIR July 6. Some in Congress have wanted to address these issues through legislation, an approach that might reduce the likelihood of further court challenges. The agency is also in the midst of reviewing ambient air quality standards for the six most widespread air pollutants. These standards serve as EPA's definition of clean air, and drive a wide range of regulatory controls.", "This report provides an overview of clean air legislative and regulatory issues.

", "The Administration counters that it would prefer for Congress to pass new legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions, but the Clean Air Act already requires action: a 2007 Supreme Court decision interpreting that authority found that EPA must weigh whether GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare and, if it concludes that they do, proceed with regulation.", "The 111 th Congress struggled to produce its own approach to climate change. On June 26, 2009, the House narrowly passed H.R. 2454 , a 1,428-page bill addressing a number of interrelated energy and climate change issues. Among its numerous provisions, the bill would have established cap-and-trade programs for GHG emissions, beginning in 2012. The Senate did not act; however, two Senate committees reported bills, but the prospect of obtaining 60 votes for either bill appeared slim, and neither came to the floor. Given these prospects, a trio of Senators began negotiating a climate bill from scratch, but they also encountered difficulty: the process ultimately lost its Republican sponsor and did not produce an introduced bill. Toward the end of the second session, there was talk of a slimmed-down bill focusing on energy and perhaps electric utilities, but even this limited approach did not come to the floor.", "Besides legislation and potential EPA regulation of greenhouse gases, a bipartisan group of Senators and EPA both considered addressing issues related to sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury emissions from electric power plants. Regulations addressing these emissions were vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2008, leaving major potential gaps in EPA and state regulations. EPA is developing new regulations to address the court's concerns and proposed regulations addressing SO 2 and NOx, July 6,2010, but legislation might provide a more straightforward solution, resolving ambiguities in current law and reducing the likelihood of further delays from litigation. S. 2995 , a bipartisan bill addressing these issues, was introduced in the Senate and hearings were held, but no further action was taken.", "The Obama Administration's EPA has also moved to reconsider or modify several Bush Administration decisions regarding national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). NAAQS represent EPA's formal judgment regarding how clean the air must be to protect public health and welfare; the standards set in motion monitoring and planning requirements, which in turn lead to emission controls. ", "On January 19, 2010, the agency proposed a more stringent NAAQS for ozone, having concluded that a 2008 revision to the standard did not satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The revision could affect as many as 650 counties\u2014virtually every county that currently has an ozone monitor. Final action on this proposal is expected by the end of December. On June 22, 2010, the agency promulgated revisions to the NAAQS for SO 2 ; 59 counties would violate the new SO 2 standard, based on the most recent monitoring data. None violated the old standard. The agency is also reviewing or has recently completed reviews of the NAAQS for four other pollutants, notably particulates, which are emitted by a wide range of mobile and stationary sources. A revised particulate standard is to be proposed by February 2011. Early indications are that the agency may propose substantially more stringent standards.", "This report provides a brief overview of the climate change, power plant, and air quality standard issues. More detailed information on most of the issues can be found in other CRS reports, which are referenced throughout this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA's Greenhouse Gas Regulations", "paragraphs": ["EPA's actions to regulate GHG emissions stem from more than a decade of petitions and litigation. Responding to a 1999 petition that it regulate greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles, the agency in 2003 denied that it had such authority, arguing that GHGs did not fall within the Clean Air Act's definition of \"air pollutants.\" The denial was challenged by Massachusetts, 11 other states, and various other petitioners in a case that ultimately reached the Supreme Court. In an April 2, 2007, decision ( Massachusetts v. EPA ), the Court found by 5-4 that EPA does have authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, since the emissions are clearly air pollutants under the Clean Air Act's definition of that term. The Court's majority concluded that EPA must, therefore, decide whether emissions of these pollutants from new motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. When it makes such an \"endangerment finding,\" the act requires the agency to establish standards for emissions of the pollutants. ", "On December 15, 2009, acting in response to the Court's decision, EPA finalized an endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, under Section 202(a) of the act. Relying on this finding, EPA promulgated GHG emission standards for new cars and light trucks, April 1, 2010. The implementation of these standards will, in turn, trigger permitting requirements and the imposition of Best Available Control Technology for new major stationary sources of GHGs beginning in 2011. (For information on these regulations and permit requirements, see CRS Report R40506, Cars, Trucks, and Climate: EPA Regulation of Greenhouse Gases from Mobile Sources , and CRS Report R41212, EPA Regulation of Greenhouse Gases: Congressional Responses and Options .) ", "The prospect of GHG standards for motor vehicles is not particularly controversial. On May 19, 2009, President Obama announced an agreement involving nine U.S. and foreign auto manufacturers; the federal government; the governors of California, Michigan, and Massachusetts; the United Auto Workers; and environmental groups under which EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would proceed with a joint rulemaking in which GHG emissions from new motor vehicles would be reduced under the Clean Air Act, while NHTSA would set corresponding fuel economy standards under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program. The objective of the new greenhouse gas standards is to reach reduction levels similar to those adopted by the state of California and 13 other states, who will harmonize their standards with those of EPA as part of the agreement. The California standards required about a 30% reduction in GHG emissions from new vehicles by 2016. The auto industry supported the national agreement, in part, to avoid having to meet standards on a state-by-state basis; thus, it is not interested in seeing EPA's motor vehicle GHG standards blocked.", "In addition to the motor vehicle GHG standards, EPA has received petitions asking the agency to regulate GHGs from a variety of other sources, including coal mines, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), aircraft, ocean-going ships, nonroad engines and equipment (e.g., construction equipment, farm equipment, recreational equipment, forklifts, harbor craft, and lawn and garden equipment), and fuels. Another petition asks the agency to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for seven specific greenhouse gases. The agency also faces lawsuits seeking to force it to regulate GHGs from stationary sources, including power plants, petroleum refineries, nonroad vehicles and engines, and the Portland cement industry. The decision to move forward on GHG standards for new motor vehicles is seen by many as a precedent for regulation of these other sources.", "Even without EPA decisions on these petitions or the conclusion of lawsuits, the adoption of GHG standards for motor vehicles will trigger GHG permit requirements for new stationary sources, as a result of language in Section 165 of the act that requires such permits to require best available control technology for all pollutants \"subject to regulation\" under the act. It is this triggering of standards for stationary sources (power plants, manufacturing facilities, and others) that appears to have raised the most concern in Congress: legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate aimed at preventing EPA from implementing these requirements. The legislation has taken several forms, including the introduction of resolutions of disapproval for the endangerment finding itself under the Congressional Review Act ( S.J.Res. 26 , H.J.Res. 66 , H.J.Res. 76 , and H.J.Res. 77 ), and five other bills that would either require EPA to reevaluate its endangerment finding ( H.Res. 974 ), amend the Clean Air Act to provide that greenhouse gases are not subject to the act ( H.R. 4396 ), limit EPA's GHG authority to motor vehicle emissions ( S. 1622 ), or suspend EPA actions regulating stationary source emissions of GHGs for two years ( S. 3072 , H.R. 4753 ). S.J.Res. 26 , Senator Murkowski's resolution of disapproval for the endangerment finding, was defeated 53-47, on June 10, 2010. Meanwhile, EPA has itself promulgated regulations and guidance that would delay the applicability of requirements for stationary sources of GHGs until 2011 and focus its initial regulatory efforts on the largest emitters, granting smaller sources at least a six-year reprieve.", "Although both the resolutions of disapproval and the stand-alone legislation to restrict EPA's authority have received a great deal of attention, the path to enactment of either of these forms of legislation would be a steep one. The Obama Administration has made the reduction of GHG emissions one of its major goals; as a result, many conclude that legislation restricting EPA's authority to act, if passed by Congress, would encounter a presidential veto.", "Addressing the issue through an amendment to the EPA appropriation, by cutting EPA's appropriation or by restricting its authority to use funds to take specific GHG regulatory actions, might have more chance of enactment. The overall appropriation bill to which it would be attached would presumably contain other elements that would make it more difficult to veto. This approach was discussed at some length in the fall of 2009, when Senator Murkowski introduced (but ultimately did not offer) S.Amdt. 2530 to the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act ( H.R. 2996 ). ", "In short, there are numerous ways that Congress can address EPA's greenhouse gas authority, and opponents of EPA action may continue to exert pressure to delay or limit the agency's actions, as the agency continues on its planned course.

The bill, also referred to by its acronym (ACES) or as the Waxman-Markey bill, addresses a number of interrelated energy and climate change issues. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported Senate counterparts: S. 1462 (Bingaman), equivalent to the energy titles, and S. 1733 , the Kerry-Boxer bill, establishing a cap-and-trade system and other measures to address climate change. The Kerry-Boxer bill faced strong opposition, however. The Republican members of the Environment and Public Works Committee boycotted the markup. The bill was reported with no Republican support and less than unanimous support among Democrats: it was clear that the bill would lack the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster and secure passage on the floor. As a result, negotiations took place among a trio of Senators (Kerry, Graham, and Lieberman) for a bipartisan (or, more accurately, tripartisan) alternative. This legislation, without Senator Graham's sponsorship, circulated extensively in draft form in 2010, but was not introduced.", "Controlling greenhouse gas emissions was among the highest priorities of the congressional leadership and the Obama Administration in the 111 th Congress.

The remainder of the climate portion of this report discusses the House bill and the issues that arose in the course of its consideration, with occasional references to developments in the Senate.", "The House bill would have amended the Clean Air Act to establish a cap-and-trade program (similar to the act's current program for addressing acid rain) to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beginning in 2012. The emissions cap on covered sources would have gradually declined\u2014from 3% below the 2005 emissions level in 2012 to 83% below in 2050. In addition to the cap-and-trade program, the bill would have established renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements, mandated carbon capture and sequestration by new coal-fired electric generating units, and required EPA to set GHG emission standards for various sources. The bill distributed the cap-and-trade program's emission allowances to a wide array of sectors in an effort to address potential impacts on low income households and protect industries that might be subject to import competition from countries with less stringent GHG requirements, and it encouraged the use of \"offsets\" (emission reductions in sectors not directly covered by the cap-and-trade program).

It would have both established an economy-wide cap-and-trade system and addressed individual sectors of the economy and categories of emitters. In addition to capping GHG emissions, it set forth energy efficiency and renewable energy requirements aimed at reducing the emissions of individual sectors, notably electric utilities, cars and trucks, electrical appliances, and commercial or government buildings. Together, these sectors account for the lion's share of energy use and GHG emissions. The bill would have amended the Clean Air Act to remove potential authority that EPA has to regulate GHGs under several broadly worded sections of the existing statute, while establishing new requirements that EPA set standards for specific emission sources. It would not have established a carbon tax. In general, it would not have preempted state authority to set standards for GHG emission sources, but it would have preempted state and regional cap-and-trade systems for the period 2012-2017.", "S. 1733 , reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee on February 2, 2010, had similar provisions.

Under the Obama Administration, the authority EPA already possesses has taken on new significance. The President is committed to addressing GHG emissions, and he can use existing Clean Air Act authority in a number of ways to do so. For starters, the agency proposed on April 17, 2009, and finalized December 15 an \"endangerment finding\" under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act. This finding permits EPA to establish GHG emission standards for motor vehicles. On May 19, 2009, before finalizing the endangerment finding, the President announced that EPA would move forward with the motor vehicle standards. EPA promulgated the standards April 1, 2010. Implementation of the first limits is scheduled for the 2012 model year. EPA also proposed GHG emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and engines, November 30, 2010.", "In addition to the pending controls on cars and trucks, EPA has received nine additional petitions to regulate GHG emissions from coal mines, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), ships, non-road engines, aircraft, and fuels. Any of these petitions could prompt further agency action. Another petition asks the agency to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for seven specific greenhouse gases. The agency also faces lawsuits seeking to force it to regulate GHGs from stationary sources, including power plants, petroleum refineries, and the Portland cement industry. The decisions on motor vehicle standards are likely to serve as precedents for some of the other decisions, and may have implications for the agency's position in the pending litigation.", "During the Bush Administration, some groups, including EPA, four Cabinet departments, and the Office of Management and Budget, expressed concern that proceeding with GHG standards for motor vehicles would activate numerous other Clean Air Act provisions. Addressing these concerns, H.R. 2454 would have prevented EPA from setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards for GHGs solely on the basis of their effect on global climate change. It would have prohibited the agency from regulating GHGs under Section 115's provisions for international air pollution. It would have prohibited regulation of GHGs as hazardous air pollutants under Section 112. It would have prohibited the use of New Source Review to regulate GHG emissions under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. And no stationary source of GHGs would have been required to obtain a permit under Title V of the act solely because of its GHG emissions. Of these, only the two permit provisions (PSD-NSR, and Title V) have been invoked by EPA, thus far, and the agency has taken steps to limit their applicability. The other authorities seem, for the most part, ill-designed to address GHG emissions. Nevertheless, advocates of retaining the authorities questioned the necessity of their removal.

The bill would have excluded the \"agricultural and forestry sectors\" (undefined in the bill) from its emissions cap.

Instead, it would have treated agriculture and forestry activities as a source of offsets (reductions from sources outside the cap-and-trade system) that could be purchased by capped sources and used in place of allowances. The bill would have allowed the use of up to 1 billion offset credits from domestic sources annually.

A number of options have been proposed to address this \"carbon leakage\" concern, including directly supporting domestic carbon-intensive industries, imposing countervailing duties or allowance requirements on imports from countries with weaker GHG requirements, and/or developing sectoral approaches that address the emissions of specific industries worldwide.", "H.R. 2454 would have established an allowance rebate program for energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries.

", "Despite this and similar caveats offered by other analysts, estimates of the bill's impact were widely cited both by opponents and proponents in the House debate. Opponents of the bill claimed that it would impose costs of as much as $3,100 annually per family, one source of which was a 2007 assessment of U.S. cap-and-trade proposals prepared by MIT's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. The author of that study, in letters to the House minority leader and the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, stated that the study's conclusions had been misstated. ", "At the other end of the spectrum, EPA estimated that the costs of the reported bill (prior to some of the final changes) would be $80 to $111 per family, annually, or as proponents have sometimes expressed it, less than the cost of a postage stamp a day. EPA's lower cost was, in part, the result of assuming cost-saving energy technologies and including the availability of low-cost emission offsets from both domestic and international sources. As noted above, the House bill would have allowed the use of as many as 2 billion offsets annually (out of a total allowance pool of 5-6 billion in the initial years). Questions have been raised whether so many offsets would actually be available, especially in the short term.", "A related issue was the impact of the bill on the federal deficit.

In total, CBO and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would reduce future budget deficits by about $4 billion over the 2010-2014 period and by about $9 billion over the 2010-2019 period. ", "Whatever the true cost, a bill of this size, affecting numerous sectors of the economy, would be bound to create winners and losers, even if its net impact on the economy or on federal revenues were small.

It met its emission reduction goals at low cost, with virtually 100% compliance, and with minimal administrative oversight. ", "The success of the program was at least partly the result of the favorable circumstances in which it was implemented: the reduction targets were easily met because of an abundant supply of cheap low-sulfur coal; there were only about 1,000 entities (power plants) covered by the trading program, making it simple and inexpensive to monitor and administer; and most of the regulated entities were allowed 10 years to achieve compliance, by which time early reductions had generated an enormous number of extra allowances that helped lubricate the trading system.", "Some other trading programs have not been as successful. Southern California's Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM), for example, which was implemented in 1994 to reduce emissions of NOx and SO 2 in the Los Angeles area, saw a 50-fold increase in NOx allowance prices during the 2000-2001 California energy crisis. To permit its continued functioning and allow utilities to use backup power generators, electric utilities were removed from the RECLAIM system, charged a flat fee of $15,000 per ton for excess emissions, and subjected to new command and control requirements (i.e., the type of regulation the trading system was designed to avoid). The European GHG trading system (EU-ETS), established to help European Union countries meet their Kyoto Protocol targets, saw wild swings in short-term allowance prices during its start-up years, making planning and decision-making difficult for participating entities.", "Both supporters and opponents have cited previous experience with cap-and-trade systems to buttress their arguments, and the House bill's GHG cap-and-trade system was designed to deal with several of the problems experienced by previous systems. Among the most notable of the design features were mechanisms to address potential volatility of allowance prices. The bill addressed cost control through five main mechanisms: (1) unlimited banking and limited borrowing of allowances, (2) a two-year compliance period, (3) a strategic auction with a reserve price to increase the availability of allowances in the early years of the program, (4) periodic auctions with a reserve price, and (5) generous limits on the use of offsets.

Under the Clean Air Act, however, they are not necessarily subject to stringent requirements: emissions and the required control equipment can vary depending on the location of the plant, when it was constructed, whether it has undergone major modifications, the specific type of fuel it burns, and, to some extent, the vagaries of EPA enforcement policies. More than half a dozen separate Clean Air Act programs could potentially be used to control emissions, which makes compliance strategy complicated for utilities and difficult for regulators. Because the cost of the most stringent available controls, for the entire industry, could range into the tens of billions of dollars, utilities have fought hard and rather successfully to limit or delay regulations affecting them, particularly with respect to plants constructed before the Clean Air Act of 1970 was passed.", "As a result, emissions from power plants have not been reduced as much as those from some other sources. Many plants built in the 1950s and 1960s (generally referred to as \"grandfathered\" plants) have little emission control equipment. ", "Collectively, power plants are large sources of pollution. In 2005, they accounted for 10.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions (70% of the U.S. total), 52 tons of mercury emissions (46% of the U.S. total), and 3.6 million tons of nitrogen oxides (19% of the U.S. total). Power plants are also considered major sources of fine particles (PM 2.5 ), many of which form in the atmosphere from emissions from a wide range of stationary and mobile sources. In addition, power plants account for about 40% of U.S. anthropogenic emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.", "With new ambient air quality standards for ozone, fine particles, and SO 2 taking effect, emissions of NOx and SO 2 will necessarily have to be reduced to meet standards.

Section 112 is the section that regulates emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In general, it requires EPA to set standards based on the Maximum Achievable Control Technology (a term defined with great precision in the act), and to impose the MACT standards at each individual emissions source. In a December 2000 regulatory finding, EPA concluded that regulation of mercury from power plants under Section 112 was appropriate and necessary.

As with the acid rain and CAIR cap-and-trade programs, early reductions under CAMR could have been banked for later use, which the agency itself said would result in utilities delaying compliance with the full 70% reduction until well beyond 2018, as they used up banked allowances rather than installing further controls. The agency's analysis projected actual emissions to be 24.3 tons (less than a 50% reduction) as late as 2020. Full compliance with the 70% reduction would have been delayed until after 2025.

Under the Obama Administration, some additional NSR cases have been filed against electric utilities, and six cases have been settled.", "The controversy over the NSR process stems from EPA's use of it to require the installation of best available pollution controls on existing stationary sources of air pollution that have been modified. The Clean Air Act requires that plants undergoing modifications meet these NSR requirements, but industry has often avoided the NSR process by claiming that changes to existing sources were \"routine maintenance\" rather than modifications. In the 1990s, EPA began reviewing records of electric utilities, petroleum refineries, and other industries to determine whether the changes were, in fact, routine. As a result of these reviews, since late 1999, EPA and the Department of Justice have filed suit or administrative actions against numerous large sources of pollution, alleging that they made major modifications to their plants, extending plant life and increasing output, without undergoing required New Source Reviews and without installing best available pollution controls.", "Of the utilities charged with NSR violations, 21 have settled with the EPA, generally without going to trial. Under the settlements, they have agreed to spend about $10 billion on pollution controls or fuel switching to reduce emissions at their affected units. Combined, these companies will reduce pollution by at least 1.65 million tons annually. Since March 2000, the agency has also reached 24 agreements with petroleum refiners representing 88% of industry capacity.

A second case, involving Duke Energy, was initially decided in the utility's favor, but on appeal to the Supreme Court, the utility lost. The issue in that case involved whether EPA should consider the hourly emissions rate or the annual total of emissions in deciding whether to apply NSR. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, in a decision upheld by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, held that the company was not required to undergo NSR and install more stringent pollution controls since the maximum hourly emissions rate did not increase as a result of the modifications, even if annual emissions did increase. On April 2, 2007, the Supreme Court overturned the lower court rulings in a unanimous decision, finding that EPA's regulations, promulgated in 1980, clearly specified an increase in actual annual emissions as the measure of whether a permit for a modification was required.", "The Bush Administration promulgated a number of changes to the NSR regulations that would have made future enforcement of NSR less likely. In December 2002 and October 2003, the agency promulgated five sets of changes to the NSR rules. The most controversial were new regulations defining what constitutes routine maintenance. The new regulations would have exempted industrial facilities from undergoing NSR (and thus from installing new emission controls) if the cost of the replacement components was less than 20% of the replacement value of the process unit. Using this benchmark, few, if any, plant modifications would trigger new pollution controls. Fifteen states, three municipalities, and several environmental groups filed suit to block this \"equipment replacement / routine maintenance\" rule.

The new rule would have effectively allowed increases in annual emissions without an NSR permit, if a modification led to an increase in the hours of operation of a facility. The agency's proposal stated that this change would establish a uniform national emissions test, in conformance with the Fourth Circuit's decision in the Duke Energy case, and it downplayed the significance of the change in light of \"substantial emissions reductions from other CAA [Clean Air Act] requirements that are more efficient,\" an allusion to CAIR.

EPA is not required by statute to follow CASAC's recommendations; the act requires only that the Administrator set forth (in the Federal Register notice in which she proposes a NAAQS) any pertinent findings, recommendations, and comments made by CASAC and, if her proposal differs in an important respect from any of the recommendations, provide an explanation of the reasons for such differences. But the failure to follow CASAC recommendations almost inevitably raises the question of whether the Administrator's decision will be judged arbitrary and capricious in a judicial review. ", "In the recent revisions of both the ozone and PM standards, CASAC made detailed objections to the Administrator's final decisions. The committee's description of the process as having failed to meet statutory and procedural requirements played an important role during judicial review. This raises the question of whether Congress might opt to strengthen CASAC's statutory role in the review process, or limit the Administrator's authority to reject CASAC's advice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adequacy of Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["A feature common to many of the recent NAAQS reviews has been EPA's finding that the current monitoring network is inadequate to determine whether or not many areas of the country are in attainment of the standards. In several cases, such as for lead and sulfur dioxide, more extensive monitoring networks had been partly dismantled by the time the standards were reviewed, after years of indicating compliance with older, less stringent standards. In other cases, such as PM and NO 2 , the monitoring network was not designed to measure the kinds of exposure that current research identifies as a cause of concern (e.g., exposure to fine particles near highways). As a result, EPA and the states will need to devote resources in the next few years to expanding and refocusing the monitoring networks in order to identify areas where air quality does not meet new standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NAAQS Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Although most of the NAAQS standards are likely to have been revised by the end of 2011\u2014ultimately stimulating billions of dollars in expenditures on pollution control\u2014the impact of the new standards will be gradual. A NAAQS does not directly limit emissions; rather, a primary NAAQS represents the Administrator's formal judgment regarding the level of ambient pollution below which public health will be protected with an adequate margin of safety; a secondary standard reflects her judgment as to the level of ambient pollution necessary to protect public welfare, including protection of the environment, water quality, building materials, etc. ", "Promulgation of a NAAQS sets in motion a lengthy process under which states and the EPA first identify nonattainment areas. Those areas then undertake a complicated implementation process. The first step, designation of nonattainment areas, generally takes at least two years after a standard is promulgated, and in many cases longer, if a new monitoring network needs to be established. After nonattainment areas are formally designated, the states generally have three years to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) that identify the specific regulations and emission control requirements that will bring the area into attainment.", "Whether more stringent NAAQS will lead to stronger federal emission controls for the sources of pollution\u2014in addition to the controls contemplated by individual states or metropolitan areas\u2014is likely to be an important issue. Several of the criteria pollutants have impacts across state lines, far from the source of emissions; others (notably ozone) form in the atmosphere as the result of chemical reactions involving precursors that may have been emitted many miles upwind. Thus, measures taken by individual states and nonattainment areas to control emissions within their borders may be inadequate for the areas to attain a NAAQS. Federal standards for cars, trucks, power plants, and other major pollution sources could need strengthening for many areas to be able to attain the NAAQS. ", "Congress has given EPA the authority to strengthen such emission standards; but Congress may still act to review the implementation of that authority."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
