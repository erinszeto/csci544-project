Today, the NHSC recruits professionals and students in the health professions who represent a broad range of health fields, including medicine, nursing, physician assistants, dentistry, and mental and behavioral health. These individuals may qualify for scholarships as well as loan repayment awards, and may fulfill their service commitment in a rural or urban HPSA. For more than 38 years, the NHSC has recruited and placed some 28,000 health professionals in rural and urban HPSAs in the 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia. In FY2007, the NHSC placed more than 4,000 trained health professionals to serve in HPSAs.", "The NHSC is a health safety net program that aims to (1) add to the supply of primary health care workers through its recruitment programs, (2) retain primary health care workers in underserved areas, and (3) increase access to primary health care for underserved populations. As an element of the health safety net, the NHSC program complements other federal health workforce programs that support the education and training of health care professionals. These health workforce programs include various authorizations in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, Social Security Act, and authorities administered in the Indian Health Service, Department of Defense, and Department of Veterans Affairs.", "NHSC workforce programs intersect with other health safety net programs, such as the Health Centers program, and health care financing structures under Medicare and Medicaid. NHSC clinicians may serve patients at federally supported health centers, and these patients may pay for services through the Medicaid program. The Medicare program provides an incentive payment to qualified physicians who serve in HPSAs (that is, where NHSC providers are placed). Further, the Secretary of HHS places approximately 50% of NHSC clinicians to serve in health centers. Increases or decreases in the number of NHSC clinicians at community health centers, as precipitated by reductions in the NHSC recruitment appropriation, could have consequences on the quality of health care that is delivered at these centers. Such an imbalance among components of the health safety net, such as a reduction in NHSC clinicians, could result in additional unmet health care needs. These interrelationships among health safety programs suggest that as changes in federal policies affect one part of the health safety net, the effects of those policies are felt by the other parts.", "The statutory mandate for the NHSC is unique, as the NHSC is one among a few federally supported health workforce programs that retains various primary care clinicians in exchange for benefits provided. In 2008, Congress passed the Health Care Safety Net (HCSN) Act ( P.L. 110-355 ), which reauthorized the NHSC's programs through 2012. The NHSC is authorized in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, Sections 331-338A, 338B, and 338I. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the NHSC through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Clinician Recruitment and Service.", "The Omnibus Appropriation, 2009 ( P.L. 111-8 ) provided $135 million for the NHSC program for FY2009, which is $12 million more than the FY2008 appropriation of $123 million. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the economic stimulus bill that the President signed into law on February 17, 2009, provided an additional $300 million for the NHSC program, of which $225 million is available for FY2009. Thus the total FY2009 NHSC funding is $360 million.", "Despite the NHSC's recent reauthorization and increase in funding, policymakers face considerable challenges in providing direction for the NHSC in an era of health care reform and economic constraint. Growing demands for primary health care workers, brought on by an aging population, declining medical school and health professional school enrollments, and increases in the number of uninsured persons, add to the list of challenges that policymakers must confront. On the clinician level, some health reformers suggest that an increased level of responsibility be given to nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and if adopted, the size and character of the NHSC's workforce could be significantly affected, and a greater share of funding might support a larger number of nonphysician primary care providers. On a programmatic level, the Institute of Medicine recommends that the NHSC be a model program for developing geriatric specialists. In the 110 th Congress, at least two bills were introduced to establish a geriatric loan repayment program, modeled after the NHSC, to train individuals in geriatrics and gerontology to meet growing demands in those fields. Altering the benefits structure for the NHSC is yet another consideration. One proposal is to extend the long-term commitment that is made between the NHSC and the NHSC clinician beyond the current maximum of 4 years to a period of 20 or 30 years, Another proposal suggests that the NHSC clinician commit to work in HPSAs in exchange for more extensive benefits such as a pension plan. ", "The NHSC's role as a major program for recruiting and retaining primary health care workers is increasingly recognized for its track record in recruiting and retaining primary health care workers, given the boost it received from the economic stimulus legislation (ARRA 2009). As legislators consider options for health care reform, the NHSC's potential contributions are of significant interest.

The Secretary of HHS must designate and publish the list of HPSAs. ", "Criteria for designating HPSA are codified in 42 CFR Part 5. Depending on whether the HPSA is a population, geographic area, or facility, those criteria may include such factors as (1) a low ratio of population to primary care physicians; (2) overuse of, or inaccessibility to, primary medical professionals; (3) constituency that belongs to a federally recognized Native American tribe; or (4) status as a public and/or nonprofit medical facility, such as a federally qualified health center. Each type of HPSA is further differentiated into three specialties: primary medical care, mental health care, and dental care.

The first is that the NHSC awarded more than 3,000 new two-year loan repayment contracts in the years 2003 through 2005. The second is that as many of these clinicians apply for continuations for their third, fourth, and fifth year of service, there is less funding for new contracts. The result is a larger number of clinicians with amendments remaining in the field, and a smaller number of new clinicians who are available to begin service in the field.", "The first goal, consistent with the NHSC mission, focused on increasing the field strength of the NHSC through scholarships and loan repayments. Figure 4 graphs the number of individuals that have fulfilled a service commitment in a HPSA from FY2002 through FY2008 (est.). The number of NHSC clinicians serving in HPSAs increased by 73% during the period from FY2002 through FY2005. The spike in the number of clinicians available to serve in FY2005 is the result of an the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ), which exempts NHSC loan repayments from taxable income (Section 320). As a result of this law, HRSA made approximately 40% more awards under the loan repayment program as tax reimbursements to loan repayors were no longer needed. Scholarship awards are also tax exempt. However, for the same years (from FY2004 to FY2005), the NHSC appropriation declined by nearly a quarter, and continued to decline in subsequent years through FY2008. During the period from FY2005 through FY2008, the NHSC did not reach its goal of increasing field strength, as NHSC field strength decreased by nearly 25%.", "The second goal, also consistent with the NHSC mission, aimed to increase the percentage of NHSC clinicians who are retained to serve in HPSAs. NHSC clinicians who are retained are those who seek to remain serving in a HPSA for at least one year, after their service commitment has ended. For each of FY2006, FY2007, and FY2008, the NHSC sought to achieve a 79% retention rate for its clinicians. However, actual data for these years have not been consistently reported or are incomplete, and therefore it is difficult to determine whether this program goal has been met.", "A third goal, related to the NHSC mission, focused on increasing the number of individuals served by NHSC clinicians. Figure 5 shows the number of individuals who received service from NHSC clinicians during the period from FY2004 through FY2007 (and estimates for service through FY2008). Trends show that between FY2004 and FY2006, the population served by the NHSC increased from 3.8 million to 4.5 million, thus meeting the goal for increased service to HPSA populations. However, in fiscal years FY2007 and FY2008, the size of the HPSA population served by the NHSC decrease by nearly a million, thus falling short of the goal to expand service to needy populations.", "A fourth goal, initiated by NHSC administrators, sought to increase the number of list-vacancies (which are qualified job postings where NHSC clinicians may fulfill their service commitment).

Figure 6 shows the number of list-vacancies filled by NHSC clinicians, during the period from FY2003 through FY2006 (and estimates through FY2008). The trend for filling these vacancies has been uneven. The actual number of list-vacancies filled by NHSC clinicians fluctuated from 3,000 in FY2003 down to 2,600 in FY2004, and up again to more than 3,000 in FY2005. A four-year low of 1,746 list-vacancies were filled in FY2007. Overall, for the period from FY2003 through FY2008, it appears that the goal of increasing the number of list vacancies filled was not consistently achieved.

The period for automatic designation ended at the end of FY2008. Finally, the law required administrators at NHSC placement sites to encourage training and development for NHSC clinicians."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "111th Congress: Legislative Activity", "paragraphs": ["On March 12, 2009, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on the health workforce and issues in health care reform. Though this hearing focused on graduate medical education, some witnesses suggested that legislators consider reforms in the NHSC, so as to bring more qualified individuals into the primary health care workforce. Suggested reforms included providing more attractive incentives for participation and extending mandatory periods of service in HPSAs. Given recent interest in issues connected with health care reform, coupled with the recent boost in the NHSC annual and supplemental appropriation (through the economic stimulus), legislators may consider holding hearings on the NHSC, its current status as a safety net program, its potential contribution to the expanding health safety net, and its prospects for building the health workforce. Hearings that were held during the period from 2000 through 2007 focused broadly on health safety net programs, with much attention to community health centers and less focus on the NHSC.", "Generally, annual appropriations hearings in the House and Senate allow legislators to deliberate on the rationale for appropriating NHSC funds and to insert legislative directives that require no statutory action. Appropriations histories point to such directives where from time to time congressional committees directed the Secretary to take actions on selected issues. Issues that may be of interest to the current Congress include health care reform; opportunities for research, evaluation, and assessment; and defining the need for NHSC clinicians."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NHSC's Role in Health Care Reform", "paragraphs": ["Increased access to health care through health care reform legislation could require a corresponding increase in the size of the health workforce. As an important part of the federal health care safety net, the NHSC contributes primary care clinicians to serve in areas where health professional shortages are most severe. An increase in the NHSC's workforce capacity could increase the volume of primary care services available under health insurance programs for safety net populations, assuming that these programs are adequately financed. The Massachusetts experience shows that an increase in access to health insurance with no concomitant increase in the health workforce results in decreased access to care.", "Assessing the balance that NHSC clinicians might confer on the full range of health safety net programs requires reliable and timely data. Some point out that the number of active primary care providers practicing in underserved areas is unknown, and this paucity in the data confounds the best efforts to determine the actual need for health professionals. As previously stated, NHSC administrators have sought to accurately count primary health care workers in HPSAs since the designation applies a ratio of physicians to population as a benchmark. However, enumerating the primary care provider workforce has become complicated as the primary care workforce is increasingly populated by nurses and physician assistants. Though NHSC administrators already require certain data measures from NHSC placement sites, some argue that more needs to be done to accurately portray the status of health worker shortages and how this intersects with federal support. Others vie for applying more nurse practitioners to meet workforce needs. Debates on workforce supply and demand are ongoing, but the presence or lack of data is likely to play a key role in decisions that affect the workforce and health safety net.

Some propose a more robust NHSC that could usher in expanded health care \"with a variety of delivery programs,\" and might be \"broadened and improved, with much enlarged financial resources placed at its disposal.\" Attempts to open up the NHSC through demonstration projects, to include optometrists, pediatricians, and physical therapists, have met resistance as the statute provides that the NHSC is a program for primary care clinicians. Others suggest that any expansion of the NHSC, to include other professional groups such as specialists, could attenuate efforts to increase the supply of primary care clinicians who focus on basic and routine care. ", "In 2001, a HRSA-supported study, Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the National Health Service Corps , provided analysis on the extent to which the NHSC accomplishes its goals for retaining clinicians, among other things. Researchers surveyed more than 2,100 NHSC alumni and 1,100 NHSC clinicians who were serving in HPSAs. The study concluded that (1) the loan repayment program yielded higher retention rates among NHSC clinicians than did the scholarship program; (2) as a whole, physician assistants and nurse practitioners reported greater satisfaction with their positions and compensation when compared with physicians, and were more likely to make contributions to community programs; (3) clinicians who were practicing in rural areas reported a higher level of job satisfaction than their urban counterparts; and (4) some evidence suggested that mature NHSC clinicians have higher retention rates than those who are younger and have less experience. Some of these findings are supported in an earlier study by the GAO, where analysts compared the costs and benefits of the NHSC scholarship and loan repayment programs and determined whether NHSC had distributed available providers to as many eligible areas as possible. Loan repayment programs offer a better long-term investment of limited federal dollars than scholarships, according to the study. Loan repayors are older and more experienced than scholars. Regarding the effectiveness of NHSC programs, the GAO found that NHSC is an important safety net provider to vulnerable populations, but certain improvements would enhance its effectiveness. These improvements include an improved system to identify and measure areas' need for NHSC clinicians, a better placement process, and coordination with other federal and state efforts to place providers in areas that need them.", "The placement and utilization of NHSC clinicians within HPSAs has been a recurring focus for GAO analysis. In 2001, GAO testified that problems in recruiting and retaining health care professionals could worsen as demand for these workers increases. High levels of job dissatisfaction among nurses and nurse aides could play a crucial role in current and future nursing shortages. However, analysts called for (1) more detailed data in order to define the extent and nature of those shortages so as to assist in planning and targeting corrective efforts; (2) better coordination of NHSC placements, with immigration waivers for foreign physicians who are educated in the United States, to assist in more needy areas; (2) and improvements in the systems for identifying underservice so as to collect more consistent and reliable information on the changing needs for services in underserved communities. ", "In 2002, evaluators in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed and applied a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) to assess the NHSC's performance. PART evaluators reported a \"moderately effective\" evaluation, stating that the NHSC's clinicians who work in HPSAs can increase access to physicians or other health clinicians among underserved populations who may otherwise have been unable to afford health care. They also found that the NHSC has shown some efficiency improvements by shifting resources from administrative staff to pay for more doctors and other clinicians. PART evaluators recommended greater flexibility in the allocation of NHSC funding between scholarships and loans that could further improve efficiency. The NHSC lacks outcome data for newly adopted measures, such as follow-up information that track NHSC providers' service in a HPSA for one or more years, according to PART evaluators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Designating the Need for NHSC Clinicians", "paragraphs": ["Between CY2000 and CY2006, the number of HPSA designations has been characterized by rsteady growth (see Appendix C ).

Accurate assessments of provider-to-population ratios enable the Secretary of HHS to use scarce resources as efficiently as possible.
