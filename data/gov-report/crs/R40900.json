The Affordable Health Choices for America Act (H.R. 3962) was introduced in the House of Representatives on October 29, 2009. H.R. 3962 is based on H.R. 3200, America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, originally introduced on July 14, 2009, and reported separately on October 14, 2009, by three House Committees\u2014Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means. H.R. 3962 was further modified by the manager's amendment posted on November 3, 2009. H.R. 3962, as passed by the House on November 7, 2009, proposes sweeping reforms of the health care delivery system, described in the three divisions. Division A, \"Affordable Health Care Choices,\" focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, and providing financial assistance to certain individuals and small employers. Division B, \"Medicare and Medicaid Improvements,\" proposes modifications to the largest two public health insurance programs to make them consistent with provisions in Division A and to amend other provisions in existing federal statute. Division C, \"Public Health and Workforce Development,\" would amend and expand existing health professions and nursing workforce programs.

The report focuses primarily on provisions in Division B, Title VII\u2014Medicaid and CHIP, plus selected provisions in Title IX\u2014Miscellaneous Provisions. It also describes selected sections of Titles I and II of Division D, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2009, related to improving access to Medicaid and CHIP for American Indians and Alaskan Natives. Due to the breadth of the changes proposed in H.R. 3962, some provisions of Divisions A and C also could affect Medicaid, but these are not Medicaid-specific. The Division B provisions would modify existing law and add new provisions affecting Medicaid eligibility; benefits; financing; waste, fraud, and abuse; payments to territories; demonstrations and pilot programs; and other miscellaneous Medicaid components. A major provision in Division B would expand Medicaid eligibility for traditional and non-traditional beneficiary categories up to 150% of the federal poverty level. The federal government would fully finance the costs for certain of these expanded beneficiary categories for periods before 2015, decreasing to 91% beginning in 2015. With respect to benefits, Medicaid programs would be required to cover preventive services, and would be allowed to cover nurse home visitation and birthing center services.", "There are a number of financing changes that would affect Medicaid under H.R. 3962, including reducing Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments by $10 billion by FY2019, increasing prescription drug rebates, and raising provider payments for certain primary care services. Additional waste, fraud, and abuse provisions affecting Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) include requirements to deny payment for health care acquired conditions, require new Medicaid Integrity Program evaluations and reports, and require states to implement a national correct coding initiative, similar to the Medicare program. Under H.R. 3962, spending caps for the territories would be increased, and a series of demonstrations would be approved, including a medical home program, an accountable care organization program, and a program for stabilization of emergency medical conditions by mental disease institutions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Status of House Legislation", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3962 , Affordable Health Care for America Act, was introduced in the House of Representatives on October 29, 2009.

There is no formal federal reporting mechanism to document Medicaid GME payments made by states. In 2005, total state and federal Medicaid payments for GME were estimated to be nearly $3.2 billion. On average, Medicaid GME payments were estimated to represent 7% of total Medicaid inpatient hospital expenditures. In May 2007, CMS issued a proposed rule that would have eliminated federal reimbursement for GME under Medicaid. Subsequent federal laws have placed a moratorium on further action on this rule. Most recently, ARRA included a Sense of the Senate provision that the Secretary should not promulgate a final GME payment rule. In its May 11, 2009, unified agenda for forthcoming regulatory action, HHS indicated that final action is \"to be determined\" on the proposed Medicaid GME rule.

To increase transparency and enable GME funds to be monitored, states would be required to provide timely information to the Secretary on annual GME payments. States would be required to report total GME payments and how these payments were used including (1) the institutions and programs eligible for receiving the funding, (2) the manner in which such payments are calculated, (3) the types and fields of education being supported, (4) the workforce or other goals to which the funding is being applied, (5) state progress in meeting workforce or other state GME funding goals, and (6) other information the Secretary determines will assist states in supporting other types and fields of education and workforce goals. In addition, H.R. 3962 also would require that the information reported to the Secretary is provided to an Advisory Committee on Health Workforce Evaluation and Assessment, and the Secretary and this advisory committee would independently review the state information. The Secretary also would be required to issue rules before December 31, 2011 on program goals for Medicaid GME payments, and requirements for use of GME funds. Finally, the bill would add a state option to make hospital GME payments under Medicaid, consistent with the other provisions of this section of the bill. These provisions would be effective upon enactment of H.R. 3962 , and nothing in this section of the bill would affect payments made before such date under a state Medicaid plan for GME.
