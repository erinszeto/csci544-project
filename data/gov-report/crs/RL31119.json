As stated in taped appearances by its leaders since the September 11, 2001terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the goal of Al Qaeda is to destroy high profile U.S.targets in order to end what Al Qaeda claims is U.S. suppression of Islamic societies. In these appearances, binLaden virtually claimed responsibility for the September 11 attacks. Throughout its history, Al Qaeda has soughtto oust pro-U.S. regimes in the Middle East and gain removal of U.S. troops from the region.", "Before September 11, signs pointed to a decline in state sponsorship of terrorism. Since the attacks, some countries that are designated by the United States as state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran and Sudan, havecooperated to an extent with the U.S.-led war against Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. Inspite of its cooperation against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, Iran is still considered a major sponsor of radicalIslamic groups that conduct terrorism against Israel.", "The Arab-Israeli peace process is a longstanding major U.S. foreign policy interest, and the Administration and Congress are concerned about any terrorist groups or state sponsors that oppose the process. Possibly because ofa breakdown in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process in September 2000, Palestinian organizations such asHamas, as well as older groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine that have been inactivefor years, have stepped up operations against Israelis. Following several major terrorist attacks against Israelissince December 2001, the United States has strongly criticized Palestinian Authority President Yasir Arafat forfailing to exert sufficient efforts to constrain these and other groups. Some analysts assert that Israel's actionsagainst the Palestinians have contributed to increased Palestinian support for violence against Israel.", "U.S. differences with other governments on the strategies for countering terrorism in the Near East have to some extent narrowed since September 11. The United States, in the past, differed with its allies, particularly on howto deal with state sponsors of terrorism; most allied governments believe that engaging these countriesdiplomatically might sometimes be more effective than trying to isolate or punish them. The United States hasgenerally been more inclined than its European allies to employ sanctions and military action to compel statesponsors and groups to abandon terrorism. Post-September 11 developments seem to have validated theimportance of both diplomacy and, in certain circumstances, more forceful responses in dealing with terrorism. Differences with allies have begun to reemerge as the Bush Administration expands its \"war on terrorism,\"indicating it will seek to prevent the emergence of threats by regimes -- some of which also have ties to terroristgroups -- that are developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD).", "This report will be updated annually."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction (1)", "paragraphs": ["This report updates the version issued on September 10, 2001, just prior to the September 11 attacks on theWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 persons.

(2) This report adopts the samedefinition of terrorism as that used by the State Department in its annual reports: the definition contained in Title22 U.S.C. Section 2656f(d). According to this section, \"terrorism\" means \"premeditated politically-motivatedviolence perpetrated against non-combatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intendedto influence an audience.\"", "Five out of the seven states currently on the terrorism list are located in the Near East region -- Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Sudan. (The other two are Cuba and North Korea, which will not be covered in this report). Thecomposition of the list has not changed since Sudan was added in 1993. The groups analyzed in this reportinclude, but are not limited to, those designated as \"Foreign Terrorist Organizations\" (FTOs), pursuant to theAnti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-132 ). The last section of the report discussessignificant themes in U.S. unilateral and multilateral efforts to combat terrorism in or from the region. The StateDepartment's annual report on international terrorism, entitled Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2000 (3) is asignificant source for this report; other sources include press reports and conversations with U.S.counter-terrorism officials, experts, investigative journalists, and foreign diplomats. ", "Although the September 11 attacks have placed Near Eastern terrorist groups at the center of U.S. anti-terrorism policy, Near Eastern terrorist groups and their state sponsors have been a focus of U.S. counter-terrorism policiesfor several decades. Since the 1970s, many of the most high-profile acts of terrorism against American citizensand targets have been conducted by these groups, sometimes with the encouragement or at the instigation of theirstate sponsors. However, no single terrorist attack -- either in or outside the Near East region -- compares inscale to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, which killed a total of over 3,000persons. Senior U.S. officials have attributed this attack to the Al Qaeda network, whose leaders enjoyedsanctuary in Afghanistan from 1996 until their defeat at the hands of the U.S. military and its Afghan partners inlate 2001.", "According to Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2000 (available on the U.S. Department of State's web site at http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/pgtrpt/2000/ ; hereafter cited as Patterns 2000 ), worldwideterrorism-relatedcasualties increased to 405 in 2000 from 233 in 1999, but the number of attacks increased only slightly, from 392in 1999 to 423 in 2000. Of these 2000 totals, only 16 of the 423 attacks and 19 of the 405 casualties occurred inthe Middle East, although Patterns 2000 covered only three months of the Palestinian uprising that began in lateSeptember 2000. Since 2001 began, there have been dozens of terrorism-related Israeli casualties resulting fromPalestinian suicide bomb attacks, some of them in retaliation for Israeli actions against suspected Palestinianmilitants. Thirty-one of attacks and 12 of the deaths during 2000 occurred in Eurasia (Central Asia, theCaucasus, and Russia). ", "The terrorist groups analyzed often differ in their motivations, objectives, ideologies, and levels of activity. The Islamist groups remain generally the most active, stating as their main objective the overthrow of secular,pro-Western governments, the derailment of the Arab-Israeli peace process, the expulsion of U.S. forces from theregion, or the end of what they consider unjust occupation of Muslim lands. Some groups, such as the KurdistanWorkers' Party (PKK), fight for cultural and political rights or the formation of separate ethnically-based states. Table 1 below shows the 20 Near Eastern groups currently designated by the State Departmentas FTOs. Thedesignations were mostly made when the FTO list was inaugurated in October 1997 and revised in October 1999and October 2001. A group can be added to the list at any time; Al Qaeda (the bin Laden network) was added onAugust 21, 1998, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan was designated on September 25, 2000, and two Pakistanigroups -- Lashkar e-Tayyiba and Jaish e-Mohammad -- were added to the FTO list on December 26, 2001.", "Under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the designation of a group as an FTO blocks its assetsin the United States and makes it a criminal offense for U.S. persons to provide it with material support orresources, such as financial contributions. Executive Order 12947 of January 23, 1995, also bars U.S. dealings(contributions to or financial transactions) with any individuals named as \"Specially Designated Terrorists(SDTs).\" On November 2, 2001, the Secretary of State also subjected all FTOs to the increased financialrestrictions that had been applied to Al Qaeda-related entities under Executive Order 13224 (September 23,2001). Under this new executive order, the United States can close down U.S. branches of foreign banks that donot comply with U.S. requests to end dealings with the FTOs. An SDT, according to the executive order, is aperson found to pose a significant risk of disrupting the Middle East peace process, or to have materiallysupported acts of violence toward that end.", " Table 1. Near Eastern Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)", "In contrast to Patterns 2000, this report analyzes the following:", "The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which has not been the subject of a separate section in Patterns since Patterns 1995, is analyzed in this report because of the debate over whether PLO leaderYasir Arafat is taking sufficient steps to prevent terrorism by other groups in areas under the control of thePalestinian Authority. Since late 2000, there has been discussion about the degree to which certain PLO factionsare involved in violence against Israel and whether they should be named as FTOs. ", "When the FTO list was reviewed and re-issued in October 1999, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) was dropped, largely because it has reconciled with Arafat. The group's pastinvolvement in terrorism, and the recent revival of its operations against Israel, are discussed in this report. ", "This report contains a section on the Abu Sayyaf Group operating in the Philippines, as well as analysis of several Pakistani Islamist groups that are fighting Indian control of part of Kashmir Province. These groups are discussed in this report, even though they operate outside the Near East region, because of theiralleged connections to the bin Laden network and the Taliban of Afghanistan.", "In accordance with the October 2001 redesignation of the FTO list, the two Jewish extremist groups Kach and Kahane Chai will be treated as one group.

Having accomplished its main goal of ousting Israel from southern Lebanon, some in the organizationwant it to focus exclusively on political and social work, primarily through participation in parliament (it holds 8out of 128 total seats) and through its charity and reconstruction works with Lebanon's Shiite community. Somewant Hizballah to accept ministerial positions in Lebanon's cabinet, a step that Hizballah has thus far not taken. Hardliners in Hizballah want it to battle Israeli forces over the border, particularly in the disputed Shib'a farmsarea. (5) Other hardliners in the organization believethat the Israeli withdrawal validated its guerrilla strategy andappear to be helping Palestinian groups apply similar tactics against Israeli forces in the West Bank and GazaStrip. ", "Although initially encouraged by Hizballah's relative restraint following the Israeli withdrawal, Israel and the United States remain wary of Hizballah. Hizballah's 15 year military campaign against Israeli and Israelisurrogate forces in southern Lebanon -- activity that is not technically considered terrorism by the U.S. StateDepartment -- often included rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. Even though the United Nations has certifiedthat Israel's withdrawal is complete, Hizballah has asserted that Israel still occupies some Lebanese territory (theShib'a farms) and, on that basis, has conducted several military attacks on Israel since the withdrawal. InOctober 2000, Hizballah captured three Israeli soldiers in the Shib'a farms area and kidnaped an Israelinoncombatant whom it had lured to Lebanon. Israel announced in early November 2001 that the three soldiersare believed dead. ", "Hizballah has continued to conduct surveillance of the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon and its personnel, according torecent Patterns reports, but no major terrorist attacks have been attributed to it since 1994. However, accordingto numerous press reports and Hizballah leaders' own statements, the organization is providing advice andlogistical support to Islamist Palestinian groups fighting against Israel in the latest Palestinian uprising, whichbegan in September 2000. In January 2001, Israel accused Hizballah of serving as an intermediary in theshipment of 50 tons of weaponry from Iran that was seized by Israel and, according to the United States andIsrael, was bound for the Palestinian Authority. The PA is precluded from fielding the weapons contained in theshipment under its Oslo interim accords with Israel. If true, this suggests that Hizballah is trying to broaden itsassistance to non-Islamist Palestinian elements. In late August 2001, Jordanian officials discovered a cache ofrockets at a Hizballah-owned location in Jordan, igniting fears that Hizballah might fire rockets on Israel fromthere or might provide the weapons to Palestinian militants there or in the West Bank. (6) Jordan's King Abdullahwas said to have raised his concern about growing Hizballah activity in Jordan with President Bush in February2002. ", "Hizballah's History. Founded in 1982 by Lebanese Shiiteclerics inspired by the Islamic revolutionary ideology of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, Hizballah's original goalwas to establish an Islamic republic in Lebanon. During the 1980s, Hizballah was a principal sponsor ofanti-Western, and particularly anti-U.S., terrorism. It is known or suspected to have been involved in suicidetruck bombings of the U.S. Embassy (April 1983), the U.S. Marine barracks (October 1983, killing 220 Marine,18 Navy and 3 Army personnel), and the U.S. Embassy annex (September 1984), all in Beirut. It also hijackedTWA Flight 847 in 1985, killing a Navy diver, Robert Stethem, who was on board, and its factions wereresponsible for the detention of most, if not all, U.S. and Western hostages held in Lebanon during the 1980s andearly 1990s. Eighteen Americans were held hostage in Lebanon during that period, three of whom were killed. ", "In the early 1990s, Hizballah also demonstrated an ability to conduct terrorism far from the Middle East. In May 1999, Argentina's Supreme Court, after an official investigation, formally blamed Hizballah for the March 17,1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in Buenos Aires and issued an arrest warrant for Hizballah terrorist leaderImad Mughniyah. Hizballah did not claim responsibility for the attack outright, but it released a surveillance tapeof the embassy, implying responsibility. In May 1998, FBI Director Louis Freeh told Argentina the FBI believesthat Hizballah, working with Iranian diplomats, was also responsible for the July 18, 1994 bombing of theArgentine-Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires that left 86 dead. (7) In July 1999,Argentine investigators brought charges against 20 suspected Argentine collaborators in the AMIA bombings,and the trial began in late September 2001.", "Hizballah's Outside Connections. Hizballah maintainsconnections with similar groups in the Persian Gulf. Saudi and Bahraini investigations of anti-regime unresthave revealed the existence of local chapters of Hizballah composed of Shiite Muslims, many of whom havestudied in Iran's theological seminaries and received terrorist training there and in Lebanon. Saudi and U.S.officials believe that Saudi Shiite Muslims, possibly with connections to Lebanese Hizballah, were responsiblefor the June 25, 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex for U.S. military personnel, nearDhahran, Saudi Arabia. The United States reaffirmed this allegation in the June 2001 U.S. indictments of 14Khobar suspects. According to Patterns 1998, in November 1998 Bahraini authorities uncovered an allegedbomb plot that they blamed on persons linked to Bahraini and Lebanese Hizballah. ", "Patterns 1999 reiterates that Hizballah receives \"substantial\" amounts of financial assistance, weapons, and political and organizational support from both Syria and Iran, although it does not mention specific figures. ThenSecretary of State Christopher said on May 21, 1996 that Iran gave Hizballah about $100 million per year, afigure that U.S. officials have not since deviated from. A reported 150 of Iran's Revolutionary Guards remain inLebanon to coordinate Iran's aid to Hizballah. Syria permits Iran to supply weapons to Hizballah through theinternational airport in Damascus, although a recent Turkish shutdown of the air corridor connecting Iran andSyria has made Iranian deliveries more difficult. ", "Specially Designated Terrorists (SDTs). (8) Hizballah membersnamed as SDTs include: (1) Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah, who is about 44 and has led Hizballah since1993; (2) Shaykh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, the 64-year-old senior Shiite cleric and leading spiritual figureof Hizballah; (3) Subhi Tufayli, the 54 year old former Hizballah Secretary General who leads a radicalbreakaway faction of Hizballah; and (4) Imad Mughniyah, the 39 year old Hizballah intelligence officer andalleged holder of some Western hostages in the 1980s. He was also implicated in the TWA 847 hijacking.

Hamas leaders also appeared resigned to an eventual final peaceagreement between Israel and the PA, although they continued to criticize Arafat as too eager to compromisewith Israel. Since the uprising began, Hamas and its smaller ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), have escalatedterrorist attacks against Israelis. Hamas claimed responsibility for the June 1, 2001 suicide bombing of the\"Dolphinarium\" discotheque in Tel Aviv, which killed 21, and for an August 9, 2001 suicide bombing at a pizzarestaurant in Jerusalem that killed 18, including one American. It also claimed responsibility for the December 1- 2, 2001 suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Haifa that killed about 25 persons, in addition to the three bombers. PIJ has conducted several recent suicide bombings, many of which killed only the bomber(s). Many expertsbelieve that the renewed terrorist activity is at least partly attributable to a breakdown in security cooperationbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority -- cooperation that was widely credited with keeping terroristattacks to a minimum in the preceding few years. The renewed terrorist threat has led Israel to adopt a policy,criticized by the United States and many other countries, of assassinating Hamas and PIJ activists to preempttheir suspected attacks. ", "Hamas continues to receive funding from businesses it runs in Palestinian controlled areas, from Iran (about 10%of its budget), from wealthy private benefactors in the Persian Gulf monarchies, and Palestinian expatriates,according to Patterns 2000. The Patterns report adds that the group conducts fundraising and propagandaactivities in Western Europe and North America. Many individual donors appear to believe their contributionsgo to charitable activities for poor Palestinians served by Hamas' social services network, and are not being usedfor terrorism. PIJ is politically closer to Iran than is Hamas, and apparently derives most of its funding from statesponsors, especially Iran. PIJ receives some logistical support from Syria, according to Patterns 2000. ", "History. Hamas was formed by Muslim Brotherhood activistsduring the early stages of the earlier Palestinian uprising (intifada) in 1987. Its spiritual leader, Shaykh AhmadYassin, who is paralyzed, was released from prison by Israel in October 1997. He seems to serve as a bridgebetween Hamas' two main components -- the extremists who orchestrate terrorist attacks (primarily through aclandestine wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades), and the more moderate elements affiliated with Hamas'social services, charity, and educational institutions. PIJ was, in part, inspired by the Iranian revolution of 1979even though PIJ is a Sunni Muslim, not a Shiite Muslim organization. PIJ remains almost purely a guerrillaorganization, with no overt component. It is led by Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, a Gaza-born, 43 year oldacademic who previously was an adjunct professor at the University of South Florida. He was chosen leader in1995 after his predecessor, Fathi al-Shiqaqi was assassinated, allegedly by Israeli agents. Recent Patterns reportscharacterize Hamas' strength as \"an unknown number of hardcore members [and] tens of thousands of supportersand sympathizers,\" and PIJ's strength as \"unknown.\"", "Hamas and PIJ generally have not targeted the United States or Americans directly, although Americans have died in attacks by these groups, along with Israelis and often the bombers themselves. Five out of the 65 killed ina series of four Hamas/PIJ bombings in Israel during February - March 1996 were American citizens. Thesebombings had the apparent effect of shifting public opinion toward the conservative Likud Party leader BenjaminNetanyahu in Israeli national elections on May 29, 1996, possibly proving decisive in his election victory asPrime Minister over then Labor Party leader Shimon Peres. Neither group conducted major attacks in the run-upto the May 1999 Israeli elections, although they did carry out attacks in an attempt to derail the negotiation andimplementation of the October 23, 1998 Israeli-Palestinian Wye River Memorandum. In total, the two groupshave conducted about 80 suicide bombings or attempted suicide bombings, killing more than 450 Israelis, sincethe signing of the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles in 1993. (9)", "Blocked Assets. The United States has blocked the assets ofsome alleged Hamas/PIJ leaders, using the authority of President Clinton's January 23, 1995 executive order onMiddle East terrorism. As of the end of 2000, a total of about $17,000 in PIJ assets in the United States wereblocked, consisting of a bank account belonging to PIJ leader Shallah.

In astreet battle in Mogadishu in October 1993, 18 U.S. special operations forces were killed in a battle withmilitiamen allegedly supplied and assisted by Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda's involvement with the Somali militiasappears to have strengthened bin Laden's view that terrorism and low-technology combat could succeed incausing the United States to withdraw from military involvement abroad.

The plots in Asia, all of which failed,were: to assassinate the Pope during his late 1994 visit to the Philippines and President Clinton during his visitthere in early 1995; to bomb the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Manila in late 1994; and to bomb U.S. trans-Pacificflights. ", "The August 7, 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224persons, including 12 American citizens, occurred just after a six month period in which bin Laden had issuedrepeated and open threats, including a February 1998 pronouncement calling for the killing of U.S. civilians andservicemen worldwide. On August 20, 1998, the United States launched cruise missiles on bin Laden's trainingcamps in eastern Afghanistan, based on U.S. evidence of his network's involvement in the bombings. TheUnited States also struck a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that the Administration alleged was linked to bin Ladenand was producing chemical weapons agents. U.S. officials add that the bombings were intended to disruptplanning for a new attack. For their alleged role in the bombings, 17 alleged members of Al Qaeda have beenindicted by a U.S. court, including bin Laden. Four of the six in U.S. custody have been tried and convicted;three others were arrested and have been convicted in Britain.

The United States plot, allegedly to bomb Los Angeles international airport, was orchestrated by apro-bin Laden cell of Algerian Armed Islamic Group members coming from Canada. In June 2000, Jordan tried28 persons who allegedly were planning to attack tourists during millennium festivities in that country, but 15 ofthose charged are still at large. Also in June 2000, Lebanon placed 29 alleged followers of bin Laden, whobelong to an organization called Asbat al-Ansar (see above), on trial for planning terrorist attacks in Jordan. Thepresence of bin Laden cells in Jordan and Lebanon, coupled with Israeli arrests of alleged bin Laden operatives inthe West Bank and Gaza Strip, suggests that Al Qaeda might plan acts of terrorism in connection with thePalestinian uprising. Some press reports in February 2002 indicate that some Al Qaeda activists who fledAfghanistan after the start of the U.S. war effort have gone to Lebanon. If the reports are true, the fleeing AlQaeda members might be benefitting from the Asbat al-Ansar network there.

Five people died in thesemailings, which temporarily closed several congressional buildings and post offices. No one has been arrestedfor the mailings. U.S. officials say it appears, based on tests, that the source of the anthrax was domestic, suchas a military research laboratory, but a connection to Al Qaeda has not been ruled out.", "SDTs/Executive Orders.

The order alsonamed bin Laden as an SDT, along with Rifai Taha Musa, of the Egyptian Islamic Group (see that section above)and Mohammad Atef.

Financially, Al Qaeda drew initially onthe personal fortune of bin Laden, variously estimated at anywhere from $50 million to $300 million. Theorganization, according to most press reports, later became relatively self-sustaining, relying on funding frommany other sources, including contributions, Islamic charities and lending institutions, such as Al Barakat, andsome legitimate businesses, such as a chain of honey shops and bakeries in the Middle East. Executive Order13224 of September 23, 2001, greatly expanded the number of Al Qaeda related entities under financialrestrictions, and increased the scope of the restrictions to include penalties against foreign financial entities thatconduct transactions with the named entities.
