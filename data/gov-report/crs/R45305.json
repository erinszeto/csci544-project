Farm income and commodity price support programs have been a part of U.S. farm bills since the 1930s. Each successive farm bill usually involves some modification or replacement of existing farm programs. A key question likely to be asked of every new farm proposal or program is how it will affect U.S. commitments under the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and its Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM).", "The United States is currently committed, under the AoA, to spend no more than $19.1 billion annually on those domestic farm support programs most likely to distort trade\u2014referred to as amber box programs and measured by the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS).

To date, the United States has never exceeded its $19.1 billion amber box spending limit.

Because the United States is a major producer, consumer, exporter, and/or importer of most major agricultural commodities, the SCM is relevant for most major U.S. agricultural products. As a result, if a particular U.S. farm program is deemed to result in market distortion that adversely affects other WTO members\u2014even if it is within agreed-upon AoA spending limits\u2014then that program may be subject to challenge under the WTO dispute settlement procedures.", "Designing farm programs that comply with WTO rules can avoid potential trade disputes.

Can a program's support outlays be excluded from the AMS total by being placed in the blue box of production-limiting programs? If amber, will support be less than 5% of production value (either product-specific or non-product-specific) thus qualifying for the de minimis exclusion? Does the total, remaining annual AMS exceed the $19.1 billion amber box limit?

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that exports account for about 20% of total U.S. agricultural production. Furthermore, given the substantial volume of its agricultural exports, the United States plays a significant role in many international agricultural markets. As a result, U.S. farm policy is often subject to intense scrutiny both for compliance with current World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and for its potential to diminish the breadth or impede the success of future multilateral negotiations. In part, this is because a farm bill locks in U.S. policy behavior for an extended period of time during which the United States would be unable to accept any new restrictions on its domestic support programs.

The current omnibus farm bill, the Agricultural Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-79 ; the 2014 farm bill), which was signed into law on February 7, 2014, made several substantial changes to the previous farm safety net of the 2008 farm bill. The commodity programs of the 2014 farm bill became operational with the 2014 crop year. They are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2018, or with the 2018 crop year. Ultimately, the current farm bill will either be (1) replaced with new legislation, (2) temporarily extended, or (3) allowed to lapse and replaced with \"permanent law\"\u2014a set of essentially mothballed provisions for the farm commodity programs that date from the 1930s and 1940s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WTO Commitments May Influence Policy Choices", "paragraphs": ["A potential major constraint affecting U.S. agricultural policy choices is the set of commitments made as part of membership in the WTO.

In general, domestic policies or programs found to be in violation of WTO rules may be subject to challenge by another WTO member under the WTO dispute settlement process. If a WTO challenge is successful, the WTO remedy would likely imply the elimination, alteration, or amendment by Congress of the program in question to bring it into compliance. Since most governing provisions over U.S. farm programs are statutory, new legislation could be required to implement even minor changes to achieve compliance.

The two general criteria are the following:", "1. It must be a publicly funded government program (defined to include either outlays or forgone revenue) that does not involve transfers from consumers. 2. It must not have the effect of providing price support to producers.", "In addition, every green-box-qualifying program must comply with at least one of the following criteria and conditions specific to the program itself:", "A \"general service\" benefitting the agricultural or rural community in general cannot involve direct payments to producers or processors. Such programs can include research; pest and disease control; training, extension, or advisory services; inspection services, including for health, safety, grading, or standardization; marketing and promotion services, including information advice and promotion (but not spending for unspecified purposes that sellers could use to provide price discounts or other economic benefits to purchasers); and generally available infrastructure such as utility, transportation, or port facilities, water supply facilities, or other capital works construction. Public acquisition (at current market prices) and stockholding of products for food security must be integral to a nationally legislated food security program and be financially transparent. Domestic food aid is to be based upon clearly defined eligibility and nutritional criteria, be financially transparent, and involve government food purchases at current market prices. \"Decoupled\" income support is to use clearly defined eligibility criteria in a specified, fixed base period; not be related in any way after the base period to (a) domestic or world prices, (b) type or volume of crop or livestock production, or (c) factors of production; and, further, not be contingent on any production in exchange for payments. Government financial participation in an income insurance or income safety net program shall define eligibility as agricultural income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income (or equivalent in net income terms) in the preceding three-year period (or preceding five-year period, excluding the highest and lowest years\u2014the so-called Olympic average), with such payment compensating for less than 70% of the income loss in year of eligibility and payments based solely on income, not production, price, or inputs. Total annual payments under this and natural disaster relief (see next paragraph) cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Payments (whether direct or through government crop insurance) for natural disaster relief are to use eligibility based on formal government recognition of the disaster. Payments are to be determined by a production loss exceeding 30% of production in the preceding three-year (or five-year Olympic average) period; they are to apply only to losses of income, livestock, land, or other production factors; and they cannot exceed the total replacement cost or require specific future production. Total annual payments under this and the income insurance or safety net measure cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Structural adjustment through producer retirement shall tie eligibility to clearly defined criteria in programs to facilitate producers' \"total and permanent\" retirement from agricultural production or their movement into nonagricultural activities. Structural adjustment through resource retirement shall be determined through clearly defined programs designed to remove land, livestock, or other resources from marketable production with payments (a) conditioned on land being retired for at least three years and on livestock being permanently disposed, (b) not contingent upon any alternative specified use of such resources involving marketing agricultural production, and (c) not related to production type/quantity or to prices of products using remaining productive resources. Structural adjustment provided through investment aids must be determined by clearly defined criteria for programs assisting financial or physical restructuring of a producer's operations in response to objectively demonstrated structural disadvantages (and may also be based on a clearly defined program for \"re-privatization\" of agricultural land). The amount of payments (a) cannot be tied to type/volume of production or to prices in any year after the base period, (b) shall be provided only for a time period needed for realization of the investment in respect of which they are provided, (c) cannot be contingent on the required production of designated products (except to require participants not to produce a designated product), and (d) must be limited to the amount required to compensate for the structural disadvantage.

For example, the value of the 2015 U.S. corn crop was $49.3 billion, and 5% of that was $2.467 billion. This compares with corn-specific AMS outlays of $2.362 billion. Since it is below the 5% product-specific de minimis threshold, the entire $2.362 billion was exempted from inclusion under the AMS limit for the marketing year 2015. In contrast, U.S. sugar support of $1.525 billion for 2015 easily exceeded its 5% product-specific de minimis of $133.2 million (based on total sugar value of $2.7 billion) and, therefore, was counted against the AMS limit. Non-product-specific domestic support , whereby it does not exceed 5% of the \"value of the member's total agricultural production.\" All non-product-specific support is tallied to determine whether the 5% level is exceeded.
