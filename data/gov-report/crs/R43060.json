The bill proposed substantial changes to both the individual and corporate income tax systems, reducing statutory tax rates for many taxpayers, while repealing dozens of credits, deductions, and other tax preferences. While no further action was taken on H.R. 1 in the 113th Congress, the proposal continues to inform the ongoing tax reform debate.", "There are various policy options for achieving comprehensive tax reform. One option is a base-broadening, rate-reducing tax reform, in the spirit of the Tax Reform Act of 2014. An alternative approach would be to substantially revise or eliminate the current tax system, instead relying on an alternative tax base for revenues. Tax reform legislation introduced early in the 114th Congress has tended to take the latter approach, proposing a retail sales tax at the federal level or a flat tax. Similar proposals were introduced in the 112th and 113th Congresses, and did not advance. A cash flow tax for businesses has also been introduced in the 114th Congress.", "Both Congress and the Administration have indicated interest in tax reform through their respective budget processes.

The President's FY2017 budget proposes a number of tax policy changes, similar to the President's FY2016 budget, including substantial changes in the international tax system.", "The prevailing framework for evaluating tax policy considers equity (or fairness), efficiency, and simplicity. Equity examines the distribution of the tax burden across different groups. This information can then be used to assess the \"fairness\" of the tax system. A tax system that is economically efficient generally provides neutral treatment, minimizing economic distortions and maximizing output. A tax system that is simple reduces administrative and compliance costs while also promoting transparency.", "Oftentimes, there are trade-offs to be considered when evaluating tax policy options. For example, shifting toward a consumption tax might enhance economic efficiency. However, taxing consumption rather than income tends to put an increased tax burden on lower-income taxpayers relative to higher-income taxpayers, reducing the progressivity of the tax system.

In January 2015, the Senate Finance Committee established five bipartisan working groups to evaluate tax reform options. The working groups' reports were released in July 2015. Both the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee have continued to hold hearings on tax reform in the 114 th Congress.", "There are various policy options for achieving comprehensive tax reform.

Tax reform legislation introduced early in the 114 th Congress has tended to take the latter approach, proposing a retail sales tax at the federal level or a flat tax. Either option can be designed to be revenue-neutral or change the revenue outlook, depending on the exact provisions of the reform.", "As an alternative to comprehensive tax reform, Congress may choose to consider reforms to certain parts of the code. For example, Congress may choose to consider international tax reform options, or evaluate business-only options. Toward the end of 2015, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), certain temporary provisions for individuals and businesses were made permanent. The 114 th Congress may consider other targeted tax changes to the taxation of individuals or businesses, absent comprehensive tax reform. ", "Tax systems are often evaluated using the criteria of efficiency, equity, and simplicity. One goal of tax reform is to enhance economic efficiency, removing provisions in the code that adversely affect decisionmaking and economic output. Changes in tax policy also have equity implications, with respect to \"fairness\" of the tax code. The current tax code is widely seen as being overly complex. Thus, tax reform provides the opportunity to simplify the U.S. tax system. Balancing these three objectives often involves trade-offs. Balancing the trade-offs in these objectives is one of the challenges policymakers face in implementing tax reform.

In modifying the existing tax system, base-broadening could raise additional tax revenues. The additional revenues could either be used to reduce tax rates or for deficit reduction. Similarly, revenues from a new tax (e.g., a consumption tax) could be used to offset reductions in current taxes, or to reduce the deficit. Much of the recent debate has centered around a revenue-neutral tax reform, with lower rates on individual and corporate income. Either base-broadening or an alternative revenue source could be used to pay for lower rates in a revenue-neutral tax reform. How revenue-neutrality is evaluated might also be an issue to be considered, with some suggesting that dynamic scoring be used to evaluate tax reform proposals. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Income Tax Reform: Base-Broadening4", "paragraphs": ["Some Members of Congress have expressed concern about the large number and high cost of tax expenditures. Examples of tax expenditures include the deduction for mortgage interest on owner-occupied residences and the deduction for property taxes on owner-occupied residences. Many tax expenditures are seen as targets to be reduced or eliminated. In evaluating tax expenditures, one issue Congress may want to consider is whether the benefits of a particular tax expenditure exceed the costs of that tax expenditure. Identifying and quantifying the costs and benefits associated with particular tax expenditure provisions, however, can be challenging.", "The current tax reform debate generally deals with the issue of broadening the individual and corporate income tax bases, often by scaling back or eliminating tax expenditures. The additional revenues could be used to lower marginal tax rates, reduce the deficit, or achieve some combination of these two options. Both the Tax Reform Act of 2014 and the Fiscal Commission's 2010 tax reform proposal pay for reduced tax rates at least in part by repealing or reforming many major tax expenditures. ", "The tax expenditures associated with the individual and the corporate tax differ in their size and value, and thus in their scope for potential revenue generation. The potential revenue gain from individual tax expenditures is large as they currently result in roughly $1 trillion of lost revenue annually. While these large amounts suggest a significant scope for base-broadening, most of these tax expenditures arise from a limited number of provisions, many of which are popular and broadly used, are difficult to eliminate in a technical sense, and/or are considered desirable provisions. In 2012, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) found that a revenue-neutral reform that (1) repealed the AMT; (2) repealed all itemized deductions; (3) taxed capital gains and dividends at ordinary rates; and (4) retained the earned income tax credit (EITC), child tax credit, and tax benefits for retirement savings and healthcare could reduce rates by 4%. Thus, the top individual income tax bracket would be reduced from 39.6% to 38.02%. ", "Corporate tax expenditures are relatively small in value, partially reflecting the smaller corporate tax base. Analysis suggests that eliminating all corporate tax expenditures would allow the statutory corporate tax rate to be reduced from 35% to roughly 28% to 29%. These base-broadening provisions are also concentrated in a few provisions, which may be difficult to change, such as accelerated depreciation. There are, however, some significant potential base-broadening provisions outside of tax expenditures. For example, additional revenues could result from taxing large pass-through entities that currently pay taxes at the individual level as corporations or by restricting interest deductions. Enacting additional base-broadening reforms could be used to reduce the corporate tax rate below what could be achieved through revenue-neutral policy that only eliminated tax expenditures. ", "There has been a particular focus, as well, on the tax treatment of foreign source income of multinationals. Under the current system, U.S.-based companies with foreign-source income may be subject to U.S. taxes on that income. However, deferral allows tax payments to be deferred until the income earned abroad is repatriated (returned) to the United States. Some proposals would eliminate the U.S. taxation of income earned abroad by U.S.-based multinationals, which could, depending on the details of the proposal, narrow the tax base. Another option is to increase the taxation of foreign-source income of U.S.-based multinationals, through limiting deferral, for example. Increasing the amount of foreign-source income subject to tax would broaden the tax base. International issues have also been an impetus for lowering the corporate tax rate.", "As an additional challenge, corporate tax reform, business tax reform, or individual tax reform in isolation would be difficult to achieve, as the corporate and individual tax systems are highly interconnected. Many of the corporate preferences also benefit unincorporated business, or \"pass-throughs.\" For pass-through entities, business income is subject to the individual income tax.", "The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed reducing statutory tax rates in both the individual and corporate income tax systems. Under this proposal, there would have been two individual income tax brackets, set at 10% and 25%, with a 10% surtax for certain higher-income taxpayers, for a top individual rate of 35%. Corporate tax rates would have been reduced to 25%, with this reduction phased in over time. The cost of these rate reductions would have been partially offset through base-broadening, and partially through other revenue-raising policies, so as to be revenue-neutral over the 10-year budget window. Additional details on the Tax Reform Act of 2014 are provided in a section later in the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A New Tax or Revised Tax Base", "paragraphs": ["Alternative revenue options may be sought for a number of reasons. If the revenues generated through base-broadening do not fully finance desired rate reductions, alternative revenue sources may be sought to fill the gap. Revenue from an add-on tax could allow for the retention of more tax expenditures and smaller reductions in other tax expenditures, or larger tax rate reductions. Further, Congress may choose to seek alternative revenue sources to reduce the budget deficit and national debt. An alternative revenue source or tax base (e.g., consumption) might also be supported as an option for potentially improving economic efficiency. ", "There are several options for imposing a broad-based consumption tax. These include a value-added tax (VAT), a retail sales tax, and a flat tax. A value-added tax is a tax on the value that a firm adds to a product at each stage of production. The value the firm adds is the difference between a firm's sales and a firm's purchases of inputs from other firms. The VAT is collected by each firm at every stage of production. A retail sales tax is a consumption tax levied only at a single stage of production, the retail stage. The retailer collects a specific percentage markup in the retail price of a good or service, which is then remitted to the government. Both the VAT and the retail sales tax have the potential of a robust revenue yield.", "Another option for implementing a broad-based consumption tax would be to levy a so-called \"flat tax\" (often referred to as a Hall-Rabushka flat tax after the two economists who popularized this proposal). Flat tax proposals generally have two components: a wage tax and a cash-flow tax on businesses. With this form, a flat tax is essentially a modified VAT, with wages and pensions subtracted from the VAT base and taxed at the individual level. Under a standard VAT, a firm would not subtract its wage and pension contributions when calculating its tax base. Under the flat tax, some wage income may not be included in the tax base because of personal exemptions. ", "Other potentially new revenue sources include environmental taxes or taxes on the financial sector. Environmental taxes have been proposed as an option to simultaneously reduce pollution and raise revenue. The most frequently discussed energy tax is a carbon tax that would be levied on the volume of carbon emitted. Another alternative energy tax option would be higher gasoline taxes. Options for imposing new taxes on the financial sector include a securities transaction tax or taxes on certain types of financial institutions, such as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed an excise tax be imposed on the consolidated assets of SIFIs in excess of $500 billion.

When considering the fairness of the distribution of tax burdens, the concepts of horizontal and vertical equity are often considered. ", "Horizontal equity holds that taxpayers with similar incomes should face similar tax burdens. Tax preferences that allow certain taxpayers to claim deductions, credits, or exemptions to reduce tax burdens often result in situations where taxpayers with similar incomes face different tax burdens. Evaluating horizontal equity involves exploring whether taxpayers in similar circumstances pay approximately the same amount of taxes. For example, will the tax burden on two cohabiting single taxpayers be the same as the burden on a similarly situated married couple?", "Vertical equity examines the distribution of tax burdens across different income groups. Under an ability-to-pay standard, vertical equity would suggest that taxpayers in higher income groups pay more. How much more is a policy question. Should the after-tax distribution of income be the same as the pre-tax distribution (suggesting taxation should be proportional)? Or should taxpayers with a greater ability to pay have a proportionally higher tax burden (suggesting taxation should be progressive)? In looking at the income of taxpayers, is annual or lifetime income the appropriate ability-to-pay metric? There are also questions as to whether tax reform should seek to be \"distributionally neutral,\" keeping the share of the tax burden borne by different income groups roughly the same.", "Evaluating the fairness of tax policy, from an economic perspective, may also involve asking several other questions.

Lower tax rates on a broader tax base tend to promote economic efficiency. If the flat tax (consumption tax) is not applied to capital income or corporate income, the flat tax may contribute to additional capital accumulation and investment. A cash flow tax might also encourage additional investment, as allowing business expensing exempts the normal (or marginal) return on capital from tax. A flat tax (or consumption tax) system, however, is likely to be less progressive than the current tax system, particularly at the top of the income distribution. Thus, efficiency gains achieved by moving to a flat tax (or consumption tax) system would come at the cost of reduced equity, as higher-income groups would tend to see tax burdens decline while lower-income groups would tend to see increased tax burdens.

A cash flow system that eliminates most credits and deductions and provides that most business expenses are expensed rather than depreciated over time, coupled with cash accounting, might also contribute to tax simplicity. However, much of the complexity in the current tax system is related to the definition of income, rather than the income tax rates. If the tax were applied only to wage income, this would create an incentive for non-wage compensation (e.g., benefits), as is the case in the current tax system with the exclusion for employer-provided healthcare. Further, if the flat tax system were to run parallel to the current income tax system, as proposed in H.R. 1040 , the flat tax could create additional complexity for taxpayers trying to decide whether to elect flat tax treatment.

These changes included such things as a 19% minimum tax on foreign earnings; limitations on corporate inversions; interest deductions restrictions; Subpart F reforms; limits on income shifting using intangible property transfers; and restrictions on hybrid arrangements to create stateless income. The Administration estimated the reforms to the U.S. international tax system would generate $238.3 billion between 2016 and 2025.

On February 26, 2014, Chairman Camp released the draft Tax Reform Act of 2014. This proposal would have broadened the tax base and restructured statutory tax rates in both the individual and corporate income tax systems, changed the tax treatment of foreign-source income for U.S. multinational corporations, and made dozens of other changes to the federal tax system (additional details can be found in the shaded text box below). This reform built on earlier discussion drafts that had been released by Chairman Camp. ", "Chairman Camp's first tax reform discussion draft on international tax reform was released during the 112 th Congress. A number of the international tax reform proposals in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 appeared in this earlier discussion draft. Similar to the earlier draft, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 would have allowed a 95% dividends received deduction for foreign business income. As a transition rule, the earlier draft had proposed a 5.25% tax on undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 also proposed taxing accumulated deferred foreign earnings, with a higher rate of 8.75% for cash, with other earnings held abroad taxed at 3.5%. In an effort to prevent tax base erosion, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 would have taxed foreign income generated by U.S. companies through the use of intangibles. ", "Other proposals in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 were similar to proposals contained in Camp's previous discussion drafts. Similar to proposals made in Camp's January 24, 2013, financial products discussion draft, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 would have required that derivatives be marked-to-market at year-end, such that taxpayers would recognize income or losses. With respect to small businesses, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 did not include the broader reform option that had appeared in the March 12, 2013, small business discussion draft. Instead, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed a number of changes to existing pass-through and partnership tax rules. Among the many proposals are provisions that would have taxed carried interest as ordinary income, changed rules related to partnership audits and adjustments, and restricted the use of publicly traded partnerships.", "Former Committee on Finance Chairman Max Baucus also released several discussion drafts related to tax reform. The former chairman released discussion drafts related to international tax reform, tax administration, cost recovery and accounting, and energy tax policy. The discussion drafts were released in addition to a series of tax reform options papers put forward by the committee earlier in 2013.", "Under Senator Baucus's international tax reform proposal, passive and highly mobile forms of foreign-earned income would be taxed at the full U.S. rate, as would income earned from goods ultimately consumed in the United States. Two alternatives were put forth for taxing income earned from products and services sold abroad. \"Option Y\" would subject all foreign-earned income to a minimum tax, which the draft sets at 80% of the U.S. statutory rate. \"Option Z\" would tax 60% of foreign active business income at the U.S. rate. Similar to Chairman Camp's international tax proposals, undistributed foreign earnings would be subject to a one-time tax. The Baucus discussion draft sets this rate at 20%. ", "Reforms to cost recovery and accounting rules have also been put forward by former Chairman Baucus as a discussion draft. Proposed reforms would eliminate the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS), enacting instead a system that uses asset pools and longer lives that more closely approximate economic depreciation. Certain intangibles, including research and experimentation as well as advertising expenditures, would be capitalized and amortized. Last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory accounting rules would be repealed. Small-business expensing allowances would be increased such that more businesses would be allowed to use cash accounting. A number of similar proposals appear in the Tax Reform Act of 2014, discussed above.", "Former Chairman Baucus has also released a discussion draft related to tax administration and energy tax reform. This tax administration draft contained several proposals designed to reduce the tax gap, enacting additional data reporting requirements and anti-fraud provisions. The energy tax reform discussion draft proposes clean energy production and investment tax credits designed to replace existing incentives for renewables and other clean electricity resources (e.g., nuclear, carbon capture, and sequestration). These credits would be available for the long term, but are designed to begin phasing out once the annual average greenhouse gas emissions rate falls below a specified threshold.

The legislation also would have broadened the income tax base, eliminating a number of individual tax expenditures. Further, the legislation would have provided an allowance of $50,000 for single filers ($100,000 for married filing jointly), that would have effectively exempted most taxpayers from the individual income tax.
