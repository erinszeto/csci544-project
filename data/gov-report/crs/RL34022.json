The FY2007 CR funded most Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs at their FY2006 level, but with decreases for some programs, and increases for other programs. The CR provided HUD with over $36.6 billion for FY2007.", "The President's FY2008 budget requested about a billion dollar decrease in funding for HUD. It proposed to provide no new funding for several programs that have been targeted for elimination in recent years, but that Congress has continued to fund (HOPE VI, Rural Housing and Economic Development, Brownfields Redevelopment, and Section 108 Loan Guarantees). The President's FY2008 budget also requested decreased funding for several programs, including housing programs for the elderly and disabled, fair housing and lead paint programs, public housing modernization, and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Each of these programs had been targeted for decreases in past budget requests, but Congress had not approved the requested decreases. The President's budget requested funding increases for several programs, including public housing operating costs and programs for the homeless, persons with AIDS, and first-time homebuyers. The FY2008 funding debate was also shaped by the ongoing decline in receipts from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) available to offset the cost of the budget. For FY2007, it was estimated that FHA would generate a net surplus of over $650 million; for FY2008, that amount was estimated to be about $250 million.", "On July 18, 2007, the House Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2008 HUD funding bill (H.R. 3074). On July 16, 2007, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version (S. 1789). Both bills would have increased funding above the President's request for Section 8 vouchers, HOPE VI, housing programs for the elderly and disabled, and CDBG. On July 24, 2007, the House approved H.R. 3074, and on September 12, 2007, the Senate approved its substitute version. On November 14, 2007, the House approved a conference agreement that would have funded HUD at about $3 billion above the President's request (H.Rept. 110-446). In a Statement of Administration Policy, the President indicated that he would veto the agreement, and the Senate never considered it. Instead, on December 19, 2007, Congress approved the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (attached to H.R. 2764), which funds HUD at a lower level than the House bill, Senate bill, and conference agreement, but at a level about $2 billion above the President's request.

And, each year, the amount of budget authority newly available for the account is equal to the amount of funding provided for use in the current fiscal year, plus the advance appropriation provided in the previous fiscal year. For most years, the advance available from the prior year and the advance that is provided for the subsequent year has been the same: $4.2 billion. As a result, the new budget authority for the tenant-based rental assistance account has equaled the budget authority newly available for the account each fiscal year. For example, as shown in Table 4 , the FY2006 appropriations act authorized $11,374 million in new budget authority for use in FY2006 and $4,200 million in new budget authority for use in FY2007, and $4,200 million provided in FY2005 became newly available in FY2006.", "However, in FY2007, Congress provided only $4,193 million in advance appropriations for use in FY2008, less than the $4.2 billion that became available in FY2007 from the FY2006 appropriation. As a result, in FY2007, the amount of new budget authority authorized in FY2007\u00a0was less than the budget authority newly available for FY2007 by $7 million. As shown\u00a0in the FY2007 column of Table 4 , $15,920 million in new budget authority was authorized by the FY2007 law, while $15,927 million was budget authority newly available to be obligated in FY2007.", "As shown in Table 3 , the FY2007 appropriations act directed HUD how to allocate only $15,920 million of the $15,927 million available for allocation.

As a result, the new budget authority authorized in FY2008 ($16,931 million) is less than the budget authority newly available in FY2008 ($16,426 million). (See the FY2008 column of Table 4 .) Unlike the FY2007 appropriation law, the FY2008 appropriations law allocates the full amount of the budget authority newly available in FY2008 (the amount provided in FY2008 plus the advance from FY2007). However, the FY2008 appropriations act also contains a rescission of $723 million from the advance provided in FY2007 for use in FY2008. (See the FY2008 Adjusted column of Table 4 .)

Congress has authorized the creation of more than 2 million vouchers over the history of the program, and the funding for virtually all of them expires every year. Since FY2004, Congress has made changes each year in the way that HUD distributes voucher renewal funding to PHAs. (For more information, see CRS Report RL33929, Recent Changes to the Section 8 Voucher Renewal Funding Formula , by [author name scrubbed].) Several voucher reform proposals have also been considered that would alter the statutory formula for distributing voucher funds, although none has been enacted. Even if they were enacted, language included in appropriations bills could potentially override statutory formula changes. (For more information, see CRS Report RL34002, Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program: Issues and Reform Proposals , by [author name scrubbed].)", "The FY2007 year-long CR did not adopt the same allocation formula that was in place in FY2006. In FY2006, PHAs were funded on the basis of what they had received in FY2005, with some adjustments (including for inflation and some first-time voucher renewals), and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. For FY2007, Congress directed HUD to fund PHAs on the basis of their actual leasing and costs from the previous 12 months, adjusted for inflation and for the cost of the first-time renewal of tenant-protection vouchers and vouchers set aside for project-based use, and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration agencies were funded on the basis of their MTW agreements, subject to proration. Several other categories of agencies also received a modified funding allocation, including certain Katrina-affected PHAs, PHAs under administrative or judicial receiverships, and PHAs that spent more than their funding allocation. Of the amount provided for renewals, $100 million was set aside to adjust the budgets of agencies that (1) had experienced an increase in voucher costs due to unforeseen circumstances or portability and (2) were adversely affected by the formula change and risked losing vouchers. The formula contained in the year-long CR was similar to the one in place in FY2004.", "In his FY2008 budget, the President requested that PHAs receive renewal funding using a formula similar to the one in place in FY2006. Specifically, the President requested that PHAs be\u00a0funded on the basis of what they received in FY2007; adjusted for inflation, the costs of deposits to escrow accounts, and the first time renewal of tenant protection vouchers; and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. MTW agencies would be funded pursuant to their agreements, subject to proration. The President's budget also requested that $100 million be set aside for additional rental subsidy needs resulting from unforeseen circumstances, and to make portability adjustments.", "The House-passed version of H.R. 3074 would have provided $14.7 billion for voucher renewals in FY2008. Similar to the President's requested formula, the House bill would have allocated renewal funds on the basis of what PHAs received in FY2007, plus inflation. The bill would have further adjusted PHAs' allocations to account for costs related to Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) escrow accounts, the first time renewal of HOPE VI vouchers, and vouchers set aside for project-based contracts, and would have prorated the allocations to fit within the amount appropriated. MTW agencies were to be funded on the basis of their MTW agreements. The bill would have required the Secretary to notify agencies of their budgets within 45 days of enactment. The Secretary would have been permitted to set aside up to $75 million to provide agencies with additional rental subsidy funding in response to unforeseen exigencies (as determined by the Secretary) or the cost of portability. The bill would have continued to prohibit PHAs from using more than their authorized number of vouchers, a practice called overleasing.", "The House committee report ( H.Rept. 110-238 ) noted that the committee chose not to use updated data for allocating FY2008 renewal funding because HUD delayed allocating FY2007 funding under the new formula, and therefore the committee wanted to give PHAs additional time to adjust to their FY2007 allocations before changing the formula again.", "The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3074 would have provided $14.9 billion for voucher renewals in FY2008. Similar to the FY2007 year-long CR, the funding would have been allocated on the basis of PHAs' most recent 12 months of leasing and cost data, adjusted for inflation and the first time renewal of tenant protection or HOPE VI vouchers or vouchers set aside for a project-based commitment. Under the Senate bill, MTW agencies would have been funded subject to their agreements, and, as under the year-long CR, the same three categories of agencies would have been funded using a different allocation formula. First, certain Katrina-affected agencies would have been funded on the basis of the higher of what they would have received under the FY2008 formula or what they received in FY2007, although PHAs would have been required to submit plans detailing how they could effectively use any additional funds within 12 months. Second, agencies that would have lost funding under the FY2008 formula and had been put in receivership within the prior 24 months would have been funded on the basis of the higher amount they received in FY2007, as long as they submitted a spending plan. Third, agencies that spent more in FY2007 than their FY2007 allocation plus their unspent voucher and administrative fee balances from FY2006 would have been funded on the basis of what they received in FY2007. All allocations were to be prorated to fit within the amount appropriated, and the Secretary would have been required to notify PHAs of their budgets within 90 days of enactment.", "The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3074 would also have permitted the Secretary to set aside up to $100 million to adjust the allocations of PHAs with significant increases in renewal costs due to unforeseen circumstances or increased portability costs, or to adjust the allocations for PHAs that could face a loss of voucher units due to the use of updated leasing and cost data. Like the House bill, the Senate bill would have continued the prohibition on overleasing. The committee report ( S.Rept. 110-131 ) noted that the committee continued the FY2007 formula because the committee believed that it would provide an efficient method to capture actual costs incurred by PHAs administering the voucher program, including variations in rental markets.", "The conference agreement ( H.Rept. 110-446 ) would have provided a funding level for voucher renewals lower than either the House or Senate bill. Similar to the Senate bill, it would have distributed funds on the basis of leasing and cost data, but rather than using the most recent data, the bill would have directed the Secretary to use data from the most recent federal fiscal year. The formula would have made adjustments for FSS costs, renewal of tenant protection or HOPE VI vouchers, and vouchers set-aside for project-based commitments. PHA budgets would then have been adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. The conference agreement included the same adjustments for Katrina-affected agencies, agencies in receivership, and agencies that spent beyond their allocation that were included in the FY2007 year-long CR and the Senate bill. It would have funded MTW agencies on the basis of their agreements and would have continued the prohibition on overleasing. The conference agreement would also have permitted the Secretary to set aside up to $50 million to adjust agency allocations for significant increases in costs due to portability, or for agencies who had increased their voucher use (indicated by leasing rates at the end of the calendar year that exceeded the 12-month average used in the formula).", "Under P.L. 110-161 , PHA's initial allocations will be determined using the same formula as in the conference agreement (prior to proration). However, each agency's allocation will then be reduced by the amount by which their unusable, restricted reserve accounts exceed 7% of the total they received in FY2007. Once those reduced allocations are made, HUD is to prorate the amount provided to each PHA to fit within the amount provided for renewals ($14,695 million), reduced by $723 million, the amount that the law rescinds from the advance appropriation provided in FY2007 for use in FY2008. Given the reduction in the advance appropriation, the total amount of new budget authority available for tenant-based renewals in FY2008 is $13, 971 million.

For the sixth year in a row, the Administration's budget also proposed to consolidate the three competitive Homeless Assistance Grants\u2014SHP, S+C, and SRO\u2014into one competitive grant. The proposed consolidated grant would have included up to $50 million for a Samaritan Housing Initiative, which would provide permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals. This proposal is similar to an incentive currently provided in the Homeless Assistance Grants application process. The House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 3074 , the conference agreement ( H.Rept. 110-446 ), and the Consolidated Appropriations Act all failed to include the set-aside proposed by the President, nor did they propose to consolidate the competitive grants.

The House bill recommended $10 million less than the amount requested by the Administration and recommended by the Senate for the entire Self Help and Assisted Homeownership account, but $10 million more than the amount appropriated for FY2007. Within the account, both the House and Senate bills recommended approximately $12 million and $13 million less than requested by the Administration for SHOP. Although both bills recommended a slight increase in funding for capacity building activities, the Senate bill specified funding for several programs and entities not funded during FY2007. The entities that would have received no funding under the President's budget include the Housing Assistance Council, Housing Partnership Network, National Council of La Raza, and the National American Indian Housing Council.
