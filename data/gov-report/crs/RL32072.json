According to David P. Fidler, Professor of Law at Indiana School of Law inBloomington, the legal implications affect three main areas -- International Health Regulations(IHR); public health measures and civil and political rights; and principles of state responsibility inresponding to SARS. (17) This section will focuson the IHR because of its relevance to WHO.", "Overview of the International Health Regulations. In 1951, under Article 21 of the WHO constitution, member states adopted the International SanitaryRegulations, which in 1969 became known as the International Health Regulations (IHR). Amendments were made in 1973 and 1981. The main purpose was to control the spread of diseaseswith minimum impact on world traffic through the development of a global surveillance system, theuse of procedures at ports and airports, and the creation of disease-specific provisions. Some arguethat the regulations have not been effective in ensuring protection against diseases in a world ofincreasing trade and travel. Experts maintain that a key reason for ineffectiveness lies in the limitednumber of diseases to which the IHR applies. Originally, the regulation covered six diseases --smallpox, relapsing fever, typhus, cholera, plague, and yellow fever. (18) Today the IHR applies onlyto the last three diseases. Smallpox is considered to have been eradicated some years ago. Relapsingfever and typhus had been so successfully controlled that they were no longer considered a publichealth threat. The IHR do not apply to more recent infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS andSARS. Member states were therefore under no obligation to report the outbreak of a new infectiousdisease nor were they required to restrict trade or travel even if it would benefit containment. (19)", "In the 1990s, the WHO initiated a revision of the IHR to address the limited scope of the diseases covered, increase its relevance to the kinds of infectious disease threats most prevalent orlikely today, and to manage the return of old diseases. These revisions are scheduled to be finalizedin 2005. (20)", "In 2001, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution concerning member response to international public health emergencies and global health security with reference to epidemics. In2002, another resolution made the response more specific, and included health risks related not onlyto natural occurrence, but to accidental or deliberate use of biological and chemical agents. (21)", "The SARS outbreak added momentum to discussions about revising the IHL that were already well under way. As recently as January 2003, the 192 member states had been discussing the detailsof the new framework, with a resolution for completing the revised regulations. Although the IHRwere recognized as being outdated, the case of SARS highlighted the problems of transparency --China denied the problem existed for months, and the information provided from Toronto wascriticized by some as incomplete and not timely enough. ", "The Fifty-Sixth World Health Assembly. Fidler argues that \"the SARS epidemic may encourage WHO member states to accept a more robustinternational legal framework for global infectious disease control than has existed historically.\" (22) At the Fifty-Sixth World Health Assembly in May 2003, the member states adopted two resolutionsrelevant to the SARS outbreak, one specifically on SARS, the other on the revision of IHL. (23) TheSARS resolution focuses on eleven recommendations to WHO member states in addressing theSARS outbreak; it also requests the WHO Director General to take specific actions. None of theseare new obligations or binding on member states as earlier press reports might have suggested. Rather, they build on the role of the WHO and highlight the need for information sharing andinternational cooperation in combating an outbreak such as SARS. (24)", "The IHL Resolution takes an important political step in emphasizing the need for member states to cooperate with other states and the WHO in monitoring and responding to infectious diseases. Although the SARS outbreak highlighted the strong need for revision of the IHL, then WHODirector General Gro Harlem Brundtland also pointed out the difficult balance to be struck inrevising the regulations, such as state obligations to report sensitive health information, protectionof human rights and civil liberties in light of an international health threat, and the impact onimmigration policies and decisions. (25) The IHLResolution does not give WHO a significant increasein authority in terms of intervention during a potential public health threat, nor does it give WHOthe power to reprimand a state that does not comply. (26) However, the IHL Resolution lays thepolitical groundwork for states to respond appropriately, much of the encouragement to comply willlikely come from international pressure as the SARS case demonstrated. (27)", "The IHL resolution was adopted as an interim measure until the IHL revisions are finalized in 2005. The WHO opted for this two-step process rather than insisting that members immediatelyapprove the incorporation of the resolution into the IHL. (28) Some experts suggest that this resolutionwill encourage WHO collaboration within countries and also provide momentum for implementationof the measures outlined in the resolution. (29) TheU.S. delegation initially asked for a postponementof action on the proposed resolution, hoping to include it in a broader discussion, but later concededwhen it did not enlist member support.

They proposed steps for examining and detecting cases, defining proceduresfor contact tracing, and responding to local transmissions. WHO was particularly concerned aboutthe capacity of the Chinese rural health systems to deal with emerging infectious diseases, fromeffective monitoring and reporting to adequate hospital care. (49) However, it found that surveillancesystems in two key rural provinces were effective. (50) China has also surprised many with the speedwith which it brought its outbreak under control. Some studies suggest that the mortality rate mayhave been lower, and the cure rate higher, than in other parts of the world. Differences in incubationperiod and groups at highest risk may provide clues for fighting the disease. According to Dr.Heymann, \"Long-term containment depends on finding answers to a long list of scientific questions. China has much to offer the rest of the world.\" (51)", "On June 24, 2003, WHO removed its recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Beijing, China.

All tourist facilitiesin Toronto were also exempt from retail tax from May 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003, under theact.

Eligible full-time and part-time health care workers affected by SARS can receive$400 per week and $200 per week, respectively. This initiative complements adjustments made tothe Employment Insurance (EI) Act, which allows up to 15 weeks of special benefits when aneligible claimant is unable to work because of illness, injury or quarantine. The Government ofCanada has adjusted the EI program so that those who become ill due to SARS are not immediatelyrequired to provide a medical certificate, and no longer have to wait two weeks to receive benefits.

(86)", "In June 2003, health workers concerned about their safety, including hundreds of nurses, demonstrated in Canada to demand danger pay, protective suits, and a public investigation into thecause of the SARS resurgence. Some nurses claimed that hospital officials were slow to respondto their warnings that patients in other wards showed SARS-like symptoms. Still, some familypractitioners expressed concern that health officials failed to notify them when the virus firstresurfaced. As a result, some family practitioners fell ill with the virus.
