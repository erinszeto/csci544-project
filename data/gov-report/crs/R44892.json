In addition, Sinclair owns four radio stations, two broadcast networks (TBD and Comet), and the Tennis Channel cable network. Sinclair is also the largest producer of local news in the country. For example, Sinclair's Connect to Congress initiative provides Sinclair's local television news anchors the ability to interview Members of Congress remotely via Sinclair's news bureau in Washington, DC.", "On June 30, 2017, the FCC's Media Bureau, acting under delegated authority from Chairman Ajit Pai, approved Sinclair's acquisition of 14 stations in eight television markets from Bonten Media Group. As part of the transaction, Sinclair agreed to take over five agreements under which Bonten shares services with four stations it does not own. As of the publication date of this report, the Bonten transaction was awaiting approval of federal antitrust authorities. If it is completed without divestitures, Sinclair would own 187 television broadcast stations in 89 local markets, and would be a party to 60 shared services agreements with stations it does not own.", "Tribune Media owns or operates 42 broadcast television stations, the cable network WGN America, the radio station WGN (AM) in Chicago, and Los Angeles-based Tribune Studios, which produces original programming for Tribune's stations and cable network. In August 2014, Tribune Media spun off its publishing business, including several daily newspapers, into a separate company.", "Broadcast television stations such as those owned by Sinclair and Tribune have two primary sources of revenue. They sell advertising, charging rates based on the number and type of viewers who watch their programs. They also may charge cable and satellite operators\u2014together referred to in statute as multichannel video program distributors (MVPDs)\u2014for the right to retransmit the stations' signals to the operators' subscribers. The research firm Kagan estimates that in 2016, U.S. broadcast stations collectively earned about $30.6 billion in revenues, with 67% coming from advertising and 26% from retransmission consent. ", "Television broadcasters are part of a complex television industry ecosystem (see Figure 1 ) in which the various participants may simultaneously be competitors, suppliers, customers, and business partners. Many television broadcasters have sought greater scale through mergers, acquisitions, and joint agreements, as greater scale may provide leverage in dealing with other industry participants. For example", "Stations sell air time to both local and national advertisers. In the local market, control of multiple stations may enable a broadcaster to command higher advertising rates than competitors. In the national market, a firm owning stations in many local markets may be better positioned to bargain with large advertisers such as automobile manufacturers and retail chains. Stations may purchase rights to programming from television and movie studios and sports leagues. A firm owning many stations may have greater bargaining power with respect to program owners than a firm with few stations. Consolidation among MVPDs has left a relatively small number of cable and satellite operators serving customers nationwide. This has encouraged consolidation among broadcasters, who fear that the MVPDs' greater size will allow them to bargain for lower retransmission consent fees. For example, during retransmission consent negotiations with DISH, a satellite operator, in August 2015 Sinclair briefly withheld permission for DISH to retransmit its broadcast signals in 79 different markets in 36 states and Washington, DC. For DISH, losing access to Sinclair's stations risked putting it at a disadvantage against competing cable and satellite operators that were able to retransmit Sinclair's programming during the blackout. ", "At the same time, television broadcasters are facing an erosion of their markets as increasing numbers of viewers watch video programming through online video subscription services such as Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime, rather than subscribing to MVPDs or receiving stations' broadcasts over the air. This potential loss of viewership affects broadcast television stations' advertising revenue, which is based on the number of and demographics of people viewing the stations' programming, and retransmission consent revenue, which is partly based on the number of each MVPD's subscribers.

", "At the time Congress enacted this law, an FCC rule, originally adopted in 1985, discounted the number of television households reached by stations operating in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band by half in measuring a station owner's reach. This adjustment reflected the physical limitations of UHF signals at the time the rule was adopted. However, on June 12, 2009, broadcast television stations completed a transition from analog to digital service pursuant to a statutory mandate. As a result of this switch, UHF stations had a technological advantage relative to VHF stations, and more broadcast television licenses began to operate on these frequencies. By December 2009, 73% of the 1,392 commercial stations operated in the UHF band.", "In September 2013, under then-Acting FCC Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn, the FCC proposed eliminating the UHF discount, citing the completed transition to digital broadcasting.

Benefits must be merger-specific and verifiable. In addition, the benefits must flow to consumers.", "The FCC's review differs from that of DOJ in several respects. In contrast to DOJ, the FCC is to consider whether a transaction will enhance, rather than merely preserve, existing competition, and often takes a more expansive view of potential and future competition in analyzing that issue.

In addition, among the FCC's general policy goals is the promotion of localism\u2014that is, the responsiveness of broadcast stations to the needs and interests of their communities.", "Among the merger-specific benefits Sinclair presents to the FCC in its application, Sinclair states that the transaction would enable it to invest in and increase the amount of local news programming aired on the stations it would acquire. In reviewing the merger, the FCC might consider whether the number of stations Sinclair would own and/or operate both within local markets and nationwide would promote the FCC's goals of localism and diversity.", "Critics of broadcast licensees that own and/or operate multiple broadcast television stations within a market state that the newscasts on these stations are composed of the same news stories airing on different stations. Therefore, they maintain, such arrangements do not promote the FCC's public policy goals of promoting diverse sources of news information. Broadcasters, however, claim that such arrangements enable stations to air news programming that they could not afford to produce on their own, thereby increasing the total amount of local news available in communities.", "Reports indicate that Sinclair has an internal corporate policy of requiring its stations throughout the country to air centrally produced video segments known as \"must runs.\" Critics claim that this practice inhibits stations' ability to air news programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of their local communities. Others counter that Sinclair's practice is routine, and that its national presence offers a countervailing point of view to other national media outlets.", "The ability of broadcast television stations to produce and distribute local news sets them apart from other electronic media, such as online video distributors, national television networks, and MVPDs. Thus, in addition to the traditional competition analysis that both the DOJ and FCC are to undertake when reviewing the Sinclair-Tribune merger, the potential scale and scope of Sinclair's news operations post-merger will require a public interest review by the FCC. Moreover, the timing of the FCC's review of its media ownership and attribution rules will have a large impact on what conditions, if any, the agency might impose on Sinclair in order to complete the transaction.
