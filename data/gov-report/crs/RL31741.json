Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate thisthreat. Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR)countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures;improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts. Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operatingin areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement. However,this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the timeneeded for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat.Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures tominimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly thancountermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks. However, thesetechniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would notprotect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports.", "Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress called for the installation of missile defensesystems in all turbojet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service.

These missiles, affordable and widely available through a varietyof sources, have been used successfully over the past three decades both in military conflicts (1) as well as by terroristorganizations. The missiles are about 5 to 6 feet in length, weigh about 35 to 40 pounds, and,depending on the model, can be purchased on the black market anywhere from a few hundred dollarsfor older models to upwards of almost a quarter million dollars for newer, more capable models.Seventeen countries, including the United States, produce man-portable air defense systems.

There are a number of different types of shoulder-fired SAMs, primarily classified by theirseekers.

These missiles use passive guidance, meaning that they do not emit signals to detect a heatsource, which makes them difficult to detect by targeted aircraft employing countermeasure systems. The first missiles deployed in the 1960s were IR missiles. First generation shoulder-fired SAMs suchas the U.S. Redeye, early versions of the Soviet SA-7, and the Chinese HN-5 are considered \"tailchase weapons\" as their seekers can only acquire and engage a high performance aircraft after it haspassed the missile's firing position. In this flight profile, the aircraft's engines are fully exposed tothe missile's seeker and provide a sufficient thermal signature for engagement. First generation IRmissiles are also highly susceptible to interfering thermal signatures from background sources,including the sun, which many experts feel makes them somewhat unreliable. ", "Second generation IR missiles such as early versions of the U.S. Stinger, the Soviet SA-14,and the Chinese FN-6 use improved coolants to cool the seeker head which enables the seeker tofilter out most interfering background IR sources as well as permitting head-on and side engagementprofiles. These missiles also employ technologies to counter decoy flares that might be deployedby targeted aircraft and also have backup target detection modes such as the ultra violet (UV) modefound on the Stinger missile. (5) ", "Third generation IR shoulder-fired SAMs such as the French Mistral, the Russian SA-18, and the U.S. Stinger B use single or multiple detectors to produce a quasi-image of the target andalso have the ability to recognize and reject flares dispensed from aircraft - a commoncountermeasure used to decoy IR missiles.

Instead, the missile operator or gunnervisually acquires the target using a magnified optical sight and then uses radio controls to \"fly\" themissile into the aircraft. One of the benefits of such a missile is that it is not as susceptible tostandard aircraft mounted countermeasure systems which are designed primarily to defeat IRmissiles. The major drawback of CLOS missiles is that they require highly trained and skilledoperators. Numerous reports from the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s cite Afghan mujahedin asbeing disappointed with the British-supplied Blowpipe CLOS missile because it was too difficultto learn to use and highly inaccurate, particularly when employed against fast moving jetaircraft. (8) Given theseconsiderations, many experts believe that CLOS missiles are not as ideally suited for terrorist useas are IR missiles, which sometimes are referred to as \"fire and forget\" missiles. ", "Later versions of CLOS missiles, such as the British Javelin, use a solid state televisioncamera in lieu of the optical tracker to make the gunner's task easier. The Javelin's manufacturer,Thales Air Defence Ltd., claims that their missile is virtually impervious to countermeasures.

Missiles such as Sweden's RBS-70 and Britain's Starstreak, canengage aircraft from all angles and only require the operator to continuously track the target usinga joystick to keep the laser aim point on the target. Because there are no data links from the groundto the missile, the missile can not be effectively jammed after it is launched. Future beam ridingSAMs may require the operator to designate the target only once and not manually keep a continuouslaser aimpoint on the aircraft. Even though beam riders require relatively extensive training and skillto operate, many experts consider these missiles particularly menacing in the hands of terrorists dueto the missiles' resistance to most conventional countermeasures in use today.

Tracking proliferation to non-state actors is considered even more difficult by manyanalysts. There are a variety of means that terrorist organizations use to obtain missiles, includingtheft, black market, international organized crime, arms dealers, and transfers from states willing tosupply missiles to terrorists. Often times, the only verification that a non-state actor has ashoulder-fired SAM is when a launcher or fragments from an expended missile are recovered afteran attack.

For example, in some instances of aircraft shootings thereare discrepancies among accounts of the event, with some reporting that the aircraft was broughtdown by a shoulder-fired missile while others claim that anti-aircraft artillery was used. Also, inmany instances there are questions as to whether the flight operation was strictly for a civilian useor may have been for military or dual use (civilian/military) purposes.

(35) While most of these historical examples do not provide any particular insight into the politicalmotivation behind shootings of civilian aircraft in the current context of the global war on terrorism,they do provide some indication of the possible outcomes of such an attack. Based on the commonlycited statistic of 24 aircraft destroyed out of 36 attacks over the past 26 years, the odds of survivingan attack are not particularly encouraging. Using these numbers, the odds of surviving an attack maybe estimated to be only about 33%.

(45) Historical arguments against fielding countermeasures on airliners include their acquisitioncost, cost and difficulty of integrating them into the aircraft, life cycle costs, environmentalconstraints on their use, and the fear that they may promote perceptions that flying is not safe.Estimates of the cost of acquiring and installing IR countermeasures on commercial aircraftrange between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft. (46) According to FAAforecasts, there will be about 6,839 passenger jet aircraft in service in 2006, including 3,692large narrow body airplanes, 599 large wide bodies, and 2,098 regional jets. Additionally,there are expected to be 1,011 all-cargo jets deployed in air carrier operations in 2006. (47) Estimates onequipping the air carrier jet fleet with IR countermeasures vary because of assumptionsregarding the type of system, whether they would be installed directly into the aircraft orattached via a pod, and the overall number to be procured. Some IR countermeasures couldincrease the airline's operating costs by increasing the aircraft's weight and drag and thus theamount of fuel consumed. Another issue for installing IR countermeasures on passenger jetsis the logistics of equipping the fleet and the potential indirect costs associated with takingairplanes out of service to accomplish these installations. An analysis by the RANDCorporation found that, in addition to an initial purchase and installation cost of about $11billion, it would cost about $2.1 billion annually in terms of both direct and indirect orincidental costs to maintain and sustain aircraft-based IR countermeasures on a fleet of 6,800passenger jets. (48) ", "For decades, military aircraft have ejected inexpensive flares to foil IR-guided SAMs.When a white-hot flare passes through an IR-guided SAM's field of view, its intense IRenergy can confuse the missile and cause it to lose its lock on the targeted aircraft. Althougheffective against older shoulder-fired SAMs, flares often cannot fool newer models, whichuse more sophisticated sensors. Also, most flares pose a fire hazard to combustibles on theground, and may be too risky for urban areas. DOD has recently developed new flares andsimilar decoys that may be more effective against modern IR-guided missiles, and pose lessof a fire hazard.", "Military aircraft also use a variety of transmitters known as IR countermeasures orIRCMs to create fields of IR energy designed to confuse shoulder-fired SAMs. Unlike flares,IRCMs do not pose a fire hazard to combustibles on the ground. Like flares, however, theyare only effective against older IR-guided missiles. Recent advances in lasers have led to thedevelopment and employment of directed IRCMs (DIRCMs), that focus their IR energydirectly on the incoming SAM. DIRCMs are able to generate more jamming power thanIRCMs, and may offer the most effective defense against modern shoulder-fired SAMs.DIRCM weight, size, cost, and reliability, however, may not yet make them attractive forcommercial airlines.", "Military aircraft use flares and IRCMs preemptively: in anticipation of a SAM launch,a pilot can eject numerous flares, or turn on the IRCM to foil a potential threat. However,environmental considerations may make the use of flares difficult for commercial airlines. DIRCM's can't be used preemptively. They must be aware that a missile has been launched,and use missile approach and warning systems (MAWS) for that function. (49) Because IR-guidedSAMs are difficult to detect, MAWS performance is a key factor in the overall effectivenessof the aircraft's protection system. DIRCM reliability and maintainability has also frequentlybeen cited as a key factor that will determine the cost effectiveness of these systems forcommercial use. Some estimate that current DIRCM system reliability will have to improveby a factor of 10 before they will be cost effective in a commercial setting. (50) ", "\"Camouflaging\" commercial aircraft, (i.e. reducing their optical and IR reflectivityand emissivity) would make it more difficult for terrorists to employ most shoulder-firedmissiles. Suppressing or otherwise mitigating the engine's hot exhaust may be the mosteffective way to \"camouflage\" commercial aircraft. DOD and industry studies indicate thatthe IR signature of large aircraft engines can be reduced by as much as 80% by shielding orducting the engine exhaust, or mixing ambient air with hot jet exhaust. (51) These measuresmay adversely affect engine performance or aerodynamic drag. Also, integrating thesemeasures into existing aircraft may cause problems with aircraft weight and balance.Regardless, DOD has conducted numerous studies on IR-signature reduction, and theexploration of this body of work may merit investigation for commercial applications. (52) ", "DOD is also developing paint that is designed to reduce an aircraft's IR reflectivityand visual profile. IR camouflage paint would not reduce an engine's heat signature, but itmight make it more difficult for terrorists to visually see the aircraft, and thus could avert aSAM launch. The Navy is studying IR camouflage paint on the V-22 Osprey . (53) The cost andmaintainability of this paint is still being studied, but the paint might actually be lighter thanconventional aircraft paint. Today, IR paint appears to offer few complications for airlineapplication compared to other potential countermeasures. ", "Infrared signature reduction techniques appear worth examining. However, it shouldbe recognized that these measures cannot make aircraft completely invisible in the IRspectrum. An airplane's IR signature will always be much stronger than that of thesurrounding sky. Thus, like many other options discussed in this report, IR signaturereduction techniques may be able to reduce an aircraft's vulnerability to IR-guided weaponsand mitigate the IR missile threat to some degree, but they cannot completely eliminate thethreat. Regardless, some in Congress recognize that IR-signature reduction may be one toolto help mitigate IR-guided missiles. In their FY2006 report ( H.Rept. 109-359 ) appropriationsconferees added $1.3 million to the Navy's $42.6 million request for electronic warfaredevelopment. The purpose of this added funding was to pursue \"infrared signature reductionto mitigate terrorist missile threats.\"(p.393).", "In addition to equipping airliners with missile countermeasures, strengthening theairframe to better withstand missile strikes has been suggested. To date, the FAA'sCommercial Aircraft Hardening Program has primarily focused on studying how hardenedaircraft can better withstand internal bomb blasts. (54) The survivability of passenger jets following missilestrikes is largely unknown, although DOD's Joint Live Fire program and the Air Force haveinitiated a multi-year effort to test the vulnerability of large turbofan engines, such as thosethat power commercial aircraft, to shoulder-fired missiles. (55) It is expected thatdeveloping hardened aircraft structures will be a challenging problem given that IR guidancesystems seek hot engine exhaust and will likely detonate at or near an aircraft engine. ", "Since most jet airliners have wing-mounted engines, hardening of surrounding aircraftstructure will likely be infeasible, particularly with regard to modifying existing aircraft. However, some aircraft survivability experts believe that isolating critical systems, likeredundant hydraulic lines and flight control linkages, and improving fire suppression andcontainment capabilities could prevent catastrophic failures cascading from the initial missilestrike. (56) Whilesuch options can be integrated into new aircraft type designs, they are unlikely to have anynear term impact on reducing the threat since retrofitting existing air carrier jets with damagetolerant structures and systems is likely to either be technically infeasible or not economicallypractical. Moreover, aircraft hardening options will likely require extensive research andtesting before their feasibility and effectiveness can be adequately assessed. Initialindications suggest that aircraft hardening and structural redesign, if feasible, will likely bevery costly and could take many years to implement.

This trainingshould already prepare flight crews to handle a loss of engine power resulting from a missilestrike. Therefore, additional training for handling missile attacks may be of limited benefit. On the other hand, specific simulator exercises using missile attack scenarios may bebeneficial by preparing pilots to fly and land a damaged aircraft. Modern airliners are builtwith redundancy in avionics and flight control systems, and consequently, a missile strikethat does not cause a catastrophic structural failure would likely be survivable if the flightcrew is properly trained to handle such a scenario.", "Another potential mitigation technique is training flight crews in evasive maneuversif fired upon by a shoulder-fired SAM. However, this approach would not likely be effectiveand presents significant risks. Without a missile detection and warning system, it is unlikelythat a flight crew would have any indication of a missile launch. Also, large transportcategory airplanes are generally not maneuverable enough to evade a shoulder-fired SAM. There is also concern that defensive maneuvering of large transport category airplanes couldresult in a loss of control or structural failure. (57) Consequently, most observers concur that evasivemaneuvering is not a viable option for mitigating the risk of missile attacks. However,properly trained crews may be able to use other special procedures to evade missile attacks. Examples of procedures that may be considered to reduce the airplane's heat signature andvulnerability to missile strikes include minimizing the use of auxiliary power units and otherheat sources when operationally feasible; minimizing engine power settings; and, if a missilelaunch is detected, reducing engine power settings to minimum levels required to sustainflight at a safe altitude. The effectiveness and safety risks associated with techniques suchas these will need to be carefully assessed before procedural measures are implemented.", "Another mitigation technique may be to alter air traffic procedures to minimize theamount of time airliners are vulnerable to missile launches and make flight patterns lesspredictable. Current arrival procedures rely on gradual descents along well defined andpublicly known approach courses that place airplanes within range of shoulder-fired SAMsas far away as 50 miles from the airport. (58) Similarly, departing aircraft with heavy fuel loadsoperating at high engine power, often along predefined departure routes, may be particularlyvulnerable and can be targeted up to 30 miles away from the airport before they climb abovethe effective range of shoulder-fired SAMs. (59) ", "Military aircraft often use spiral descents from altitude above the airfield whenoperating in hostile areas. Using spiral descents may be an option for mitigating the threatof terrorist SAM attacks to airliners approaching domestic airports. Doing so can limitapproach and descent patterns to a smaller perimeter around the airfield where securitypatrols can more effectively deter terrorist attacks. While spiral approaches may beimplemented on a limited basis, wide scale use of spiral patterns would likely requireextensive restructuring of airspace and air traffic procedures. This technique may presentsafety concerns by greatly increasing air traffic controller workload and requiring pilots tomake potentially difficult turning maneuvers at low altitude. The use of spiral patterns couldalso reduce passenger comfort and confidence in flight safety. Also, this technique wouldnot mitigate the risk to departing aircraft, which are generally considered to be the mostvulnerable to missile attacks.", "Another technique used by military aircraft, particularly fighter jets, to reducevulnerability on departure is to make steep, rapid climb outs above the effective range ofsurface to air missiles over a short distance. Like spiral descents, such a technique haslimited application for civilian jet airliners. A typical climb gradient for these aircraft isbetween 400 and 500 feet per mile, which means that they remain in range of shoulder-firedmissiles for about 40 to 50 miles after departure. Even if the airplane were to double itsclimb rate, which would probably be close to the maximum practically achievable climb ratefor most jet airliners, the distance traveled before safely climbing above the range ofshoulder-fired missiles would still be 20 miles or more. Climbing out at such a steep ratewould also pose a risk to the aircraft since it may not provide an adequate margin of safetyif an engine were to fail during climb out. Also, steep climb angles are likely to be perceivedas objectionable by passengers.", "Another option that may be considered is to vary approach and departure patterns. Regularly varying approach and departure patterns, in non-predicable ways, may make itmore difficult for terrorists to set up a shoulder-fired SAM under a known flight corridor;and, may increase the probability that they will be detected, while trying to locate a usablelaunch site, by ground surveillance, local law enforcement, or civilians reporting suspiciousactivities. One challenge to implementing this technique is that aviation radio frequenciesare not protected, and terrorists might gather intelligence regarding changing flight patterns. Also, flight tracking data are available in near real time from Internet sources and may beexploited by terrorists to gain information about aircraft position. Nonetheless, this approachcould be a deterrent by making overflights of particular locations less predictable. Limitations to this approach include disruption of normal air traffic flow which may resultin delays, increased air traffic controller workload, and possible interference with noisemitigation procedures. Varying air traffic patterns may be a viable mitigation technique,particularly at airports with low to moderate traffic and for approach and departure patternsthat overfly sparsely populated areas. Also, maximizing the use of over water approach anddeparture procedures, when available, coupled with measures to limit or restrict access to andincrease patrols of waters under these flight paths has also been suggested as a mitigationalternative. (60) ", "Other suggested changes to air traffic procedures include the increased use ofnighttime flights and minimal use of aircraft lighting. However, this approach is likely to beopposed by the airlines and passengers since there is little demand for night flights in manydomestic markets. Furthermore, minimizing the use of aircraft lighting raises safety concernsfor aircraft collision avoidance. While the airspace system includes good radar coverage inthe vicinity of airports and airliners are required to have collision avoidance systems, the lastline of protection against midair collisions is the flight crew's ability to see and avoid otheraircraft. Therefore, increased use of night flights and minimizing aircraft lighting is notthought to be a particularly viable mitigation option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements to Airport and Local Security", "paragraphs": ["One of the most expedient measures that can be taken to mitigate the risk fromshoulder-fired SAMs to airliners is to heighten security, surveillance, and patrols in thevicinity of airports served by air carriers. The difficulty with implementing these securitymeasures is that the approach and departure corridors where aircraft operate within range ofshoulder-fired SAMS extend for several miles beyond airport perimeters. Therefore, whileheightening security in the immediate vicinity of an airport may reduce the threat fromshoulder-fired SAMs, these measures cannot effectively mitigate the threat during the entireportion of flight while airliners are vulnerable to attack. Nonetheless, using threat andvulnerability assessments, airport and airspace managers can work with security forces todetermine those locations beyond the airport perimeter that have high threat potential andwhere aircraft are most vulnerable to attack. Using this information, security can concentratepatrols and surveillance in these high risk areas. Airport security managers will likely needto work closely with local law enforcement to coordinate efforts for patrolling these high riskareas. ", "Terrorist acts are preceded by planning activities, much of which is observable.Because law enforcement officers can't be everywhere, public education and neighborhoodwatch programs in high risk areas may also be effective means to mitigate the threat. The AirForce has instituted a \"neighborhood watch\"-type program that might serve a model forbroader application. Civilians and servicemembers are trained in the \"Eagle Eye Program\"to recognize elements of potential terrorist activity, and how to most effectively report theirobservations.

However, use of aerial patrols may significantly impact normal flight schedules andoperations, particularly at the nation's larger airports.", "Detecting and eliminating a terrorist threat before an attack is initiated is the optimalsolution. If terrorists are not detected prior to launch, rapid detection and accurateidentification of a missile attack would be a critical step in an effective defense. In 2004DOD evaluated ground-based warning systems composed of networked arrays of differentkinds of sensors (e.g., electro-optical, radar). Such ground-based sensor grids couldpotentially warn and cue aircraft-based, or ground-based missile countermeasures. ", "Ground-based missile countermeasures could potentially take many forms. Randomly dispensing flares in the vicinity of airports has been suggested, noting that theIsraeli airline El Al occasionally used this technique during periods of heightened tension inthe 1980s. However, ground-based flares pose a risk of fires on the ground and thereforewould not be suitable at many airports in the United States, particularly those surrounded bypopulated or wooded areas. Furthermore, dispensing flares may be annoying to some andmay also diminish public confidence in the safety and security of air travel. Ground basedinterceptors are another option that has been suggested. These interceptors could be vehicle-mounted SAMs like the Marine Corps \"HUMRAAM\" system, or directed energyweapons like the Army's tactical high-energy laser (THEL). The THEL has successfullyintercepted rockets and artillery shells in tests. (62) Cost, reliability, probability of intercept, and potentialside-effects and unintended consequences would have to be weighed when considering theseoptions. Older \"lamp-based\" IR countermeasures might also offer some missile jammingcapability, by generating wide, if relatively weak, fields of IR energy near airports. Industryis also exploring, and promoting, the potential deployment of microwave-basedcountermeasures. Ground-based antennas could emit a microwave pulse intended to defeata terrorist missile by \"jamming\" or confusing its electronic systems. Again, costs, potentialside-effects, and unintended consequences of all of these potential approaches would haveto be assessed. The risk of interfering with, or actually shooting down a commercial aircraft,for example, may be of primary concern.", "Another way to mitigate the threat of shoulder-fired SAMs is through intelligence andlaw enforcement efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring these weapons, particularlyterrorists operating inside the United States.
