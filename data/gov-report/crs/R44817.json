Regarding sequencing, the UK favors conducting the negotiations about the UK-EU future partnership in parallel with the withdrawal negotiations.

Such questions underscore the high level of integration between the UK and the EU-27; the EU is the UK's largest trading partner for both goods and services (see Figure 5 ), though its share has declined in recent years.", "In a January 17, 2017, speech, Prime Minister May set out the British government's negotiating objectives and plan for exiting the EU. A February 2017 white paper subsequently released by the UK government elaborated on these positions. The Prime Minister confirmed that the UK is not seeking membership in the EU Single Market, but rather the negotiation of an FTA with the EU to allow \"the freest possible trade in goods and services between Britain and the EU's member states\" (see text box ). The Prime Minister further noted that", "[the] agreement [between the UK and EU] may take in elements of current single market arrangements in certain areas\u2014on the export of cars and lorries for example, or the freedom to provide financial services across national borders \u2013 as it makes no sense to start again from scratch when Britain and the remaining [m]ember [s]tates have adhered to the same rules for so many years.... ", "At the same time, the Prime Minister left open the possibility of no trade agreement with the EU if negotiations between the UK and the EU do not lead to an acceptable outcome, saying \"no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.\" EU officials and some industry groups have pushed back on this view. Some have characterized scenarios of a negotiated UK-EU trade deal as a \"soft\" Brexit and the absence of such a deal as a \"hard\" Brexit.", "The UK government also stated a goal of being able to pursue new trade agreements with other countries post-Brexit. The Prime Minister observed that \"full [c]ustoms [u]nion membership,\" which binds the UK to the EU's common external tariff, prevents the UK from negotiating its own trade deals with other countries, and the white paper stated, \"the UK will seek a new customs arrangement with the EU....\" For some observers, questions arose over the extent to which the UK might remain a part of the EU customs union. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond later confirmed that it is \"clear\" that the UK cannot stay in the customs union, as that would prevent the UK from independently negotiating its own trade deals outside of the EU.", "On March 29, 2017, Prime Minister May triggered the two-year Article 50 process for withdrawal from the EU. June 2017 marked the start of the withdrawal negotiations. After reported infighting over how to implement Brexit, UK Cabinet ministers jointly affirmed the importance of a \"time-limited\" transition period to cushion Brexit's impact after the UK exits the EU, while underscoring that this period is not a way for the UK to stay in the EU \"through the backdoor.\"", "The EU has relatively low external tariffs on goods, but the UK may seek lower or no tariffs in certain sectors.

Redefinition of the UK's terms in the WTO raises unprecedented issues for the WTO. ", "The UK is a founding member of the WTO. It currently has WTO membership both on an individual basis and as a part of the EU. The UK's commitments to other WTO members presently are through the EU's schedule of commitments in the WTO. Transitioning to an independent position in the WTO will require the UK to negotiate new goods and services schedules on its WTO market access commitments (see text box ). The WTO, which currently has 164 members, operates on a consensus basis. Some aspects of the UK's WTO transition, such as establishing its most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff levels, may be relatively straightforward. The UK could \"cut and paste\" the EU's bound tariff rates to its own schedule, though, of course, the UK's internal economic and political dynamics may lead it to pursue different tariff levels. Establishing tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) may be more complicated, as doing so will require reallocation of the EU's quotas under the WTO. The EU maintains TRQs on products such as beef, poultry, dairy, cereals, rice, sugar, fruits, and vegetables. Other aspects include commitments under the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), of which the UK is a member through its EU membership but is not currently a nation-state member. ", "Some observers note that the UK may face difficulty securing approval from WTO members for its proposed schedule, pointing to the possibility that countries that have territorial disputes with the UK\u2014such as Argentina over the Falkland Islands or Spain over Gibraltar\u2014could use the WTO negotiation process as leverage to address these issues with the UK. Others say that any lack of formal approval (\"certification\") of the UK's proposed new schedule should not be a bar to the UK negotiating trade agreements with other countries. They note that the EU's schedule as the EU-28 has lacked full certification, and that has not stopped the EU from entering into FTAs. Under this view, so long as the UK does not make its trade terms more restrictive than the EU's schedule, it may not run afoul of WTO obligations.", "In terms of sequencing, negotiations for UK's transition in the WTO could happen alongside UK withdrawal negotiations.

The Government will undertake this process in dialogue with the WTO membership. This work is a necessary part of our leaving the EU.

These commitments expand on WTO obligations and address new issues. ", "Possible areas in U.S.-UK FTA negotiations are highlighted below.

Enhanced market access addresses a number of issues, including reducing and eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers. Tariff liberalization could be a component of a potential U.S.-UK FTA. Industrial tariffs applied by the United States and UK (through the EU's tariff schedule) are already relatively low (see Table 1 ), but higher in certain sensitive sectors. For instance, EU tariffs on automobiles are 10%. Expanding agricultural market access could be a key area of focus for the United States, given high EU average tariffs or tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) on products such as meat, fish, sugar, dairy products, soft drinks, and wine. ", "It remains to be seen if a U.S.-UK FTA would face the same issues with respect to market access that confronted U.S. and EU negotiators in T-TIP. In those negotiations, the United States and the EU exchanged tariff offers to reduce and eliminate tariffs on most industrial goods, but opted to leave agricultural tariff issues, which were highly sensitive, until \"end-game\" negotiations.", "Services market access could be significant in potential FTA negotiations, given the high level of U.S.-UK services trade. Regulatory and other barriers to trade in services could be a focal point (see \" Regulatory Cooperation and Standard-Setting \" section below). Other areas of interest could include issues such as licensing and qualification requirements for professional service providers, as well as rules on the movement of foreign nationals for temporary entry and stay for business travel. Some services issues that were complex in T-TIP may be less so in U.S.-UK FTA negotiations. For instance, \"cultural exceptions\" were controversial in T-TIP due to the interest of countries like France in protecting its audiovisual sector.", "Other market access issues could arise in terms of public procurement. U.S. FTAs include rules to ensure transparent, nondiscriminatory access for U.S. firms to trading partners' public procurement markets in covered sectors at certain thresholds, and vice versa. In the transatlantic context, frictions have included, on the U.S. side, concerns about the transparency of EU public procurement policies, and on the EU side, concerns about U.S. restrictions to certain sensitive sectors, Buy American legislation, and access to U.S. state-level government procurement markets. These issues could also be politically sensitive in U.S.-UK FTA negotiations. President Trump has advocated for a \"Buy American\" and \"Hire American\" policy, while the UK released a post-Brexit industrial strategy including a goal of using \"strategic government procurement to drive innovation and enable the development of UK supply chains.\" More restrictive Buy American policies may run afoul of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA); the United States is a member of the GPA, and the UK also is a GPA member through its membership in the EU (but is not currently a nation-state member of that agreement)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade-Related Rules", "paragraphs": ["U.S. FTAs contain rules and disciplines governing a range of trade-related areas. Potential areas of interest in a bilateral FTA include the following.", "Investment . Given high levels of bilateral FDI, investment rules could be a major part of a U.S.-UK FTA. U.S. international agreements on investment typically include market access commitments, investor protections such as nondiscriminatory and minimum standard of treatment, and compensation for direct and, in limited cases, indirect expropriation, as well as enforcement of these obligations through investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). An open question could be treatment of ISDS, a mechanism for an investor to take a host country to binding arbitration for alleged breaches of obligations. Historically favored by U.S. government and business, ISDS has been a core part of many U.S. and European investment agreements, but triggered public debates on T-TIP because of potential implications for regulatory sovereignty and other issues. An added dynamic is the EU's proposal for an \"Investment Court System,\" which the EU included in recent trade agreements. It differs from ISDS; for example, it has an appellate mechanism while ISDS decisions are final. It is not clear what position the Trump Administration or the UK would take regarding this issue.", "Digital trade. Cross-border data flows are key to the U.S.-UK trading relationship, whether for manufacturing operations or financial services firms. Similar to provisions in TPP, a U.S.-UK FTA could address ways to facilitate cross-border data flows for business transactions and reduce barriers to digital trade, such as \"forced\" localization requirements. Any future UK-EU regulatory relationship may inform the nature of U.S.-UK FTA negotiations on digital trade. Discussions on cross-border flows in a bilateral FTA may not have the same level of sensitivities over privacy issues that constrained the T-TIP negotiations in the wake of disclosures of National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance activity. Such issues were particularly controversial for countries like Germany.", "Intellectual property rights (IPR) . Another area of significant interest is rules on IPR protection and enforcement. Both the United States and the UK are major centers of research and development and innovation, view intellectual property as a source of comparative advantage, and are strong proponents of advancing trade-related rules for IP R protection and enforcement. A U.S.-UK FTA could present opportunities for cooperation on IPR issues, such as combating cyber theft of trade secrets and enhancing protections for biologics. A bilateral FTA may not face the same challenges as did T-TIP on IPR issues such as geographical indications (GIs), which protect regional food names. Protection of GIs is a key priority for countries like France and Italy, but less so for the UK (though the UK does have over 60 registered GIs, including for Stilton Cheese and Cornish Pasty). The United States has favored protecting regional food names primarily through trademarks. ", "Other issues. A U.S.-UK FTA could also include rules and disciplines in a range of other areas. Some of these are areas that \"traditionally\" have been a part of U.S. FTAs, such as labor and the environment. The UK's status as a developed economy with strong environmental protections could mitigate concerns of some stakeholders about U.S. outsourcing or reducing environmental standards through an FTA. Other issues for possible discussion have been more recent additions to U.S. FTAs, including rules on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and commitments to support exports by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Cooperation and Standard-Setting", "paragraphs": ["A U.S.-UK FTA could include commitments on regulatory cooperation and standard-setting, both in terms of horizontal commitments, such as transparency and stakeholder input in regulatory processes, as well as sector-specific commitments. Many of the products in which in the United States and UK trade are in high-value-added but heavily regulated sectors that intersect with consumer safety issues. Sectoral issues of potential interest might include motor vehicle, pharmaceutical, chemical, and food safety regulatory regimes. The United States may view a U.S.-UK FTA as an opportunity to open the UK market to U.S. exports currently constrained by EU restrictions, such as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) barriers and technical barriers to trade (TBT). For instance, frictions on the U.S. side have included EU restrictions such as those on chlorine-washed chicken, hormone-raised beef, and genetically engineered food. In general, the UK is more closely aligned with the U.S. approach to regulatory issues than the EU but not necessarily in all areas. For instance, some UK consumers continue to reject genetically engineered foods.

Broadly speaking, the United States prefers risk-based assessments, while the EU favors the \"precautionary principle\" through preventive decisionmaking in case of risk; both sides view their approaches as science-based. T-TIP negotiations became weighted down by EU public debate over the impact of a U.S.-EU FTA on food safety and other regulatory concerns, though subsequent progress has been made in some areas. For example, in March 2017, the United States and the EU amended a 1998 U.S.-EU Mutual Recognition Agreement to allow for U.S. and EU regulators to rely upon each other's inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities to avoid duplication of inspections. ", "How the United States and the UK approach regulatory cooperation and standard setting within the context of a bilateral FTA will depend in large part on the extent to which the UK reclaims its regulatory authority from the EU during Brexit negotiations, including whether the UK will choose to retain EU regulations or adopt its own national regulations . \u00a0 T he UK has said that it plans to introduce a \"Great Repeal Bill\" to remove the European Communities Act 1972 from its statute book and convert the body of existing EU law ( known as \"acquis\" ) into domestic law where practical and appropriate, after which the UK will decide which elements of the law to keep, amend, or repeal.

Other issues include timing for when formal negotiations could start legally. As discussed, this depends in large part on the outcome of the UK's Brexit negotiations with the EU. The United States and UK also may have political considerations to take into account in determining when to launch trade negotiations, including in the context of overall trade policy priorities. Capacity to negotiate may be an issue on the UK side. The UK has \"outsourced\" trade negotiating skills to Brussels for decades as part of the EU's exclusive competence over trade policy, but has sought to rebuild that capacity in recent months. The UK has also indicated interest in negotiating a number of trade agreements, including with countries that have FTAs with the EU and those that do not. The EU has concluded over 50 trade agreements worldwide.

One reason is that the UK has been characterized as a liberalizing force within the EU that has shared the United States' traditional support for trade liberalization and a rules-based international trade system. Another reason is that the negotiating dynamics presumably would be less complex because U.S.-UK FTA negotiations would involve two economies, rather than T-TIP's 29 economies (United States and EU-28 member states). Some may counter, however, that the economic impact of a U.S.-UK FTA also would be smaller than T-TIP (see next section).", "Some analysts believe that U.S.-UK FTA negotiations would not face the level of substantive and procedural difficulty that beset the T-TIP negotiations. Given these dynamics, some have called for a U.S.-UK FTA to be implemented within 90 days after Brexit\u201490 days being the amount of time the executive branch must give Congress before it signs a trade agreement under TPA.

Yet, broad macroeconomic factors generally are considered to play an important role in affecting the U.S. economy as a whole. Given the openness of the U.S. and UK economies, a U.S.-UK FTA may be expected to generate modest economic benefits. Nevertheless, due to the size of the bilateral economic relationship, further trade liberalization could yield significant benefits for particular industries. Regarding the enhanced market access and other benefits that a concluded FTA could bring, some experts caution that no U.S.-UK FTA would replicate the broader EU market access that U.S. affiliates in the UK enjoy by virtue of the UK's membership in the EU and access to the EU Single Market. A potential bilateral FTA could present costs, such as in terms of job losses and other transition costs stemming from increased competition. Such costs, however, could be less than those of other U.S. FTAs, as the United States and the UK are both highly advanced economies. ", "As U.S.-UK FTA negotiations advance, Congress likely would examine various studies by the U.S. government (e.g., the U.S. International Trade Commission) and external organizations to assess the expected impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy. It should be kept in mind that economic models are highly sensitive to assumptions. Further, data limitations and other issues\u2014including the fact that a number of variables beyond trade affect economic performance\u2014make it difficult to develop precise estimates of the impact of a particular trade agreement on the economy.", "Any economic impact of a U.S.-UK FTA is in the longer term, given that the commencement of U.S.-UK FTA negotiations is at least two years away. Over the short run, Brexit-specific factors may have more economic impact on the United States. These factors include the economic impact of Brexit on the EU and on the UK, the amount of time it takes for the UK withdrawal from the EU, and the final composition of the UK-EU economic relationship\u2014all of which could have implications for U.S. trade and investment with both the UK and the EU. Another aspect of the economic relationship is the impact Brexit will have on financial flows and any secondary impact on the dollar if markets perceive additional uncertainty for a EU economic recovery. ", "A U.S.-UK FTA could have broader strategic implications. For instance, a U.S.-UK FTA could play a similar role to what TPP and T-TIP were expected to play in setting globally relevant rules and disciplines to support economic growth and multilateral trade liberalization through the WTO. It also could strengthen the broader U.S.-UK relationship and add a new dimension to the transatlantic trade relationship. In addition, a U.S.-UK FTA could apply pressure on unlocking past stumbling blocks to progress in T-TIP, assuming that both the United States and EU seek to continue negotiations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role in U.S. Trade Policy", "paragraphs": ["A potential U.S.-UK FTA would fit into a new U.S. emphasis on bilateral trade deals under the Trump Administration, which has expressed a clear preference for focusing on bilateral trade deals in lieu of multiparty ones. The Trump Administration has argued that a bilateral approach allows the United States to use its economic strength and focus on U.S. priorities. This represents a shift from the Obama Administration, which made it a priority to negotiate multiparty regional trade deals, such as TPP and T-TIP. Regional negotiations, while more complex, offer the opportunity for mutually beneficial but politically challenging trade-offs to occur across multiple countries. ", "Once Brexit procedural roadblocks to U.S.-UK FTA negotiations are overcome, the question arises of when the administration may launch formal negotiations, amid other potential U.S. trade negotiations and other trade policy actions. The Trump Administration says that it aims to focus its future trade efforts on the possibility of renegotiating and reviewing existing FTAs, turning first to NAFTA, and pursuing new bilateral FTAs, including with TPP participants, particularly Japan, and possibly other countries. ", "Given the already relatively low levels of trade and investment barriers between the United States and the UK, some question whether it is appropriate for the administration to give priority to negotiating a U.S.-UK FTA. Proponents of a U.S.-UK FTA argue that concluding a bilateral FTA between two economic and political international heavyweights will contribute to future trade liberalization efforts. Others say that, in light of resource constraints and other factors, the United States should pursue FTAs with other countries that present greater barriers to trade. For example, some may argue that the United States would benefit more from resuming T-TIP negotiations or pursuing bilateral deals with countries that were a part of the TPP.

The 15 th round, the last under the Obama Administration, occurred in October 2016. By then, the United States and the EU had consolidated texts in a number of areas, but unresolved complex and sensitive issues remained and raised questions over whether political momentum exists to overcome differences. For instance, public opposition to T-TIP runs high in the EU due to concerns over issues such as over food safety regulations, ISDS, and data privacy. Aspects of T-TIP also were controversial among U.S. stakeholders.", "T-TIP negotiations are on pause, and the Trump Administration has stated that it is \"currently evaluating the status of these negotiations.\" Should the United States and the EU decide to resume T-TIP negotiations prior to the UK exiting the EU, the European Commission would continue negotiating the T-TIP on behalf of all 28 member states, including the UK. ", "Brexit presents uncertainties for T-TIP, despite the Trump Administration's expressions of support for expanding transatlantic trade. Some observers argue that Brexit is a major setback given the UK's historical liberalizing role in the EU on trade issues. Others argue that a U.S.-UK FTA could pressure the EU to reenergize T-TIP, as the EU may be wary of the UK receiving preferential access to the U.S. market without the EU securing similar access. Likewise, if the agreement \"in principle\" announced in July 2017 on an EU-Japan FTA leads to a ratified FTA between those two economies, it could accelerate U.S. interest in resuming negotiations to ensure U.S. firms' competitiveness in the EU market. Should the United States and the EU decide to resume T-TIP negotiations prior to the UK exiting the EU, the European Commission would continue negotiating the FTA on behalf of all 28 member states, including the UK.
