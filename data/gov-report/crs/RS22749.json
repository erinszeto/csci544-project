{"id": "RS22749", "title": "Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) and Its Implementing Regulations", "released_date": "2012-04-10T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) seeks to cut off the flow of revenue to unlawful Internet gambling businesses. It outlaws receipt of checks, credit card charges, electronic funds transfers, and the like by such businesses. It also enlists the assistance of banks, credit card issuers and other payment system participants to help stem the flow of funds to unlawful Internet gambling businesses. To that end, it authorizes the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve System (the Agencies), in consultation with the Justice Department, to promulgate implementing regulations. The Agencies adopted a final rule implementing the provisions of the UIGEA, 73 Federal Register 69382 (November 18, 2008); the rule was effective January 19, 2009, with a compliance date of June 1, 2010.", "The final rule addresses the feasibility of identifying and interdicting the flow of illicit Internet gambling proceeds in five payment systems: card systems, money transmission systems, wire transfer systems, check collection systems, and the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system. It suggests that, except for financial institutions that deal directly with illegal Internet gambling operators, tracking the flow of revenue within the wire transfer, check collection, and ACH systems is not feasible at this point. It therefore exempts them from the regulations' requirements. It charges those with whom illegal Internet gambling operators may deal directly within those three systems, and participants in the card and money transmission systems, to adopt policies and procedures to enable them to identify the nature of their customers' business, to employ customer agreements barring tainted transactions, and to establish and maintain remedial steps to deal with tainted transactions when they are identified. The final rule provides non-exclusive examples of reasonably designed policies and procedures to prevent restricted transactions. The Agencies argued that flexible, risk-based due diligence procedures conducted by participants in the payment systems, in establishing and maintaining commercial customer relationships, is the most effective method to prevent or prohibit the restricted transactions.", "Some Members of Congress have criticized the current Internet gambling restrictions for being, in their view, ineffective at stopping Internet gambling, an infringement on individual liberty, and a lost opportunity to collect tax revenue, among other things. The 112th Congress has held several hearings concerning Internet gambling and related issues, and several bills have been introduced that would allow for lawful, government-regulated Internet gambling activities. The legislation includes H.R. 1174 (Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act), which would establish a licensing program administered by the U.S. Treasury Secretary under which Internet gambling companies may legitimately operate and accept bets or wagers from individuals located in the United States; H.R. 2230 (Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act of 2011), which would establish a licensing fee regime within the Internal Revenue Code for Internet gambling operators; and H.R. 2366 (Internet Gambling Prohibition, Poker Consumer Protection, and Strengthening UIGEA Act of 2011), which would create an office within the U.S. Department of Commerce responsible for overseeing qualified state agencies that issue licenses to persons seeking to operate an Internet poker facility.", "Several state legislatures are also considering measures that would legalize, license, and tax Internet gambling within their borders, taking advantage of a UIGEA provision that exempts intrastate Internet gambling from its applicable scope. A recent change in the U.S. Department of Justice's position regarding the federal Wire Act that now interprets that statute as prohibiting sports betting only (and not interstate transmission of other types of gambling) has also helped encourage state initiatives to legalize intrastate, and possibly even interstate, online gambling."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in 2006 as Title VIII of the SAFE Port Act represented the culmination of legislative consideration that began with the recommendations of the National Gambling Commission published in a 1999 report. The legislative history of UIGEA indicates that Congress wanted the law, in part, to address the perceived problem of foreign Internet gambling operations that made their services available to U.S. customers. ", "UIGEA prohibits anyone \"engaged in the business of betting or wagering\" from knowingly accepting checks, credit card charges, electronic transfers, and similar payments in connection with unlawful Internet gambling. UIGEA expressly excludes from the definition of the term \"business of betting or wagering\" the services of financial institutions as well as communications and Internet service providers that may be used in connection with the unlawful bet; however, such entities may nonetheless incur liability under UIGEA if they are directly engaged in the operation of an Internet gambling site. A violation of UIGEA is subject to a criminal fine of up to $250,000 (or $500,000 if the defendant is an organization), imprisonment of up to five years, or both. In addition, upon conviction of the defendant, the court may enter a permanent injunction enjoining the defendant from making bets or wagers \"or sending, receiving, or inviting information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers.\" ", "Any person or entity that violates UIGEA and its implementing regulations may also be subject to civil and regulatory enforcement actions. For example, the Attorney General of the United States or a state attorney general may bring civil proceedings to enjoin a transaction that is prohibited under UIGEA. However, UIGEA expressly limits the instances when the attorneys general may bring a civil suit against financial institutions and Internet service providers, as follows: they may only bring a civil proceeding against financial institutions to block transactions involving unlawful Internet gambling (unless the institution is directly involved in an unlawful Internet gambling business, in which case criminal prosecution is available). The attorneys general may also initiate civil proceedings against Internet service providers under UIGEA only to block access to unlawful Internet gambling sites or to hyperlinks to such sites under limited circumstances.", "UIGEA's definition of \"unlawful Internet gambling\" does not specify what gambling activity is illegal; rather, the statute relies on underlying federal or state gambling laws to make that determination\u2014that is, UIGEA applies to an Internet bet or wager that is illegal in the place where it is placed, received, or transmitted:", "The term \"unlawful Internet gambling\" means to place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by any means which involves the use, at least in part, of the Internet where such bet or wager is unlawful under any applicable Federal or State law in the State or Tribal lands in which the bet or wager is initiated, received, or otherwise made.", "However, this statutory definition expressly exempts certain intrastate and intratribal Internet gambling operations, including state lotteries and Indian casinos that operate under state regulations or compacts. To qualify for the intrastate exception under UIGEA, a bet must (1) be made and received in the same state; (2) comply with applicable state law that authorizes the gambling and the method of transmission including any age and location verification and security requirements; and (3) not violate various federal gambling laws. The intratribal exception is similar, but slightly different. Compliance with the various federal gambling laws remains a condition and there are also similar security, age, and location verification requirements. Intratribal gambling, however, may involve transmissions between the lands of two or more tribes and need not be within the same state.", "UIGEA further defines the term \"bet or wager\" to mean \"the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others, a sporting event, or a game subject to chance, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or another person will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.\" The statutory definition includes lottery participation, gambling on athletic events, and information relating to financing a gambling account, but a \"bet or wager\" does not include the following:", "securities transactions; commodities transactions; over-the-counter derivative instruments; indemnity or guarantee contracts; insurance contracts; bank transactions (transactions with insured depository institutions); games or contests in which the participants do not risk anything but their efforts; or certain fantasy or simulation sports contests.", "UIGEA leaves in place questions as to the extent to which the Interstate Horseracing Act curtails the reach of other federal laws, an issue that was at the center of World Trade Organization (WTO) litigation. The statute instructs the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Attorney General, to issue implementing regulations within 270 days of passage.", "On September 1, 2009, a federal appeals court ruled that UIGEA is not unconstitutionally vague. The Interactive Media Entertainment & Gaming Association had filed a lawsuit alleging that UIGEA was facially unconstitutional, and sought to enjoin the enforcement of the act and its regulations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit disagreed with Interactive's assertion that UIGEA was void for vagueness because of the lack of an \"ascertainable and workable definition\" of the statutory phrase \"unlawful Internet gambling\":", "The Supreme Court has explained that a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it \"fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\" United States v. Williams, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 1845, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008).... We reject Interactive's vagueness claim. The Act prohibits a gambling business from knowingly accepting certain financial instruments from an individual who places a bet over the Internet if such gambling is illegal at the location in which the business is located or from which the individual initiates the bet. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5362(10)(A), 5363. Thus, the Act clearly provides a person of ordinary intelligence with adequate notice of the conduct that it prohibits.", "The appellate court noted that UIGEA \"itself does not make any gambling activity illegal,\" but rather, the definition of \"unlawful Internet gambling\" references federal and state laws related to gambling. Therefore, the court suggested that \"to the extent that [there is] a vagueness problem, it is not with the Act, but rather with the underlying state law.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulations Implementing UIGEA", "paragraphs": ["UIGEA calls for regulations that require \"each designated payment system, and all participants therein, to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions through the establishment of policies and procedures\" reasonably calculated to have that result. On October 4, 2007, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department (the Agencies) issued proposed regulations implementing UIGEA. The proposal invited commentators to suggest alternatives and critiques before the close of the comment period on December 12, 2007. The proposal offered to exempt substantial activities in those payment systems in which tracking is not possible now and in which it may ultimately not be feasible. It also noted that the two Agencies felt that they have no authority to compel payment system participants to serve lawful Internet gambling operators. After taking into consideration the public comments on the proposed rule and consulting with the Department of Justice (as required by the UIGEA), the Agencies adopted a final rule implementing the provisions of the UIGEA; the rule was effective January 19, 2009, with a compliance date of June 1, 2010 (originally December 1, 2009)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Designated Payment Systems & Due Diligence", "paragraphs": ["The final rule identifies five relevant payment systems that could be used in connection with, or to facilitate, the \"restricted transactions\" used for Internet gambling: Automated Clearing House System (ACH), card systems, check collection systems, money transmitting business, and wire transfer systems. The rule defines a \"restricted transaction\" to mean any transactions or transmittals involving any credit, funds, instrument, or proceeds that the UIGEA prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting, in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful Internet gambling. However, the rule does not provide a more specific definition of the term \"unlawful Internet gambling;\" instead, it restates the UIGEA's definition. ", "While the Agencies expect that card systems will find that using a merchant and transaction coding system is \"the method of choice\" to identify and block restricted transactions, the Agencies felt that the most efficient way for other designated payment systems to comply with the UIGEA is through \"adequate due diligence by participants when opening accounts for commercial customers to reduce the risk that a commercial customer will introduce restricted transactions into the payment system in the first place.\"", "The rule directs participants in the designated systems, unless exempted, to \"establish and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions,\" and then provides non-exclusive examples of reasonably compliant policies and procedures for each system. Participants may comply by adopting the policies and procedures of their payments system or by adopting their own. Participants that establish and implement procedures for due diligence of their commercial customer accounts or commercial customer relationships will be considered in compliance with the regulation if the procedures include the following steps:", "1. At the establishment of the account or relationship, the participant conducts due diligence of a commercial customer and its activities commensurate with the participant's judgment of the risk of restricted transactions presented by the customer's business. 2. Based on its due diligence, the participant makes a determination regarding the risk the commercial customer presents of engaging in an Internet gambling business. Such a determination may take one of the two courses set forth below: a. The participant determines that the commercial customer presents a minimal risk of engaging in an Internet gambling business (such as commercial customers that are directly supervised by a federal functional regulator, or an agency, department, or division of the federal government or a state government), or b. The participant cannot determine that the commercial customer presents a minimal risk of engaging in an Internet gambling business, in which case it must obtain a certification from the commercial customer that it does not engage in an Internet gambling business. If the commercial customer does engage in an Internet gambling business, the participant must obtain: (1) documentation that provides evidence of the customer's legal authority to engage in the Internet gambling business and a written commitment by the commercial customer to notify the participant of any changes in its legal authority to engage in its Internet gambling business, and (2) a third-party certification that the commercial customer's systems for engaging in the Internet gambling business are reasonably designed to ensure that the commercial customer's Internet gambling business will remain within the licensed or otherwise lawful limits, including with respect to age and location verification. 3.

There are no card system exemptions from the regulations' requirements. Examples of reasonably compliant policies and procedures feature due diligence and prophylactic procedural components.

", "The regulations contain exemptions in varying degrees for the other payment systems. In essence, because of the difficulties of identifying tainted transactions, they limit requirements to those who may deal directly with the unlawful Internet gambling businesses. In the case of \"check collection systems,\" the coded information available to the system with respect to a particular check is limited to information identifying the bank and account upon which the check is drawn, and the number and amount of the check. Information identifying the payee is not coded and a \"requirement to analyze each check with respect to the payee would substantially ... reduce the efficiency of the check collection system.\" Consequently, the final rule exempts all participants in a particular check collection through a check collection system except for \"the first U.S. institution to which a check is transferred, in this case the institution receiving the check deposit from the gambling business\" \u2014namely, the depository bank. ", "Banks in which a payee deposits a check are covered by the regulations as are banks which receive a check for collection from a foreign bank. The rule offers examples for both circumstances. In the case of a check received from a foreign bank, examples of a depositary bank's reasonably compliant policies and procedures are procedures to inform the foreign banking office after the depositary bank has actual knowledge that the checks are restricted transactions (such actual knowledge being obtained through notification by a government entity such as law enforcement or a regulatory agency). In the purely domestic cases, examples of reasonably compliant policies and procedures would include (1) due diligence in establishing and maintaining customer relations sufficient to identify the nature of a customer's business, and to provide for a prohibition on tainted transactions in the customer agreement, and (2) remedial action (refuse to deposit a check; close an account) should a tainted transaction be unearthed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wire Transfer Systems", "paragraphs": ["\"Wire transfer systems\" come in two forms.

The Agencies sought public comments on whether additional safeguards should be required of the initiating bank in such cases but ultimately decided to exempt all but the bank receiving the transfer. ", "Banks that receive a wire transfer (the beneficiary's bank) are covered by the regulations, and examples of reasonably compliant policies and practices resemble those provided for check collection system participants: know your customer, have a no-tainted transaction customer agreement clause, and have a remedial procedure (transfer denied; account closed) when tainted transactions surface.
