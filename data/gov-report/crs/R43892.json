With total repatriations of over 600,000 people in FY2013\u2014including about 440,000 formal removals\u2014the removal and return of such aliens have become important policy issues for Congress, and key issues in recent debates about immigration reform.", "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides broad authority to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to remove certain foreign nationals from the United States, including unauthorized aliens (i.e., foreign nationals who enter without inspection, aliens who enter with fraudulent documents, and aliens who enter legally but overstay the terms of their temporary visas) and lawfully present foreign nationals who commit certain acts that make them removable. Any foreign national found to be inadmissible or deportable under the grounds specified in the INA may be ordered removed. The INA describes procedures for making and reviewing such a determination, and specifies conditions under which certain grounds of removal may be waived. DHS officials may exercise certain forms of discretion in pursuing removal orders, and certain removable aliens may be eligible for permanent or temporary relief from removal. Certain grounds for removal (e.g., criminal grounds, terrorist grounds) render foreign nationals ineligible for most forms of relief and may make them eligible for more streamlined (expedited) removal processes.", "The \"standard\" removal process is a civil judicial proceeding in which an immigration judge from DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) determines whether an alien is removable. Immigration judges may grant certain forms of relief during the removal process (e.g., asylum, cancellation of removal), and the judge's removal decisions are subject to administrative and judicial review. The INA also describes different types of streamlined removal procedures, which generally include more-limited opportunities for relief and grounds for review. In addition, two alternative forms of removal exempt aliens from certain penalties associated with formal removal: voluntary departure (return) and withdrawal of petition for admission. These are often called \"returns.\"", "Following an order of removal, an alien is inadmissible for a minimum of five years after the date of the removal, and therefore is generally ineligible to return to the United States during this time period. The period of inadmissibility is determined by the reason for and type of removal. For example, a foreign national ordered removed based on removal proceedings initiated upon the foreign national's arrival is inadmissible for five years, while a foreign national ordered removed after being apprehended within the United States is inadmissible for 10 years. The length of inadmissibility increases to 20 years for an alien's second or subsequent removal order, and is indefinite for a foreign national convicted of an aggravated felony.", "Absent additional factors, unlawful presence in the United States is a civil violation, not a criminal offense, and removal and its associated administrative processes are civil proceedings. As such, aliens in removal proceedings generally have no right to counsel (though they may be represented by counsel at their own expense).

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA, P.L. 104-208 ), established new mechanisms by which to effectuate the removal of aliens who have violated the nation's immigration laws\u2014including several streamlined processes. An alien's immigration status and whether the alien has engaged in certain specified activities (e.g., committed a particular criminal offense) determines which process is used. Lawful permanent residents are generally subject to the standard removal process where foreign nationals have their cases decided by an immigration judge. However, arriving aliens who have not been admitted into the country, as well as aliens within the United States who have committed specified criminal offenses, may be subject to more streamlined removal processes such as reinstatement of removal or expedited removal of criminal aliens.", "This report provides an overview of the statutory framework for removal and briefly describes the standard removal process.

Between FY1996 and FY1998 the number of removals increased 151%, from 69,680 to 174,813, corresponding to changes made in IIRIRA that expanded the grounds for removal and tightened the standards for relief from removal. In addition, the changes made to the grounds for removal (i.e., the statutory reasons a foreign national can be removed) were retroactive.

The divergence between the number of returns and border patrol apprehensions since FY2012 may be partially attributable to the rise in the number of apprehensions of persons from countries other than Mexico. For example, foreign nationals from countries other than Mexico accounted for 47% of all border patrol apprehensions in FY2013, compared to 13% in FY2010. Another factor may be CBP's effort in recent years to promote \"high consequence\" enforcement for unauthorized Mexicans apprehended at the border (this is known as the Consequence Delivery System). Historically, immigration agents permitted most Mexicans apprehended at the border to voluntarily return to Mexico without any penalty.
