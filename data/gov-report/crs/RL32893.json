Norton ) was filed in 1996, in the federal district court for the District of Columbia, against the federal government by IIM account holders. Many OST activities are related to the Cobell case, including litigation support activities, but the most significant issue for appropriations concerns the method by which the historical accounting will be conducted to estimate IIM accounts' proper balances. The DOI estimated its proposed method would cost $335 million over five years and produce a total owed to IIM accounts in the low millions; the plaintiffs' method, the cost of which is uncertain, was estimated to produce a total owed to IIM accounts over $100 billion .", "In 2003, the district court conducted a lengthy trial to decide which historical accounting method to use in estimating the IIM accounts' proper balances. The court's decision on historical accounting was delivered on September 25, 2003. The court rejected both the plaintiffs' and DOI's proposed historical accounting plans and instead ordered DOI to account for all trust fund and asset transactions since 1887, without using statistical sampling. The Interior Department estimated that the court's choice for historical accounting would cost $6-12 billion.", "In the FY2004 Interior appropriations act, Congress enacted a controversial provision aimed at the court's September 25, 2003 decision. The provision directed that no statute or trust law principle should be construed to require the Interior Department to conduct the historical accounting until either Congress had delineated the department's specific historical accounting obligations or December 31, 2004, whichever was earlier. Based on this provision, the DOI appealed the court's September 25, 2003 order. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia temporarily stayed the September 25 order. During the stay, on April 5, 2004, the IIM plaintiffs and the federal government announced agreement on two mediators in their case and mediation commenced. Meanwhile, no bill was introduced in the 108 th Congress to delineate the government's historical accounting obligation. On December 10, 2004, the Appeals Court overturned much of the September 25 order, finding among other things that the congressional provision prevented the district court from requiring DOI to follow its directions for a historical accounting. The Appeals Court noted that the provision expired on December 31, 2004, but did not discuss the district court's possible reissue of the order. On February 23, 2005, the district court issued an order on historical accounting very similar to its September 2003 order, requiring that an accounting cover all trust fund and asset transactions since 1887 and not use statistical sampling. The DOI, which estimates that compliance with the new order would cost $12-13 billion, appealed the order. The district court did not stay its order during the appeal, however, so various deadlines that DOI must meet are still in effect. One news story suggests DOI is seeking congressional action to delay the court-ordered accounting, similar to the provision in the FY2004 Interior appropriations act.", "Congress has long been concerned that the current and potential costs of the Cobell lawsuit may jeopardize DOI trust reform implementation, reduce spending on other Indian programs, and be difficult to fund. Besides the ongoing expenses of the litigation, possible costs include $12-13 billion for the court-ordered historical accounting, a Cobell settlement that might cost as much as the court-ordered historical accounting, the over-$100 billion that Cobell plaintiffs estimate their IIM accounts are owed, or the $27.5 billion that the Cobell plaintiffs have proposed as a settlement amount. Among the funding sources for these large costs discussed in a recent House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee hearing were discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" but some senior appropriators consider the Fund insufficient even for a $6-$13 billion dollar settlement. Among other options, Congress may await a stay, reversal, or other appeals court action, or it may enact another delay to the court-ordered accounting, or it may take other actions such as directing a settlement or delineating the department's historical accounting obligations. In their reports for FY2006, both the House Appropriations Committee and the conference committee stated that they rejected the position that Congress intended in the 1994 Act to order an historical accounting on the scale of that ordered by the district court. The House Appropriations Committee also noted that House and Senate authorizing committees are committed to developing a legislative solution, and a settlement bill ( S. 1439 ) has been introduced and received hearings. No language in the FY2006 appropriations law either delayed the court-ordered historical accounting or otherwise settled the suit.", "For further information on the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians , see its website at http://www.ost.doi.gov/ .", "CRS Report RS21738.

Accordingly, appropriations in the original House-passed bill generally mirrored, or were reductions from, the Administration's FY2006 request and the FY2005 appropriation. The Senate originally provided more than the Administration's FY2006 request for federal land acquisition and stateside grants, but less for other programs.

By contrast, the Senate had sought to earmark the bulk of the funds for specific federal land acquisitions.", "For the stateside grant program, the FY2006 appropriations law provided $30.0 million, a large reduction from the $91.2 million appropriated for FY2005. The original Senate-passed bill also had contained $30.0 million, and an amendment seeking to augment money for the stateside program through state retention of certain recreational user fees was withdrawn. The House, as in the Administration request, had included $1.6 million for administration of the stateside grant program, but did not include funding for new state grants. The Administration did not seek funds for state grants in FY2006, on the grounds that large federal deficits require a focus on core federal responsibilities, state and local governments have alternative sources of funding for parkland acquisition and development, and the current program could not adequately measure performance or demonstrate results.

The FY2006 enacted level was sizeably smaller than the Administration's request of $531.7 million for other programs, the second largest such request in the history of the LWCF. As shown in Table 21 , the FY2006 appropriations law provided the indicated programs with no funding from the LWCF or with less than the Administration requested.

The CSC, which is also called the Conservation Trust Fund by some, combines funding for more than two dozen resource protection programs including the LWCF. (It also includes some coastal and marine programs funded through Commerce Department appropriations). This action was in response to both the Clinton Administration request for substantial funding increases in these programs under its Lands Legacy Initiative, and congressional interest in increasing conservation funding through legislation known as the Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA), which passed the House in the 106 th Congress. The FY2001 Interior appropriations law authorized that total spending for CSC would increase each year by $160.0 million, from $1.6 billion in FY2001 (of which $1.2 billion would be through Interior appropriations laws) to $2.4 billion in FY2006.

Neither the Forest Service nor the Department of Commerce used the CSC as a structure for organizing or tabulating their requests.
