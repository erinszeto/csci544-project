Bushdramatically increased CN aid to Colombia through his 1989 \"Andean Initiative.\" Grant aid to Colombia hadincreased gradually, albeit not evenly, through the1980s, as Colombia evolved from a major supplier of marijuana to the United States, to nearly the sole supplier ofcocaine. By the end of the 1980s, with coca leafcultivation and cocaine production rising in the Andean region, and Colombia suffering increased political violencefrom the Medellin drug-trafficking cartel, theformer Bush Administration established its new CN program. Under this region-wide initiative, the United Statessubstantially increased State Department supportfor Colombian CN efforts, and provided Colombian security forces, primarily the police, with equipment throughforeign military financing grants and DODequipment drawdowns. As part of the effort to bring military resources to bear on the \"war against drugs,\" in 1991,Congress enacted \"Section 1004\" of the 1991National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) ( P.L.101-510 ). This provides the DOD with authority to providetransportation, reconnaissance, training, intelligence,and base support when requested by foreign law enforcement agencies for CN purposes.

During Pastrana's October 1998state visit, President Clinton announced that the United State would provide nearly three times more assistance toColombia during FY1999 than it had the previousyear. Much of this, however, was the $173.2 million in congressionally-mandated supplemental appropriationsfunding ( P.L. 105-277 ) for helicopter and aircraft upgrades, radar, andpolice assistance that the Administration had not requested. In FY2000, the funding again rose substantially withthe \"Plan Colombia\" legislation.

Nearly half of the Colombiafunding was dedicated to the \"Push into Southern Colombia\" program toset up and train two new Colombian Army Counternarcotics battalions (CACBs), which combined with an existingone set up earlier by the United States to form a brigade of some2,700. The brigade assists the Colombian National Police (CNP) in the fumigation of illicit narcotics crops and thedismantling of laboratories, beginning with coca fumigation in thesouthern provinces of Putumayo and Caquet\u00e1, where coca cultivation was spreading rapidly.
