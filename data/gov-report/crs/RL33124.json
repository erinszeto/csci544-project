Katrina, which made landfall on August 29, resulted in the shutdown of most crude oil andnatural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as a great deal of refining capacity in Louisianaand Alabama, 554,000 barrels per day of which was still closed as of late October, 2005. Offshoreoil and gas production was resuming when Hurricane Rita made landfall on September 24, and anadditional 4.8 million barrels per day (mbd) of refining capacity in Texas and nearby Louisiana wasclosed.", "Combining the effects of both storms, 1.3 mbd of refining -- about 8% of national capability-- is shut down, reducing the supply of domestically refined fuels commensurately. Much of therefined product shortfall was made up by imports of refined products, some of which were madeavailable by strategic supplies released by International Energy Agency (IEA) member nations onSeptember 2.", "As part of the IEA drawdown, 30 million barrels of crude oil were made available from theU.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which holds only crude. Only 11 million barrels was soldfrom the SPR, in part because limited refinery capacity reduced the call on crude.", "Natural gas production from Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana state lands has been recoveringsince the storms, but the equivalent of about 3% of U.S. consumption remains shut-in because ofproduction or transport problems. Unlike refined products, which can be imported, there is littleextra available supply. A normal storage situation at the start of the heating season -- coupled witha very warm winter -- saw Spring 2006 arrive with surplus gas in storage and gas prices well belowequivalent oil prices.", "This report will be updated to reflect significant restoration of gas and oil production andrelated infrastructure, as well as relevant changes in hydrocarbon supply and demand."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Hurricanes Katrina and Rita shut down oil and gas production from the Outer ContinentalShelf in the Gulf of Mexico, the source for 25% of U.S. crude oil production and 20% of natural gasoutput.

At one point, about one-third of thenation's refining capacity was closed. Virtually all have been restored, although output at a coupleof units is still in the process of ramping up. Heroic recovery efforts at refineries and increasedimports of refined products met a warm heating season's needs and kept gasoline supplies flowingwithout isolated run-outs.", "About 400,000 bd of crude oil from the outer continental shelf (OCS) and Louisiana statelands is currently shut in. This is the equivalent of about 5% of total U.S. petroleum demand. Imported crude has kept stocks at more than adequate levels.", "Refined product supplies were initially made up from the release of 30 million barrels ofgasoline, middle distillate and other products from the strategic reserves of member nations of theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) who are International EnergyAgency (IEA) members. Since those barrels arrived in early fall 2005, the world market privatesector has provided the United States with an increased level of imports. Supply appears to havematched demand, as prices fell through late 2005 and early 2006.", "A number of crosscurrents bear on this situation, including how fuel demand is affected byprices, and when winter weather arrives and how cold it might be. On the supply side of therelationship are factors which include the rate at which U.S. refining recovers, and the availabilityon world markets of commercial refined products. In addition, some waivers of gasolinespecifications have been granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), aimed at makinggasoline easier to supply.", "With natural gas, about 85% of the nation's supply comes from domestic production; thereis very little opportunity to import replacement supply. As of October, nearly 10% of totalnationwide consumption was shut-in because of production problems in the Federal Offshore Gulfof Mexico, or because of damage to critical infrastructure. Another 3% of nationwide supply fromLouisiana state lands is shut-in. Despite reduced output, gas was still being placed in storage; theadditions during the week ending October 14 were 75 billion cubic feet (bcf). The amount of gasalready in storage was equivalent to the five-year average, although it was slightly below year-earlierlevels.", "Gas sold from storage is used to balance seasonal demand swings, and not to replace acatastrophic loss of production. Given that the current amount of shut-in OCS and Louisiana statelands gas is the equivalent of half the most recent week's storage addition, the perception of a robustinjection to storage should be adjusted accordingly.", "Despite the fact that supplies continue to flow, wellhead prices have doubled since lastsummer. Issues for the onset of cold weather include timing and severity, as with oil, as well as\"demand destruction\" resulting from higher prices. But if Gulf of Mexico production does notrecover, there is no import safety-valve, and supplies could become tight and prices could spike.", "In the immediate wake of Katrina and Rita, much of the impacted area was without electricpower.

But a full assessment of damage to facilities, including underwater productionplatform-wellhead connections and pipeline gathering systems, has not been completed. It may betoo early to assess whether production is steadily coming back, or if all the production that has comeback was the easiest to restore while currently shut-in output presents significant challenges atproduction platforms, within transport infrastructure, and at coastal processing facilities. Productioncan come back only as fast as pipelines and processing facilities return to service.", "That said, Energy Information Administration (EIA) Administrator Guy Caruso has estimatedthat shut-in production will continue being restored; the amounts shut-in will likely average 930,000bd in October, 724,000 bd in November and 517,000 bd in December. (1) ", "In addition to disrupted production, the operation of two important long-distance crude oilpipelines were impeded. CAPLINE, which transports crude from Louisiana to Illinois, was shut forseveral weeks; it is now operating at 80% capacity. This limited crude supply to a number of refinersin the central part of the nation. And the Sun Pipeline and terminal started limited operations in earlyOctober, supplying a number of Texas and Louisiana refineries.", "Some pipelines transporting refined products had service outages or throughput reductionsas a result of the hurricanes. Most notable was the Colonial Pipeline, which transports fuels from theGulf northeastward, ending in New York. This is an important source of supply for consumers allalong its route, and its outage resulted in very high prices in places like Maryland and Washington,D.C., which at one point had the highest gasoline prices in the nation. Colonial received fullcommercial electric power on October 13; full capacity is now available, subject to availability ofpipeline input. Gasoline prices in its service area are returning to parity with prices elsewhere.", "About 2.5 mbd of crude oil imports -- including 0.9 mbd by way of the Louisiana OffshorePort (LOOP) -- flow through storm-damaged ports in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Thisconstitutes more than 12% of petroleum consumption. (2) LOOP was operating at full capacity when it was shut down againas a precautionary measure in anticipation of Hurricane Rita. It is reportedly operating at 100%capacity, having escaped more damage from Rita.

Citing falling U.S.product demand, IEA Executive Director Claude Mandil told Platts :", "There is no immediate issue right now, but there is stilla lot of oil and products that will be missing in the balance. We still need to carefully monitor thesituation together with our American friends to see whether demand destruction is long-lasting ornot because there may be risks to supply in November andDecember.", "The most recent import statistics for the four weeks ending October14 (6) show that refined productimports were about 1.4 mbd higher than year-to-date 2005, suggesting a continued flow of this fuel.As the IEA's Mandil points out, it remains to be seen how U.S. gasoline and distillate stocks holdup as the oil industry recovers from the hurricane damage.", "Loans of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve were granted to seven companiestotaling roughly 13.2 million barrels.

Total stocks have declined at a rate of about 750,000bd. How these figures might be interpreted is a matter of some debate -- the obvious facts are thatthey have declined, and that there is some level below which spot shortages and distributionalproblems begin to appear. Prior to March 2003, DOE's Weekly Petroleum Status Report referred tothis as the \"minimum operational inventory\" (MOI). Subsequent issues have dropped any referenceto MOI because of differing views within the industry regarding what the minimum level might be.Because of improvements and inventory management and logistics, industry had recommended usinglower figures than DOE had previously been using.
