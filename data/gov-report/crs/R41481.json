Since the early 1950s, the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty commits the United States to help South Korea defend itself. Approximately 28,500 U.S. troops are based in the ROK, which is included under the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella.\" Washington and Seoul cooperate in addressing the challenges posed by North Korea. The two countries' economies are joined by the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). South Korea is the United States' seventh-largest trading partner and the United States is South Korea's second-largest trading partner (China is its first-largest). Political changes in both countries in 2017 along with North Korea's increasing military capabilities have produced strains in the relationship.", "Coordination of North Korea Policy", "Dealing with North Korea is the dominant bilateral strategic concern. The Trump Administration appears to have raised North Korea's nuclear and missile programs to a top U.S. foreign policy priority, and has adopted an approach of increasing pressure on Pyongyang in the hopes of convincing the North Korean regime \"to de-escalate and return to the path of dialogue.\" The Administration has emphasized pushing China, which accounts for around 90% of North Korea's trade, to do more to pressure North Korea. North Korea's two tests in July 2017 of long-range ballistic missiles, which some observers characterized as having intercontinental range, has heightened the U.S. sense of urgency over the North Korean issue.", "ROK President Moon Jae-in, elected in May 2017, has said he supports the continuation of sanctions against North Korea if it is aimed at bringing North Korea to the negotiating table. He also argued, however, against a \"sanctions-only\" approach toward North Korea. Instead, President Moon envisions denuclearization policy and low-level inter-Korean initiatives as complementary and in July 2017 proposed holding several inter-Korean dialogues. These initiatives appear to have caused some tension in U.S.-ROK relations, but North Korea's lack of a response to them and its continued missile testing appear to have ameliorated disagreements between Washington and Seoul, at least temporarily.", "The U.S.-ROK Alliance", "Since 2009, the United States and South Korea have accelerated steps to reform their alliance, including the relocation of U.S. troops on the Korean Peninsula and boosting ROK defense capabilities. Provocations from North Korea have propelled more integrated bilateral contingency planning, for instance by adopting policies to respond more swiftly and forcefully to attacks and by deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system in South Korea. China has protested the THAAD deployment and appears to have taken retaliatory measures against ROK companies and economic interests. President Moon at first delayed finishing the deployment but then reversed himself after North Korea's July 29, 2017, long-range missile test. According to U.S. military officials, South Korea pays roughly half of the nonpersonnel costs of stationing U.S. troops in South Korea. Many analysts think that the Trump Administration will demand that South Korea increase its cost-sharing payments.", "Bilateral Economic Relations", "The KORUS FTA has been the centerpiece of U.S.-Korea trade and investment relations since its entry into force in 2012, but views on KORUS FTA's economic outcomes are mixed. Most U.S. business groups highlight market access improvements and a more robust mechanism for dispute resolution, but others have raised concerns over implementation, for example with respect to specific issues such as country-of-origin verifications. The Trump Administration has repeatedly criticized the agreement, focusing on the growth in the bilateral trade deficit since its entry into force, and has called for modifications. Following a U.S. request, the two nations are expected to convene a special committee under the KORUS FTA to discuss the agreement and possible changes. The scope of these discussions remains unclear but may be limited to date, as the Administration has yet to officially notify Congress of its intent to negotiate with South Korea, a requirement for any trade agreement negotiation to receive expedited legislative consideration."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T his report contains two main parts: a section describing recent events and a longer background section on key elements of the U.S.-South Korea relationship.

Cemented by strong relationships with two successive conservative governments in Seoul, U.S.-South Korea cooperation on North Korea policy was particularly close, and the two countries effectively managed the alliance in the face of a changing threat from Pyongyang. ", "Under the administrations of Donald Trump and Moon Jae-in, who was elected in May 2017, core elements of the U.S.-ROK military alliance appear likely to endure, though a major diplomatic or military shock to the region could reshape some longstanding security commitments. President Trump, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have reiterated the United States' \"ironclad commitment to defend the ROK.\" Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson visited South Korea in February and March 2017, respectively, soon after their confirmations by the Senate. For his part, President Moon has called the alliance \"the most important foundation for our diplomacy and national security.\" During a two-day summit meeting between the presidents in Washington, DC, in June 2017, the two governments issued a joint statement that emphasized the overlap in their approaches to North Korea. ", "North Korea's escalation of provocations, and particularly its two tests in July 2017 of long-range ballistic missiles, which some observers characterized as having intercontinental range, have driven closer security cooperation in recent weeks. In response to the missile tests, the United States and South Korea conducted nonroutine joint military exercises, the Moon government reversed its decision to delay the full deployment of a U.S. missile defense battery, and the two allies opened discussions about amending existing missile guidelines that limit South Korea to developing ballistic missiles with ranges greater than 800km (about 500 miles) and warheads of 500kg (about 1,100 lbs). On certain issues, however, the Trump and Moon Administrations have signaled significant policy differences that could become contentious. On North Korea, during July 2017 the two sides sometimes appeared to be out of sync, with the Trump Administration and Congress intensifying pressure against Pyongyang while the Moon government proposed multiple initiatives for inter-Korean dialogue, moves that are in keeping with Moon's history as a champion of using engagement to change North Korea's behavior. Although President Moon has said that he and President Trump agreed they \"have no intention to attack North Korea,\" Administration officials openly have mentioned the possibility of a preemptive military strike on North Korea.", "On trade, the Trump Administration has given U.S. trade deficit with South Korea a more prominent place on the bilateral agenda. Most notably, in July 2017, the Administration requested opening discussions on issues of concern in the Korea\u2013U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). Additionally, many analysts think that cost-sharing for defense will become an issue of greater friction than in the recent past, with the Trump Administration demanding more from South Korea. U.S. pressure on South Korea to increase defense spending could come during negotiations over renewing the cost-sharing Special Measures Agreement (SMA) that are due to begin in early 2018. President Trump has said that all U.S. allies, including those in the Pacific, must \"pay their fair share of the cost,\" without specifying to which countries or which costs he was specifically referring. In remarks, the President has linked these trade and security issues, stating \"South Korea, we protect, but we're losing $40 billion a year with South Korea on trade.\" ", "Additionally, as discussed below, the process of bilateral policy coordination appears to potentially have become more difficult since the advent of the Trump and Moon administrations. Although the two sides appear to be engaging in prior notification of one another's policy positions on matters such as North Korea, security policy, and trade, developments in June and July 2017 raise questions about whether the two are engaging in the type of prior consultation that from 2009 to 2016 resulted in forming joint positions on many issues. These dynamic could be particularly important on North Korea policy. While not contradictory per se , U.S. and South Korean approaches to North Korea differ. Without greater coordination on substance, timing, sequencing, and public messaging, these differences could be amplified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Following Impeachment, South Korea Elects a New President", "paragraphs": ["On May 9, 2017, South Korea elected the Minjoo (Democratic) Party's Moon as president. Moon captured just over 41% of the vote in what was essentially a five-person race. Turnout was over 77%, the highest since the 1990s. Domestic economic issues\u2014particularly boosting economic growth and promoting social welfare\u2014and political reform appear to have been the most important issues in voters' minds. The presidential election occurred approximately seven months earlier than originally scheduled. In March 2017 South Korea's Constitutional Court voted to uphold the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. ", "President Moon, who narrowly lost to Park in South Korea's 2012 presidential election, is a former human rights lawyer and former chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun, who was president from 2003 to 2008. Roh championed carving out greater independence from the United States and pursued a policy of largely unconditional engagement with North Korea. Moon promoted many of the same causes in the 2012 campaign, and during the 2017 campaign he championed policies that could be summarized as \"South Korea in charge\"; he advocates South Korea assuming a leading role in North Korea policy and has called for boosting South Korea's \"independent defense posture\" by increasing military spending. However, unlike his mentor Roh Moo-hyun, Moon also has emphasized the importance of the ROK-U.S. alliance and has articulated a need for conditions to be placed on at least some of Seoul's engagement initiatives with North Korea. Through the end of July, Moon's public approval ratings in one poll have hovered in the 75%-85% range.

The two leaders issued a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to the U.S.-South Korea alliance and creating new and/or upgrading existing alliance coordination institutions. On North Korea, the statement said that the two sides shared the same goal and overall approach. In the statement, President Moon backed the Trump Administration's \"maximum pressure\" approach to Pyongyang, while President Trump supported President Moon's belief that South Korea should take a \"leading role\" in \"fostering an environment for peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula,\" including Seoul's desire to restart humanitarian and other forms of dialogue with North Korea. The joint statement said comparatively little on trade. In public and private settings, however, President Trump repeatedly placed heavy emphasis on trade issues in general and on the need to renegotiate parts of the KORUS FTA to reduce the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with South Korea. The joint statement did not mention the KORUS FTA, which raises questions about the degree to which this and future statements fully reflect U.S. government positions and the content of bilateral discussions, particularly regarding policies with little bilateral consensus. To the surprise of many observers, the controversy over President Moon's early plan to delay the full deployment of a U.S. missile defense battery in South Korea was not mentioned publicly, perhaps indicating that the two sides came to an understanding before or during the summit. President Trump said he would visit South Korea later in 2017.", "During his trip to the United States, President Moon met with Members of Congress and visited the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, VA. At the museum, he laid a wreath at a memorial commemorating the Korean War battle at the Chosin (Jangjin) Reservoir, where over 10,000 U.S. troops were killed or wounded. The Chosin Reservoir battle delayed a North Korean and Chinese advance long enough to allow U.S. forces to rescue and transport to South Korea tens of thousands of refugees, including President Moon's parents.", "Presidents Trump and Moon met again during the July 2017 Group of 20 (G-20) summit in Hamburg, including during a trilateral U.S.-South Korea-Japan summit that included Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The three leaders pledged to work together \"to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner,\" and to \"continue to cooperate to apply maximum pressure on the DPRK to change its path, refrain from provocative and threatening actions, and take steps necessary to return to serious denuclearization dialogue.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "North Korea Policy Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Dealing with North Korea (officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK) is the dominant strategic element of the U.S.-South Korean relationship. From 2009 to 2016, Seoul and Washington maintained tight coordination over North Korea policy, following a joint approach\u2014often called \"strategic patience\"\u2014that emphasized pressuring the regime through expanded multilateral sanctions and muscular displays of military cooperation. ", "In the June 2017 joint statement, the two countries stated that they shared a goal of \"complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization\" of the Korean Peninsula and that they would \"coordinate closely\" by creating a \"high-level strategic consultation mechanism\" to achieve this goal. The joint statement outlined the ways the two governments' approaches toward North Korea overlap, presenting them as a common approach of applying \"maximum pressure on the DPRK\" to \"compel Pyongyang to cease its provocative actions and return to sincere and constructive talks.\" \"Maximum pressure\" is a phrase that many Trump Administration officials have used to describe their policy toward Pyongyang. In the statement, the two agreed that \"the door to dialogue with the DPRK remains open under the right circumstances.\" In two items that the Moon government highlighted after the summit, President Trump \"supported\" South Korea's \"leading role\" in \"fostering an environment for peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula,\" and \"expressed support\" for President Moon's \"aspiration to restart inter-Korean dialogue on issues, including humanitarian affairs.\"", "Despite such language, challenges may arise in future policy coordination efforts because of differing interpretations of the joint statement, particularly what constitutes \"the right circumstances\" for opening dialogue on security issues with North Korea.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Trump Administration's North Korea Policy", "paragraphs": ["Shortly after coming into office, the Trump Administration initiated a review of U.S. North Korea policy. In April 2017, the State Department, Pentagon, and Director of National Intelligence issued a statement that the United States will seek to \"pressure North Korea into dismantling its nuclear, ballistic missile, and proliferation programs by tightening economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures with our Allies and regional partners.\" Since then, the Administration has moved to implement U.S. sanctions against North Korea more aggressively, including by designating Chinese financial entities and asking other countries to curtail their economic interactions with Pyongyang. The Administration has stated that it hopes that pressure will convince the North Korean regime \"to de-escalate and return to the path of dialogue.\" Secretary of State Tillerson has said that dialogue would be held only \"with an understanding that a condition of those talks is there is no future where North Korea holds nuclear weapons or the ability to deliver those nuclear weapons....\"", "Secretary of State Tillerson has said that the Administration is seeking neither a change in nor a collapse of the governing regime of Kim Jong-un. The Administration has cast its approach as a departure from the Obama Administration's \"strategic patience.\" However, many of the elements remain: expanding U.S. and international sanctions, emphasizing China's ability to pressure North Korea, and coordinating policy with U.S. allies. Three key changes appear to be that (1) the Trump Administration has raised the priority level of the North Korea threat; (2) the timeframe for U.S. action has been accelerated; and (3) President Trump has explicitly stated that his administration is willing to calibrate other areas of U.S.-China relations according to China's degree of cooperation on North Korea. ", "North Korea's actions since President Trump's inauguration have helped to heighten the sense of urgency surrounding North Korea's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs. During the first 7 months of 2017, North Korea conducted nearly 20 ballistic missile tests, in contravention of UNSC resolutions. Following North Korea's two tests in July 2017 of what it and other observers described as ICBMs, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reportedly concluded that Pyongyang will be able to deploy a nuclear-tipped ICBM in 2018, achieving a milestone years earlier than predicted. Also during the summer of 2017, Congress passed and President Trump signed into law H.R. 3364 / P.L. 115-44 , the Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act, which strengthens the use of sanctions on those who facilitate North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs.", "In addition to these tests, Pyongyang initiated other moves in 2017 that led President Trump to label it \"a reckless and brutal regime\" that has \"no respect for human life.\" In March, North Korea was accused of sending attackers to assassinate Kim Jong-un's half-brother in Malaysia using the banned chemical VX nerve agent. In June, North Korea released Otto Warmbier, a U.S. college student who had been detained in North Korea for 17 months; Warmbier returned to the United States in a coma, having suffered brain trauma while detained in North Korean, and died just days later. Securing Warmbier's release required multiple interactions between U.S. and North Korean diplomats, including a trip to North Korea by Joe Yun, U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Policy and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Korea and Japan.", "Thus far, the Administration has emphasized pushing China, which accounts for around 90% of North Korea's trade, to fully implement United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions and take other steps to pressure North Korea. President Trump has repeatedly emphasized his intention to make China use its leverage to pressure North Korea, but has at times also suggested that he is no longer relying on or confident in Beijing's ability to pressure Pyongyang. In late June 2017, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a preliminary rule that U.S. financial institutions be prohibited from maintaining correspondent accounts for, or on behalf of, a Chinese financial institution, the Bank of Dandong. FinCEN determined that the bank \"acts as a conduit\" for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems for entities involved in North Korea's programs to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missile capabilities. The same day, Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated a Chinese shipping company and two Chinese nationals for economic sanctions, charging them with assisting North Korea in evading international sanctions. The same week, the Trump Administration announced the approval of an arms sales package to Taiwan.", "Some U.S. and South Korean commentators have characterized Administration officials' remarks on North Korea in March and April as inconsistent, particularly on the questions of under what specific pre-conditions, if any, the United States would insist on before entering formal negotiations with North Korea and whether the United States is prepared to launch a preemptive attack against North Korea. Some South Koreans have been alarmed by President Trump's remarks about the chances of a \"major, major [military] conflict with North Korea.\" In July 2017, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford said ", "Many people have talked about military options as ... \"unimaginable.\" But ... it is not unimaginable to have military options to respond to North Korean nuclear capability. What's unimaginable to me is allowing a capability that will allow a nuclear weapon to land in Denver, Colorado ... ideally we will denuclearize the North Korean\u2014the Korean Peninsula with economic and political means. But in the meantime, I can assure the American people that our job is to develop military options in the event that that fails.", "However, the Administration also has given signals of a readiness to talk to North Korea. The President has said that he would be \"honored\" to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, calling Kim a \"smart cookie.\" In March 2017, the Administration reportedly approved visa requests for a group of North Korean officials to travel to the United States to hold discussions with U.S. scholars and former U.S. officials, only to reverse its decision later the same day after learning of North Korea's use of VX to kill Kim Jong-un's brother in Malaysia. Whether the apparent inconsistency is unintended or deliberate remains unclear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Moon Administration's North Korea Policy", "paragraphs": ["For nearly two decades, President Moon has been associated with efforts to promote inter-Korean engagement and dialogue. He served as chief of staff to former President Roh Moo-hyun (2003-2008), who carried out many initiatives under Seoul's \"sunshine policy\" that involved significant South Korean investments in North Korea. President Moon has argued against what many critics called the Park-Obama \"sanctions-only\" approach toward North Korea. Early in the 2017 election campaign, he pledged to visit North Korea as president, as well as to reopen and expand the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), an inter-Korean industrial park located in North Korea that former President Park shut down in 2016 to increase pressure on Pyongyang. ", "In the weeks initially following his election President Moon has emphasized repeatedly the overlap between his approach and that of the Trump Administration. \"As long as North Korea continues its provocations, I believe that we will have no choice but to apply additional and strong pressure on it.\" President Moon, however, has argued that his immediate predecessors placed too little emphasis on engaging North Korea. \"To resolve the issue, we have to add dialogue to the current menu of sanctions and pressure\" under the right conditions, an element he says is consistent with the Trump Administration's approach. The essence of his approach appears to be that denuclearization policy\u2014including sanctions\u2014and low-level inter-Korean initiatives\u2014such as humanitarian assistance\u2014are complementary and for the time-being should operate on parallel tracks. ", "Differences in emphasis between Washington and Seoul surfaced in the weeks immediately following the first Trump-Moon summit. Acting on the understanding that the Trump Administration has signaled its agreement with his government's approach, President Moon in a July speech in Berlin said he \"is ready\" to meet with Kim Jong-un \"at any time at any place, if the conditions are met and if it will provide an opportunity to transform the tension and confrontation on the Korean Peninsula.\" His government has lifted restrictions on South Korean nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) contacting North Korea. Moon also has proposed holding two dialogues with North Korea: one to discuss holding a round of reunions of families separated by the Korean War, and another to discuss military tension-reduction and confidence-building measures in the demilitarized zone (DMZ). As of August 2, North Korea publicly has dismissed Moon's proposals.", "Asked about South Korea's proposals, then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, \"President [Trump] has made clear in the past with respect that any type of conditions that would have to be met are clearly far away from where we are now.\" A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson reportedly commented, \"this is not the time for talks, but to apply pressure.\" These responses could indicate that the United States, South Korea, and Japan are not fully coordinating their messages about North Korea policy. Some observers go further, arguing that it indicates South Korea's views about the timing and nature of when to propose talks with North Korea conflict with the views of the United States and Japan. ", "Assessments that North Korea can reach the United States with its long-range missiles have heated up the continuing debate in South Korea over whether the country should build its own nuclear weapons rather than depending on the U.S. nuclear \"umbrella.\" South Korean Minister of Defense Song Yong-moo said that South Korea was not considering acquiring its own nuclear weapons but was reviewing the possibility of building nuclear-powered submarines. Producing nuclear fuel for such submarines would require negotiations with the United States.

The deployment, which a Ministry of National Defense spokesman said was \"temporary,\" reversed Seoul's July 28 decision to delay a full deployment until a full-scale environmental impact assessment could be completed, a process that was expected to take months. In May 2017, in one of his first major moves after entering office, Moon had temporarily suspended the installation of four launchers in the six-launcher batteries. The other two had been deployed in March, earlier than originally planned, a move that President Moon during the election campaign had called \"very regrettable.\" A series of North Korea missile launches in March 2017, along with South Korea's early presidential election in May, apparently accelerated the timetable of installing the THAAD battery, which had been scheduled for later in 2017. ", "Critics of the THAAD deployment, including those within the Moon Administration, have pointed to President Trump's statement in late April that South Korea should pay for the system as justification for investigating the previous president's decision to accept the U.S. system. Trump's National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, later said that the United States would pay for the $1 billion system in line with the initial agreement. Despite this assurance, Trump's statement appeared to increase suspicions among some South Koreans that the United States would eventually ask South Korea to cover the cost of the U.S. asset. The land for the THAAD system was provided by South Korea, but the United States is to pay for the system and its operation. According to press reports, estimated costs for the system range from $800 million to $1.6 billion. Among the South Korean critics of the THAAD deployment have been residents near the site. When the Park Administration announced in 2016 that the THAAD battery would be positioned in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, local residents protested. Among their concerns were health issues associated with THAAD's X-band radar. ", "The March 2017 announcement that THAAD was being deployed prompted a stern response from China, which warned that it would \"take the necessary steps to safeguard our own security interests, and the consequences will be shouldered by the United States and South Korea.\" Although specific retaliation measures were not announced, Chinese state media have encouraged Chinese consumers to boycott South Korean companies, tourism officials said that they would cease booking trips to South Korea by Chinese travelers, and Chinese officials have suspended operations at China-based retail stores of Lotte, citing violations of safety codes. Lotte had owned the land that is being used to host the THAAD battery until early 2017, when it transferred the property to the Korean government. During his March 2017 visit to Seoul, Secretary Tillerson said that China's \"economic retaliation against South Korea is inappropriate and troubling.\" In a May 2017 phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Moon reportedly said in order to settle differences over the deployment, North Korea needed to cease provocations, implicitly asking China to do more to rein in North Korea.

According to the FTA text, such a meeting must be convened within 30 days of the July 12, 2017, request. In a July 24 response, the South Korean Minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE) asked to delay this meeting to allow time to finish an ongoing \"restructuring,\" which includes establishing a Trade Office and new Minister for Trade within the existing Ministry. MOTIE also requested that the Joint Committee evaluate together the agreement's effects on bilateral trade and the concerns posed by the Trump Administration to arrive at a \"common understanding\" of the issues to be addressed. The Trump Administration has focused specifically on the growth in the bilateral U.S. trade deficit with South Korea over the five years the agreement has been in effect. Many economists suggest that other factors, not the KORUS FTA, have been the major drivers of the growth in the trade deficit during this period, including a relative slump in the South Korean economy, highlighted by declining South Korean imports from its major trade partners.", "The extent of possible KORUS FTA modifications to be discussed remains unclear at this point. Given its constitutional authority over U.S. trade policy, Congress would play an important role in the negotiation and consideration of any changes to the KORUS FTA. On July 17, the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate and House committees of jurisdiction on trade wrote to Ambassador Lighthizer to highlight congressional authorities regarding this process and expectations for consultation. The Trump Administration may intend to focus its initial discussions with South Korea on implementation issues or other aspects of the bilateral trade relationship not requiring specific amendments to the FTA text, as it has not sent Congress official notification of its intent to negotiate with South Korea. Such notification, as well as a listing of specific objectives, would be required under the most recent grant of Trade Promotion Authority, if the Administration seeks to have a renegotiated agreement considered by Congress under expedited legislative procedures. For example, the Administration notified Congress of its intent to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on May 18, 2017, before any official renegotiation talks were held among the parties of the agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contradictory Developments in South Korea-Japan Relations", "paragraphs": ["North Korea's provocations have provided South Korea and Japan with a strategic rationale to increase cooperation bilaterally, as well as trilaterally with the United States. Since early 2016, the three countries appear to have closely coordinated their responses to North Korea's nuclear tests and missile launches. In November 2016, Seoul and Tokyo concluded a General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), which the United States has welcomed because it could institutionalize trilateral defense cooperation. The two countries first negotiated a GSOMIA in 2012, only to have Seoul withdraw from the agreement at the last minute due to domestic opposition. President Moon's Minjoo party opposed the signing of the GSOMIA, but since assuming the presidency, Moon reportedly has upheld the agreement. ", "Although South Korea-Japan cooperation and U.S.-South Korea-Japan cooperation over North Korea policy appears to be continuing under Moon, tensions between Seoul and Tokyo may mount over historical issues. In South Korea, opposition has risen over a December 2015 agreement on how to resolve the \"comfort women\" issue, a euphemism that refers to the thousands of women who were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers during the 1930s and 1940s when Japan occupied Korea. Several prominent politicians, including President Moon, have called for the agreement to be renegotiated, a position that was one of the few areas of agreement among all five candidates in the May presidential election. In December 2016, South Korean activists erected a comfort woman statue facing the Japanese consulate in Busan, South Korea's second-largest city\u2014similar to a statue facing the Japanese embassy in Seoul. In response, Japan withdrew its ambassador for several weeks and suspended talks on reconstituting a bilateral currency swap agreement that had been allowed to expire during the previous downturn in relations. ", "In his first days in office, President Moon spoke with Prime Minister Abe by phone. Reportedly, the president told the prime minister that most South Koreans could not accept the comfort women agreement, but did not use the word \"renegotiation.\" He also reportedly said that efforts to overcome differences over historical issues should not interfere with the two countries' bilateral relations, particularly coordination over North Korea. In late July 2017, the Moon government created a task force to review the comfort women agreement. The nine-person group plans to announce its assessment by the end of 2017.", "A poor relationship between Seoul and Tokyo jeopardizes several important U.S. interests, including by making trilateral cooperation over North Korea policy more difficult and hampering the ability to respond effectively to China. Some policy analysts have called for the United States to become more directly involved in trying to improve relations between South Korea and Japan.

However, Washington and Seoul initially settled on a policy of interoperability rather than integration. Seoul was resistant to the concept of a regional integrated BMD system for several reasons: the desire, especially strong among progressive Koreans, for more strategic autonomy; a reluctance to irritate China, which had consistently voiced opposition to U.S. BMD deployments; and a disinclination to cooperate with Japan due to poor relations based on disputes over historical and territorial issues.", "South Korea has placed an emphasis on indigenous development of high-technology defense systems.

Reportedly, South Korean officials worried that their military was not fully prepared to cope with North Korean threats and that Pyongyang might interpret the Opcon transfer as a weakening of the alliance's deterrence. Some military experts expressed concern that turning over control would lead to the United States reducing its overall commitment to South Korean security. In October 2014, the United States and South Korea announced in a joint statement that the allies would take a \"conditions-based approach\" to the Opcon transfer and determine the appropriate timing based on South Korean military capabilities and the security environment on the Korean Peninsula.

However, despite increased cooperation, closeness, and interdependence between the South Korean and Japanese governments, people, and businesses over the past decade, mistrust on historical and territorial issues continues to linger. South Korea and Japan have competing claims to the small Dokdo/Takeshima islands in the Sea of Japan (called the East Sea by Koreans), and most South Koreans complain that Japan has not adequately acknowledged its history of aggression against Korea. For more than three generations beginning in the late 19 th century, Japan intervened directly in Korean affairs, culminating in the annexation of the Korean peninsula in 1910. Over the next 35 years, Imperial Japan all but attempted to subjugate Korean culture. Among the victims were tens of thousands of South Korean \"comfort women\" who during the 1930s and 1940s were recruited, many if not most by coercive measures, into providing sexual services for Japanese soldiers.

First, continued suspicions of Japan among the South Korean population place political limitations on how far and how fast Korean leaders can improve relations. Second, ongoing disagreements over Dokdo/Takeshima's sovereignty continue to weigh down the relationship. Third, unlike Japan, South Korea generally does not view China as an existential challenge and territorial threat. South Korea also needs Chinese cooperation on North Korea. Accordingly, South Korean leaders tend to be much more wary of taking steps that will alarm China. A factor that could change this calculation is if China is seen as enabling North Korean aggression and/or undermining South Korea's efforts to defend itself against the DPRK.

North Korea's growing dependence on China, which has accounted for over 60% of North Korea's trade with the world since 2011, has meant that South Korea must increasingly factor Beijing's actions and intentions into its North Korea policy. China's influence over North Korea has tended to manifest itself in a number of ways in Seoul. For instance, Chinese support or opposition could be decisive in shaping the outcome of South Korea's approaches to North Korea, both in the short term (such as handling sudden crises) and the long term (such as contemplating how to bring about reunification). For this reason, a key objective of the joint Park/Obama policy toward North Korea was trying to alter China's calculation of its own strategic interests so that they might be more closely aligned with Seoul and Washington rather than with Pyongyang. Additionally, many South Koreans worry that China's economy is pulling North Korea, particularly its northern provinces, into China's orbit. ", "On the other hand, China's continued support for North Korea, particularly its perceived backing of Pyongyang after the Yeonpyeong Island shelling in 2010, has angered many South Koreans, particularly conservatives. China's treatment of North Korean refugees, many of whom are forcibly repatriated to North Korea, has also become a bilateral irritant. Many South Korean conservatives also express concern that the Chinese have been unwilling to discuss plans for dealing with various contingencies involving instability in North Korea, though beginning in 2013 there were signs that Beijing had become more willing to engage in these discussions. Park Geun-hye called for establishing a trilateral strategic dialogue among South Korea, the United States, and China that presumably could discuss various situations involving North Korea.

For years, China has been the number one location for South Korean firms' foreign direct investment, and the two countries signed a bilateral FTA in 2015. Yet, even as China is an important source of South Korean economic growth, it also looms large as an economic competitor. Fears of increased competition with Chinese enterprises have been an important motivator for South Korea's push to negotiate a series of FTAs with other major trading partners around the globe.

In fall 2015, the South Korean defense minister and foreign minister made the first public comments by cabinet officials that were seen to be obliquely critical of China's actions in the South China Sea.

In 2016, the number of Chinese fishing vessels operating in waters claimed by the two Koreas, as well as in South Korea's undisputed exclusive economic zone (EEZ), reportedly increased dramatically from dozens of vessels to hundreds. South Korean fishermen blame a precipitous drop in South Korea's 2016 crab catch on the increase, and argue that the Chinese fishing boats use nonsustainable methods that damage spawning grounds. Moreover, by prompting increased patrols in the area by both Koreas, the expanded presence of Chinese fishing vessels increases the chances of an unintended collision or skirmish between South Korean and North Korean coast guard or naval vessels attempting to police the area, particularly around the Northern Limit Line (NLL) that South Korea says is the maritime boundary between the two Koreas.

Proponents argue that KORUS has enhanced competition and consumer choice in both countries, increased protection of U.S. intellectual property in South Korea, and improved the transparency of the South Korean regulatory process.

U.S. beef exports, for example, have increased from $649 million in 2011 to just over $1 billion in 2016, as the South Korean beef tariff has fallen from 40% to 24% and will continue declining to zero by 2026.

Despite increased exports in certain products, total U.S. exports to South Korea have not fluctuated much since 2011, while imports have grown by more than 20%, causing the overall trade deficit to increase. The bulk of this growth in the trade deficit stems from auto trade. U.S. goods imports from South Korea increased by about $13 billion from 2011 to 2016, with auto imports alone accounting for almost $9 billion of the increase ($12 billion to $21 billion). Under KORUS, the 2.5% U.S. car tariff remained in place until January 2016 at which time it was eliminated for most types of cars. Although both U.S. exports and imports of autos have roughly doubled over the period, U.S. exports increased from a much lower base.", "Attributing changes in trade flows (both U.S. exports and imports) to the KORUS FTA is difficult. Price changes due to tariff reductions are only one of a number of factors affecting trade. Other factors include fluctuations in the business cycle and growth rates, exchange rates, and the level of aggregate demand. In addition, some provisions of the agreement have yet to take effect and tariffs on certain products continue to phase out. In dollar terms, South Korean goods imports from each of its top three trading partners (China, Japan, and the United States) have declined or been flat since 2011, suggesting slower rates of economic growth in South Korea during that period played a significant role in South Korea's import patterns and hence the growth in the U.S. trade deficit. Using data from 2015, the U.S. International Trade Commission estimated that without the agreement in place, the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with South Korea would have been even larger.", "The Trump Administration has repeatedly criticized the KORUS FTA. In its 2017 Trade Agenda, the Administration noted that the rise in the U.S. trade deficit since the agreement's entry into force \"is not the outcome the American people expected from that agreement.\" Vice President Pence, during a visit to South Korea in April, raised concerns over the deficit and continued barriers in the South Korean market and spoke of reforming the KORUS FTA.

To date the Administration has not notified Congress of its intent to begin negotiations regarding the KORUS FTA. This may signal a limited scope for these Joint Committee talks.

The won 's depreciation during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, when it fell by nearly a third to around 1,500 won per dollar, helped to stimulate South Korea's economic recovery by making its exports cheaper relative to many other currencies, particularly the Japanese yen . A primary concern in more recent years, however, has been the devaluation of the Japanese yen. From mid-2012 to mid-2015 the Japanese yen depreciated against the dollar and the won by roughly 40%, though it has regained some of its value against both currencies since. The yen's devaluation has been in part caused by expansionary monetary policies in Japan, as part of Prime Minister Abe's focus on stimulating the Japanese economy. The yen's fall has boosted Japanese exports and proved politically unpopular with its trade partners, including the United States and South Korea.", "Over the years, South Korean exchange rate policies periodically have been a source of consternation in U.S.-South Korea relations, with some observers arguing that South Korea has artificially depressed the value of the won in order to gain a trade advantage by making its exports cheaper in other countries' markets.

The report still urges South Korea to limit its interventions and to be more transparent in its foreign exchange operations (South Korea does not publicly report its interventions in foreign exchange markets) . The report also found South Korea to satisfy two of the three criteria, established in the Trade Facilitation and Enforcement Act of 2015, for more intensive engagement on currency policy by the Treasury Department.

This cooperation includes commercial projects as well as research and development work on safety, safeguards, advanced nuclear reactors, and fuel cycle technologies. On June 15, 2015, the United States and the Republic of Korea signed a renewal of their civilian nuclear cooperation agreement, known as a \"123 agreement.\" The agreement provides the legal foundation for nuclear trade between the countries; it provides the legal foundation for export licensing. The new agreement's duration is 20 years, after which it automatically will renew for an additional five-year period unless either or both parties choose to withdraw. The two governments initialed the text of the agreement in April 2015. An agreement did not require an affirmative vote of approval from Congress. It entered into force on November 25, 2015, after a mandatory congressional review period. During her October 2015 visit to Washington, DC, former President Park described the civilian nuclear cooperation agreement as one of the three \"major institutional frameworks of our alliance,\" alongside the U.S.-South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty and the KORUS FTA. ", "The agreement provides for a new high-level bilateral commission (HLBC) where the two sides would review cooperation under the agreement. The HLBC held its most recent meeting in January 2017, in Washington, DC. The commission is to \"serve as a senior-level forum to facilitate strategic dialogue and technical exchanges on peaceful nuclear cooperation between the two countries.\" It provides a discussion forum about \"management of spent nuclear fuel, the promotion of nuclear exports and export control cooperation, assurances of nuclear fuel supply, and nuclear security.\" There are four working groups: spent fuel management, the promotion of nuclear exports and export control cooperation, assured fuel supply, and nuclear security. The HLBC meeting was co-chaired by U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and Second Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ambassador Ahn Chong-ghee.", "Both countries have called the new 123 agreement a success. South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-Se said that the agreement was \"future-oriented\" and would facilitate \"modern and mutually beneficial cooperation.\" Former U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz said that the agreement would solidify the alliance and would \"enable expanded cooperation between our respective nuclear industries, and reaffirm our two governments' shared commitment to nonproliferation.\" ", "The future of fuel cycle technology in South Korea was a contentious issue during the negotiation of the new Section 123 agreement. The United States has a long-term nonproliferation policy of discouraging the spread of fuel cycle (enrichment and reprocessing) technology to new states. This is because enrichment and reprocessing can create new fuel or material for nuclear weapons. Many South Korean officials and politicians see U.S. policy as limiting South Korea's national sovereignty by requiring U.S. permission (as required under U.S. law) for the use of U.S.-obligated fuel in certain sensitive civilian nuclear activities. The two countries resolved earlier disagreements over these issues. According to a State Department Fact Sheet, the agreement requires \"express reciprocal consent rights over any retransfers or subsequent reprocessing or enrichment of material subject to the agreement.\" However, the agreement does give South Korea advance permission to ship U.S.-obligated spent fuel overseas for reprocessing into mixed-oxide fuel. There are no current plans to do so, but South Korea may consider this option in developing a strategy for managing its growing spent fuel stocks. The agreement allows for enrichment up to 20% of fissile uranium-235 in South Korea, after consultation through the bilateral commission and further written agreement by the United States. This provision was not part of the previous agreement. South Korea does not have an enrichment capability, but was seeking language in the new agreement that would open the door to that possibility. Enrichment at low levels can be used for nuclear fuel. The agreement also includes U.S. fuel supply assurances.", "For decades, the United States and South Korea have worked on joint research and development projects to address spent fuel. In the 1990s, the two countries worked intensely on research and development on a different fuel recycling technology (the \"DUPIC\" process), but this technology ultimately was not commercialized. In the past decade, joint research has centered on pyroprocessing. The Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) is conducting a laboratory-scale research program on reprocessing spent fuel with an advanced pyroprocessing technique. U.S.-South Korean bilateral research on pyroprocessing began in 2002 under the Department of Energy's International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (I-NERI). R&D work on pyroprocessing was temporarily halted by the United States in 2008, due to the proliferation sensitivity of the technology. In an attempt to find common ground and continue bilateral research, in October 2010 the United States and South Korea began a 10-year Joint Fuel Cycle Study on the economics, technical feasibility, and nonproliferation implications of spent fuel disposition, including pyroprocessing. In July 2013, a new agreement on R&D technology transfer for joint pyroprocessing work in the United States took effect as part of the Joint Fuel Cycle Study.", "Spent fuel disposal is a key policy issue for South Korean officials, and some see pyroprocessing as a potential solution. While South Korean reactor-site spent fuel pools are filling up, the construction of new spent fuel storage facilities is highly unpopular with the public. Some officials argue that in order to secure public approval for an interim storage site, the government needs to provide a long-term plan for the spent fuel. However, some experts point out that by-products of spent fuel reprocessing would still require long-term storage and disposal options. Other proponents of pyroprocessing see it as a way to advance energy independence for South Korea. ", "While some in the Korean nuclear research community have argued for development of pyroprocessing technology, the level of consensus over the pyroprocessing option among Korean government agencies, private sector/electric utilities, and the public remains uncertain. Generally, there appears to be support in South Korea for research and development, but some analysts are concerned about the economic and technical viability of commercializing the technology. While the R&D phase would be paid for by the government, the private sector would bear the costs of commercialization. At a political level, pyroprocessing may have more popularity as a symbol of South Korean technical advancement and the possibility of energy independence. However, other public voices are concerned about safety issues related to nuclear energy as a whole. Others see fuel cycle capabilities as part of a long-term nuclear reactor export strategy, envisioning that South Korea could have the independent ability to provide fuel and take back waste from new nuclear power countries in order to increase its competitive edge when seeking power plant export contracts.", "Some analysts critical of the development of pyroprocessing in South Korea point to the 1992 Joint Declaration, in which North and South Korea agreed they would not \"possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities\" and are concerned about the impact of South Korea's pyroprocessing on negotiations with the North. Some observers, particularly in South Korea, point out that the United States has given India and Japan consent to reprocess, and argue that they should be allowed to develop this technology under safeguards. Since the technology has not been commercialized anywhere in the world, the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are working with the South Korean government to develop appropriate IAEA safeguards should the technology be developed further.

An Additional Protocol (AP) to South Korea's safeguards agreement entered into force as of February 2004. The AP gives the IAEA increased monitoring authority over the peaceful use of nuclear technology. In the process of preparing a more complete declaration of nuclear activities in the country, the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) disclosed previously undeclared experiments in its research laboratories on uranium enrichment in 2000, and on plutonium extraction in 1982. The IAEA Director General reported on these undeclared activities to the Board of Governors in September 2004, but the Board did not report them to the U.N. Security Council. In response, the Korean government reconfirmed its cooperation with the IAEA and commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and reorganized the oversight of activities at KAERI. The experiments reminded the international community of South Korea's plans for a plutonium-based nuclear weapons program in the early 1970s under President Park Chung Hee, the father of the current President Park. At that time, deals to acquire reprocessing and other facilities were canceled under intense U.S. pressure, and Park Chung Hee eventually abandoned weapons plans in exchange for U.S. security assurances. The original motivations for obtaining fuel cycle facilities as well as the undeclared experiments continue to cast a shadow over South Korea's long-held pursuit of the full fuel cycle. As a result, since 2004, South Korea has aimed to improve transparency of its nuclear programs and participate fully in the global nonproliferation regime. In addition, the 1992 Joint Declaration between North and South Korea says that the countries \"shall not possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities.\" Since North Korea has openly pursued both of these technologies, some debate whether South Korea should still be bound by those commitments. Some analysts are concerned that a denuclearization agreement with North Korea could be jeopardized if South Korea does not uphold the 1992 agreement.
