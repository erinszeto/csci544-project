Most of the satellites they carried into orbit were owned by U.S. or foreign government agencies. Now, commercial payloads are generally launched by private providers, and the payloads themselves are increasingly likely to be owned by private entities: Of the 576 U.S.-owned satellites currently in orbit, 286 were launched for commercial reasons and another 12 on behalf of academic users.

The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 states the following:", "[T]he United States should encourage private sector launches, reentries, and associated services and, only to the extent necessary, regulate those launches, reentries, and services to ensure compliance with international obligations of the United States and to protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States .", "That law was amended in 2004 to provide that \"the regulatory standards governing human space flight ... evolve as the industry matures so that regulations neither stifle technology development nor expose crew or space flight participants to avoidable risks as the public comes to expect greater safety for crew and space flight participants from the industry.\"", "National security agencies have emphasized the importance of the commercial space industry, in particular the space industrial base. To foster its growth, the commercial space industry has purposely been insulated from some types of federal regulation often applied to other industries. For example, the Commercial Space Launch Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations affecting the design and operation of launch vehicles only to protect the safety of crew, thereby giving launch vehicle manufacturers and operators wide leeway in developing new rockets.

Typically, the firms that provide commercial launch services also design and assemble the rockets they launch. The payloads, such as satellites and manned space capsules, are manufactured by other firms. Service providers (such as television broadcasters) may design and build their own satellites, or purchase them from third-party manufacturers.

Satellites are custom-made for their users, using specialized parts, which require extensive testing to ensure they will operate in a space environment where replacement and repair are generally not options. Because there are a limited number of rocket launches each year, supply chain deadlines are governed by a satellite launch window; if that window is missed because of production or regulatory delays, it may be many months or even years before another launch vehicle will be available to carry the satellite into orbit. Minimizing the mass and physical dimensions of a satellite is critically important, because heavier or bigger satellites are likely to require larger, more costly launch rockets. Appendix A shows a range of existing satellites, their weight, and corresponding familiar objects that approximate the same mass.", "The United States is the largest manufacturer of spacecraft, followed by the European Union and Russia. The global commercial satellite manufacturing sector, with $6 billion in revenues in 2015, attempted 86 launches carrying 262 spacecraft. Of these, 126 were satellites weighing less than 22 pounds (10 kilograms). The growing use of these smaller satellites has led to a doubling in the number of satellites launched. However, smaller satellites comprise a tiny portion of the mass of vehicles sent into space: Of 392 tons of satellites launched in 2015, the total weight of satellites under 22 pounds was barely half a ton.", "Regardless of their size and type, satellites generally utilize similar types of components and instruments ( Figure 1 ), including the following:", "S olar panels generate electricity that is stored in onboard rechargeable batteries . A propulsion tank adjusts altitude and orbit control and assists in placing the satellite into final orbit; several thrusters assist with these maneuvers and may be used later to move the satellite into a new orbit or, when the satellite's useful life is over, into a \"graveyard\" orbit farther away from Earth. T hermal control is the skin that prevents damage to the internal components in the extreme temperatures of space. Satellites pass through a wide range of temperatures, ranging from about -300\u00b0F to +200\u00b0F. Certain components, such as batteries, have an optimum operational range of about +50\u00b0F to +85\u00b0F. The skin is composed of a multilayer thermal blanket made of lightweight reflective films. In addition, a coated or mirrored optical solar reflector may be used, which acts like a radiator to keep the components from overheating due to solar energy and radiation. An electronics system controls satellite functions, such as flight operations, the direction in which the satellite points, and mathematical analysis. A communications system includes a transmitter, a receiver, antenna e that send data to and receive instructions from ground stations, and an amplifier that produces high-power radio frequency signals. Specialized components are determined by the core mission of the satellite. For example, a remote sensing satellite might include an image sensor, a telescope, and a digital camera.", "Satellites are placed into different types of Earth orbits depending on their planned use: low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous Earth orbit, and high Earth orbit ( Figure 2 ). The altitude of the orbit determines how frequently the spacecraft orbits the Earth. Some types of space activities require closer proximity to Earth for supply and maintenance and to provide higher-resolution images of Earth. Others operate farther in space to more effectively deploy their services. The International Space Station (ISS), for example, is in low Earth orbit, taking 90 minutes for a full orbit, while a television or weather satellite in geosynchronous orbit will take a full day. A satellite in geosynchronous orbit matches the Earth's rotational speed, so unlike other types of satellites, it will remain in the same place above the Earth and can therefore provide the same locations with weather monitoring or telecommunications.", "At the end of June 2016, 1,419 satellites were in operation, with 55% in low Earth orbit, 36% in geosynchronous orbit, 7% in middle Earth orbit, and the remainder in high Earth orbit.

California, Florida, and Texas each have two licensed spaceports. Additional launch sites have been proposed in other states. ", "Spaceports are configured for specific uses. Some are planned only to launch large vertical rockets, while others hope to lure space tourism with facilities for winged launch vehicles.

", "The satellite industry expressed concern over sharing spectrum, particularly the 28 GHz band, contending that current satellite services could be undermined without a deeper understanding of how future 5G services will be used:", "[S]atellites are providing vital services to all Americans using spectrum bands above 24 GHz. Satellites \"distribute point-to-multipoint video and other high bandwidth services more efficiently and more cost effectively than any other technology.\" In addition, high-throughput satellites are bringing competitive broadband services to all of the United States. Satellites also provide advanced services to ships, aircrafts and motor vehicles.... Consideration of repurposing spectrum access from existing users with a supporting record would result in the loss of critical services to U.S. consumers, and to vital enterprise users such as first responders and the U.S. military.", "The FCC contends that its approach in its July 2016 ruling struck a balance between wireless services and satellite operations and that the spectrum sharing provided in the decision would \"ensure that diverse users\u2014including federal and non-federal, satellite and terrestrial, and fixed and mobile\u2014can co-exist and expand.\" The FCC also noted that there had been \"dueling studies\" from affected industries and said it would continue to study the issue and make adjustments if necessary.", "There has been congressional interest in the FCC's activities with regard to satellite spectrum. H.R. 4945 (114 th Congress) would direct the FCC to preserve primary electromagnetic access in the 27.5-28.35 GHz band for satellite operators. The FCC is also evaluating a proposal by Ligado Networks, a satellite-communications company developing a network to support 5G service, for sharing the 1675-1680 band with NOAA. DOC, the Air Force, and the Aerospace Industries Association have expressed concern that this sharing arrangement might interfere with GPS signals and the emergency response, homeland security, and aviation safety sectors that rely on them.", "Appendix A.
