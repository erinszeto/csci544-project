The tax revenues are deposited into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), from which Congress appropriates funds for most harbor dredging.", "In 1990, Congress increased the HMT rate from 4 cents per $100 of cargo value to 12.5 cents per $100 of cargo value in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( P.L. 101-508 ). In recent years, HMTF annual expenditures have remained relatively flat while HMT collections have increased due to rising import volume. Consequently, a large surplus in the HMTF has developed. The maritime industry seeks to enact a \"spending guarantee\" to spend down the surplus in the HMT. Some harbor channels are not being maintained at their authorized depth and width, which may in some cases require ships with the deepest drafts to \"light load\" or wait for high tide. Harbors primarily used by fishing vessels or recreational craft have also complained of insufficient maintenance dredging. Since spending from the HMTF requires an appropriation from Congress, spending more from the HMTF could reduce available funding for other Energy and Water Development activities under congressional budget caps.", "The Administration's FY2015 budget requested $915 million from the HMTF, leaving an estimated-end-of-year balance of more than $9.5 billion.

While the exact amount of total HMTF funding provided in P.L. 113-235 was not delineated, the House Appropriations Committee Report noted a significant increase in its recommended spending level compared to the Administration request, indicating that its funding for HMTF activities was more than $1.1 billion.

IWTF monies derive from a fuel tax on commercial vessels on designated waterways, plus investment interest on the balance. Since FY2007, there has been a looming shortfall in the IWTF. In recent years Congress has taken measures to ensure temporary solvency of the IWTF, either by appropriating federal funds beyond the aforementioned 50% federal requirement (FY2009 and FY2010), by limiting IWTF expenditures to the amount available under current-year fuel tax revenues (FY2011-FY2013), or by altering the IWTF cost-share requirements for individual projects (FY2014).", "In the past, multiple Administrations have proposed fees (e.g., lock user fees, congestion fees) that would have increased IWTF revenues. These fees have been opposed by users and rejected by Congress.

At the same time, other navigation construction and major rehabilitation work is expected to stall. Without a new source of revenue or some other change directed by Congress, the overall number of inland waterway construction projects is expected to remain limited. Changes to IWTF policies have historically been under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committees, but in recent years appropriators have expressed frustration with the lack of action on this issue.", "For FY2015, the Administration once again requested appropriations for IWTF projects that are below projected fuel tax revenues. The FY2015 Administration budget requested approximately $85 million in inland waterway spending from the IWTF, with an equal amount to be drawn from the General Fund of the Treasury. The Administration also assumed an additional $80 million in new revenues from an unspecified user fee, presumably separate from the current fuel tax. The majority of FY2015 requested IWTF funds ($80 million of the $85 million requested from the IWTF) was for the Olmsted Project. This approach of limited funding devoted mostly to the Olmsted Project was similar to the Administration's requests for FY2011-FY2014.

With these changes enacted, the House recommended significant funding from the IWTF for projects other than the Olmsted Project for the first time in several years. The House recommended $169 million for construction work on the Olmsted Project (15% from the IWTF) and $112 million for work on other projects (50% cost-shared with the IWTF), for a total of $281 million on all inland waterways construction.

These estimates have varied widely over the years by many billions of dollars. DOE typically estimates a range of costs, rather than a single dollar amount, to reflect uncertainties in the cleanup process. For example, final decisions have yet to be made at some sites to determine the actions that will be necessary to remediate contamination. Methods to dispose of vast quantities of wastes, and the scheduling of these actions, also could affect cleanup costs and time frames. The costs of long-term stewardship after the completion of cleanup also are excluded from the above cost estimates.

Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ) established the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) Fund to pay for the cleanup of three federal facilities that were used to enrich uranium for national defense and civilian purposes. Title X of P.L. 102-486 also authorized the reimbursement of uranium and thorium licensees for their costs of cleaning up contamination at sites that processed nuclear materials for national defense purposes at these federal facilities. The three federal uranium enrichment facilities are located near Paducah, KY; Piketon, OH (Portsmouth plant); and Oak Ridge, TN.", "P.L. 113-235 appropriated a total of $5.87 billion for these three accounts combined to fund the Office of Environmental Management in FY2015 after accounting for offsets and rescissions, an increase above both the President's request of $5.62 billion and the FY2014 enacted appropriations of $5.83 billion. As passed by the House, H.R. 4923 had proposed $5.63 billion for FY2015, and the Senate subcommittee draft bill had recommended $5.94 billion.

WIPP is the centralized geologic repository located in New Mexico that serves as the site for the permanent disposal of defense-related transuranic wastes generated at other DOE sites. Incidents in February 2014 at WIPP involving a fire resulting from a truck hauling accident inside the repository and a separate radiological release have resulted in the temporary closure of the facility and suspension in the receipt of new shipments of transuranic wastes from other sites. DOE has been investigating the nature of the incidents and issued a recovery plan on September 30, 2014, to resume the operation of WIPP. The plan outlines measures that are intended to allow the resumption of limited waste disposal operations sometime during the first quarter of calendar year 2016.", "P.L. 113-235 appropriated $320 million within the Defense Environmental Cleanup account for WIPP in FY2015, a $104 million increase above both the President's request and the FY2014 enacted appropriations of $216 million. The Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 83 noted that the increase is intended to \"fully support the WIPP recovery effort\" and directed DOE to include a separate accounting of all funds supporting the WIPP recovery plan in the President's FY2016 budget request. The Administration initially had formulated the President's FY2015 budget request prior to the timing of the incidents that resulted in the closure of the facility. The President's request therefore had not included any funds for the recovery effort when the Administration originally submitted it to Congress.", "As passed by the House, Section 310 of H.R. 4923 had proposed to transfer up to $120 million from accounts of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to the Defense Environmental Cleanup account of the Office of Environmental Management for WIPP. In its report on H.R. 4923 , the House Appropriations Committee had noted that these funds would have been intended for recovery efforts to re-open WIPP to receive waste shipments, and had expressed concern about the potential effects of the closure of WIPP on DOE's ability to meet cleanup commitments at other DOE sites where transuranic wastes are awaiting disposal. The funds available for this transfer would have been supplemental to the $236 million for WIPP that the House included within the Defense Environmental Cleanup account in H.R. 4923 . With these funds combined, the House bill would have provided up to $356 million for WIPP in FY2015.", "In its draft report, the Senate subcommittee also had commented on the incidents that have resulted in the closure of WIPP and the efforts of DOE to re-open the repository to receive transuranic wastes awaiting shipment from other sites. The subcommittee had expressed its concern about the lack of a detailed budget justification for the funding that would be needed to resume operations. The subcommittee had noted that it is \"prepared to fund necessary additional investigation and recovery operations at WIPP to ensure the safe rehabilitation and continuation of the facility\" and urged DOE to submit a detailed remediation plan \"so that resources are properly allocated.\" The Senate subcommittee bill would have provided $318 million for WIPP recovery efforts in FY2015 within the Defense Environmental Cleanup account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund", "paragraphs": ["The adequacy of the balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to finance the cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities also was an issue in the FY2015 appropriations debate.

As passed by the House, H.R. 4923 did not include any funding for this federal payment. Whether to reauthorize the payment has been a recurring issue, since Congress had ceased it in FY2012. The federal payment historically has been treated as an offset to the funding for the Office of Environmental Management because the payment does not become available to DOE until Congress subsequently appropriates it out of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund.", "The Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 83 noted that while the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund would resume in FY2015, no authority was provided to resume collections of assessments from nuclear utilities that once helped to finance the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. As the President had proposed, Section 310 of the Senate subcommittee bill would have reauthorized the collection of up to $200 million in assessments on nuclear utilities in FY2015 to generate additional revenues for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. As passed by the House, H.R. 4923 would not have reauthorized the collection of these assessments. The authority to collect the assessments expired in October 2007 under existing law.", "As authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, both federal payments and nuclear utility assessments originally financed the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. This sharing of liability was based on the premise that the federal government and the nuclear utilities benefited from services provided by federal uranium enrichment facilities and that both therefore should share the cleanup costs at these facilities. Nuclear utilities have asserted that they fulfilled their original obligations under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, the Obama Administration has observed that additional revenues eventually would be needed based on the remaining balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, compared to more recent estimates of cleanup costs.", "DOE last estimated in December 2010 that the balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D fund would be exhausted by FY2020 without additional revenues, leaving a shortfall of $11.8 billion to complete the cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities over the long term. If the fund were fully expended, DOE would remain responsible for the cleanup costs under existing law, subject to appropriations by Congress. In its draft report, the Senate subcommittee directed DOE to update its December 2010 report on the status of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, in accordance with Section 1805 of the Atomic Energy Act. The Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 83 directed DOE to provide a status report on the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund (including a general schedule of cleanup milestones and costs) to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees no later than 90 days after enactment.

Once the Corps completes the cleanup of a site under this program, it is responsible for the initial two years of operation and maintenance, after which time the site is transferred back to DOE's Office of Legacy Management for long-term stewardship.", "The Office of Legacy Management also manages the payment of pensions and retirement benefits of former contractor personnel who worked at DOE sites that do not have a continuing mission, among other supporting activities. The federal role in the management of these former contractor pensions and benefits stems from the long-term nature of the projects and the associated length of employment for the personnel who performed the work for DOE. These pensions and benefits are earned and accrued by contractor employees while in active employment at DOE sites and are payable after their employment ends.", "The Office of Legacy Management has been funded entirely within DOE's Other Defense Activities account since FY2009.

The FY2015 appropriation is $5 million less than the FY2014 enacted appropriations of $177 million. DOE had attributed the requested reduction mostly to more recent savings in pension and benefits costs. DOE also has established a performance target of lowering site long-term stewardship costs by at least 2% annually through cost-efficiencies while continuing to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. However, funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management may increase over time as cleanup is completed at additional sites that are transferred from the Office of Environmental Management and the FUSRAP program for long-term stewardship. The Office of Legacy Management will be responsible for the long-term stewardship of 96 sites in FY2015. DOE projects that the number of these sites will increase to a total of 129 by FY2020. ", "Estimating the long-term funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management is inherently challenging because of the lengthy time horizons that are involved. For example, actions may be necessary for many decades to operate and maintain cleanup remedies and monitor contaminant levels to ensure the effectiveness of the remedies over time. At sites where the cleanup entails the permanent containment of radioactive wastes, long-term stewardship may continue indefinitely because of the time needed for radioactive elements to decay to acceptable levels. Enforcement of land use restrictions or other institutional controls also may be necessary in perpetuity at sites that are not cleaned up for unrestricted use, in order to prevent potentially harmful exposures. These and other factors make it difficult to reliably estimate the financial liability of the United States for long-term stewardship of sites contaminated from the historic production of nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear energy research in the 20 th century."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Power Marketing Administrations139", "paragraphs": ["DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs)\u2014Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA)\u2014were established to sell the power generated by the dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers.
