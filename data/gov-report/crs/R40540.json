As a result of BAPCPA, administrative expenses generally cannot include either allowances or payments of inducements to remain with the debtor company if those inducements are transfers to an insider of the debtor or obligations incurred for the benefit of the insider. The Bankruptcy Code does establish standards under which such inducements may be allowed or paid. However, there is some question as to whether the standards can realistically be met within the context of a pending bankruptcy. To be allowed, the court must find, based on evidence in the record, that (1) the inducement \"is essential to retention of the person because the individual has a bona fide job offer from another business at the same or greater rate of compensation\" and (2) the person's services are \"essential to the survival of the business.\" In addition, the court must compare the amount of the inducement to other similar transfers or obligations to nonmanagement employees, for any purpose, within the same calendar year. To be allowed, the inducement to the insider may be no more than 10 times the mean of the nonmanagement transfers or obligations. In the case where there have been no similar transfers or obligations to nonmanagement employees within the calendar year, the amount of the insider's inducement must be no more than 25% of any similar transfer or obligation, for any purpose, benefiting the insider during the previous calendar year.", "Severance payments to insiders may be allowed as administrative expenses in a post-BAPCPA bankruptcy only if \"the payment is part of a program that is generally applicable to all full-time employees.\" Such a payment will not be allowed if it is more than 10 times the mean severance pay for nonmanagement employees during the same calendar year.
