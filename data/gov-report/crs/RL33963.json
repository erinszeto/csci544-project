The discussion covers the provisions enacted in federal law that govern the definition, calculation, and reporting requirements of these critical high school outcomes.

That analysis is followed by a description of the federal programs designed to help youth who have dropped out, or who are at risk of dropping out, in completing high school or an equivalency certificate program. Finally, the report discusses issues that may arise as Congress considers reauthorizing the laws that pertain to this topic.", "The United States has made great strides in secondary school participation during the last century. Yet more than one-quarter of first-year high school students do not receive their diploma in four years. By age 24, more than one in 10 still do not have a high school degree or its equivalent. During the 2003-2004 school year alone, nearly 5% of students dropped out of high school. In addition, dropout rates vary significantly by race/ethnicity and immigration status, with very high rates among Hispanics and new immigrants.", "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act, authorizes several dropout prevention programs and contains the main federal requirements that stipulate how graduation, completion, and dropout rates are to be calculated and reported. Additional dropout prevention programs are authorized in the Higher Education Act and the Workforce Investment Act. These programs may be categorized as having: (1) the primary purpose of helping students complete high school, (2) multiple purposes, at least one of which is targeted toward dropout recovery or dropout prevention, or (3) broad purposes not explicitly encompassing dropouts but whose funds may be used at local discretion to help students complete high school.", "Each of these acts is likely to be considered for reauthorization in the 110th Congress. Several issues may be debated as Congress considers reauthorizing some, and perhaps all, of the federal programs and provisions pertaining to high school graduation, completion, and dropouts. These issues include program coordination, targeting, and effectiveness; the quality and reporting of data required to assess high school outcomes; whether the federal effort should focus on \"at-risk\" students or \"out-of-school\" youth; and whether recently enacted testing and accountability requirements have the perverse effect of increasing high school dropout rates."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The United States has made great strides in secondary school participation during the last century.

In estimating the AFGR, NCES uses statistical averaging to stabilize the denominator\u2014that is, the number of enrolled students. According to NCES,", "The Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate provides an estimate of the percentage of high school students who graduate on time by dividing the number of graduates with regular diplomas by the size of the incoming freshman class 4 years earlier, expressed as a percent. The rate uses aggregate student enrollment data to estimate the size of an incoming freshman class and aggregate counts of the number of diplomas awarded 4 years later. The size of the incoming freshman class is estimated by summing the enrollment in eighth grade in one year, ninth grade for the next year, and tenth grade for the year after and then dividing by three.", "The counts of enrollments by grade and graduates for the AFGR are taken from the CCD subfile called the State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education . Graduates include those students who are reported as diploma recipients and do not include GED recipients except in states that have in-school GED programs that lead to a regular diploma. Although enrollments are reported by grade, some states report ungraded students. NCES adjusts for this by redistributing these students across grades in proportion to the graded enrollment of the state.", " Table 1 summarizes the four high school indicators described above. Each of these rates provides a different perspective on high school outcomes and applies to different policy issues. The Title I Graduation Rate mandated by the NCLBA is intended to be part of a larger school, LEA, and state accountability system. With no statutory requirement that this indicator be reported to ED or Congress, this rate is mainly intended to shed light on school performance and enhance public notification on the state and local level. The Event Dropout Rate has historically been NCES' best attempt at producing a national standard for measuring high school outcomes. Although data reporting has improved in recent years, this indicator continues to fall short of consistency and completeness. The CPS Completion Rate has long been the most straight-forward, consistent, nationwide estimate of the nation's educational attainment; however, it cannot (and was never intended to) be used for accountability purposes. Finally, the Average Freshman Graduation Rate is the recent culmination of a major undertaking by NCES (along with a body of expert researchers) to produce a national estimate of high school completion (like the CPS rate) using data derived from the local level (like the Event Dropout Rate) to produce an accountability-friendly indicator (like the Title I rate)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Published Indicators of High School Outcomes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Historic Rise in Educational Attainment", "paragraphs": ["As clearly seen in Figure 1 , the United States has achieved a dramatic increase in secondary school participation since the beginning of the twentieth century.

In its recommendations for ESEA reauthorization, the Aspen Commission on NCLB urged Congress to improve federal, state, and local dropout prevention coordination.

While this may seem to be a logical programmatic organization, others argue that this view of the dropout problem fails to recognize that youth do not cleanly move from being students to being dropouts.
