It is difficult (and some would consider it unwise) to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic as time goes forward, and other unforeseen events (such as technological breakthroughs) loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled. Hence, long-term cost projections are at best speculative, and should be viewed with attentive skepticism. The finer and more detailed the estimate presented, the greater the skepticism should be. In the words of the late Dr. Lincoln Moses, the first Administrator of the Energy Information Administration: \"There are no facts about the future.\"", "But if models cannot reliably predict the future, they can indicate the sensitivity of a program's provisions to varying economic, technological, and behavioral assumptions that may assist policymakers in designing a greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The various cases examined here do provide some important insights on the costs and benefits of H.R. 2454 and its many provisions.", "If enacted, the ultimate cost of H.R. 2454 would be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill. The allocation of allowance value under H.R. 2454 will determine who ultimately bears the cost of the program. The cases generally indicate that the availability of offsets (particularly international offsets) is potentially the key factor in determining the cost of H.R. 2454. The interplay between nuclear power, renewables, natural gas, and coal-fired capacity with carbon capture and storage technology among the cases emphasizes the need for a low-carbon source of electric generating capacity in the mid- to long-term. A considerable amount of low-carbon generation will have to be built under H.R. 2454 in order to meet the emission reduction requirement. Attempts to estimate household effects (or other fine-grained analyses) are fraught with numerous difficulties that reflect more on the philosophies and assumptions of the cases reviewed than on any credible future effect.", "Finally, H.R. 2454's climate-related environmental benefit should be considered in a global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort. When the United States and other developed countries ratified the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), they agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases. This global scope raises two issues for H.R. 2454: (1) whether the bill's greenhouse gas reduction program and other provisions would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely, and (2) whether the bill's reductions meet U.S. commitments to stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations under the UNFCCC, and whether those reductions occur in a timely fashion so that global concentrations are stabilized at an acceptable level."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As Congress continues the debate on an appropriate response to the climate change issue, multiple bills have been introduced that would require reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Most have to do with electricity price impacts and are discussed at an appropriate time later in the report. ", "Beyond specific caveats each of these analyses has, there are some more general caveats the reader should keep in mind when comparing them to each other: ", "First, the different studies analyze the impact of H.R. 2454 at different stages of its development. The NBCC/CRA analysis is of the bill as introduced in April 2009. The EPA analyses is of the bill as reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee in May 2009. The EIA, ACCF/NAM, and MIT analyses are of the bill as passed by the House. The version analyzed by the Heritage Foundation depends on the date of the WebMemo or other presentation of the results, although its allowance allocation scheme is generally based on a memorandum by Representatives Waxman and Markey dated May 14, 2009. Likewise, analyses by CBO reflect the legislative point in the debate where the analysis was done. At each stage of the legislative process, changes were made to the bill that affect the compliance costs and the distribution of allowance value. ", "Second, H.R. 2454 is a comprehensive energy and environmental bill (not just a cap-and-trade bill), and the studies differ in terms of the scope of their analyses . The NBCC analysis focuses on the cap-and-trade program (including bonus allowances for carbon capture and storage, and the impact of free allowance allocations on regional and U.S. welfare impacts) and the combined renewable energy and energy efficiency standard for electricity (RES) in Title I of the bill. The EPA analyses include these areas, along with State Energy and Environmental Development (SEED) accounts, and an explicit analysis of the allocation of allowances to trade-exposed, energy-intensive industries. The EIA analysis includes the cap-and-trade program, the combined energy efficiency and renewable energy standard for electricity, carbon capture and sequestration provisions, and various energy efficiency provisions (e.g., lighting standards). The Heritage Foundation study is limited to carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector; other sectors are not incorporated in their analysis. The ACCF-NAM analysis discusses the impact of H.R. 2454 in terms of the cap-and-trade provisions, renewable portfolio standards, energy efficiency standards, and supposed low-carbon fuel standards. The MIT analysis includes the combined renewable energy and energy efficiency standard for electricity in Title I along with the cap-and-trade provisions in Title III.", "Third, the studies examined in this report are published with different levels of documentation, making comparative analysis difficult. Each study's sponsor has selected features or impacts it is particularly interested in highlighting, and presentations of projections that emphasize those points. In order to increase the comparability of the various cases examined here, CRS has converted all publicly available data presented by the cases to 2005 dollars (where appropriate) and interpolated missing data where possible. Likewise, where studies have stated they used specific projections as a reference case (such as EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2009 projections), CRS has assumed those assumptions have not been altered except as specifically stated by the study. In some cases, the authors of the reports were contacted in order to clarify assumptions or results. Finally, CRS has attempted to present projections in the most comparable fashion possible .", "Fourth, a special note with respect to the RES is appropriate . As noted above, seven cases (EPA/ADAGE, EPA/IGEM, NBCC/CRA, EIA/NEMS,ACCF-NAM/NEMS, CBO, and MIT/EPPA) clearly included the RES in their analyses. EPA and CRA do not highlight any significant cost increases directly resulting from implementing RES, while EIA states that no additional costs are entailed by compliance with the RES as sufficient renewable energy is incorporated in the baseline. Likewise, CBO finds that the RES requirement is not binding. ACCF-NAM/NEMS only includes it as one reason for increasing energy prices. However, the MIT/EPPA case finds the RES raises household costs, particularly in early years when the RES is increasing rapidly. MIT found the effect moderates in later years, but the overall losses in the early years depress the level of savings and investment that continues to affect the economy in later years. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Major Cap-and-Trade Provisions of H.R. 245420", "paragraphs": ["As passed by the House, Title III of H.R. 2454 would amend the Clean Air Act to set up a cap-and-trade system that is designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from covered entities 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. Covered entities are phased into the program over a four-year period from 2012 to 2016. When the phase-in schedule is complete, the cap will apply to entities that account for 84.5% of U.S. total GHG emissions. By including other provisions contained in the legislation (e.g., a separate cap-and-trade program for hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)), the World Resources Institute (WRI) estimates that the overall potential net reductions in GHG emissions from the economy as a whole (as opposed to just covered entities) from H.R. 2454 could range from 28%-33% below 2005 levels in 2020 and 75%-81% in 2050.", "The market-based approach adopted by H.R. 2454 would establish an absolute cap on the emissions from covered sectors and would allow trading of emissions permits (\" allowances \") among covered and non-covered entities. The bill achieves its broad coverage through an upstream compliance mandate on petroleum, most fluorinated gas producers and importers, a downstream mandate on electric generators and industrial sources, and a midstream mandate on natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs). Generally, the emissions cap would limit greenhouse gas emissions from entities that produce or import more than 25,000 metric tons annually (carbon dioxide equivalent) of greenhouse gases (or produce or import products that when used will emit more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Emission Allowance Allocation", "paragraphs": ["If left unmitigated, any greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program (as well as a carbon tax alternative) would be regressive. In an attempt to mitigate this distributional problem, H.R. 2454 allocates a substantial percentage of the allowances available for the benefit of energy consumers and low-income households. In some cases, these allowances are allocated at no cost to entities such as LDCs, with the express purpose of mitigating energy cost increases; in other cases, such as low-income assistance, the allowances are auctioned by EPA and the proceeds distributed to eligible recipients. As the program proceeds, between 2026 and 2035, the energy cost relief, along with other free allocations are phased out in favor of more government auctioning with most of the proceeds returned to households on a per-capita basis. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for a summary of how emission allowances are distributed in 2016 and 2030, respectively.", "H.R. 2454 's allocation scheme also attempts to smooth the economy's transition to a less carbon-intensive future through free allowance allocations to energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries, merchant coal-fired electric generators, and petroleum refiners. Bonus allotments of allowances are allocated for emission reductions achieved by carbon capture and storage technology. Except for carbon capture and storage, these free allocations of allowances are phased out by the early to mid-2030s.", "Finally, H.R. 2454 's allocation scheme attempts to address greenhouse gas emissions by providing allowances to help prevent further tropical deforestation and to fund climate adaptation activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Price Control", "paragraphs": ["Because allowance prices can be volatile, cap-and-trade bills generally provide some mechanisms to address either potential price fluctuations, or allowance prices more generally. H.R. 2454 does not have a \"safety valve\"\u2014an alternative compliance option that permits covered entities to pay an excess emissions fee instead of reducing emissions. Instead, the legislation addresses cost control through five main mechanisms: (1) unlimited banking and limited borrowing, (2) a two-year compliance period, (3) a strategic reserve auction with a pool of allowances available at a minimum reserve price, (4) periodic auctions with a reserve price, and (5) broad limits on the use of offsets .", "With respect to allowance price volatility, the bill includes two design elements that may dampen volatility to some degree. First, the bill allows entities to borrow (without interest) allowances from the year immediately following the current year, effectively creating a rolling two-year compliance period. Second, EPA is directed to hold strategic reserve auctions. A strategic reserve of allowances borrowed from future years is auctioned off in the early years of the program. This increases the availability of allowances early, but maintains the overall emissions cap. The strategic reserve auction would include a reserve price: $28/allowance in 2012 that would increase annually in 2013 and 2014. Starting in 2015, the reserve price would be 60% above the 36-month rolling average allowance price.", "Regular auctions mandated by the bill also have a reserve price: $10 (in 2009 dollars) in 2012, increasing at 5% real annually. An auction reserve price would help create an allowance price floor, and may help dampen allowance price spikes. The auctions, along with the other mechanisms listed above, attempt to bracket volatility. Whether they would work is subject to debate, particularly with respect to short-term price volatility.", "As will be discussed further later in the report, with respect to overall cost control, analysis indicates that an important cost control mechanism in the cap-and-trade program is the availability of domestic and international offsets. The bill limits the availability of domestic and international offsets to two billion tons of emissions annually\u2014divided equally between domestic and international pools. According to analyses done by EPA, EIA, the Congressional Budget Office, and CRA International, the availability of these offsets reduces projected allowance prices under the program by half or more.", "Another concern with respect to a cap-and-trade program is potential allowance market abuse and manipulation. The size of a U.S. carbon market could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and is likely to involve all of the financial instruments, particularly derivatives, that any other commodity market includes. To provide oversight of the newly created carbon allowance market, the bill has detailed provisions for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversight of the cash allowance market, and enhanced Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight of allowance derivatives. With respect to the latter, the bill would remove energy commodities (including carbon allowances) from the category of \"exempt commodity\" and require that over-the-counter transactions be cleared through a clearing house (a standard feature of a futures exchange). In addition the CFTC is required to establish position limits, thus setting ceilings on the number of energy contracts that any person could hold."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Besides the two emission caps created under Title III, the bill contains other provisions in Titles III and IV to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon leakage. Among the most important of these provisions are (1) prevention of tropical deforestation, (2) performance standards for uncovered entities that emit over 10,000 metric tons annually, (3) discounted international offsets after 2017; and (4) programs designed to reduce potential carbon leakage.", "First, H.R. 2454 has a supplemental greenhouse gas reduction program that requires EPA to use some of the allowances available under the cap-and-trade program to fund international projects to reduce deforestation. The goal of the program is to achieve 720 million metric tons of additional emission reductions in 2020 (about 10% of U.S. 2005 emissions), and a total of 6 billion metric tons by 2025 (about equal to U.S. emissions in 1990). If achieved, this would have a significant effect on the net emission reductions achieved in the early years of the program, as suggested by the WRI study cited earlier.", "Second, as noted above, not all greenhouse gas emitting sources are covered by the Title III cap-and-trade programs. Under other provisions of Title III, stationary sources not covered by the Title III caps are potentially subject to greenhouse gas performance standards. WRI estimates that standards for uncapped sources could reduce emissions from such sources by about 115 million metric tons annually.", "Third, as passed, the cap-and-trade program requires that international offsets submitted for compliance beginning in 2018 be discounted (i.e., it takes 1.25 offset credits to equal 1.00 allowance). Depending on the number of international offsets used for compliance after 2017, the discount factor could add up to 375 million metric tons of reductions annually, according to WRI.", "Fourth, H.R. 2454 takes two primary approaches to mitigating the potential impact of carbon leakage on the net greenhouse gas reductions to be achieved under the bill. The first is the allocation of allowances at no cost to energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries, as identified above. The second is an international reserve allowance scheme that essentially imposes a shadow allowance requirement on importers of energy-intensive, trade-exposed products, creating a de facto tariff. Basically, the scheme would require importers of energy-intensive products from countries with insufficient carbon policies to submit a prescribed amount of \"international reserve allowances,\" or IRAs, for their products to gain entry into the United States. Based on the greenhouse gas emissions generated in the production process, IRAs would be submitted on a per-unit basis for each category of covered goods from a covered country.", "Whether the international reserve allowance scheme would actually work is unclear. The daunting administrative, informational, and analytical resources necessary to implement such a program would create significant issues in any attempt to implement it. Likewise, it is not clear that the World Trade Organization (WTO) implications of the provision have been fully exposed and accommodated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Earlier Versions of the Bill", "paragraphs": ["There are six key changes between the cap-and-trade provisions of a draft version of the bill circulated by its sponsors, and H.R. 2454 as introduced, as reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the House-passed version:", "The introduced version (and subsequent versions) of the bill contains a less stringent cap on emissions for covered sources in the early years of the program compared to the initial discussion draft. The original discussion draft discounted domestic and international offsets by 20% (requiring 1.25 tons of offsets to equal 1 ton of covered emissions). As introduced, reported, and passed, only international offsets are discounted, and only after 2017. The distribution of allowances was somewhat modified between the reported and House-passed versions to include allocations for early actions, small electric LDCs, small refineries, and other stakeholders. Further, the allocation for all electric LDCs was modified to prohibit any LDC from receiving more allowances than it needs to offset increased electricity costs resulting from the bill. The reported version of the bill made the International Reserve Allowance scheme a discretionary program that could not begin before 2025. The version as passed by the House made the implementation mandatory unless positive action was taken by the Congress to halt it. In addition, the definition of covered goods under the provisions was expanded from primary goods (e.g., iron and steel) to include other energy-intensive items, including items \"manufactured for consumption.\" Significant changes were made to the offset provisions from the reported version to the version passed by the House. These include establishing a separate program for offsets from domestic agriculture and forestry to be administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with all other offsets administered by EPA (in earlier versions, all offsets were administered by EPA); and the establishment of \"term offset credits\" to address concerns over the permanence of some offset projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Introduction: Models Cannot Reliably Predict the Future Costs of a Climate Change Program", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lessons from SO2 Cap and Trade Program", "paragraphs": ["During the Clean Air Act debate in 1990 on the Title IV sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) cap-and-trade program, CRS found it difficult to analyze the cost of the bill beyond the first 10 years (1990-2000), and considered any breakdown of 2000 data on a state-by-state basis as \"not useful for any more than illustrative purposes.\" As stated in 1990:", "It is difficult (and some would consider it unwise) to project costs up to the year 2000, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events (such as electric utility deregulation) loom as critical issues which can not be modeled. Hence, cost projections beyond the year 2000 are at best speculative, and are more a function of each model's assumptions and structure than they are of the details of proposed legislation . Projections this far into the future are based more on philosophy than analysis. [emphasis in original]", "The history of resulting SO 2 cap-and-trade program costs has proven illuminating. As indicated in Table 1 , the 2010 cost estimates for the SO 2 cap-and-trade program made in 1990 proved to be substantially higher than what is now estimated to be the program's actual costs. Indeed, the EPA-ICF low estimate\u2014the estimate closest to the projected actual number\u2014is both 50% higher than the actual number, and the estimate least focused-on in the original ICF report. It is interesting that none of the analyses were willing to \"speculate\" with assumptions that would have created a 2010 cost estimate lower than EPA's then-current projection.", "Equally interesting is that the \"best\" 2000 estimate was off by almost the same 50% that the 2010 estimate was. Like the 2010 estimates, the assumptions either underestimated the ingenuity and creativity of companies in responding to the SO 2 requirements, or mis-read the economics of the cap-and-trade process. As explained below by Chestnut and Mills in 2005, the gross over-estimates are essentially the product of the models' failure both to fully incorporate the flexibility that the cap-and-trade program provided participants and to explore the potential for technological breakthroughs and enhancements:", "Costs are lower than originally predicted primarily because flexibility occurred in areas that were thought to be inflexible and technical improvements were made that were not anticipated. Factors contributing to the lower costs included lower transportation costs for low-sulfur coal (attributed to railroad deregulation), productivity increases in coal production leading to favorable prices for low-sulfur and mid-sulfur coal, cheaper than expected installation and operation costs for smokestack scrubbers, and new boiler adaptations to allow use of different types of coal. It appears that Title IV has worked as expected to provide the flexibility and incentives for producers to find low-cost compliance options. [footnote omitted] Banking opportunities also induced early reductions in emissions for some facilities. Harrington et al. (2000) compared estimates of actual costs of many large regulatory programs to predictions of those costs made while the regulatory programs were being developed and found a tendency for predicted costs to overstate the actual implementation costs, especially for market-based programs such as the SO 2 trading program. They cite technological innovation and unanticipated efficiency gains as key factors leading to lower than predicted costs. They noted that unit costs are often more accurately predicted than total costs because predicted emission reductions are sometimes overstated, but they report that predicted unit costs and total costs were both overstated for Title IV."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Illustrative Example from Analyses of H.R. 2454", "paragraphs": ["There is no reason to believe that cost estimates for greenhouse gas reductions will be any more accurate than the 1990 SO 2 estimates; indeed, they are likely to be less reliable . This is not to say that they will be too high; they may be too low. To illustrate, CRS examines some results of the modeling efforts with respect to the costs of H.R. 2454 . To frame this illustration, we focus on the three primary drivers of greenhouse gas emissions: (1) population, (2) incomes (measured as per capita gross domestic product [GDP]), and (3) intensity of greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities (measured as metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per million dollars of GDP). As shown in the following formula, a country's annual greenhouse gas emissions are the product of these three drivers:", "( Population ) x ( Per Capita GDP ) x ( Intensity ghg ) = Emissions ghg", "This is the relationship for a given point in time; over time, any effort to change emissions alters the exponential rates of change of these variables. This means that the rates of change of the three left-hand variables, measured in percentage of annual change, sum to the rate of change of the right-hand variable, emissions.", "Using the three drivers, Table 2 provides the essential assumptions from four analyses of H.R. 2454 for the year 2050. The Heritage Foundation analysis is not included because it covered only the energy sector and only until 2035; the EIA and ACCF/NAM analyses are not included because they only project to 2030. Examining the \"business-as-usual\" reference cases, a range of assumptions are employed by the models. As suggested by the formula above, the differing assumptions result in different 2050 baseline GHG emissions: 8.4 billion metric tons for EPA/ADAGE, 8.4 billion metric tons for EPA/IGEM, 9.7 billion metric tons for NBCC/CRA, and 10.1 billion for MIT/EPPA\u2014a 20% difference from the lowest to the highest. Interestingly, major sources of disagreement in the reference cases include per capita GDP and population projections\u2014two variables that are generally not the focus of greenhouse gas reduction strategies.", "Moving to the H.R. 2454 scenario as modeled, the variability in the results widens for two of the three drivers (the 2050 reference case population remains constant in the three models), but the range of projected 2050 greenhouse gas emissions estimates narrows: 4.6 billion metric tons for EPA/ADAGE, 5.1 billion metric tons EPA/IGEM, 4.3 billion metric tons for NBCC/CRA, and 4.8 billion metric tons for MIT/EPPA\u2014a 19% difference. The models' assumptions about the flexibility and responsiveness of the U.S. economy resulted in some interesting reversals in 2050 between the base case and H.R. 2454 scenario that narrow this range: (1) the CRA and MIT models, which have the highest GHG intensity assumption in the reference case, have the lowest GHG intensity under H.R. 2454 . (2) In contrast, the EPA/IGEM model, which has the lowest GHG intensity assumption in its reference cases, has the highest GHG intensity result under H.R. 2454 .", "Because of these different views of the economy, the economic impact of the bill is almost lost in the differences in the models' reference case assumptions. As indicated in Table 2 , the EPA/ADAGE, NBCC/CRA, and MIT/EPPA model projections of the country's 2050 GDP per capita under H.R. 2454 are greater than the reference case projections of EPA/IGEM. According to the EPA/ADAGE model, the 2050 GDP per capita of the country is reduced by 1.3% under H.R. 2454 ; 2.0% according to the EPA/IGEM projection, 1.5% according to the NBCC/CRA analysis, and 1.8% according to the MIT/EPPA analysis.", "In some ways, the above comparison underestimates the uncertainty involved because all the analyses are linked to some degree to the 2009 EIA Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) reference case projection. The AEO projections have changed over time (and will continue to do so in the future). Figure 3 below presents the changes in the three drivers (substituting energy intensity for greenhouse gas intensity) and resulting baselines from EIA's reference case projections over the past four years. As indicated, projected 2030 greenhouse gas emissions have dropped by almost a quarter over that four-year period. Most of this reduction results from less optimistic assumptions about GDP growth per capita and a small improvement in energy efficiency that overwhelmed an increasing population projection. If the analyses reviewed in this report were conducted using EIA's 2006 reference case projections, instead of its 2009 projections, the compliance costs associated with the program would be significantly higher . ", "The uncertainty about the future direction of the basic drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and the economy's responsiveness (economically, technologically, and behaviorally) illustrate the inability of models to reliably predict the ultimate macroeconomic costs of reducing greenhouse gas es. Policy relevant analysis provides insight into the features and design of proposals that increase or reduce compliance cost and under what economic, technological, and behavior conditions, and that identify potential intended and unintended consequences on the economy.

For example, the acid rain program involves up to 3,000 new and existing electric generating units that contribute two-thirds of the country's SO 2 . This concentration of sources (and the fact that they are stationary) makes the logistics of allowance trading administratively manageable and enforceable. The imposition of the allowance requirement is straightforward. The acid rain program is a \"downstream\" program focused on the electric utility industry.

This greatly increases the economic sectors and individual entities that may be required to reduce emissions.", "It also affects the operation of a cap-and-trade program, as the diversity of sources creates significant administrative and enforcement problems for a tradable permit program if it is meant to be comprehensive. A downstream approach is impractical for a comprehensive greenhouse gas program where the transportation sector and dispersed residential, commercial, and agricultural sources emit almost half the total emissions. One alternative is to move the imposition point more \"upstream\" in those sectors, as is done by H.R. 2454 . This complicates the economics of the program as the price signal has to work its way through multiple paths to the particular entities\u2014utilities, consumers, industry\u2014that are the ultimate sources of the greenhouse gases. Arguably, the primary purpose of an economic mechanism, such as a cap-and-trade program, is to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions.

GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a nation's borders. Although it is commonly used as a measure of quality of life, this application is problematic. Generally, it includes only those items for which there is a value defined in a market, and does not take into account some activities that have economic value, but no market valuation (e.g., leisure time, environmental quality, etc.). Thus, GDP is intended to be a measure of economic activity, not quality of life.", "A second measure sometimes presented is consumption effects (sometimes called welfare effects). Unfortunately, the models do not measure consumption or welfare effects in a consistent fashion (the primary advantage of using GDP). This problem is discussed later in the section on \" Impact on Households .\" In addition, like GDP, none of the definitions of consumption or welfare currently employed quantify any benefits from improved environmental quality.", "A third measure often presented is allowance prices. Allowance prices reflect to some degree the aggregate marginal cost of reductions as estimated by the models. Marginal cost is the cost of reducing the last ton (and, therefore, the most expensive) of greenhouse gases required by the program at a specific point in time. Marginal costs are very useful to affected entities in choosing what reduction strategy would be the most cost-effective in achieving reductions required by the cap-and-trade program. Marginal costs are not average costs and therefore cannot be simply multiplied by the greenhouse gases reduced to estimate total compliance cost. They also need to be put into the context of the overall reduction achieved at the given point and time being examined.", "However, allowance prices in most analyses are not equal to marginal costs of achieving the specified reductions in a specific year because of program provisions, such as banking. Banking activity reflects the assumed foresight of affected entities to the likelihood of increasing allowance prices (in real terms) as the cap tightens. As indicated by the experience with the SO 2 program, entities will bank substantial allowances early and use them later as the program's requirements tighten. This results in allowance prices being higher than marginal costs in the early years of the program, and lower in later years. This ability to time-shift reduction requirements and compliance costs means that allowance price projections reflect the assumed foresight of affected entities as much as they do actual marginal costs.", "In examining cost measures, aggregate welfare indicators such as GDP may be overemphasized. As illustrated above in Table 2 , aggregate, macroeconomic cost results for H.R. 2454 are generally lost in the uncertainty about future conditions. Focusing on aggregate macroeconomic measures may lead readers to miss valuable insights into the analyses' assumptions and their conclusions about the costs or benefits of certain compliance strategies. For example, Figure 4 below shows a 1997 scatter-plot by World Resources Institute (WRI) of 162 predicted impacts estimates from 16 different economic models of the U.S. economy as a result of a CO 2 abatement program. As indicated, the vast majority of estimates fall with a range of 0%-4% of GDP, regardless of the reduction requirement. Over-emphasis on GDP or other aggregate cost measures can obscure fundamental technological, economic, or behavioral insights the analyses may have in helping policymakers craft legislation.

While supporting use of aggregate welfare cost measures, MIT notes:", "GE [general equilibrium] effects can stem from interactions with pre-existing distortions (e.g., taxes), from externally induced terms-of-trade effects, from the fact that the domestic policy itself creates terms-of-trade effects, and from other rigidities in the economy. Many aspects of model structure produce GE effects that are not easy to separately measure because of the inherent interactions in the economy.", "Generally, the cases examined here have not chosen to separate the two components of macro-economic cost measures: (1) the direct abatement (or compliance) cost of a greenhouse gas reduction program, and (2) the general equilibrium effects of a greenhouse gas reduction program (i.e., the interactions of the direct abatement costs with the rest of the economy). The availability of accurate compliance cost estimates would allow policymakers to put current greenhouse gas reduction proposals in the context of other environmental initiatives\u2014be they acid rain or toxic air pollutants\u2014and, indeed, to the overall environmental agenda, and greatly increase the transparency of the analyses' insights. It would also help relieve confusion between compliance costs, average costs (per ton reduced), and the other commonly presented costs, such as allowance prices. It is argued that an aggregate macroeconomic cost measure provides a more complete view of the economic impact of proposed legislation, and helps identify potential unintended economic effects of compliance strategies. This may be true, particularly if, for example, auction revenues are being recycled via a reformed tax code.

None of these perspectives is inherently more \"right\" or \"correct\" than another; rather, they overlap and to varying degrees complement and conflict with one another. People generally hold to each of the lenses to some degree.", "However, different combinations of these perspectives lead to different cost estimates. An illustration of this can be seen in the contrast between the H.R. 2454 results obtained by the American Council for Capital Formation/National Association of Manufacturers (ACCF/NAM) high cost case and the \"high technology\" sensitivity case conducted by EIA using the same model: EIA's NEMS model. Table 4 summarizes the general approach of the two analyses according to the three perspectives identified above. In its sensitivity case, EIA mimics H.R. 2454 's various technology and efficiency provisions by employing its High Technology baseline that has more aggressive technology development assumptions than its reference case, and also includes banking, and phased-in offsets. In contrast, ACCF/NAM is not confident that new technology, new energy sources, and market mechanisms (e.g., carbon offsets, banking) will be sufficiently available to achieve H.R. 2454 's emission targets. Accordingly, ACCF/NAM's High Cost case assumptions differ substantially from EIA's High Technology sensitivity analysis by discouraging banking, restricting the availability of offsets to half that allowed in H.R. 2454 , and significantly restricting availability of various low- and non-carbon technologies beyond what is embedded in the NEMS base case.", "As indicated by Table 5 , the widely different cost assumptions provided the expected results, although both analyses remained in the 0-4% GDP range common for greenhouse gas reduction analysis. Allowance price estimates diverge significantly by 2030, but this cost measure tends to exaggerate differences between results and should not be confused with average costs or program costs. This is particularly true for analyses of H.R. 2454 , as ACCF/NAM did not publish its environmental results in terms of greenhouse gases reduced; thus, one can not compare the allowance price with what is being reduced over time. Unfortunately, the analyses do not present sufficient sensitivity analysis and other information to determine whether it is the economic assumptions (e.g., discount rates and offset availability), the behavioral assumptions (e.g., impact of efficiency programs), the technology assumptions (e.g., availability), or what combination of these assumptions that explains the differences in results.", "Some attempts have been made to sort out the importance of various assumptions in analyzing the costs of greenhouse gas reduction proposals, beginning with Repetto and Austin's effort for the World Resources Institute (WRI) in 1997, with more recent efforts by Barker, Qureshi and Kohler in 2006 and Barker and Jenkins in 2007.

This is most likely due to the no banking and declining offset supply assumed in the HF/GI case. HF/GI also has the least baseline growth of any of the cases presented here, reducing the overall emission reductions it requires. Indeed, with its relatively low offset price, the baseline and offset price assumptions combine to result in a slight rise in U.S. emissions under H.R. 2454 before 2018, at which point the declining availability of offsets assumed by HF/GI forces the analysis to increase domestic emission reductions to meet the increasing stringency of the cap.", "The case that results in the most reductions from baseline levels is NBCC/CRA.

Covered entities can offset 1 billion tons of emissions from domestic offsets and 1 billion tons from international offsets each year. Further, if the supply of domestic offsets is below 0.9 billion tons, the remainder can be made up with international offsets, up to an additional 0.5 billion tons (i.e., if there are only 0.5 billion tons of domestic offsets, the bill allows 1.5 billion tons of international offsets, for a total of 2 billion). The potential for low-cost offsets is limited somewhat by the fact that after 2017, international offsets are discounted by 20%\u2014five international offsets are required to offset four tons of emissions (no such limitation applies to domestic offsets).", "As mentioned above, the cases generally agree that the availability of offsets plays a key role in the cost of the program.

For example, the strong price signal in the EIA/NEMS cases results in an increasing deployment of CCS to 2030, while the somewhat weak price signal of EPA/ADAGE results in CCS deployment peaking with the bonus allowance allocation then declining as the allowance price is inadequate to sustain new deployment.

If the price was lowered to $30 per ton, the capacity deployed is also lowered as the bonus is insufficient to encourage commercialization of the technology. If the price was raised to $50 per ton, the incentive is reduced because the bonus pool is depleted faster as more is paid out than is necessary to encourage commercialization.

Once a price on carbon is determined, the market responds by efficiently reducing carbon emissions to the point where the cost of reducing emissions equals, in the case of a cap-and-trade scheme, the cost of buying an allowance. By creating allowances, each one essentially a license to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, the government is creating an instrument that has value and for which there will be a demand at a given price. ", "What cap-and-trade does economically is shown in Figure 19 , using EPA/IGEM's estimates as an example. As indicated, there are two components to the cap-and-trade program. First, there is the compliance cost\u2014the actual cost of reducing emissions. This represents the resources that covered entities use to reduce their emissions to the level specified by the emissions cap. ", "Second, there is the value, or wealth created by the establishment of valuable permits required for emitting greenhouse gases. As indicated in Figure 19 below, the allowance value created by H.R. 2454 is projected by EPA to be substantially higher than the compliance costs, particularly in the program's early years. How the government chooses to allocate these valuable instruments would have a significant impact on who pays for the program. This potentially substantial transfer of wealth helps explain the strong debate with respect to allowance allocation. ", "This situation differs substantially from a traditional regulatory approach for controlling emissions. With traditional regulatory approaches, the discussion of costs would end at compliance costs (the first point above) because traditional approaches use a regulatory mandate to order entities to comply with a requirement instead of employing a price signal. Regulatory approaches also tend to restrict the flexibility covered entities have to comply with the program's mandates. The result is potentially a less efficient compliance program than is possible with a market-based system. ", "Allowance markets present covered entities with an option of either reducing emissions or buying allowances (or a combination of both) to meet the emission cap. The value created by the establishment of allowances can be used to mitigate the impact of the program on specific entities or groups. If one believes that allowance value is really a cost like resources costs are (and not a means to encourage cost-effective compliance strategies), then one should oppose market-based solutions as being more \"costly\" than a traditional regulatory approach as any inefficiency introduced by the regulatory system would be more than offset by the allowance \"cost\" introduced by the market-based system.", "The manner in which allowances are allocated does not reduce the program's compliance cost, it only changes who bears the cost. As stated by W. David Montgomery of CRA International during congressional testimony:", "The allocation of allowances cannot eliminate the cost of a cap and trade program; it can only change who bears the cost. Free allocations can remove some or all of the cost of obtaining allowances that grant permission to emit up to the stated caps; but no matter how allowances are distributed, none of the cost of the actions that must be undertaken to bring emissions down to satisfy the caps can be removed. At best, that distribution can eliminate the cost of purchasing allowances from the government. Nothing can eliminate the cost of reducing emissions from their projected business-as-usual level to the capped level, though there are many ways of hiding or shifting that cost around.", "Indeed, free allocation of allowances can increase the cost of the program if it dilutes the price signal, resulting in less economically efficient compliance schemes. As EPA stated in its analysis of H.R. 2454 : ", "Returning the allowance value to consumers of electricity via local distribution companies in a non-lump sum fashion prevents electricity prices from rising but make the cap-and-trade more costly overall. This form of redistribution makes the cap-and-trade more costly since greater emission reductions have to be achieved by other sectors of the economy. Resulting changes in prices of other energy-intensive goods also influence the overall distributional impacts of the policy. ", "In the case of H.R. 2454 , this diluting effect does not seem to dominate the cost analysis. For example, in analyzing the May discussion draft that preceded the introduction of H.R. 2454 , EPA assumed that the cap-and-trade program would allocate its allowances entirely by auction\u2014the most economically efficient means of distributing allowances. In its June analysis of H.R. 2454 as reported by House Energy and Commerce Committee, EPA included scenarios that incorporated the free allocation provisions of the bill in a manner that reduced electricity price increases to consumers and which increased electricity demand and associated emissions. However, in comparing the overall impact of the two versions, the projected allowance prices were less in the reported version than the discussion draft\u2014a result driven primarily by the reported version's less stringent 2020 emissions cap and its provisions permitting expanded use of international offsets. This suggests that, in the case of H.R. 2454 , there may be design parameters, particularly the assumed availability of international offsets, that could substantially outweigh whatever economic inefficiencies are introduced by its free allocation scheme. ", "In the case of H.R. 2454 , there are three factors that affect the efficiency of its allocation system. First, as indicated earlier, H.R. 2454 uses a mixture of free allocation schemes and auctions to distribute allowances. Over time, the distribution becomes increasingly based on auctions with per-capita rebates to consumers. Thus, the allocation system becomes increasingly efficient economically over time with over 65% of allowances auctioned by 2030. Second, there is a significant amount of free allowances allocated for other purposes (state energy efficiency programs, international activities, etc.,) that would have little or no effect on the price signal. Third, the bill contains language that attempts to prevent electricity and natural gas LDCs from using the free allowances provided them to reward increased use of energy. Alternatives include focusing on the fixed component of energy bills and use of allowance value to fund energy efficiency activities (mandated for one-third of natural gas LDCs' allocation).", "Of the analyses examined here, the EPA cases assume that the allowances allocated to electricity LDCs do dilute the price signal, resulting in the need for increased emission reductions. However, the scenario most focused on by EPA (scenario 2) incorporates some of the efficiency provisions of H.R. 2454 that counteract this effect. The CRA International analysis assumes that LDCs do distribute the allowances in the manner mandated by the bill, preventing a dilution of the price signal. Disagreeing with EPA's interpretation, CRA International states: \"The specific provisions on the use of the allowances do not allow the use of the allowances for rebates based 'solely on the quantity of electricity delivered to such ratepayer.' [footnote to H.R. 2454 omitted] Since the rebate is not to be based on electricity use it should not distort the incentive for consumers to conserve electricity.\" For EIA, electricity allowances allocated freely to load serving entities are reflected as a reduction in \"effective\" electricity rates to consumers. When asked by CRS about how its study distributed allowance value, the Heritage Foundation rejected the entire notion a priori that allowance value could be used to reduce energy prices. Instead, the Heritage Foundation models the macro-economic and pricing effects of H.R. 2454 as if all the allowances are auctioned, treating the allowance value created by H.R. 2454 as government revenue (similar to a tax) regardless of whether they are formally auctioned or not.

This approach is not the formula mandated by H.R. 2454 in several important respects: (1) H.R. 2454 's electricity rebate is not calculated by state, but by individual LDCs; (2) the rebate is not calculated according to emissions associated with in-state electric generation, but by emissions associated with sales; and (3) H.R. 2454 prohibits allocation of allowances in excess of the amount necessary to compensate consumers for any increased costs, so there can be no \"winners\" under the rebate scheme. In addition, the map's authors assume there are no cost-effective reduction strategies available to utilities and that the only compliance strategy is to purchase allowances or offsets at CBO's marginal cost of control\u2014$15 an allowance. Thus, the map does not actually reflect either the overall allocation or costs of H.R. 2454 , its distribution across states, or likely compliance strategies of affected utilities. M.J. Bradley and Associates' Residential Electricity Bills Map . Entitled: \"Change in Monthly Average Residential Electricity Bills in 2012 under the Waxman-Markey Bill,\" the four-page analysis of H.R. 2454 's (as passed) impact on monthly average residential electricity bills avoids most, but not all, of the pitfalls that the NMA map fell into. By focusing on monthly residential electric bills, the analysis' scope is in line with the thrust of the electricity provisions in H.R. 2454 , including the structure of the electricity cost relief. The M.J. Bradley and Associates map makes attempts to allocate H.R. 2454 's rebate to consumers according to electricity sales and emissions associated with those sales data specified by the bill. Unlike the NMA and the NRDC analysis (below), the calculations are based on a nationwide average residential electricity consumption of 1000 kilowatt-hours (Kwh) per month. A major advantage of the M.J. Bradley approach is that the assumptions and calculations are transparent and easily understood. A major short-coming of this analysis is the same as for all these analyses: the focus on state-by-state data, rather than the LDC data required by H.R. 2454 , means that intra-state differences in electricity supply and consumption are masked. In addition, like the NMA map, M.J. Bradley also uses allowance prices (EPA's in this case) as the average cost of control. Natural Resources Defense Council's (NRDC) Electric Bills Map . Entitled: \"Climate Bill Cuts Electric Bills: H.R. 2454 saves Americans an average of $6 per month,\" the one page map summarizes the state level electricity bill impacts of H.R. 2454 based on an analysis conducted by OnLocation Inc. for NRDC using the NEMS model developed by EIA. Unlike the NMA and M.J. Bradley maps, the NRDC estimates are the results of an integrated modeling exercise, although the state-level estimates are the result of off-model calculations by NRDC (the NEMS-NRDC model resolves to the regional level only). A unique part of this analysis is the modeling of the demand response by consumers to both the efficiency provisions of H.R. 2454 and its price signal \u2013 a dynamic not addressed by the other two analyses. Other differences with the above analyses involve presentation: the two previous analyses estimate costs in 2012 compared with today's costs; the NRDC analysis estimates average monthly costs (or savings) from 2012-2020 compared with projected baseline conditions. As with the two other analyses, the choice of state-level data does not reflect the LDC-based rebate formula of H.R. 2454 . ", "To try and put these maps on a somewhat more level field, CRS adjusted the NMA figures to: (1) reflect residential consumer consumption only; (2) reflect the average state's residential consumer's monthly consumption; and (3) convert the estimate into 2005$. The analysis by M.J. Bradley required no adjustment, presenting residential monthly bills in 2005$. For the NRDC analysis, the results were converted to 2005$. CRS was unable to separate the aggregate average 2012-2020 projection into a 2012 projection, but notes that much of the saving s is likely to occur in the later years of the projections. Also, readers are reminded that the three maps assumed different allowance prices in 2012 (or 2012-2020 in the case of NRDC).", "As indicated in Figure 21 , the U.S. average residential electric bill in 2012 would increase about $2 a month under the NMA and M.J Bradley analyses, compared with an average eight-year savings of over $6 a month under the NRDC analysis. The analyses for individual states generally range from a $5 increased cost monthly, to a $5 savings monthly. Three notable outliers are created by the NMA methodology that focused on in-state generation rather than electricity sales. North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming export a substantial portion of their in-state generation to other states, leading to artificially high estimates. Likewise, states that are net importers of electricity may have artificially low estimates. The NMA methodology does not account for this, resulting in some clearly erroneous results; for example, North Dakota's residential electricity bills rising over $20 a month while South Dakota's residential electricity bills are slightly declining. ", "Overall, the attempts to provide state impact data provide the reader with little insight into the effects of H.R. 2454 on individual states. Arguably, a more useful way of looking at the residential rates is to consider consumers' electricity usage, electricity supply, and the electricity efficiency opportunities provided by H.R. 2454 's various programs and price signal. The data presented do suggest that the rebate formula would reduce the increase in average residential electric bills nationwide in the early years of the program to about $2 a month (assuming allowance prices in the $12-$15 range), with opportunities to reduce future bills if the energy efficiency provisions work as designed.

In general, the incremental impact of H.R. 2454 on natural gas prices depends on the degree to which natural gas-fired generation is used to back out existing coal-fired capacity and to meet future demand. As discussed above, the cases fall into three categories with respect to future natural gas-fired generation: (1) little or no increased generation; (2) modest increased generation; or (3) substantial increased generation. Of the three cases included in the first category, the EPA/ADAGE case projects a small increase in overall natural gas rates, rates that include allowance costs.

By including the rebate in its case, EIA/NEMS's short-term rate increases are reduced by the rebate, while NBCC/CRA's rates are not. However, by 2030, the rebate has been phased out, and that difference has been effectively removed. NBCC/CRA goes on to project more steeply increasing natural gas rates, reaching 34% above baseline levels in 2050.", "In contrast to the cases above, the ACCF-NAM/NEMS and HF/GI cases (which project substantial increases in natural gas-fired capacity) estimate minor increases in residential natural gas prices in 2020 (possibly due to the LDC rebate), but substantial increases (over 50%) in both residential and industrial rates by 2030.

These factors are briefly discussed below. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Definition of Welfare Effects", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier in this report, the term \"welfare effects\" is not consistently defined across the various studies examined. This problem becomes acute when one gets to the subject of household effects. A uniform calculation of a household's increased or reduced welfare from enacting H.R. 2454 would be a useful contribution to the policy debate. The lack of such a definition has contributed to a jumble of differing estimates that shed little light on the underlying fundamental issues. ", "The studies reviewed here use four different types of measures in determining household effects: (1) welfare change (MIT/EPPA); (2) consumption-based change (EPA/ADAGE, EPA/IGEM, EIA/NEMS, NBCC/CRA [called purchasing power]) , (3) income-based change (household income (ACFF-NAM/NEMS), or disposable income (HF/GI)), and (4) economy-wide costs (CBO)). Even within these categories, the accounting can be different; thus, comparisons across the different measures are problematic at best. None of these measures included any environmental benefits in the calculation of welfare effects. ", "The broadest measure of welfare is \"welfare change\" as used by MIT. Welfare change refers to the difference between a household's welfare with and without enactment of H.R. 2454 : As explained by MIT:", "For many economists the preferred measure of total economic costs of greenhouse gas abatement or of other policy measures is the change in consumer welfare, measured in terms of \"equivalent variation\", as this measure considers the GHG price and the amount of abatement and can include the effect of interactions with other policy measures to the extent these other policy measures are modeled. And, whereas the CO 2 price measures the marginal cost, a welfare measure takes into account the fact that many of the reductions likely cost less than the last ton abated. Welfare is also generally a measure that is broader than just market activity and as such the change in welfare includes changes in both labor and leisure time. Leisure is considered a good and in models like EPPA it is represented by the monetary value of the non-working time. In coming up with a measure of change in welfare any reductions (increases) in the amount of work time are offset by increases (decreases) in the amount of leisure time. ", "The most common measure of household effects is consumption change (called purchasing power in the NBCC/CRA case). Consumption is a major component of GDP and consumption change is related to the welfare change measured above. The primary difference between the two is that consumption change focuses on market impacts and therefore does not include the impact of policy on leisure time. As a result, this measure generally registers greater losses than the welfare indicator because it does not capture any increases in non-market activities (i.e., leisure) resulting from decreases in consumption from higher prices. This is particularly true if percentages are presented since consumption is a smaller measure to begin with than welfare. ", "However, it should be noted that consumption is not defined uniformly across the various models that present consumption estimates. For example, the EPA/IGEM model accounts for consumer durables like housing as investments, rather than as consumption (as they are treated in EPA/ADAGE and the U.S. National Income Accounts (NIA)). This makes examining such figures across cases even more problematic. ", "The third category is income-based measures and these can be subject to a significant range of interpretation. National income is a measure of the total net value of all goods and services, representing the sum of wages, profits, rents, interest, and pension payments. Personal income measures gross income from employment (e.g., wages), self-employment, investment income, dividends, and transfer payments (such as Social Security). In contrast, disposable income measures personal income minus taxes \u2013 i.e., the income individuals have available to spend or save.", "Disposable income, in particular, is a hard concept to directly reconcile with the welfare and consumption measures discussed above. Disposable income is a well-defined term in national income accounting, but in a modeling exercise it is highly sensitive to many assumptions unrelated to the direct cost of the bill. For example, how a model characterizes allowance value, either as a tax (and therefore reducing disposable income) or as a transfer payment (and therefore having no effect on disposable income), can have a significant effect on the \"welfare\" estimate, given the amount of the allowance value created by H.R. 2454 . Thus, readers should carefully examine the dynamics of a modeling exercise that employs disposable income (or any other measure for that matter) as a measure of welfare to determine what is actually being measured.", "The fourth category is economy-wide costs. As defined by CBO, this term includes four factors with respect to H.R. 2454 : (1) purchase of international offset credits; (2) cost of producing domestic offset credits; (3) resource costs associated with reducing emissions; and (4) allowance value that would be directed overseas. CBO assumes that allowance value is a pure transfer flowing back to U.S. households \"both in the form of direct relief and indirectly through allocations to businesses and government (all of which would eventually benefit households in people's various roles as consumers, workers, shareholders, and taxpayers).... \" The term does not include the potential indirect general equilibrium effects that H.R. 2454 's costs could trigger.

Thus, most industries are price sensitive, and therefore any increase in manufacturing costs hurts the competitiveness of a firm. This complex situation is further complicated for energy-intensive industries in the case of H.R. 2454 as competitors within the same industry may experience different energy price increases (particularly for electric power), depending on their individual energy needs and power arrangements. Thus, individual facilities within the same industry will be affected differently by H.R. 2454 and other unforeseen events in the future.

Indeed, the effect of discounting is so great on a long-term marginal damage estimate of climate change that \"using standard assumptions about discounting [i.e., 4-5%] and aggregation, the marginal damage costs of carbon dioxide emissions are unlikely to exceed $50 tC [$14 tCO 2 ], and probably much smaller.\" Indeed, estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)\u2014the marginal damage resulting from the addition of one more ton of CO 2 \u2014span over three orders of magnitude: from zero to over a $500 a ton.", "However, most current attempts to monetize environmental benefits are incomplete. The matrix presented in Table 19 illustrates the problem. Most studies that attempt to monetize climate risks focus on the market impact of predictable, average changes in climate (the \"easiest to measure\" box of Table 19 ). Only a few attempt to value non-market impacts or extreme events and fewer still consider catastrophes or socially contingent impacts. In reviewing 28 studies the UK Government had analyzed in re-examining its estimate of an appropriate Social Cost of Carbon, Ackerman and Stanton observed:", "That is, all of the studies that estimate the social cost of carbon base their numbers on an incomplete picture of climate risks\u2014often encompassing only the simplest and most predictable corner of the vast, troubling canvas that has been painted by climate science. There is, of course, no way to assign monetary values to the global response to the possibility of widespread droughts across large parts of Asia, or an increase in the probability of a sudden change in ocean currents that would make the UK as cold as Canada, but in the understandable absence of such impossible monetary values, it is important to remember the disclaimer from the DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs] review: all estimates of the SCC [Social Cost of Carbon] omit some of the most important unpriced risks of climate change. The same disclaimer applies to virtually any quantitative economic estimate of climate impacts.", "The matrix also indicates the moral dilemma presented by efforts to monetize damages\u2014a dilemma magnified by the issue of intergenerational discounting. The notion that premature deaths, extinctions, and other such potential impacts are less important because they occur in some future generation is, for some, morally problematic. Criticizing the UK government attempt to put a price on climate change, the UK House of Commons Select Committee on Environmental Audit\u00a0stated:", "Furthermore, given the inherent difficulties in putting a price on climate change, the Government's first priority in deciding on the merits of potential policies and construction projects ought to be deciding how they affect UK carbon budgets, and only secondly on what the monetary value of resulting carbon emissions would be.", "Besides moral considerations, one's valuation of the social cost of carbon is dependent on one's assumptions about the emissions path the world is on. This is due to the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and radiative forcing (i.e., the higher the atmospheric concentration, the less the effect of one more ton on warming), the relationship between climate change and economic impacts (i.e., the higher the damage, the less the effect of one more ton on that damage), and discounting (impacts occurring earlier are valued more than impacts occurring later). This phenomenon is illustrated in The Stern Review on the economics of stabilizing climate change. As shown in Table 20 , the SCC declines as the path of emissions is projected to result in less severe damages. Such estimates would increase over time as the damage got closer and closer.", "In an attempt to respond to the implications of climate change and The Stern Review , the UK Government has instituted a shadow price for carbon to be used in official cost-benefit analyses. A shadow price is a little different from a Social Cost of Carbon value. The latter is an attempt to determine the marginal damage resulting from the addition of one more ton of CO 2 \u2014it indicates what people should be willing to pay now to avoid the future damage caused by more carbon emissions. In contrast, a shadow price represents a cost or benefit from a good when the market price is a poor indicator of economic value or there is no market at all. The UK shadow price of carbon is based on the Social Cost of Carbon of a 550 ppm stabilization goal as determined in The Stern Review , plus consideration of abatement costs and the value of UK leadership in encouraging global participation and from being out front in developing new technology. The result is a shadow price of about $45 a ton in 2012 (2005$), rising 2% annually thereafter in real terms.", "Using this shadow price of carbon and the UK Green Book discount rates of 3.5% for the first 30 years and 3.0% afterward, the net present value (NPV) of H.R. 2454 's estimated reductions over the life of the program (2012-2050) would range from $4.3 trillion (EPA/ADAGE case) to $5.4 trillion (NBCC/CRA case) in 2005 dollars. To complete this illustrative exercise, NBCC/CRA case estimates the net present value of the welfare effects (i.e., consumption) of H.R. 2454 at $2.6 trillion (5% discount rate, 2005$)", "Not surprisingly, the estimates illustrated here have been criticized by some (including the UK Parliament) for being too low and incomplete, and for discounting future generations. For example, if one objects to the discount of future generations, an undiscounted flow of benefit estimates based on the UK shadow price of carbon from H.R. 2454 's estimated reductions ranges from $8.6 trillion (EPA/ADAGE) to $12.4 trillion (NBCC/CRA) in 2005 dollars.", "Likewise, others have criticized the estimates as too large and inflated. For example, in its 2008 assessment of new average fuel economy standards, the Bush Administration's U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) chose to value carbon reductions at $7 a ton and employ a 7% discount rate. Applied to the reduction estimated under H.R. 2454 , the resulting NPV would be about one order of magnitude lower than the UK shadow price-based estimates. Thus, reminiscent of EPA's illustrative calculation of the health benefits of a 1-hour sulfur dioxide standard, the illustration here results in a range of climate-related benefits from reducing greenhouse gases under H.R. 2454 at between zero and $200 billion annually (2005$).", "As illustrated with the long-term cost estimates presented in this report, attempts to monetize climate-related benefits currently reflect much about the philosophies and assumptions of the people doing the estimating. As stated in The Stern Review : \"It is very important ... to stress that such estimates [NPV of climate change policy benefits] reflect a large number of underlying assumptions, many of which are very tentative or specific to the ethical perspectives adopted.\" Likewise, these modeling exercises may be useful for conducting sensitivity analysis to gage the potential impact of various policy options and assumptions.

One useful perspective is provided by MIT's general study of cap-and-trade bills conducted in 2008. Using the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM), MIT explored the climate response to different stabilization goals being discussed in the international community. It developed parameterizations of IGSM that represented each of three major atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AO GCMs) that would help illustrate the uncertainty in translating emission trends into an estimate of climate change: those of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (CISS-SB), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL-2.1), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (CCSM3).", "MIT simulated the climate effects of six different policy scenarios through 2100. Four of these are of interest in exploring H.R. 2454 : ", "(1) a reference scenario that assumes no specific global climate policy (\"Reference\"); (2) a global participation scenario (\"Global Participation, 203 bmt case\"), (3) a global participation scenario where abatement efforts in developing countries are delayed until 2050 (\"Developing Countries Delayed\"); and (4) a partial participation scenario where no abatement efforts occur in developing countries (\"Developed Only\"). ", "Under scenarios 2, 3, and 4, developed countries (including the United States) are assumed to have reduced emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050 (and held them there through 2100). This assumption is in the ballpark of U.S. reductions anticipated under H.R. 2454 (given the projected substantial use of foreign offsets). For developing countries, scenario 2 assumes their emissions reductions begin in 2025, with emissions returning to their 2015 levels, and with additional reductions beginning in 2035 with emissions returning to their 2000 levels, and are held there; scenario 3 assumes emissions reductions are delayed until 2050, at which point they return to 2000 levels; and scenario 4 assumes developing country emissions are not stabilized at all.", "The climate effects of these scenarios as simulated by MIT IGSM replication of the three AO GCMs identified above is shown in Figure 24 . As indicated by the red line, the impact of H.R. 2454 , combined with that of the other developed countries (all of which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol), is to reduce by 0.5 degrees C the projected 3.5 degrees C to 4.5 degrees C increase in global mean temperatures suggested by the simulations. If the United States chose not to reduce, the impact would be to move the red, green, and blue lines closer to the reference case line. With respect to the red line, it should be noted that, in 2000, the United States' greenhouse gas emissions were about 40% of the developed world's total emissions. In terms of the effect of any U.S. reductions on global mean temperatures, that is about all that can be said in isolation. As noted by MIT:", "...it is not possible to connect specific U.S. policy targets with a particular global concentration or temperature target, and therefore the avoided damages, because any climate gains depend on efforts in the rest of the world.... If a cooperative solution is at all possible, therefore, a major strategic consideration in setting U.S. policy targets should be their value in leading other major countries to take on similar efforts.", "Thus, H.R. 2454 's climate-related environmental benefit should be considered in a global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort. It is in this context that the United States and other developed countries agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases when they ratified the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This global context raises two issues for H.R. 2454 : (1) whether H.R. 2454 's greenhouse gas reduction program and other provisions would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely, and (2) whether H.R. 2454 's reductions meet U.S. commitments to stabilization under the UNFCCC and occur in a timely fashion so that global stabilization may occur at an acceptable level."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Non-Climate Change Air Quality Benefits", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, the estimates of emission reductions from non-greenhouse gas air pollutants suffer because of difficulties in determining a \"business as usual\" baseline. However, values have been assigned to these pollutants from time to time. For example, in the notice of proposed rulemaking for the new average fuel economy standard, the Department of Transportation assigned emission damage costs of $3,900 a short ton for nitrogen oxides, $16,000 a short ton for sulfur dioxide, and $164,000 a short ton for particulate matter\u2014all pollutants that are also emitted from coal-fired generating facilities.

Other benefits may occur from reductions of pollutants such carbon monoxide.", "In promulgating the Clean Air Mercury Rule for electric generating units in 2005, EPA estimated the direct benefits of reducing mercury emissions by 70% at as little as $400,000 annually. But the agency did not include the results of two peer-reviewed studies (one of which it had funded) in its estimates. One of the two studies estimated the benefits of mercury control at $1.3 billion annually; the second study estimated the benefits at $5.2 billion annually."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["This report examines seven studies that project the costs of the cap-and-trade provisions of H.R. 2454 to 2030 or 2050. It is difficult (and some would consider it unwise) to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events (such as technological breakthroughs) loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled. Hence, long-term cost projections are at best speculative, and should be viewed with attentive skepticism . The finer and more detailed the estimate presented, the greater the skepticism should be. In the words of the late Dr. Lincoln Moses, the first Administrator of the Energy Information Administration: \"There are no facts about the future.\"", "But if models cannot predict the future, they can indicate the sensitivity of a program's provisions to varying economic, technological, and behavioral assumptions that may assist policymakers in designing a greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The various cases examined here do provide some important insights on the costs and benefits of H.R. 2454 and its many provisions.", "First, if enacted, the ultimate cost of H.R. 2454 w ould be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill. The bill provides numerous price, research and development, deployment, and regulatory incentives for technology innovation. The potential for new technology to reduce the costs of H.R. 2454 is not fully analyzed by any of the cases examined, nor can it be. The process of technology development and dissemination is not sufficiently understood at the current time for models to simulate that process with any long-term confidence. In the same vein, it is difficult to determine whether the various incentives provided by the bill are directed in the most optimal manner, as in many cases the bill focuses on specific technologies. ", "Second, the distribution of allowance value (either through free allocations or auction revenue) under H.R. 2454 will determine who bears much of the program's cost. The allowances created by H.R. 2454 (essentially licenses to emit a metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent) will have market value based on supply and demand. Total allowance value could approach or exceed $100 billion (2005$) annually\u2014significantly more than the projected costs to comply with the bill's emissions reduction requirement. H.R. 2454 transfers that value to a wide range of covered and non-covered entities. Entities receiving that value will bear less of the program's costs compared with those who do not. The major impact of H.R. 2454 's allowance allocation scheme is not in changing the costs required to comply with the program's reduction requirement; instead, it is in changing who bears those costs.", "Third, the cases studied generally indicate that the availability of offsets (particularly international offsets) is a major factor in determining the cost of H.R. 2454 . Sensitivity analyses generally found that eliminating international offsets would raise allowance prices by 60% or more. In general, those studies that assumed restrictive (and in some cases, declining) offset supply projected higher allowance prices. Cases that ramped up availability of offsets generally projected lower allowance prices. No case assumed that the full amount of offsets permitted under H.R. 2454 would be available or used immediately in 2012.", "Fourth, the interplay between nuclear power, renewables, natural gas, and coal-fired capacity with carbon capture and storage (CCS) among the cases emphasizes the need for a low-carbon source of electric generating capacity in the mid- to long-term. A considerable amount of low-carbon generation will have to be built under H.R. 2454 in order to meet the reduction requirement. The cases presented here do not agree on the amount of new generating capacity necessary under the bill, or the mix of fuels and technologies that would be employed. The estimated amount of capacity constructed depends on the cases' assumptions about the need for new capacity and replacement/retirement of existing capacity under H.R. 2454 , along with consumer demand response to the rising prices and incentives contained in the bill. Here again, technological development will be critical.", "F ifth , attempts to predict household effects (or conduct other fine-grained analyses) are fraught with numerous difficulties ; estimates generated reflect more on the philosophies and assumptions of the cases reviewed than on any credible future effect. Decisions about appropriate welfare measure, household size, and discounting, and, indeed, the value of government services in general, dwarf any insight that could be gained from such estimates. For example, estimates of household effects in the studies reviewed vary by an order of magnitude, even when normalized by household size and accounting method. Likewise, fine-grained analysis of effects on specific states and/or economic sectors are similarly suspect.", "S ixth , H.R. 2454 ' s climate-related environmental benefit should be considered in a global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort.
