Following ESA enactment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) placed four gray wolf subspecies\u2014the eastern timber wolf, the Mexican wolf, the Texas gray wolf, and the northern Rocky Mountain wolf\u2014on the first ESA list of endangered species. In 1978, FWS replaced the subspecies listings by listing the gray wolf species (Canis lupus) as endangered in all of the conterminous 48 states except Minnesota, where FWS listed it as threatened. In 2011, FWS found that this listing was in error; that more targeted regional units were appropriate for wolves (notably in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest); that a newly recognized species, the eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), not the gray wolf, occupied the Northeast; and that all or parts of 29 eastern states should be removed from the gray wolf's historic range.", "With the exception of experimental populations (Ex Pops) of gray wolves that FWS established in order to reintroduce wolves to selected areas, protections for the gray wolf have diminished as wolf populations have increased in areas such as the Northern Rocky Mountains. The use of distinct population segments (DPSs), a term created in the 1978 ESA amendments, has played a role in reduced protection. Through DPSs, vertebrate species may be divided into distinct groups, based on geography and genetic distinctions for listing purposes.", "Ex Pops of wolves were reintroduced in three regions of the United States in the 1990s: Central Idaho, Yellowstone, and the Blue Range of Arizona and New Mexico. The Ex Pops in Central Idaho and Yellowstone have grown to over 1,650 wolves as of December 31, 2010, while the Mexican gray wolf population of the Blue Range has not surpassed 59 wolves, and as of January 2011 totaled 50.", "ESA protection for wolf DPSs has varied since the first DPSs\u2014Western, Eastern, and Southwestern\u2014were proposed in 2003. Each effort by FWS to delist the wolf or designate a DPS has been rejected by a court or settled by the agency. Most recently, the April 2009 rules that had established and then delisted DPSs in the Western Great Lakes and the Northern Rockies were nullified as a result of litigation. As a consequence, the Northern Rockies wolves resumed their Ex Pop status, meaning they were treated as threatened in most circumstances but were endangered outside of the Ex Pop boundaries. Wolves in the rest of the lower 48 states were again endangered, with the exception of Minnesota wolves, which were threatened.", "The April 2009 rule for the Northern Rockies was the topic of legislation in April 2011, when Congress took the unusual step of directing FWS to delist an endangered species. Section 1713 of P.L. 112-10 required FWS to reissue the 2009 Northern Rockies DPS rule. FWS's reissuance of that rule on May 5, 2011, ended federal protection of the gray wolf in Montana, Idaho, eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, and north-central Utah, but kept the wolf as a listed species in the remainder of the lower 48 states. Also on May 5, 2011, FWS proposed designating a DPS in the Western Great Lakes area and delisting those gray wolves. On October 5, 2011, FWS proposed delisting the wolves in the Wyoming DPS and terminating the Ex Pop. The proposal is contingent upon the Wyoming legislature's passing certain management requirements.", "This report analyzes the ESA as it applies to gray wolves and, in particular, Ex Pops and DPSs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["For centuries, wolf populations have been under pressure by humans. Wolves are carnivores, feeding not only on a variety of animal species smaller than themselves, but also on very large mammals such as bison, elk, and even moose. Wolves are able to prey on large mammals by hunting cooperatively in packs. However, these large species are also favorite game animals for human hunters. In addition to game animals, their prey may include livestock such as cattle and sheep; some people perceive them as a direct threat to humans as well. These habits led to an effort to reduce or eliminate the species. Wolves were eventually eliminated in most states in an effort supported by the science community at the time. But coinciding roughly with the forester Aldo Leopold's essay, \"Killing the Wolf,\" in A Sand County Almanac in 1948, the view that wolves must be eliminated began to change. Leopold wrote the following:", "I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would mean hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.... Since then I have lived to see state after state extirpate its wolves. I have watched the face of many a newly wolfless mountain, and seen the south-facing slopes wrinkle with a maze of new deer trails. I have seen every edible bush and seedling browsed, first to anaemic desuetude, and then to death.", "Leopold's somewhat poetic understanding of predator-prey interactions marked the beginning of a new scientific view of the role of predators in ecosystems. Scientists came to agree that, in the absence of major predators, prey populations would expand until some other factor (usually food) limited their population growth. As seen in a variety of ecosystems, the elimination of major predators devastated plant populations and led to serious reductions in the other species depending on those plants for food, nesting, migration habitat, or concealment or in any species dependent on the undisturbed ecosystem. The disappearance of wolves, eagles and other hawks, bears, and other top carnivores in much of their former ranges contributed to the passage of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973, and ultimately, to the re-introduction of wolves into parts of their former range. And predictably, the conflicts over livestock and game that led to the wolf's near extinction a century ago re-emerged. The ensuing conflicts over wolf management are the topic of this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wolf Populations: A Taxonomic View", "paragraphs": ["To protect gray wolves under the ESA, there needs to be some agreement on what a gray wolf is scientifically. Like many large mammals, such as bears ( Ursus arctos ), mountain lions ( Felis concolor ), and white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ), gray wolves ( Canis lupus ) have a complicated, even convoluted, taxonomic history. Variations in color, size, and bone structure have led some mammalogists to designate wolves in different areas as different subspecies or populations, whereas other experts would recognize only a single species with variability. A few key terms are central to the taxonomic debate discussed below:", "A population is a group of \"organisms of the same species that inhabit a specific area.\" A species is a \"naturally [occurring] population or a group of potentially interbreeding populations that is reproductively isolated (i.e., cannot exchange genetic material) from other such populations or groups.\" A subspecies is a \"taxonomic category that subdivides species into morphologically distinct groups of individuals representing a step toward the production of a new species, although they are still fully capable of interbreeding. Subspecies are usually geographically isolated.\" Taxon , or the plural taxa , is defined as \"a grouping of organisms given a formal taxonomic name at any rank: species, genus, family, order, class, division, phylum, or kingdom.\"", "These terms may appear clear; however, there are no simple measures to draw unequivocal distinctions. Biologists commonly describe their colleagues as lumpers or splitters , based on their inclinations in classifying organisms. As the names suggest, lumpers are those who tend to minimize differences, and see one or a few species, perhaps with some variations, while splitters tend to emphasize those differences, dividing a species into many subspecies, or populations. As one well-known mammalogist once stated, \"Splitters make very small units\u2014their opponents say that if they can tell two animals apart, they place them in different genera, and if they cannot tell them apart, they place them in different species. Lumpers make large units\u2014their opponents say that if a carnivore is neither a dog nor a bear they call it a cat.\"", "For wolves, which are (or were) found in temperate and polar areas throughout the Northern Hemisphere, some observers (splitters) would argue that there are as many as 24 subspecies in North America and 8 in Europe and Asia. More recently, lumpers have had the upper hand in the scientific community. However, that tide may be changing. In May 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) proposed recognizing a third species of wolf, the eastern wolf ( Canis lycaon ), in addition to the gray and red wolf. (See \"2011 Regulatory and Legislative Activity\" below, for more on this announcement.)", "This muddled state of taxonomic affairs is entirely predictable for several reasons. First, wolves are extremely wide-ranging, both as a species and as individuals, so occasional interbreeding among them could certainly confuse the picture. Second, the consistency of variations over time is hard to determine, since long-range studies of long-lived species are rare. Third, evolutionary change does not stop, and wolves are an adaptable species, as shown by their behavior and by their presence in a tremendous variety of ecosystems. The debate among academic scientists also has an air of informed judgment\u2014and there is no reason to predict that the scientific debate will end any time soon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Endangered Species Act", "paragraphs": ["The Endangered Species Act (ESA or the Act) provides for the protection and conservation of species that the FWS or the National Marine Fisheries Service identifies as threatened or endangered.

The practice allows introduction of a species outside its current range to restore it to its historic range.", "Two criteria must be met to establish an experimental population under the law. First, the Department of the Interior (DOI) must authorize the release of the population. Second, the population must be \"wholly separate geographically from nonexperimental populations of the species.\" Congress required the separation so that the introduced population could be clearly distinguished from existing populations of the species.", "Under the ESA, members of an Ex Pop generally are treated as threatened, and are eligible for special rules.

The committee also expects that, where appropriate, the regulations could allow for the directed taking of experimental populations. For example, the release of experimental populations of predators, such as red wolves, could allow for the taking of these animals if depredations occur or if the release of these populations will continue to be frustrated by public opposition.", "Section 10(j)(2)(B) of the ESA requires FWS to determine whether the Ex Pop is essential to the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species, otherwise the Ex Pop is deemed nonessential.

In 1973 the definition included \"any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants and any other group of fish or wildlife of the same species or smaller taxa in common spatial arrangement that interbreed when mature.\" In 1978 Congress amended that definition to include the term distinct population segment (DPS), which was limited to vertebrates. The change was controversial.", "The General Accounting Office (GAO) (now the Government Accountability Office) recommended limiting the definition of species to higher taxonomic categories than populations, and excluding all distinct populations, including geographically separated populations. GAO proposed the following definition: \"The term 'species' includes any subspecies of fish, wildlife, or plants.\" ", "Congress did not follow the GAO recommendation. It agreed with FWS that the service needed to be able to adopt different management practices for different populations, based on need. A Senate committee report discussing populations said, \"the committee agrees that there may be instances in which FWS should provide for different levels of protection for populations of the same species,\" but advised that the practice be used \"sparingly and only when the biological evidence indicates that such action is warranted.\"", "Thus, Congress revised and limited the definition of species in 1978 by eliminating taxonomic categories below subspecies from the definition, except for vertebrates. The revised, and still current, definition is \"any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.\" However, the phrase distinct population segment had no meaning in the scientific community outside of the ESA, and was not used in ESA listings by FWS for nearly two decades."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulatory History of DPSs", "paragraphs": ["A DPS refers generally to a portion of a listed species that is separated from the rest of the species by genetic distinction and range.

The Policy contains the criteria that must be met for a species to be protected at the population level. First, the population segment must be discrete. Factors considered to determine discreteness are whether the segment is \"markedly separated from other populations of the same taxon as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral factors.\" Discreteness can also be found if the population is delimited by international governmental boundaries. Although state boundaries are frequently used to describe a DPS, they cannot be used under the Policy to determine discreteness.", "Next, the population segment must be found to be significant, meaning its demise would be an important loss of genetic diversity. Four factors are listed in the Policy for determining a species' significance: (1) persistence of the segment in an ecological setting unusual or unique for the taxon; (2) evidence that loss of the DPS would result in a significant gap in the range of the taxon; (3) evidence that the DPS represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon within its historic range; or (4) evidence that the DPS differs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic characteristics. Genetic evidence may be considered but is not required. The Policy indicates that \"available scientific evidence of the discrete population segment's importance\" will be considered in finding significance, but does not specify the best available scientific evidence.", "If a species is found to be both discrete and significant, then its status is reviewed to see whether it is endangered or threatened. The same criteria are used for a DPS listing as for any other listing. The determination must be based solely on the \"best scientific and commercial data available.\"", "According to the Policy, agency efficiency and focus were two intended benefits of DPSs.

States have traditionally worked closely with the federal agencies that manage lands where hunting occurs to set harvest quotas, and Forest Service regulations also provide that wilderness designations do not change the state's right to control fish and game. It appears that the Wyoming plan is to be a formal proposal to prohibit wolf hunting in those Forest Service wilderness areas under state law.

The wolf population in the area was estimated at 1,651 for 2010.", "In 2008 FWS changed the special rule. FWS determined that the definition of unacceptable impact had to be altered, as wolves were not the primary cause in ungulate population decreases. Accordingly, the definition was modified to mean: \"Impact to a wild ungulate population or herd where a State or Tribe has determined that wolves are one of the major causes of the population or herd not meeting established State or Tribal population or herd management goals.\" Public and peer reviews are still required. The plan allows a state to kill wolves, provided the experimental population does not go below 20 breeding pairs in the state. Additionally, wolves found by wildlife officials to be hybrids may be killed.", "The 2008 Rule also expands the provision for killing wolves when they are in the act of attacking livestock or dogs. The 2005 Rule allowed an individual to \"take\" a wolf that was in the act of attacking stock animals or dogs on private property.
