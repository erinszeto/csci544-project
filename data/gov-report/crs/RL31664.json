The cost of this protection is shared by the retiree (in the form of reductions from monthly military retired pay after retirement), the government, and possibly the beneficiary (under certain types of coverage). The original intended purpose of the SBP (and its antecedents) is to \"insure that the surviving dependents of military personnel who die in retirement or after becoming eligible for retirement will continue to have a reasonable level of income.\" Coverage was later expanded to active duty personnel as well. ", "The Survivor Benefit Plan was created by legislation enacted on September 21, 1972, and has been modified by later legislation. The SBP replaced the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan (RSFPP). The RSFPP was replaced because it had a number of unpopular features that made it unattractive. The RSFPP could be expensive for the retiree; the cost was approximately $0.23 of deducted retired pay per dollar of survivor benefits for a retired member age 45 who elected to provide coverage for a spouse who was 5 full years younger. The RSFPP was intended to be actuarially neutral in terms of costs\u2014in other words, the cost of this program was fully paid for by its participants. The decision to elect RSFPP coverage had to be made by the prospective military retiree before his or her 18 th year of military service. Furthermore, the methods used in computing the RSFPP's cost and benefit could change between the time at which the servicemember elected to provide coverage and the time at which the member actually retired. Thus, the costs and benefits remained an unknown quantity, limiting the ability of the retiree to make future financial plans. During its 19-year history, participation in the RSFPP never exceeded more than 15% of eligible military retirees. It was expected\u2014and has largely been proven\u2014that the SBP would be a significant improvement over the RSFPP, in terms of participation rates, costs to the retiree, and benefits for the survivors.

For those eligible for both, military retired pay was offset or reduced, dollar for dollar, by VA disability benefits.", "Numerous attempts to address this issue over the past few years or so resulted initially in the creation of \"Combat Related Special Compensation\" for certain disabled military retirees whose disability was a direct result of military combat operations or training and whose disability is rated at 10% or more.", "Later, in FY2004, Congress authorized concurrent receipt for all retirees with at least a 50% disability, regardless of the cause of the disability. However, 100% disabled retirees were entitled to immediate concurrent receipt effective January 1, 2005.", "Although such changes do not affect the receipt of an SBP annuity, some have claimed that if concurrent receipt or \"special pays\" for military retirees is allowed, such should also be afforded their survivors. Under this reasoning, if a military retiree is allowed to receive both military retired pay and VA disability payments or other \"special pay\", it is only fair that the surviving spouse also receive both the SBP annuity and DIC benefits. Critics contend that concurrent receipt was originally barred because Congress viewed it as \"double dipping\" or paying someone twice for the same period of service. These critics reason that allowing concurrent receipt to the retiree or the retiree's survivor are forms of \"double dipping\" that are inherently unfair to the taxpayer.", "In order to avoid this SBP-DIC offset, surviving spouses of active duty personnel are allowed to designate their children, if any, as the recipient of the SBP benefit. Unlike retirees, active duty personnel do not designate a beneficiary. (As stated earlier, children remain eligible to receive SBP until they reach age 18 or 22; or for life if mentally or physically incapacitated and if the incapacitating condition existed prior to age 18. Eligibility terminates if the child marries.)", "The Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 contained a provision that woud eliminate the SBP-DIC offset entirely. This language was dropped by the conference committee prior to final passage. Again, the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 contained a provision that would eliminate the SBP-DIC offset entirely. This language was, too, dropped by the conference committee prior to final passage. In both the FY2008 and FY2010 National Defense Authorization Acts, language was included to eliminate this offset; and again was dropped by the conferees. Legislation ( H.R. 775 ) was introduced but did not pass in the 111 th Congress to eliminate the offset. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of eliminating this offset would be $7.0 billion over the 2010-2019 period. Despite the additional cost to the taxpayer, critics note that having eliminated the Social Security offset lead to \"double dipping.\" Eliminating the SBP-DIC offset, they contend, would lead to \"triple dipping\" in that the survivor(s) would be eligible to receive three overlapping government benefits based on the same military career."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA)", "paragraphs": ["Effective 2009, Congress created the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance or SSIA. As originally created, beginning in 2009, those subject to the SBP-DIC offset began receiving an additional $50 per month. This amount was scheduled to be increased by $10 each year until 2014 when it would reach $100. The benefit was scheduled to end in 2016. However, during the 111 th Congress, SSIA was made more generous in that for the years 2014 through 2017, the amount would increase from $150, to $200, $275, and finally, $310, after which the benefit will terminate on October 1, 2017. The amount received under SSIA may not be greater than the amount of the SBP-DIC offset. (SSIA was extended to survivors of active duty members later in October, 2008.) Although, again a generous increase at no cost to the retiree, critics have called the creation of SSIA a form of \"triple dipping.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Retiree and Government Contributions to SBP", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, the cost of the SBP is shared by the government and the retirees. The amount paid by a particular retiree varies depending on level of coverage, years of payments, years the survivor receives an annuity, etc. For active duty personnel who make no contributions, the benefit is essentially free. Certain retirees and organizations representing their interests have claimed that, as originally structured, withholdings from retired pay for SBP were expected, on average, 40% of the cost of this benefit. Further it is claimed that since retirees are living longer and since the government has manipulated the withholdings formula, the retirees' share has increased to more than 73%. These claims are made in an effort to increase government payments into the SBP in hopes of increasing benefits (particularly with regard to the apparently successful effort of eliminating the reduction in benefits that occurs when the surviving spouse reaches age 62).", "In reviewing these claims, a number of points may be considered. First, as noted, there is no legal mandate for any ratio of retiree to government contributions. Second, such claims of a shift in the retiree/government share appear to be based on a selective use of retiree data. Third, the claim that retirees are living longer and paying more ignores the obvious point that survivors, too, are living longer and collecting more. Fourth, the above history of this benefit shows that Congress has expanded eligibility (including \"free\" benefits to \"forgotten widows\" and active duty survivors), increased benefits, reduced costs, will eliminate withholdings under the \"paid-up provision\" afforded supplemental coverage, etc. At no time did Congress reduce the benefit. As such, the claims that the government's contribution to SBP have been reduced are unreliable. Nor do such claims rationalize the increase of benefits at age 62 for surviving spouses (a change that arguably creates a superior benefit relative to those available to the survivors of other federal employees).", "It is noteworthy that after the SBP was introduced, the FY1973 cost to retirees was $36,145,000 with a fiscal year payment to families of only $5,700,000. This is due to the relatively small number of participants who died shortly after signing up. Ten years later, as more retirees signed up and more died, the FY1983 cost to retirees grew to $652,536,000 while the payment to families grew to $406,887,000. In FY1993, as participant deaths increased, the cost to retirees was $822,955,000 with payments to families reaching $1,177,185,000. Finally, in FY2005, costs to retirees were reported to be $1,099,363,000 while payments to families surged to $2,253,728,000. From 1973 through 2005, the cumulative cost to retirees was $22,597,064,000 while cumulative payments to families was $30,923,249,000. Considering the cumulative payments by retirees and to military families, the government paid $8,326,185,000 more in benefits to families than it received. The cost to retiree/family payment gap will grow as the age 62 reduction is phased out and the \"paid-up provision\" is implemented. From this perspective, if the cost/benefit share has shifted, the shift has been in the favor of recipients with taxpayers assuming an increasing cost of the program. In FY2009, 874,613 were making payments into SBP with a cumulative cost to retirees of $27,340,043,000 and cumulative payments of $43,084,459,000.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 directed Comptroller General to report on the actuarial soundness of the Survivor Benefit Plan.", "On July 26, 2006, the Government Accountability Office issued its report.

Of this amount, Treasury and DOD will be responsible for an estimated $23.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. DOD's $1.5 billion liability includes $1.3 billion in normal costs for current active duty and full-time reservists (full-time employees) and $0.2 billion in normal costs for current part-time reservists (part-time employees).", "\u2013 Periodically, Congress has allowed an open season for SBP enrollment, the most current one being during fiscal year 2006.

Of this amount, Treasury will be responsible for an estimated $2.4 billion, and DOD will be responsible for $0.1 billion in normal costs related to current full-time employees.", "\u2013 Extending SBP surviving spouse or child benefits for all personnel who are killed in the line of duty and are not eligible for retirement at the time of their deaths increased the SBP liability by an estimated $72 million as of September 30, 2001.

Using conservative assumptions, the DOD OOA calculated that the SBP liability would increase by an estimated $2.2 million if retirees were allowed the option of choosing a second insurable interest. Of this increase, Treasury would be responsible for $2 million and DOD for $231,000. Of DOD's $231,000, $211,000 would be for normal costs related to current full-time employees and $20,000 for normal costs related to current part-time employees.", "\u2013 The survivors of veterans who die because of complications resulting from a service-connected disease or injury are entitled to DIC benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Under current law, SBP benefits for survivors of retired veterans are offset by any DIC payments received. The DOD OOA calculated that eliminating the current offset requirement would increase the SBP liability by an estimated $12.9 billion. Of this amount, Treasury and DOD would be responsible for $12.3 billion and $645 million, respectively.
