In some instances, research activity may straddle several different missions and thrust areas. S&T and the Department must prioritize this consolidated research budget, which is substantially reduced from recent fiscal years, to focus on areas with the greatest promise for delivering material improvements or tangible contributions to homeland security missions in the near term. This flexibility in funding should facilitate that effort and partially offset the impact of an overall funding reduction.", "In budget requests since FY2012, the S&T Directorate provided a more detailed description of its planned activities within the RD&I PPA. It identified spending by R&D topic, which provided greater insight into the relative funding between these subjects.", "For FY2014, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations again objected to the consolidated RD&I PPA structure. Both committees would have directed the S&T Directorate to divide the RD&I PPA into six PPAs: Apex, Border Security, Disaster Resilience, Cybersecurity, and Chem/Bio/Radiological/Nuclear/Explosives Defense.

For FY2015, the DHS has requested 1.072 billion.", "The reductions in appropriated funding in FY2011 and FY2012 illustrated several competing priorities within the S&T Directorate. One is establishing the appropriate balance between long-term R&D investments and near-term operational needs. As described in 2011 by the House Committee on Appropriations, ", "The Committee believes that S&T must more clearly demonstrate significant contributions to the homeland security mission and should prioritize the development of near-term, operational projects that promise substantive gains to our Nation's security ... The Committee believes that S&T has a meaningful role to play within DHS and affirms that this reduction will change the nature and scope of S&T's research ... S&T has not fully justified the billions of taxpayer dollars that it has spent on R&D, and the Committee believes these revised funding levels will force the Directorate to concentrate its efforts on its highest priority projects.", "Another is balancing maintenance of federal research infrastructure and investment in R&D activities performed by industry or academic stakeholders. While the construction and development of DHS infrastructure provides a location and organization to homeland security R&D activities, costs associated with construction, operations, and maintenance of such infrastructure have increased. In a declining S&T Directorate budget, these infrastructure costs compete with programmatic R&D funding. As described in 2012 by former Under Secretary O'Toole, ", "Today, when new facilities or major infrastructure repairs are required, agency leaders and Congress often face the choice of having to use research budgets to fund infrastructure costs or pursuing promising research while delaying needed repairs and construction. Shifting research funds to infrastructure often means accepting the loss of existing, not-yet-matured research investments and facing significant opportunity costs ... Effective innovation is the core of the U.S. economy and U.S. national security; it requires investment in both facilities and research and development (R&D). The U.S. must robustly fund both of these activities in order to maintain the capability needed to respond to the diverse threats.", "The increase in S&T Directorate funding may alleviate some tension in meeting these priorities, as the fraction of the RDA&O account dedicated to R&D activities returns to a level similar to prior years. Planned infrastructure costs associated with the construction of the National Bio and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF) and decontamination and demolition of Plum Island Animal Disease Center, however, may increase this tension in the future. The conference report accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ), addressed this concern: \"If additional funds are to be considered for NBAF in fiscal year 2014, or any fiscal year thereafter, such funds must be in addition to the Department's enacted budget, thereby not displacing resources for Departmental programs.\" ", "A third priority is balancing between performing R&D activities and providing other types of S&T assistance to other DHS components, such as consulting on concepts of operation, developing future technology concepts, and overseeing test and evaluation.

Similarly, Apex project planning activities may be more holistic, with operational considerations built into project planning at an earlier stage relative to non-Apex projects.", "The Apex project approach may prove advantageous when compared with traditional R&D investment because of the involvement of senior operational component officials in setting priorities. In the past, the S&T Directorate has experienced significant challenges in successfully transitioning R&D results into operational environments. Reasons underlying these challenges include a failure of R&D projects to reflect leadership priorities, lack of further investment, ambiguous operational requirements, insufficient user demand, failure to devise an appropriate and timely commercialization strategy or acquisition process, and lack of integration into concepts of operation. The structure of Apex projects may ameliorate some of these challenges through increased commitment by senior DHS policy makers and explicit integration of the technology solution into the operational environment.", "On the other hand, uncertainties attending the budgets and schedules for Apex projects may increase their risk of failure or underperformance. The S&T Directorate expects funding for an Apex project to be larger than it has typically invested in previous individual projects since Apex project investments extend through deployment. Such increased investment may lead to a correspondingly higher success rate, but it may make each failure more costly. The need to support multiple simultaneous Apex projects may strain S&T Directorate funding unless Congress provides additional funds expressly for these projects. If Congress instead supports Apex projects but does not provide additional funding for them, the S&T Directorate may be required to shift funding away from other priorities to meet the Apex projects' needs. Since the Apex projects are a new effort, the S&T Directorate additionally has little data to estimate their future rate of successes or required durations. Thus, it is unclear how quickly Apex projects will address high-priority, near-term problems and whether the use of Apex projects to solve urgent short-timeframe problems will come at the expense of solutions to long-term, fundamental problems.", "The S&T Directorate had two Apex projects in FY2013, has capacity for a total of three or four simultaneous Apex projects, and anticipates starting new Apex projects with additional DHS components. One Apex project with the U.S. Secret Service was successfully completed. The other Apex-like project with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was terminated by mutual agreement.

Such a formal process might increase agency predictability, potentially allowing the private sector greater access to and notice of S&T Directorate funding opportunities. It might also increase transparency with respect to the S&T Directorate's priorities and its progress toward meeting them. However, such a mandate might also have drawbacks. Rigid long-term planning might limit flexibility and responsiveness within the S&T Directorate's activities due to adherence to the long-term plan and its interdependencies. For example, the S&T Directorate might less readily react to the results of its portfolio review process or shift funds between projects if it had already developed a formal multiyear plan for those projects.

In general though, GAO has found mixed opinions among DHS operational component staff regarding S&T Directorate coordination.", "According to DHS, the S&T Directorate has limited capabilities and staffing in this area and must be selective regarding the extent of acquisition support it can provide. If the S&T Directorate increases its role in acquisition support, but maintains a constant workforce size, this acquisition support may compete with R&D program oversight and development responsibilities. On the other hand, if the S&T Directorate integrates its program managers more closely into the activities of the DHS operational components, the R&D it does manage may become more successful at meeting those components' needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Testing and Evaluation Role", "paragraphs": ["The ASOA Division oversees operational testing and evaluation of major acquisition programs through the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation (T&E). This office develops and implements department-wide operational T&E policies and procedures. As the designated independent oversight authority for operational testing within DHS, it approves Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs), which describe the necessary tasks that must be conducted in order to determine system technical performance and operational effectiveness. The Office of Operational T&E provides oversight for approximately 135 DHS major acquisition programs. According to DHS, it \"ensures each acquisition has a robust T&E strategy to test, verify progress towards meeting specific requirements, and ultimately ensure through formal validation via operational test and evaluation that acquisitions meet operational requirements.\"", "The GAO has found that the S&T Directorate has met some but not all of its T&E oversight responsibilities. The GAO found that additional steps were needed to ensure that all requirements were met and identified specific challenges the S&T Directorate experienced.", "[S&T] and DHS component officials stated that they face challenges in overseeing T&E across DHS components which fell into 4 categories: (1) ensuring that a program's operational requirements\u2014the key performance requirements that must be met for a program to achieve its intended goals\u2014can be effectively tested; (2) working with DHS component program staff who have limited T&E expertise and experience; (3) using existing T&E directives and guidance to oversee complex information technology acquisitions; and (4) ensuring that components allow sufficient time for T&E while remaining within program cost and schedule estimates. ", "The GAO recommended that the S&T Directorate more robustly document its approvals of operational test agents, reviews of component acquisition documents, and the extent to which acquisition documents meet the requirements of departmental test and evaluation directives. In response to the GAO recommendations, the S&T Directorate issued additional policies detailing test and evaluation oversight procedures with discrete criteria to track operational test agents and acquisition documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Options", "paragraphs": ["Congressional policy makers might refine the S&T Directorate's role in acquisition and T&E by codifying existing activities or expanding the S&T Directorate's role in supporting acquisition and T&E by other DHS components."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Expand Integration of R&D and Acquisition", "paragraphs": ["One way to strengthen the relationship between R&D and procurement might be greater integration through operational components co-funding S&T Directorate activities, so that the entity that performs R&D also procures its results. In theory, this approach could allow for a seamless flow of information between those setting the requirements and those developing the technologies. This integration might allow requirements to be more easily amended to take into account new information discovered during the development process. Some policy makers may view the increased role of the S&T Directorate in providing acquisition support and operational analysis as a first step in developing a more integrated R&D and acquisition process. Congressional policy makers might encourage greater integration between the acquiring component and the S&T Directorate either by authorizing specific joint projects or linking funding for acquisition to specific R&D programs within the S&T Directorate.", "However, according to GAO, a managerial best practice involves separating acquisition and R&D responsibilities in order to reduce the possibility that prior involvement in the R&D process might influence procurement decisions. In 2010, GAO testified in the context of DNDO's CAARS program that", "separating technology development from product development and acquisition is a best practice that can help reduce costs and deliver a product on time and within budget because separation of the technology development phase from production in particular helps to ensure that (1) a sound business case is made for the product, (2) product design is stable, and (3) production processes are mature and the design is reliable.", "An integrated R&D and acquisition process may lead agencies to continue unsuccessful procurement efforts longer than is cost effective due to a history of investment in the underlying R&D and an institutional attachment to the success of that investment. Similarly, having procurement, R&D, and possibly operations within the same component might create budgetary competition between these functions. For example, officials might reduce funding for the development of next-generation detectors in order to acquire additional current-generation detectors or to operate or support detectors already deployed. Such budgetary tradeoffs might occur via a higher decision-making authority or be viewed differently if different parts of DHS performed next-generation R&D, acquired current technology, or operated and supported fielded equipment.

One such directive requires the Under Secretary for Science and Technology to establish T&E policies and processes through the Director, Test and Evaluation Standards Division (TSD), and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). Providing statutory authority for these roles might help to maintain the independence of testing and evaluation, but it also might inhibit DHS's ability to restructure or reform T&E oversight.", "Congress could expand the test and evaluation funding or staff within the S&T Directorate in order to strengthen S&T Directorate oversight of test and evaluation. Such additional funding or staff might enable the S&T Directorate to oversee more acquisition activities, reduce time pressure, and increase effectiveness. In the current fiscal environment, however, additional resources may need to be taken from some other priority; policy makers may have to weigh the relative value of shifting such funding.", "Congress might expand the role of the S&T Directorate in testing and evaluation oversight. Such an expanded role might be informal or formal in nature. For example, Congress might require the S&T Directorate to provide operational components with the ability to consult with test and evaluation experts in the S&T Directorate, but not require the operational components to rely on such consultation. In contrast, Congress might formalize the current or an expanded role for the S&T Directorate in the DHS acquisition and test and evaluation process. This formalized role might slow technology acquisition due to the need to involve the S&T Directorate in more component activities, since not all components use the acquisition support services of the S&T Directorate. Additionally, such a codification of agency process might reduce the ability of DHS to alter its own processes in order to quickly or flexibly address an emerging challenge. However, it also might increase the quality of technology acquisitions, reducing the potential for purchasing suboptimal technologies.", "Alternatively, congressional policy makers might reduce the responsibilities of the S&T Directorate with respect to test and evaluation. Within DHS, the Under Secretary for Management generally oversees major acquisition. Oversight of operational test and evaluation activities might be transferred to the Under Secretary for Management.
