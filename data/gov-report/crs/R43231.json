As a result, there is interest among some parties in exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil to take advantage of international markets. This has placed new attention on the laws and regulations governing, and in many cases restricting, the export of fossil fuels.", "In most cases, export of fossil fuels requires federal authorization of both the act of exporting the fuel and the facility that will be employed to export the fuel. For example, the export of natural gas is permitted by the Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy, while the construction and operation of the export facility must be authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Oil exports are restricted, but an export that falls under one of several exemptions can be authorized by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security. Oil pipelines that cross international borders must be permitted by the State Department. Coal exports do not require special authorization specific to the commodity; however, as with natural gas and crude oil, other generally applicable federal statutes and regulations may apply to the export of coal.", "Restrictions on exports of fossil fuels could potentially have implications under international trade rules. They may possibly be inconsistent with the most favored nation requirement of Article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) if certain World Trade Organization (WTO) members are treated differently than others. Limits on exports could also potentially violate the prohibition on export restrictions contained in Article XI of the GATT 1994 if they prescribe vague and unspecified criteria for export licensing. However, an export licensing regime does not appear to constitute a \"subsidy\" to downstream users of fossil fuels under WTO rules.", "Article XXI, the exception for essential security interests, may provide justification for potential violations of GATT Articles I and XI. The United States has traditionally considered this exception to be self-judging. However, it is possible that a panel or the Appellate Body might scrutinize the United States' use of the exception.", "Article XX of the GATT provides additional exceptions that a member country may invoke if it is found to be in violation of any GATT obligations. For example, WTO members may maintain an otherwise GATT inconsistent measure if it is necessary to protect an exhaustible natural resource or necessary to protect human health or the environment. Article XIII potentially requires that if an otherwise GATT inconsistent measure is permitted to remain in force due to an Article XX exception, the measure must be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner. Export restrictions that treat WTO members differently would appear not to satisfy the potential nondiscriminatory requirements of Article XIII."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Partly as a result of the increased use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from shale formations in the United States, the domestic supply of natural gas has increased relative to demand, leading to lower domestic prices.

Whether an export license is required depends on several factors, including the nature of the item, its end use, and its ultimate destination. The EAR provides instructions for exporters to follow when determining whether an export transaction is subject to the EAR and, if so, whether the transaction requires a license.", "Other general requirements may apply to transactions involving the export of items from the United States.

The regulations further provide that BIS will issue licenses for certain crude oil exports that fall under one of the listed exemptions, including (i) exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet; (ii) exports to Canada for consumption or use therein; (iii) exports in connection with refining or exchange of strategic petroleum reserve oil; (iv) exports of heavy California crude oil up to an average volume not to exceed 25,000 barrels per day; (v) exports that are consistent with certain international agreements; (vi) exports that are consistent with findings made by the President under certain statutes; and (vii) exports of foreign origin crude oil where, based on satisfactory written documentation, the exporter can demonstrate that the oil is not of U.S. origin and has not been commingled with oil of U.S. origin.

The regulations provide that while BIS \"will consider all applications for approval,\" generally BIS will approve only those applications that are either for temporary exports (e.g., a pipeline that crosses an international border before returning to the United States), or are for transactions (1) that result directly in importation of an equal or greater quantity and quality of crude oil; (2) that take place under contracts that can be terminated if petroleum supplies of the United States are threatened; and (3) for which the applicant can demonstrate that for compelling economic or technological reasons, the crude oil cannot reasonably be marketed in the United States.", "The regulations also provide for a few enumerated exceptions to the general license requirement.

Title III of this act transferred all functions of the Federal Power Commission to DOE except for those subsequently assigned to FERC in Title IV.", "Title III of the DOE Organization Act thus transferred the authority to authorize natural gas imports and exports from the Federal Power Commission to DOE.

In order to construct any port facility, permits must be obtained from ACE, which will review applications to see that they are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act.

The panel rejected this argument, stating that although a restriction on exports of a good may result in lower prices for domestic users of that good, the restriction was not an explicit command or direction by the government to private parties to sell the good within the meaning of the SCM Agreement.

The bill would allow the President to waive this requirement for a lease in certain circumstances, including when a waiver is necessary under an international agreement. In addition, S. 435 , the American Oil for American Families Act of 2013, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Robert Menendez. The bill would ban the export of crude oil or refined petroleum products derived from federal lands (including land on the Outer Continental Shelf).", "Various other bills introduced in the 113 th Congress seek to loosen restrictions on, or expedite the federal government's consideration of approvals for, the export of oil or natural gas to certain foreign countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Recent advances in natural gas exploration and production technology have led to a newfound interest in the possibility of expanding U.S. fossil fuel exports. Such exports, and the facilities needed to conduct export operations, are subject to a panoply of federal laws and regulations. These include the authorizations required by the Natural Gas Act, a generic ban on crude oil exports, and various laws and regulations applicable to construction and operation of export facilities. Currently, any party wishing to export fossil fuels must comply with these laws and regulations.", "Under international trade rules, restrictions on exports of fossil fuels could potentially be difficult to reconcile with Articles I and XI of the GATT 1994. Article XXI, the exception for essential security interests, may be cited in order to justify potential violations of GATT Articles I and XI. The United States has traditionally considered this exception to be self-judging. However, it is possible that a panel or the Appellate Body might scrutinize the United States' use of the exception. ", "Article XX of the GATT provides additional exceptions that a member country may invoke if it is found to be in violation of any GATT obligations. However, Article XIII potentially requires that if an otherwise GATT inconsistent measure is permitted to remain in force due to an Article XX exception, the measure must be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner. Export restrictions that treat WTO members differently would appear not to satisfy the potential nondiscriminatory requirements of Article XIII."], "subsections": []}]}}
