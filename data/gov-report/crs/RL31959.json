It is not an attempt to comprehensivelyreview and re-write existing foreign aid legislation, but rather it is a first step in providing necessaryauthorization for program appropriations in FY2005 and updating selected legislative provisions toreflect current policy. Committee Chairman Lugar said that it was his intent to launch a moreambitious effort later that would revamp the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and other long-standingforeign aid laws.

Title XXV consists of several provisions, some of which address Africa and Latin Americaissues, including additional aid for Haiti.", "The legislation authorizes the appropriation of about $16.9 billion for 22 foreign assistance programs, closely matching the account structure of the annual Foreign Operations appropriationsfor bilateral economic and military aid.

The bill requires the Secretary of State to prepare and submit to Congress reportsassessing the threat of a radiological attack on U.S. missions. The bill further authorizes theSecretary to aid foreign countries, or propose that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)develop programs, helping foreign first responders identify and address threats posed by radioactivematerials.", "The legislation also includes the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act, authorizing $35 million for FY2005 to enhance the capability of developing nations to detect, identify, and contain infectiousdisease outbreaks, whether naturally occurring or the result of a bioterrorist attack. The measureincludes several provisions that are intended to support and strengthen the disease surveillancecapabilities of developing nations.

Priorto 1985 beginning in the mid-1950s, it had been the congressional practice to debateand approve general foreign aid legislation either annually or biennially. Thesedebates frequently evolved into a wide-ranging consideration of U.S. foreign policythat went well beyond discussions of economic and military assistance programs. Assuch, the legislation was frequently marked by controversy, internal congressionaldisagreements concerning international issues, and disputes between the executiveand legislative branches regarding Presidential management of foreign policy. Inseveral years since 1985, Congress considered foreign aid authorizing measures, butthe bills failed to reach final passage. (1) In the interim,lawmakers have approved morenarrowly focused, \"single-issue\" foreign aid authorization bills, such as the Supportfor East European Democracy (SEED) Act (1989), the FREEDOM Support Act(1992), the International Malaria Control Act (2000), and the more recently enactedUnited States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. ", "Lack of Administration support for foreign aid bills has been a continuing obstacle to enactment over the past 18 years. The Clinton Administration submitteddraft legislation in 1994 seeking to re-write the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, butin most cases, the executive has opposed or not encouraged consideration of broadforeign assistance measures which were perceived as intrusions into Presidentialflexibility in managing foreign policy or excessive congressional earmarking.", "In the absence of omnibus foreign aid authorizations, the majority of the foreign assistance legislation has been enacted as part of annual Foreign Operationsappropriation measures. Over the past 19 years, these appropriation bills increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played a majorrole in shaping, authorizing, and guiding both executive and congressional foreignaid and broader foreign policy initiatives. It has been largely through ForeignOperations appropriations that the United States has modified aid policy and resourceallocation priorities since the end of the Cold War. Legislation authorizing U.S.participation in most multilateral development bank replenishments since the early1980s has been incorporated into Foreign Operation measures. The legislation andcompanion supplemental appropriation bills have also been the channel throughwhich the President has utilized foreign aid as a tool in the global war on terrorismsince the attacks of September 11, 2001. Earlier this year, the President's newforeign aid initiative -- the Millennium Challenge Corporation -- was authorizedwith the FY2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. Appropriation measures have also been a key instrument used by Congress to apply restrictions and conditionson Administration management of foreign assistance, actions that have frequentlyresulted in executive-legislative clashes similar to those that occurred previously inauthorization debates.", "Last year, the Foreign Relations Committee reported a similar bill -- S. 1161 -- characterizing the action as effort to \"reinforce\" theCommittee's role in foreign assistance policy making. (2) Chairman Lugar noted duringthe Committee's markup of that bill that it was not an attempt to comprehensivelyreview and re-write existing foreign aid legislation. Rather, S. 1161 represented a first step in providing necessary authorization for programappropriations in FY2004 and updating selected legislative provisions to reflectcurrent policy. Senator Lugar said that it was his intent to launch a more ambitiouseffort in the future to revamp the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and otherlong-standing foreign aid laws.", "After being folded into S. 925 (the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2004), the Senate debated on July 9 and 10, 2003, the foreign aidauthorizing legislation, adopting several amendments but without coming to a finalvote. S. 2144 is a continuation of the 2003 Committee's effort to steeran omnibus foreign policy authorizing bill for FY2005 through the Senate forconsideration by the House-Senate conference committee. The House approved onJuly 16, 2003, companion legislation ( H.R. 1950 ) that includes many ofthe same provisions on State Department operations and security assistance issuesas the new Senate measure, but does not address economic aid programs.

Infectious disease outbreaks need notoriginate in the United States to pose a threat to the nation.", "Global surveillance, especially for newly recognized infectious diseases, is crucial to responding to and containing microbial threats before isolated outbreaksdevelop into regional or worldwide pandemics. Key components of an effectivesurveillance system include trained epidemiologists, a network of modern fullyequipped laboratories able to isolate and identify emerging pathogens, and a publichealth communications infrastructure to transmit and share information on diseaseoutbreaks. In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the GlobalAlert and Response Network to monitor and track infectious disease outbreaks inevery region of the world. But the WHO network is only as strong as its individualcomponents. Many developing nations lack the trained personnel, laboratoryfacilities, and public health infrastructure to detect emerging pathogens and trackevolving disease patterns.
