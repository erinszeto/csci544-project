Two changes ultimately enacted include requiring the advice and consent of the Senate and establishing a commission to recommend names to the President. ", "Other bills proposed making the Architect a congressional appointee. These included proposals to make the Architect subject to a joint appointment by the Speaker and President pro tempore; alternating appointment between the Speaker and President pro tempore; and a commission of Members recommending candidates to the Speaker and President pro tempore, with ratification by the chambers.

", "Questions have previously been raised about the authority of Congress to vest itself, or more specifically congressional leadership, with the power to appoint the Architect. These questions generally relate to whether the AOC's nonlegislative functions\u2014including facility responsibilities for the Supreme Court and the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building and membership on several nonlegislative governing or advisory bodies \u2014make the Architect an \"Officer of the United States\" such that his or her appointment cannot be made by Congress consistent with the requirements of the Appointments Clause (Clause) of the Constitution. Under the Clause, \"officers of the United States,\" defined primarily as officials that exercise \"significant authority\" in a \"continuing\" office, must either be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, or, in the case of \"inferior officers,\" by the \"President alone, [] the Courts of Law, or [] the Heads of Departments.\" ", "Whether the functions and responsibilities exercised by a government official rise to the level of \"significant authority\" is not easily determined. Consistent with this ambiguity, it does not appear that Congress has adopted a uniform interpretation of the Clause's applicability to the Architect. Nonetheless, the executive branch has previously concluded that \"functions simply involving the management of governmental property\" are generally not considered significant for purposes of the Clause. Thus, to the extent that concerns over congressional appointment of the Architect relate to his management of nonlegislative property, it would appear that such functions may not, on their own, prevent Congress from choosing to retain the power of appointment for itself.
