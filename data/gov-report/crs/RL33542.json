Broadband access, along with the content and services it might enable, has the potential to transform the Internet: both what it offers and how it is used. It is possible that many of the future applications that will best exploit the technological capabilities of broadband have yet to be developed. There are multiple transmission media or technologies that can be used to provide broadband access. These include cable; an enhanced telephone service called digital subscriber line (DSL); fiber-to-the-home (FTTH); satellite, mobile, and fixed wireless (including \"wi-fi\" and \"Wi-Max\"); broadband over powerlines (BPL); and others.", "From a public policy perspective, the goals are to ensure that broadband deployment is timely and contributes to the nation's economic growth, that industry competes fairly, and that affordable and high-quality service is provided to all sectors and geographical locations of American society. The federal government\u2014through Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\u2014is seeking to ensure fair competition among the players so that broadband will be available and affordable in a timely manner to all Americans who want it.", "Some areas of the nation\u2014particularly rural and low-income communities\u2014continue to lack full access to high-speed broadband Internet service. In order to address this problem, the 110th Congress is examining a wide range of issues including the scope and effect of federal broadband financial assistance programs (including universal service and the broadband programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service), the adequacy of broadband data collection by the FCC, and the impact of telecommunications regulation and new technologies on broadband deployment. One facet of the debate over broadband services focuses on whether present laws and subsequent regulatory policies are needed to ensure the development of competition and its subsequent consumer benefits, or conversely, whether such laws and regulations are overly burdensome and discourage investment in and deployment of broadband services.", "This report which will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is Broadband and Why Is It Important?", "paragraphs": ["Broadband or high-speed Internet access is provided by a series of technologies that give users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds far greater than Internet access over traditional telephone lines.

Broadband access, along with the content and services it enables, has the potential to transform the Internet\u2014both what it offers and how it is used. For example, a two-way high speed connection could be used for interactive applications such as online classrooms, showrooms, or health clinics, where teacher and student (or customer and salesperson, doctor and patient) can see and hear each other through their computers. An \"always on\" connection could be used to monitor home security, home automation, or even patient health remotely through the Web. The high speed and high volume that broadband offers could also be used for bundled service where, for example, cable television, video on demand, voice, data, and other services are all offered over a single line.

These include cable modem, an enhanced telephone service called digital subscriber line (DSL), satellite technology, fiber, mobile or fixed wireless technologies, and others. Cable and DSL are currently the most widely used technologies for providing broadband access. Both require the modification of an existing physical infrastructure that is already connected to the home (i.e., cable television and telephone lines). Each technology has its respective advantages and disadvantages, and competes with each other based on performance, price, quality of service, geography, user friendliness, and other factors. The following sections summarize cable, DSL, and other broadband technologies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cable", "paragraphs": ["The same cable network that currently provides television service to consumers is being modified to provide broadband access. Because cable networks are shared by users, access speeds can decrease during peak usage hours, when bandwidth is being shared by many customers at the same time. Network sharing has also led to security concerns and fears that hackers might be able to eavesdrop on a neighbor's Internet connection. The cable industry is developing \"next generation\" technology which will significantly extend downloading and uploading speeds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)", "paragraphs": ["DSL is a modem technology that converts existing copper telephone lines into two-way high speed data conduits. Speeds can depend on the condition of the telephone wire and the distance between the home and the telephone company's central office (i.e., the building that houses telephone switching equipment). Because DSL uses frequencies much higher than those used for voice communication, both voice and data can be sent over the same telephone line. Thus, customers can talk on their telephone while they are online, and voice service will continue even if the DSL service goes down. Like cable broadband technology, a DSL line is \"always on\" with no dial-up required. Unlike cable, however, DSL has the advantage of being unshared between the customer and the central office. Thus, data transmission speeds will not necessarily decrease during periods of heavy local Internet use. A disadvantage relative to cable is that DSL deployment is constrained by the distance between the subscriber and the central office. DSL technology over a copper wire only works within 18,000 feet (about three miles) of a central office facility. However, DSL providers are deploying technology to further increase deployment range. One option is to install \"remote terminals\" which can serve areas farther than three miles from the central office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wireless", "paragraphs": ["Mobile or fixed wireless systems transmit data over the airwaves from towers or antennas to a receiver. Mobile wireless broadband services (also referred to as third generation or \"3G\") allow consumers to get broadband access over cell phones, PDAs, or wireless modem cards connected to a laptop. The FCC has auctioned frequencies currently occupied by broadcast channels 52-69. These and other frequencies in the 700 MHZ band are possible candidates for wireless broadband applications. A number of wireless technologies, corresponding to different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, also have potential. These include the upperbands (above 24GHz), the lowerbands (multipoint distribution service or MDS, below 3 GHz), broadband personal communications services (PCS), wireless communications service (2.3 GHz), and unlicensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum is being increasingly used to provide high-speed short-distance wireless access (popularly called \"wi-fi\") to local area networks, particularly in urban areas where wired broadband connections already exist.

Optical fiber cable, already used by businesses as high speed links for long distance voice and data traffic, has tremendous data capacity, with transmission speeds dramatically higher than what is offered by cable modem or DSL broadband technology. While the high cost of installing optical fiber in or near users' homes has been a major barrier to the deployment of FTTH, both Verizon and AT&T (formerly SBC) are rolling out fiber-based architectures that will offer consumers voice, video, and high-speed data (sometimes referred to as a \"triple play\").

Another disadvantage of Internet -over-satellite is its susceptibility to disruption in bad weather. On the other hand, the big advantage of satellite is its universal availability. Whereas cable or DSL is not available to some parts of the United States, satellite connections can be accessed by anyone with a satellite dish facing the southern sky.

Of the 100.9 million high speed lines reported by the FCC, 65.9 million serve residential users. While the broadband adoption rate stands at roughly 58% of U.S. households, broadband availability is much higher. As of June 30, 2007, the FCC found at least one high-speed subscriber in 99% of all zip codes in the United States. The FCC estimates that \"roughly 20 percent of consumers with access to advanced telecommunications capability do subscribe to such services.\" According to the FCC, possible reasons for the gap between broadband availability and subscribership include the lack of computers in some homes, price of broadband service, lack of content, and the availability of broadband at work.", "According to the International Telecommunications Union, the U.S. ranks 24 th worldwide in broadband penetration (subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2007).

Like the previous three reports, the FCC concluded that \"the overall goal of section 706 is being met, and that advanced telecommunications capability is indeed being deployed on a reasonable and timely basis to all Americans.\" While the FCC is currently implementing or actively considering some regulatory activities related to broadband, no major regulatory intervention pursuant to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has been deemed necessary by the FCC at this time.", "The FCC noted the future promise of emerging multiple advanced broadband networks which can complement one another:", "For example, in urban and suburban areas, wireless broadband services may \"fill in the gaps\" in wireline broadband coverage, while wireless and satellite services may bring high-speed broadband to remote areas where wireline deployment may be costly. Having multiple advanced networks will also promote competition in price, features, and quality-of-service among broadband-access providers.", "Two FCC Commissioners (Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein) dissented from the Fourth Report conclusion that broadband deployment is reasonable and timely. They argued that the relatively poor world ranking of United States broadband penetration indicates that deployment is insufficient, that the FCC's continuing definition of broadband as 200 kilobits per second is outdated and is not comparable to the much higher speeds available to consumers in other countries, and that the use of zip code data (measuring the presence of at least one broadband subscriber within a zip code area) does not sufficiently characterize the availability of broadband across geographic areas.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has also cited concerns about the FCC's zip code level data. Of particular concern is that the FCC will report broadband service in a zip code even if a company reports service to only one subscriber, which in turn can lead to some observers overstating of broadband deployment. According to GAO, \"the data may not provide a highly accurate depiction of local deployment of broadband infrastructures for residential service, especially in rural areas.\"", "On March 19, 2008, the FCC adopted an Order that substantially expands its broadband data collection capability. Specifically, the Order expands the number of broadband reporting speed tiers to capture more information about upload and download speeds offered in the marketplace, requires broadband providers to report numbers of broadband subscribers by census tract, and improves the accuracy of information collected on mobile wireless broadband deployment. Additionally, in a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FCC is seeking comment on broadband service pricing and availability.", "Also on March 19, 2008, the FCC adopted the Fifth Report to Congress on broadband deployment under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As did previous reports, the Fifth Report found that broadband services are currently being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion.
