The Department of the Interior (DOI) released a comprehensive inventory of OCS resources in February 2006 that estimated reserves of 8.5 billion barrels of oil and 29.3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas. Another 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 tcf of natural gas are classified as undiscovered resources. Congress had imposed moratoria on much of the OCS since 1982 through the annual Interior appropriation bills. A Presidential Directive issued by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 (and extended by President Clinton until 2012) also banned offshore oil and gas development in much of the OCS. Proponents of the moratoria contend that offshore drilling would pose unacceptable environmental risks and threaten coastal tourism industries. However, on June 18, 2008, President Bush announced his support for lifting the moratoria on offshore oil and gas development. However, President Bush said that he would not lift the executive ban until Congress acted to lift its ban first.

Each five-year leasing program entails a lengthy multistep process that includes environmental impact statements. After a public comment period, a final proposed plan is submitted to the President and Congress.", "The offshore leasing program is administered by the Minerals Management Service (MMS), an agency within the DOI. The MMS conducted 16 OCS oil and natural gas lease sales during its previous five-year program from 2002-2007. Nine of those sales were in the western or central Gulf of Mexico (GOM), two in the Eastern GOM and the remainder were around Alaska. Alaska's lease sales were held in the Beaufort Sea, Norton Basin, Cook Inlet, and the Chukchi Sea/Hope Basin (see Figure 1 ). Two Alaskan lease sales that were not held in the scheduled 2002-2007 leasing program (sales 193 and 203) will be superseded by lease sales in the 2007-2012 leasing program.

Public hearings on the leasing program have been held, and states and interest groups are filing comments on future lease sale areas for the 2007-2012 leasing program. On April 30, 2007, the Secretary of the Interior announced its Proposed Final Program. Areas along the Atlantic coast (i.e., Virginia, currently covered by OCS moratoria), the North Aleutian Basin (Alaska), and the central GOM are included in the final leasing program. A small area would be offered for lease in the eastern GOM planning area, which has been redrawn to provide for more accuracy in boundaries between states and planning areas. The new five-year leasing program began July 1, 2007.", "Nineteen lease sales are scheduled for the 2007-2012 leasing program. Seven lease sales have occurred to date. Two lease sales were held in 2007 (sales 204 and 205), lease sale 193 in February 2008, lease sales 206 and 224 took place in March 2008. Lease sale 207 was held in August 2008 and lease sale 208 was held in March 2009. Revenues from lease sale 224 will be shared with coastal states (Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and Louisiana) as required by the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA) ( P.L. 109 - 432 ) (discussed further in the Appendix of this report). Thirteen of the 348 tracts bid on in lease sale 207 (located in sale area \"181 South\") also fall under the revenue sharing agreement in GOMESA. ", "Lease sales are conducted through a competitive, sealed bonus bidding process, and leases are awarded to the highest bidder. Successful bidders make an up-front cash payment, called a bonus bid, to secure a lease. A minimum acceptable bonus bid is determined for each tract offered. During the past 13 years, annual bonus revenues have ranged from $85 million in 1992 to $1.4 billion in 1997. Bidding on deepwater tracts in the mid-1990s led to a surge in bonus revenue. Offshore bonus bids totaled $374 million in FY2007. But as a result of high oil and natural gas prices and the significant possible resources in the Central Gulf of Mexico, record setting bonus bids of $3.7 billion were accepted by the MMS at leases sale 206 held in March 2008. In addition to the cash bonus bid, a royalty rate of 12.5% or 16.7% is imposed on the value of production, depending on location factors, or the royalty is received \"in-kind.\" The rate could be higher than 16.7% depending on the lease sale. For instance, lease sale 224 will require a royalty rate of 18.75% in all water depths. According to MMS Congressional Affairs representatives, this higher rate (18.75%) is likely to remain in place for future lease sales. Annual rents are $5-$9.50 per acre, with lease sizes generally ranging from 2,500-5,760 acres. However, annual rental rates for the March 2009 sale in the Central Gulf of Mexico begin at $11 per acre for leases in water depths over 200 meters. Initial lease terms of 5-10 years are standard, and leases continue as long as commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are being produced. Bonding requirements are $50,000 per lease and as much as $3 million for an entire area. The Secretary of the Interior may reduce or eliminate the royalty established by the lease in order to promote increased recovery."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Distribution of OCS Revenues", "paragraphs": ["Federal revenues from offshore leases were estimated at $18.0 billion in FY2008 by the MMS. During the previous 10 years (1998-2007), revenues from federal OCS leases reached as high as $7.6 billion in FY2006. Revenues were as low as $3.2 billion in 1999. Higher prices for oil and gas are the most significant factors in the revenue swings. Of the $18.0 billion offshore revenue in FY2008, $8.3 billion was from royalties and $9.5 billion came from bonus bids.", "These revenues are split among various government accounts. Revenues from the offshore leases are statutorily allocated among the coastal states, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the National Historic Preservation Fund, and the U.S. Treasury. For distribution of all revenue from federal leases, see Figure 2 . States receive 27% of OCS receipts closest to state offshore lands (drainage tracts) under section 8(g) of the OCSLA amendments of 1985 ( P.L. 99 - 272 ). In FY2008, this share was over $100 million compared with the $2.5 billion in total state on-shore receipts. A dispute over what was meant by a \"fair and equitable\" division of the 8(g) receipts was settled by the 1985 OCSLA amendments. Revenue-sharing provisions in S. 3711 ( P.L. 109 - 432 ) allow selected Gulf States to receive 37.5% of the revenue generated from specified federal oil and gas leases off their coasts. Most of the proposed legislation in the 110 th Congress that would have opened moratoria areas of the OCS included similar revenue sharing provisions for the states. On April 2, 2009, in the 111 th Congress, the Senate defeated (37-60) an OCS revenue sharing amendment to the Senate Budget resolution ( S.Con.Res. 13 ). The amendment (#931) would have provided up to 50% of OCS leasing revenues to be either distributed among the coastal states producing energy and/or allocated for alternative energy research and development; and parks and wildlife.

They particularly want more assistance for coastal areas that may be most affected by onshore and near-shore activities that support offshore energy development. Proponents of these proposals look to the rates at which funds are given to jurisdictions where onshore energy development occurs within those jurisdictions on federal lands. Coastal destruction has received more attention in Louisiana, where many square miles of wetlands are being lost to the ocean each year. One of the causes of this loss is thought to be widespread energy-related development. Currently, the affected states receive revenue indirectly from offshore oil and gas leases in federal waters. This is in contrast to the direct revenues to states that have onshore federal leases within their boundaries, as noted above. On the other hand, opponents point out the budget implications as a result of the loss of federal revenues.", "There are two fundamental purposes for revenue sharing programs, according to the Coastal Impact Assistance Working Group (an MMS advisory group): (1) to fund projects that will mitigate the environmental and economic impact of OCS energy development, including the need for infrastructure and public services, and (2) to help sustain development of nonrenewable energy sources.", "Two federal revenue sharing programs addressed coastal impacts from OCS energy development: (1) the now-expired Coastal Energy Impact Program (CEIP), established as an amendment to the Coastal Zone Management Act, and (2) the Section \"8(g)\" zone program, established under OCSLA. A third program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, has also provided state funding from the OCS revenue stream, but the distribution of those revenues has no connection with OCS activities. Even the CEIP program was not considered a true revenue-sharing program because its funding levels were not based on the amount of leasing activity in the OCS.", "A new Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) is established under section 384 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct '05) ( P.L. 109 - 58 ) as an amendment to Section 31 of the OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1356a). Under this program, the Secretary of the Interior is to disburse (revenue from OCS lease activity), without further appropriation, $250 million per year during FY2007-FY2010 to producing states and political subdivisions according to specified allocations. The states must submit plans on how they will spend these funds for approval by the Secretary of the Interior. Among other things, the funds are designated for the restoration of coastal areas, mitigation of damage to natural resources, the implementation of federally approved conservation management plans, and for infrastructure projects.

Eventually, the moratoria were expanded to include New England, the Georges Bank, the mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, a portion of Alaska, and much of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Because of environmental and economic concerns, Congress for the past two decades has supported annual moratoria on leasing and drilling in the OCS. Congress enacted the moratoria for each of fiscal years 1982-2008 through the annual Interior Appropriations bill. The most recent Continuing Appropriation Act of 2009 ( P.L. 110 - 339 ) omitted language that had kept the annual moratoria in place.

The Bush Administration appealed this decision to a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit of Appeals in San Francisco on January 9, 2002, and has proposed a more limited lease development plan that involves 20 leases, using existing platforms and other necessary infrastructure. However, on December 2, 2002, the Ninth Circuit panel upheld the District Court decision. The Department of the Interior did not appeal this decision and is currently working with lessees to resolve the issue. A breach-of-contract lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Federal Court of Claims against MMS on January 9, 2002, by nine oil companies seeking $1.2 billion in compensation for their undeveloped leases ( Amber Resources et al. v. United States ).", "After the lawsuit was filed, several oil and gas lessees involved in the dispute submitted a new round of suspension applications to prevent lease termination and loss of development rights. In response, the MMS prepared six environmental assessments and found no significant impact for processing the applications. However, under the Coastal Zone Management Act, a consistency review by MMS and the state's response to that review must occur before a decision is made to grant or deny the requests. The State Coastal Commission ruled unanimously on August 11, 2005, that the lease suspensions should not be renewed. Following that decision, on August 12, a U.S. District Court ordered the MMS to conduct additional studies under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of the 36 leases under suspension. MMS argued that it had presented sufficient evidence for the judge to reach a decision on whether to allow MMS to grant further suspensions. Senator Diane Feinstein of California has urged that the MMS conduct additional studies or, if not, allow the leases to terminate.", "In the meantime, on November 17, 2005, the U.S. Federal Court of Claims made a determination in the Amber Resources lawsuit that the federal government breached its contract with the lessees regarding the 36 offshore California leases. Although the government was ordered to repay the lessees $1.1 billion, the judge deferred a final judgment until additional claims (such as recovery of sunk costs) are resolved. If a settlement is reached, the MMS would automatically terminate the leases. This action would then negate any further action on the consistency determinations. Thus, no further action will be taken by the Department of the Interior to address the concerns of the California Coastal Commission until a final judgment is reached.

Royalty relief under the End-of-Life and Special Case categories was already in place under OCSLA before the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA). The DWRRA expands the Secretary's authority to use royalty relief as an incentive for leasing federal OCS Gulf of Mexico deepwater. Under DWRRA, the Secretary of the Interior may reduce royalties if production would otherwise be uneconomic. Threshold price levels were established in 1995, above which the relief is discontinued. In 2008, the threshold price (with some exceptions) was $37.18 per barrel for deepwater oil and $4.65 per million BTUs for deepwater natural gas. The threshold price levels are adjusted annually for inflation.", "Congressional debate over royalty relief for OCS oil and gas producers has been ongoing. On February 13, 2006, the New York Times reported that the MMS would not collect royalties on leases awarded in 1998 and 1999 because no price threshold was included in the lease agreements during those two years. Without the price thresholds, lease holders may produce oil and gas up to specified volumes without paying royalties no matter what the price. The MMS asserts that placing price thresholds in the lease agreements is at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior. However, according to the MMS, the price thresholds were omitted by mistake from 576 offshore leases during 1998 and 1999.

The bill would also repeal royalty relief provisions (sections 344 and 345) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Opponents of H.R. 6 argue that the companies with valid leases, even though without price thresholds, should not be penalized and that the provision could result in breach-of-contracts lawsuits by the companies. On July 30, 2007, the House introduced H.R. 3221 , containing language on offshore royalties (under Title VII) nearly identical to Title II of H.R. 6 .

Overall, since 1995, deepwater production of oil has increased from 16% of total GOM production to nearly 75% in 2006. Deepwater natural gas has risen from 3.8% of total GOM production to about 38% during the same period. The deepwater production in the GOM is expected to continue growing over the next 20 years. There are, however, a limited number of rigs available to drill, and there are prospects elsewhere that could make any area available for leasing less likely to get developed in the short-term. Moreover, very little exploration and development have yet to occur within some of the deepwater regions that were leased since 1995.", "The amount of development of leases is significantly different in shallow and deep regions. In the West and Central Gulf region, at less than 400 meters deep, about 40% of the leased tracts have been producing since the 1990s, whereas a small and declining fraction of currently leased tracts have been explored but did not produce. About 40% of the active leases at this depth have not been explored.", "In the narrow region between 400 and 800 meters, most of the relatively few leases have not been explored, but a small and increasing number have begun production. This pattern is even clearer in the region deeper than 800 meters, where a large number of leases have been let, especially since 1995, and only a small fraction of them have been explored.", "A major stimulus to exploration and development of a promising lease is the approach of the end of the lease term. MMS officials contend they are allowing leases to expire and putting them up for reletting.
