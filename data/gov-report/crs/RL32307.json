Corps appropriations include a reduction for Saving and Slippage (S&S) to account for the slip of spending on projects due todelays caused by weather, non-federal sponsor financing, or a decision not to proceed-- or to account for savings from a project costing less than estimated. TheAdministration in its budget estimate proposes an S&S rate for various Corpsaccounts; Congress maintains or modifies these rates during the appropriationsprocess. The enacted S&S rates are normally applied across the board to all projectsin an account, except for those activities specifically set forth in act language. S&Srates that exceed the actual saving and slippage experienced could contribute toappropriations constraints on the progress of projects. Over the course of the fiscalyear, the Corps reprograms funds within an account from the projects that are notproceeding as planned to those that are moving forward. There is no statutorylanguage permitting or prohibiting reprogramming of funds; however, Congressprovided specific guidance in the past with regard to reprogramming of theconstruction account in report language.

Some of these reactors would use plutonium recoveredthrough reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The Administration's May 2001 NationalEnergy Policy report contends that plutonium recovery could reduce the long-termenvironmental impact of nuclear waste disposal and increase domestic energysupplies. However, opponents contend that the separation of plutonium from spentfuel poses unacceptable environmental risks and, because of plutonium's potentialuse in nuclear bombs, undermines U.S. policy on nuclear weapons proliferation.", "The development of plutonium-fueled reactors in the Generation IV program is closely related to the nuclear energy program's Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative(AFCI), for which the conference report provides $68.0 million -- about the sameas the FY2004 level and the amount approved by the House. The Administration hadproposed cutting the program to $46.3 million. According to the budget justification,AFCI will \"develop advanced, proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycle technologies\"that could reduce the long-term hazard of spent nuclear fuel and recover additionalenergy. Such technologies would involve separation of plutonium, uranium, andother long-lived radioactive materials from spent fuel for re-use in a nuclear reactoror for transmutation in a particle accelerator.

Supporters argue that it is needed to attack hard and deeply buried targets (such as leadership bunkers or chemical weapons productionfacilities) in countries of concern, thereby deterring or defeating such nations; criticsreply that RNEP would lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons and promptother nations to develop nuclear weapons to deter U.S. attack.", "Secretary Rumsfeld said in 2003 that RNEP \"is a study. It is nothing more and nothing less.\" (7) The study is examining feasibilityand cost. Yet the FY2005 requestseems to cast serious doubt on assertions that RNEP is only a study. Beginning withthe FY2005 budget cycle, NNSA presented a detailed four-year projection along withthe current request. For RNEP, the figures are: FY2005, $27.6 million; FY2006,$95.0 million; FY2007, $145.4 million; FY2008, $128.4 million; and FY2009, $88.4million, for a five-year total of $484.7 million. (8) Along with the increase, the planshows RNEP starting -- assuming congressional authorization -- developmentengineering, in which the nuclear weapons laboratories produce a completed warheaddesign, in FY2007, and production engineering, in which the design is adapted forproduction and a system to manufacture the weapon is created, in FY2009.", "An NNSA manager responsible for the program maintained that the budget increase beyond FY2005 is an artifact of the budget process. (9) He stated that themoney was inserted in the out years as a \"placeholder\" to protect the option ofproceeding with RNEP. Were this not done, it is argued that NNSA would face twochoices that it deems unsatisfactory: (1) By the time the budget for one fiscal yearis submitted, the budget for the next fiscal year is largely fixed; without theplaceholder, a decision to proceed with RNEP could not be implemented until thesecond fiscal year. (2) Alternatively, without the placeholder, a decision to proceedwith RNEP could be implemented promptly only by taking the needed funds out ofother programs. Similarly, the move to development engineering and productionengineering reflects how the program might be expected to advance if it proceeds. The official, however, indicated that no decision has been made on whether or notto proceed with RNEP pending completion of the study.", "The RNEP study was initially projected to cost $45 million -- $15 million a year for FY2003-FY2005 -- but each year's numbers have changed. For FY2003,delay in submission of a DOD study required by the FY2003 National DefenseAuthorization Act ( P.L. 107-314 , Sec. 3146) delayed the start of NNSA's RNEPstudy; as a result, $6.0 million was spent of the $15.0 million appropriated. ForFY2004, Congress cut the RNEP appropriation to $7.5 million. The FY2005 requestis $27.6 million, vs. $15.0 million originally planned. Finally, FY2006, not FY2005,will be the last year of the RNEP study; NNSA estimates the FY2006 request at $30million. The four-year total is about $71 million. NNSA stated that a firm budgetestimate for RNEP beyond FY2006 must await completion of the cost study.", "According to NNSA, the study's cost has grown for a number of reasons. The $45 million did not take into account participation in the study by Y-12 Plant, whichwould make components of RNEP, or of Pantex Plant, which would convert existingweapons into RNEPs; their participation adds some $2 million. DOE has imposedadditional project management requirements that add $2 million. The rest of theincrease comes from a better definition of the requirements of the study, refinementof cost estimates, and an increase in surety (safety, security, and use control) of theproposed weapon. On the latter point, DOE requires that any modifications of anuclear weapon look for ways to increase its surety. (10) NNSA says it has found waysto increase RNEP surety, and plans to do so.", "The two Armed Services Committees recommended providing the full amount requested for RNEP for FY2005, $27.6 million, and House and Senate flooramendments to delete such funding were rejected. In contrast, the HouseAppropriations Committee eliminated RNEP and ACI funds for FY2005. It sawthese two programs as a \"diversion of resources ... from the most serious issues thatconfront the management of the nation's nuclear deterrent\" and \"remain[ed]unconvinced\" by DOE's assurances that RNEP is only a study and ACI is only todevelop weapon design skills. It found that DOE actions \"left little doubt that theobjective of the program [RNEP and ACI] was to advance the most extreme newnuclear weapon goals irrespective of any reservations expressed by Congress.\" Accordingly, \"[t]he Committee directs the NNSA to focus wholly on its primarymission of maintaining the safety, security, and viability of the existing stockpile.\" As a part of the compromise discussed earlier, the omnibus bill eliminated funds forRNEP and ACI.", "ACI has also been controversial. Critics claimed that its purpose was to develop a low-yield \"mini-nuke\" that would make nuclear weapons more usable; supportersresponded that ACI was not working on a mini-nuke and that ACI would helpdevelop and maintain weapons design expertise. The Administration requested $9.0million for ACI for FY2005. The House provided no funds for it for reasons justnoted. The House Appropriations Committee stated that its priorities are maintainingthe stockpile and countering WMD proliferation, and found that DOE's \"obsessionwith launching a new round of nuclear weapons development runs counter to thosepriorities.\" While the omnibus bill provided no funds for ACI, the conference reportstated that \"the same amount is made available for the Reliable ReplacementWarhead program to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existingweapons and their components.\"", "Campaigns. These are \"multi-year, multi-functional efforts\" that \"provide specialized scientific knowledge and technicalsupport to the directed stockpile work on the nuclear weapons stockpile.\" ForFY2005, there are six campaigns, each of which has multiple components: Science;Engineering; Inertial Confinement Fusion and High Yield; Advanced Simulation andComputing; Pit Manufacturing and Certification, and Readiness.", "The House Appropriations Committee commended NNSA for \"great progress in budgeting by weapons type\" (e.g., the amount requested for extending the life ofthe W80 warhead). On the other hand, it expressed its concern that NNSA'saccounting system still did not provide the full cost of weapon refurbishmentsbecause it did not assign the cost of campaigns to specific warhead types. Accordingly, \"[t]he Committee directs the NNSA to assign the associated lifeextension costs by weapons type associated with each campaign.\"", " Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign. This is perhaps the most controversial campaign at present. It may remain so for some yearsbecause one component of it is a facility that may cost several billion dollars and isscheduled to start initial operations in FY2019, and other components of thecampaign involve restoring U.S. ability to manufacture pits, a critical nuclear weaponpart. Pits are the fissile cores of nuclear warheads that trigger the thermonuclearsecondary stage. DOE has had no facility to produce pits for use in stockpiledweapons since it suspended pit production at the Rocky Flats Plant (CO) in 1989. Asa result, the United States has been unable to make all-new nuclear warheads ofexisting or advanced new designs. (See CRS Report RL31993 , Nuclear Warhead'Pit' Production: Background and Issues for Congress .) For FY2005, this campaignhas five components.", "(1) W88 Pit Manufacturing: When Rocky Flats suspended production, it was making pits for the W88 warhead for the Trident II missile.

These pits cannot be certified for use in the stockpile untilthey meet the standards being developed.", "(3) Pit Manufacturing Capability. This component will establish technologies to manufacture pits other than for theW88.", "(4) Modern Pit Facility (MPF): NNSA maintains that pits will ultimately develop defects as a result of aging and other unanticipated problems, sothat a higher capacity will be needed in the future. Further, it is argued, since itwould take many years to complete a higher-capacity facility, work on it must beginpromptly. Accordingly, it is planning for MPF, which would be a new facility, firstoperational in FY2019, with a capacity of at least 125 pits per year. It might cost $2billion to $4 billion. Critics maintain that the plutonium component of a pit, whichis by far the most difficult to fabricate, is likely to deteriorate very slowly, andperhaps in a way that would not impair weapon performance. They further state thatthe need for the facility is unclear, given anticipated reductions in nuclear weapons,and that MPF is proceeding at too rapid a pace. To address these questions, NNSAis conducting \"accelerated aging experiments,\" in which plutonium of the type usedin a pit is mixed with a greater-than-usual amount of a more radioactive plutoniumisotope to simulate more quickly the effects of aging.", "(5) Pit Campaign Support Activities at Nevada Test Site: NNSA plans to conduct certain experiments at Nevada Test Site to support W88 pitcertification.", "This campaign has attracted much congressional interest. For FY2002, the House Appropriations Committee asserted that DOE cannot show \"that it has aviable plan to manufacture and certify pits on the schedule dictated by nationalsecurity needs,\" criticized the project as \"years behind schedule and hundreds ofmillions of dollars over the original cost estimate,\" and stated that it would judgeNNSA's success on how well the pit project succeeds ( H.Rept. 107-112 ). The SenateAppropriations Committee viewed the then-current schedule, which would not certifya pit for use in the stockpile until FY2009, as \"unacceptable\" ( S.Rept. 107-39 ).", "In its FY2003 report, the Senate Appropriations Committee stated that it \"remains greatly concerned about the NNSA's refusal to request funds consistentwith its own project plan submitted less than 1 year ago.\" Because this was not done,\"the Committee has been forced to reduce other items in the budget.\" The finalappropriation provided more funds than requested. According to the joint explanatorystatement of the Committee of Conference, \"The increase will ensure that the NNSAmaintains its commitment to produce a certifiable W88 pit by 2003 and a certifiedW88 pit by 2007.\"", "For FY2004, the Administration requested a substantial increase to items in this campaign. The House Appropriations Committee saw the campaign as proceedingtoo quickly. It recommended reducing the request for this campaign substantially. It praised NNSA and Los Alamos National Laboratory for \"turning around\" thiscampaign, but urged NNSA to reduce costs. It stated that the current plan would\"aggressively pursue a multi-billion dollar Modern Pit Facility before the firstproduction pit has even been successfully certified for use in the stockpile\" andrecommended \"a less aggressive planning approach\" to MPF. The SenateAppropriations Committee recommended the amount requested for this campaign. The Feinstein amendment ( S.Amdt. 1655 ) discussed under DSW, whichwas tabled, would have barred use of funds for MPF site selection. Confereesprovided the full amount requested for manufacturing and certifying the W88 pit, butreduced MPF funding from $22.8 million to $10.8 million: \"The conferees agree withthe House Report that until the Congress reviews the revised future Stockpile planit is premature to pursue further decisions regarding the Modern Pit Facility.\"", "The FY2005 request (with FY2004 funding in parentheses) includes $132.0 million ($125.0 million) for W88 pit manufacturing, $101.5 million ($108.6 million)for W88 pit certification, $21.0 ($10.0 million) for pit manufacturing capability,$29.8 million ($10.8 million) for MPF, and $52.2 million ($42.4 million) for pitcampaign support activities at Nevada Test Site.", "The House Appropriations Committee raised concerns about proceeding with MPF until the need for that facility is validated. It \"will consider a modern pitfacility design only when the [accelerated] pit aging experiments are completed andthe future MPF requirements as a function of the 2012 stockpile and the expandedTA-55 production capability are determined.\" (TA-55 is the facility at Los Alamosused for making pits.) In contrast, it favored accelerating efforts to expand capabilityat TA-55 as a near-term hedge. Accordingly, the committee commended LosAlamos's work to restore pit manufacturing capability at TA-55, adding $10.0million to W88 pit manufacturing to accelerate this work, and eliminated the $29.8million requested for MPF. It provided the amount requested for W88 pitcertification and for pit campaign support activities at Nevada Test Site. Iteliminated the $21.0 million requested for pit manufacturing capability on groundsthat \"work on pit manufacturing should be focused on expansion of the pitproduction capability of TA-55.\" The omnibus bill provided the requested amountsfor W88 pit manufacturing and pit campaign support activities at NTS. It cut W88pit certification to $61.0 million and pit manufacturing capability to $13.5 million. Further, it reduced MPF to $7.0 million: \"The conferees agree that funding forModern Pit Facility cannot be used to select a construction site in fiscal year 2005.\"", " Other Campaigns. The House Appropriations Committee acted on numerous other campaigns, as presented in its report on FY2005 energy andwater appropriations.

A key issue is whether the United States can continue to maintain its weaponsthrough the Stockpile Stewardship Program without nuclear testing. While thatprogram has sought to do so, statements in early 2002 implied a reduced commitmentto that approach. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reportedly said that nationswith nuclear weapons have \"a responsibility to see that they are safe and reliable. Tothe extent that can be done without testing, clearly that is the preference. And thatis why the President has concluded that, thus far, that is the case.\" (12) J. D. Crouch,Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, stated that there is\"no change in the Administration's policy at this point on nuclear testing. Wecontinue to oppose CTBT [Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty] ratification. We alsocontinue to adhere to a testing moratorium.\" (13)", "Of particular interest is readiness to conduct a nuclear test. Since FY1996, U.S. policy has been that NNSA (or DOE prior to NNSA's establishment) should be readyto conduct a nuclear test within 24 to 36 months from the time the order is given. Several studies identified work needed to reduce this time to 18 months. Thesestudies were funded by \"Enhanced Test Readiness.\" The FY2004 budget documentstated, \"The DOD and the NNSA agreed to transition to an 18-month test readinessposture while continuing to review the optimum posture. The actions necessary formoving toward an 18-month posture are expected to begin upon completion of thefinal FY 2003 appropriation.\" The Senate Armed Services Committee's bill forFY2004 national defense authorizations, S. 1050 , section 3132, requiredan 18-month posture unless the Secretary of Energy determined that a differentposture was preferable. NNSA, however, prepared a study in April 2003 thatconcluded that an 18-month posture was preferable. (14) Meanwhile, through FY2003,funds in the \"Nevada Site Readiness\" account maintained the 24- to 36-monthposture with ongoing work at the Nevada Test Site. Because no policy decision hadbeen reached on reducing the time needed to test, the Enhanced Test Readiness andNevada Site Readiness accounts had to be kept separated. With the move to an18-month test readiness posture, the enhanced posture was expected to become thecurrent posture, which would have made this separation unnecessary. Accordingly,the two accounts were expected to be merged into \"Test Readiness\" beginning inFY2004, depending on congressional language, though the FY2004 NNSA budgetrequest level did not reflect that merger.", "The FY2003 appropriation for enhanced test readiness was $15.0 million. Conferees on the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for FY2003 directed DOEto notify the Appropriations Committees before obligating any of these funds inFY2003 ( H.Rept. 108-10 ).

The primary purpose of the program is to manage radioactive andhazardous wastes, and to remediate contamination from such wastes, at former nuclear weapons sites across the country. The program also addresses wastemanagement and remediation at sites where civilian nuclear energy research wasconducted by the federal government. As such, DOE's Environmental ManagementProgram is the largest waste management and environmental cleanup programthroughout the federal government. In comparison, annual funding for the cleanupof non-radioactive contamination at Department of Defense sites has been less than$2 billion in recent years, and annual funding for the Environmental ProtectionAgency's cleanup of the nation's most hazardous private sector sites under theSuperfund program has been around $1.25 billion in recent years.", "DOE's Environmental Management Program has a lengthy history with many longstanding issues. Much attention has focused on the amount of time and moneyneeded to clean up environmental contamination resulting from the production ofnuclear weapons during the Cold War. Since the beginning of the U.S. atomicenergy program in the 1940's, DOE and its predecessors have been responsible foradministering the production of nuclear weapons and managing radioactive and otherhazardous wastes. In later years, DOE expanded its efforts to include theenvironmental restoration of radioactive sites and those with other hazardouscontamination in buildings, soil, and water to ensure their safety for future uses. In1989, the first Bush Administration established the Environmental ManagementProgram within DOE to consolidate the agency's efforts in cleaning upcontamination from defense nuclear waste and civilian nuclear energy research. DOE is responsible for complying with numerous federal environmental laws andregulations in administering the current program, and is subject to fines and penaltiesfor violations of these requirements. Consequently, DOE has signed numerouslegally binding compliance agreements with the Environmental Protection Agencyand the states to perform cleanup activities and dispose of wastes according tospecific deadlines.", "DOE reports that there are 114 geographic sites in 31 states and one U.S. territory where the production of nuclear weapons, and civilian nuclear energyresearch and development activities, resulted in radioactive and other hazardouscontamination. Together, these sites occupy approximately 2 million acres, whichis equivalent to the land area of Rhode Island and Delaware combined. DOE reportsthat all response actions were complete at 76 sites as of the end of FY2003, at a costof approximately $70 billion. DOE expects cleanup to be complete at 3 additionalsites by the end of FY2005. However, most of the sites that have been cleaned upthus far are relatively small and are among the least hazardous. The sites wherecleanup remains underway contain some of the most severely contaminated areas. DOE estimates that cleanup at the remaining sites will not be complete until 2035,at a cost of $142 billion. DOE had previously estimated that cleanup would not becomplete until a later date of 2070, at a higher cost of $192 billion.", "DOE has substantially revised its earlier estimates of cleanup time frames and costs, as part of its cleanup reform initiative. DOE launched this initiative in FY2003and has signed letters of intent with the Environmental Protection Agency and thestates to accelerate cleanup at its major sites. DOE also has prepared PerformanceManagement Plans for many of its sites, which outline how cleanup would beaccelerated and costs reduced. According to DOE, these goals would beaccomplished by assessing the risk of exposure to determine which cleanup remediesare selected. Risk is currently one of many factors that DOE uses to select cleanupremedies. Altering the current process to use risk as the primary factor could resultin decisions to contain waste on site as a means of preventing exposure, rather thanremoving it. Whereas containment can often be accomplished more quickly and atless cost, the possibility of future exposure remains if the method of containment failsover time.", "Although there has been widespread concern about the amount of time and money needed to clean up nuclear waste sites, questions have been raised as to howDOE would use a risk-based approach to accomplish its goals of faster and lesscostly cleanups without weakening environmental protection. Some have drawnattention to the possibility that more contamination may be left on site, rather thanremoved. Because of the substantial amount of time required for certain types ofradioactivity to decay, arguments have been raised that contamination left in placemay migrate in unexpected ways over the long-term, and result in pathways ofexposure that could not have been predicted when the remedy was originally selected. Others counter that completely removing radioactive contamination from all sites topermit unrestricted future land use, and eliminate all future pathways of exposure,would not be economically feasible, and in some cases would be beyond thecapabilities of current cleanup technologies.", "DOE's cleanup reform initiative would continue in FY2005, with funding provided under five accounts. These accounts include two for Site AccelerationCompletion, one for Defense and one for Non-defense, which fund efforts tocomplete cleanup and close contaminated facilities at a faster pace than previouslyscheduled. There also are two Environmental Services accounts, one for Defense andone for Non-defense as well, which fund activities that indirectly support the missionof accelerated cleanup and closure, such as policy development and coordination, andthe integration of mission activities across the complex of sites. A fifth account forthe Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund supports thecleanup of uranium enrichment plants and uranium and thorium processing sites, which previously had been included in an account entitled Uranium FacilitiesMaintenance and Remediation.", "Defense sites have traditionally received the vast majority of funding under the Environmental Management Program.

TheNon-defense Site Acceleration Completion Account would receive $152 million, andthe Non-defense Environmental Services Account would receive $291 million. TheUranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund would receive$499 million. Although the total appropriation for these five accounts would be$7.98 billion, this amount is offset by $463 million in federal contribution to theUranium fund, which yields a total amount of $7.51 billion for the EnvironmentalManagement Program in FY2005, subject to an across-the-board rescission of .80%as noted above.", "The most controversial issue regarding funding for the Environmental Management Program in FY2005 was DOE's \"High-level Waste Proposal,\" forwhich the President's budget proposed to set aside $350 million out of the DefenseSite Acceleration Completion Account. Under this proposal, DOE would speed theclosure of tanks storing high-level radioactive and other chemical wastes at theHanford site in Washington state, the Savannah River site in South Carolina, and theIdaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The volumeof these wastes is substantial. For example, DOE reports that at the Hanford site thereare over 50 million gallons of high-level radioactive and chemical wastes storedbeneath the surface in 177 tanks. The tank wastes at Hanford, and the other two sites,that are classified as \"high-level\" radioactive wastes must be removed and safelystored in a centralized geologic repository, as required by the Nuclear Waste PolicyAct (NWPA). For more information, see CRS Report RL32163(pdf) , Radioactive WasteStreams: An Overview of Waste Classification for Disposal , by [author name scrubbed]. ", "DOE has proposed to speed the closure of the tanks at these three sites by classifying some of the waste as \"incidental to reprocessing,\" and to dispose of it aslow-level waste by mixing and immobilizing it with a cement \"grout\" inside the tank. DOE issued this proposal under an internal agency \"order\" (Order 435.1). (15) SomeMembers of Congress, states, environmental organizations, and communities opposed DOE's proposal, arguing that none of the tank wastes should be allowed toremain in place because of the possibility that the grout might not mix thoroughlywith the waste to contain it safely and prevent leaks. However, others asserted thatmethods to remove all of the tank residues would generate a new hazardous wastestream that would need to be managed properly to prevent exposure. There alsocould be significant risks of exposure to workers who would remove the residues. ", "Thus far, DOE has grouted high-level radioactive wastes in two tanks at the Savannah River site. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) legallychallenged DOE's authority to dispose of these wastes in this manner. In 2003, theU.S. District Court for Idaho ruled that DOE does not have the authority to classifythe tank wastes at the Savannah River site, or any other site, as anything other thanhigh-level radioactive waste. (16) Consequently,these wastes would have to beremoved and disposed of in a centralized geologic repository as required by theNWPA.", "DOE appealed the 2003 ruling, and on November 5, 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the above district court opinion, ruling that thechallenge to Order 435.1 was not \"ripe\" for review. (17) The court found that thedistrict court decision predated DOE application of Order 435.1 to a particularsituation, and, thus, there was no present conflict with the NWPA. (18) The courtdetermined that while it was possible that DOE might violate the NWPA at somepoint, it might just as likely comply with all applicable law. (19) Thus, under the termsof the circuit court opinion, DOE may engage in activities pursuant to Order 435.1,and NRDC or others then would be free to bring suit if they believe those activitiesviolate the law.", "Prior to the appeals court ruling, the Secretary of Energy asked Congress to enact legislation that would provide DOE with statutory authority to classify someof the tank wastes as incidental to reprocessing at Hanford, Savannah River, and theINEEL, thereby exempting them from disposal requirements for high-levelradioactive waste in the NWPA. Whether the wastes could be left in the tanks andgrouted in place would ultimately depend on the concurrence of state regulatoryagencies who issue the permits for tank closures.", "Congress included authority in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 ( P.L. 108-375 ) for DOE to grout some of the tankwastes at Savannah River and the INEEL. However, the authority was not extendedto Hanford, where most of the leaking tanks are located. As noted above, DOE stillmay pursue the grouting of tanks at Hanford under Order 435.1, but could be subjectto legal challenge at that site.

Reagan NationalDefense Authorization Act for FY2005 , coordinated by David Bearden.)", "From the appropriation for the Defense Site Acceleration Completion Account, H.R. 4818 ( P.L. 108-447 ) would provide $292 million of the $350million that the Administration requested for its High-level Waste Proposal. Of the$292 million, $163 million would be allocated to the Savannah River site in SouthCarolina for projects to prepare for the grouting of tank wastes, and $97 millionwould be allocated to the INEEL in Idaho for such projects. The remainingappropriation of $32 million would be allocated to Hanford in Washington state. However, it appears questionable whether this appropriation for Hanford would besufficient legal authority to permit the grouting of tank wastes at that site, as thewaste disposal authority in P.L. 108-375 does not include Washington state.", "There are differing court rulings regarding whether an appropriation of funding by Congress for a specific activity alone provides sufficient authority for an agencyto carry out that activity, absent authority provided in other statutes or in apparentcontradiction of pre-existing authority. In short, Congress can effectively validateotherwise unauthorized or unlawful action in an appropriations act by clearlyindicating that it intends to alter or repeal pre-existing law, in addition to funding anactivity. Whether an appropriation for a specific activity constitutes an authorizationmay be subject to some argument and possible legal challenge, unless Congressexplicitly addresses the authority in question. (20) The conference report languageallocating an appropriation of $32 million for \"waste incidental to reprocessing\"activities at the Hanford site in FY2005 does not expressly mention the grouting oftank wastes, raising the question of the authority for the use of this disposal methodat that site. ", "In addition to the issue of how to dispose of radioactive tank wastes, there also has been ongoing concern in Congress about the feasibility of DOE's overall plansto accelerate cleanup and lower costs at the 114 sites across the country that make upthe former defense nuclear weapons complex. Prior to the conference agreement on H.R. 4818 ( P.L. 108-447 ), the House Appropriations Committee notedin its report on H.R. 4614 ( H.Rept. 108-554 ) that recent delays incleanup schedules and cost overruns of certain projects raise questions regardingDOE's ability to accelerate cleanup. The committee also raised concerns regardingDOE's delay in submitting a report to Congress on statutory changes that may benecessary to allow accelerated cleanup to proceed, and the need for agreements withthe states on all elements of the Performance Management Plans for each site. Theseplans outline how accelerated cleanup would be accomplished. ", "In addition to funding for the Environmental Management Program, the conference agreement on H.R. 4818 ( P.L. 108-447 ) would appropriate$78 million for DOE's Office of Legacy Management. The Administration hadrequested $66 million, the same as the FY2004 appropriation. Of the amount in H.R.4818 ( P.L. 108-447 ), $47 million would be allocated to defense sites, andthe remaining $31 million to non-defense sites. Congress provided the funding forDOE to establish this office in the Energy and Water Development AppropriationsAct for FY2004 ( P.L. 108-137 ). The primary function of the office is to assesslong-term stewardship needs once cleanup is complete, to ensure that DOE's cleanupactions continue to be effective in the future. These planning assumptions arecurrently based on a time frame of 150 years. DOE previously administered theseresponsibilities under multiple elements of its Environmental Management program.", "Civilian Nuclear Waste. Considerable controversy erupted over the Bush Administration's FY2005 budgetrequest for the DOE civilian nuclear waste disposal program. Although theprogram's proposed budget totaled $880 million -- a 50% boost over FY2004 -- theAdministration also proposed that $749 million be offset by revenue from theexisting nuclear waste fee, so that the net appropriation would be only $131 million.", "The House Appropriations Committee, noting that Congress had not enacted the Administration's waste-fee offset proposal, voted to provide only the $131 millionnet appropriation request rather than cut other programs to make up the difference. The controversy contributed to a decision by the Senate Appropriations Committee'sEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee against holding a markup on theFY2005 funding bill. At one point, it appeared that the Energy and Water bill wouldbe left out of the omnibus spending bill, but a compromise was ultimately reachedto give the DOE waste program $577.0 million, the same as the FY2004 fundinglevel.", "The Administration's proposed spending increase was intended primarily to pay for designing a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, andfor developing a national waste transportation program. DOE contends that fundingfor the waste program, run by the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management(OCRWM), must average $1.3 billion per year between FY2005 and FY2010 to meetthe current 2010 target date for shipping nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. Thattarget date was largely dependent on DOE's plans to submit a repository licenseapplication to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of 2004 -- which DOErecently announced would be delayed until 2005.", "In addition to the $880 million request for the civilian waste disposal program, the Administration had planned in FY2005 to transfer responsibility for DOE-ownedspent fuel to a new Office of DOE Spent Fuel Management, which would report tothe OCRWM Director. The $22.5 million request for the new office brought the totalFY2005 request for OCRWM to $907.5 million. However, the conference report didnot include the proposed transfer.", "The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA, P.L. 97-425 ), as amended, names Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for a national geologic repository. Congress passed an approval resolution in July 2000 ( H.J.Res. 87 , P.L.107-200 ) that authorized the Yucca Mountain project to proceed to the licensingphase.", "FY2005 funding in the conference report for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management comes from two appropriations accounts. First, $346.0 millionis appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund, which consists of fees paid by nuclearutilities. Second, $231.0 million would be appropriated from general revenues underthe Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal account, which pays for disposing of high-levelwaste from the nuclear weapons program in the planned civilian repository.", "The House Appropriations Committee excoriated the Administration for requesting a net appropriation of only $131 million and for assuming that Congresswould enact the waste-fee offset proposal in time. \"At best, the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) made an unwise budget calculation to assume thisoffset,\" said the committee report. \"At worst, OMB took a foolish political gambleby assuming that reclassification legislation would be enacted this year.\" ", "The House panel warned in its report that the funding cutback would have \"far-reaching\" consequences for the nuclear waste program, but that there was nofunding available under the budget request to shift from other programs. TheCommittee report noted DOE's prediction that the funding reduction could forcelayoffs of 70% of the program's work force, place submittal of the repository licenseapplication \"at risk,\" and cause \"an indefinite delay in opening the repository.\"", "On the same day the House Appropriations Committee approved the energy and water bill, the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality of the House Energy andCommerce Committee approved a bill ( H.R. 3891 ) to enact theAdministration's nuclear waste fee reclassification proposal. However, the use ofwaste fees to offset appropriations for the repository program would be limited to thenext five years. No Senate action has been taken on the proposal.", "The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than the Nuclear Waste Policy Act deadline of January 31, 1998, for DOE to begin takingwaste from nuclear plant sites. Nuclear utilities and state utility regulators, upsetover DOE's failure to meet the 1998 disposal deadline, have won two federal courtdecisions upholding the department's obligation to meet the deadline and tocompensate utilities for any resulting damages. Utilities have also won several casesin the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The nation's largest nuclear utility, ExelonCorporation, reached a breach-of-contract settlement with the federal government inAugust 2004 that may total $600 million if DOE does not begin taking spent fuelbefore 2015.", "Further delays in the Yucca Mountain program could result from a July 2004 court decision that overturned a key aspect of the Environmental Protection Agency's(EPA's) regulations for the repository. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that EPA's 10,000-yearcompliance period was too short, but it rejected several other challenges to thestandards.

DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) developed during the 1930sout of the construction of dams and multi-purpose water projects that are operatedby the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The originalintention behind many of these projects was conservation and management of waterresources, including irrigation, flood control, recreation, and other objectives. However, many of these facilities generated electricity for project needs. The PMAswere established to market the excess power; they are the Bonneville PowerAdministration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), SouthwesternPower Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).", "The power is sold at wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies \"at the lowest possible rates ... consistent with sound business practice,\" and priority onPMA power is extended to \"preference customers,\" which include municipal utilities,co-ops and other \"public\" bodies.

ThePMAs are responsible for covering their expenses and repaying debt and the federalinvestment in the generating facilities.", "The 104th Congress debated sale of the PMAs and did, in 1995, authorize divestiture of one PMA (the Alaska Power Administration Act, P.L. 104-58 ). Therehas been no press to dispose of the remaining PMAs, and none seems likely given thebroader uncertainties governing electric utility restructuring.", "Congress enacted a funding level of $213.0 million in FY2004, less $22 million in Colorado River Basin revenues.
