They were up for reauthorization review in the 108thCongress, and the only substantial child nutrition-WIC legislation in the 108th Congress, and so farin the 109th Congress, has been the 2004 reauthorization law -- the Child Nutrition and WICReauthorization Act of 2004, P.L. 108-265 , enacted June 30, 2004.", "The 2004 law extended virtually all expiring authorities through FY2009 and containedimportant, but incremental, changes in child nutrition programs and the WIC program; theCongressional Budget Office estimated that it will generate net new spending totaling about $230million through FY2009. Its major feature was a set of amendments aimed at improving the integrityand administration of the school meal programs. Significant changes were made in proceduresrelating to the way children's eligibility for free and reduced-price school meals is certified andverified, and new initiatives to upgrade schools' administration of their meal programs were put inplace. However, minimal revisions were made to the school meal programs themselves -- forexample, expansion of eligibility for homeless, runaway, and migrant children, loosened rules forcertain higher school breakfast subsidies -- and a major proposal to phase in higher income eligibilitylimits for free school meals was limited to an authorization for a pilot project. Relatively minoramendments also affected the Summer Food Service and Child and Adult Care Food programs --for example, making permanent and expanding coverage of \"Lugar\" rules facilitating participationby summer program sponsors and making permanent and nationally applicable a rule looseningChild and Adult Care Food program eligibility rules for for-profit child care centers.", "Another area of concern addressed by the reauthorization law was nutrition, health, andnutrition education. Here, the biggest initiative was a requirement that all schools participating inschool meal programs establish locally designed \"wellness policies\" to set nutrition, physical activity,and other goals and strategies for meeting them. Coupled with it were (1) authorizations for newnutrition education efforts, (2) an expansion of the program offering free fresh fruit and vegetablesin selected schools, and (3) significant changes in food safety rules.", "Finally, a large number of revisions were made to the law governing the WIC program. Themost important among them were amendments aimed at strengthening rules that help contain foodcosts incurred by the program; these included provisions placing substantial limits on vendorsreceiving the majority of their revenue from WIC vouchers (so-called \"WIC-only\" stores).", "This report will be updated as events and legislation warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Child nutrition programs and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,Infants, and Children (the WIC program) are governed by three basic federal laws: (1) ", "The Richard B.

(4) Anticipating renewal of these authorizations, Congress began consideration of childnutrition/WIC reauthorization legislation in the Spring of 2003. However, primarily becauseof budget-related concerns as to how much, if any, new funding might be available to bespent on new or expanded initiatives, no action was taken in 2003 (other than hearings andthe introduction of bills proposing various individual program changes). Instead, ashort-term extension of expiring authorizations ( P.L.108-134 ) was enacted, pushing mostexpiration dates to March 31, 2004, and giving Congress time to act.", "On March 24, 2004, the House passed an amended version of its child nutrition-WICreauthorization bill (the Child Nutrition Improvement and Integrity Act; H.R. 3873 ; H.Rept. 108-445 ), which included provisions that would have resulted in estimatednet new mandatory spending of $235 million through FY2009.

This bill, as amended with unanimous consent on the Senate floor,passed the Senate on June 23, 2004. It reflected agreements that had been reached in theHouse-Senate discussions that had been taking place over the past several months andincluded many House (and Administration) proposals and perspectives. On June 24, 2004,the House passed it without objection. This final measure encompassed changes in lawestimated to result in $232 million in net new mandatory spending (outlays, slightly more inbudget authority) through FY2009 (the end of the reauthorization period).

Budget reconciliation agreements offered little new mandatory money (a total of about $230million through FY2009), and, if House and Senate legislators wanted to fund new initiativesor expansions with mandatory dollars beyond these budget constraints, they effectively wereforced to use savings from changes they made within child nutrition programs. (5) In the alternative, theycould (and did) authorize appropriations for new initiatives/expansions or establish pilotprojects rather than create or expand entitlement/mandatory programs. The final productencompassed some $395 million in new gross spending through FY2009; however, this wasfinanced with an estimated $163 million in savings achieved primarily by revisions to thesystem for certifying and verifying eligibility for free and reduced-price school meals (seeimmediately below).", "Perhaps the biggest issue confronted by Congress was concern over \"overcertification\" -- the degree to which ineligible children are judged eligible for free orreduced-price school meals. Though estimates and perceptions differed as to the extent andseriousness of the problem, overcertification was widely judged a significant issue andprovoked accompanying questions as to schools' administrative strength and how to ensurethat eligible children were not disadvantaged by any legislative solution. As a result, themost important amendments in the 2004 law dealt with program integrity -- improvementsto rules governing certification and verification of eligibility, new procedures to upgradeadministration of school meal programs, and new technical assistance and training.", "As to school meal program operations, few changes were made (e.g., expansion ofeligibility for homeless, runaway, and migrant children and youth, loosened rules for higher\"severe need\" school breakfast subsidies). And, a major (and costly) proposal to phase inhigher income eligibility limits for free school meals was limited to authorization for a smallpilot project.", "Another major set of issues involved nutrition, health, and nutrition education aspectsof child nutrition programs, particularly childhood obesity trends and the role of childnutrition programs and school environments (like physical activities) in dealing with this, therules governing the offering of milk and milk substitutes, foods sold in competition withschool meals, food safety, and the desire of some to substantially increase fundingcommitments for nutrition education. While a number of federally led options were offered,in the end, the most significant change was a requirement that all schools participating inschool meal programs establish locally designed \"wellness policies\" to tackle obesity- andnutrition/health-related issues (like competitive foods and students' physical activity), withfederal technical assistance and other support. Nutrition education provisions encompasseda series of authorizations , but no new funding. In related amendments, the program offeringfree fresh fruit and vegetables operating in selected schools in a few states was expanded andmade permanent, and important changes were made to food safety rules.", "Small changes also were made in the Summer Food Service and Child and Adult CareFood programs -- for example, making permanent and expanding the coverage ofpre-existing \"simplified summer program\" (so-called \"Lugar\") rules that make it easier forsummer program sponsors to participate, making permanent and nationally applicable apre-existing rule loosening eligibility requirements for for-profit child care centers wishingto participate in the Child and Adult Care Food program.", "Finally, a large number of revisions were made to the WIC program, but the mostsignificant were several aimed at strengthening rules containing food costs incurred by theprogram.

In order to reduce the number ofpaper applications that need to be reviewed, by relying on verification already conducted inother venues, requires that LEAs use direct certification -- certification of eligibility for freeand reduced-price school meals (without application) by direct communication withappropriate state or local agencies -- for any child who is member of a food stamp household. This direct certification mandate is phased in, beginning with the largest LEAs, through the2007-2008 school year.
