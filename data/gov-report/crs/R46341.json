So, too, do various DOD agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), collectively aggregated within the Defense-Wide account. RDT&E funding also can be characterized by budget activity (i.e., the type of RDT&E supported). Those budget activities designated as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development, respectively) constitute what is called DOD's Science and Technology (S&T) program and represent the more research-oriented part of the RDT&E program. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including support for test and evaluation facilities. Budget activity 6.7 supports the development of system improvements in existing operational systems. Budget activity 6.8 was added in the FY2021 budget and supports software and digital technology pilot programs.", "Many congressional policymakers are particularly interested in DOD S&T program funding, since these funds support the development of new technologies and the science that underlies them. Some in the defense community see ensuring adequate support for S&T activities as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority into the future. The knowledge generated at this stage of development may also contribute to advances in commercial technologies. The FY2021 request for Title IV S&T funding (base plus OCO) is $14.070 billion, $1.991 billion (12.4%) below the FY2020 enacted level. Within the S&T program, basic research (6.1) receives special attention, particularly by the nation's universities, as over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities. The Trump Administration is requesting $2.319 billion for DOD basic research for FY2021, $284.2 million (10.9%) below the FY2020 enacted level. While DOD is not the largest federal funder of basic research, it is a substantial source of federal funds for university R&D in certain fields, such as aerospace, aeronautical, and astronautical engineering (60%); electrical, electronic, and communications engineering (58%); industrial and manufacturing engineering (48%); mechanical engineering (46%); computer and information sciences (44%); metallurgical and materials engineering (39%); and materials science (33%).

This provision allows the Secretary of HHS, with the approval of appropriators, to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations across HHS for program evaluation purposes. Although the PHS Act limits the tap to no more than 1% of eligible appropriations, in recent years, annual LHHS appropriations acts have specified a higher amount (2.5% in FY2020, P.L. 116-94 ) and have typically directed specific amounts of funding from the tap for transfer to a number of HHS programs. The assessment has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds for specific purposes among PHS and other HHS agencies. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, has historically been the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds; until recently, it had been a relatively minor recipient. Provisions in recent LHHS appropriations acts have directed specific tap transfers to NIH, making NIH a net recipient of tap funds.", "President Trump's FY2021 budget request would provide NIH with a total program level of $38.694 billion, a decrease of $2.992 billion (-7.2%) from FY2020 enacted levels.

If adopted, these funding levels would likely be specified in report and/or explanatory statement language accompanying LHHS appropriations bills.

The one major research program receiving an increase would be Advanced Scientific Computing Research (up 0.8%).

The OMB figures presented in Table 1 indicate a substantially smaller amount for NASA R&D than the figures presented in this section, and a decrease in the FY2021 request relative to FY2020 rather than an increase. The main reason for this appears to be that OMB treats only about half of the Exploration account as R&D (somewhat more than half in FY2020, somewhat less than half in FY2021).
