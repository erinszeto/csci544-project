CDSOA disbursements amounted to $231 millionin FY2001, $330 million in FY2002, $190 million in FY2003 (with an additional $50 million heldin reserve pending the outcome of a legal challenge), and $284 million in FY2004. The CDSOA wassuccessfully challenged in a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute proceeding brought by 11WTO Members including Canada, the European Union, and Japan. In late 2004, eight of thecomplaining parties were authorized to \"suspend concessions\" (retaliate) until the United Statescomplies, most readily by repealing the law. Canada and the European Union began retaliating onMay 2, 2005, by placing a 15% additional import duty on selected U.S. exports. Mexico imposedhigher tariffs on U.S. milk products, wine, and chewing gum as of August 18, and Japan placed anadditional tariff of 15% on 15 steel and industrial products as of September 1.

In late November 2004, the European Union, Japan, Korea, India,Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and Chile received formal authorization to retaliate.

The conference report, with the CDSOA language included, subsequentlypassed the House on December 19, 2005, and the Senate on December 21.

In order for the industry to obtain relief, two things must happen: (1) theInternational Trade Administration (ITA), an agency of the Department of Commerce, must finddumping or subsidization and (2) the International Trade Commission (ITC) must find that thedomestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury due to the dumped orsubsidized imports. These agencies conduct preliminary and final investigations in a detailedadministrative process with specific time lines. (5) ", "According to the findings in the CDSOA, the legislative intent of the act is to address theissue of foreign products which continue to be dumped or subsidized sales to the U.S. market afteran AD or CV duty has already been assessed, and, in so doing, to strengthen the remedial purposeof antidumping and countervailing duty laws. One of the findings underlying the law stated thatcontinued dumping or actionable subsidies \"can frustrate the remedial purpose of the [trade remedy]laws by preventing market prices from returning to fair levels\" which can lead to domesticproducers' reluctance to rehire employees or otherwise invest in the business in order to remaincompetitive.

Instead, the CDSOA directs the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection of the Department ofHomeland Security (CBP) to disburse these duties directly to petitioners and interested parties in theinvestigations that resulted in the orders. Many find the measure controversial, therefore, becausethey believe that it adds a level of \"protection\" on subject U.S. products in addition to theameliorative action afforded by trade remedies.", "Some also find the measure controversial because it was enacted without committee or flooramendment in either House. The measure was inserted into the Agriculture, Rural Development,Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2001 ( P.L. 106-387 ) bySenator Robert Byrd, a conferee to the appropriations bill.

InDecember 2000, the European Communities (EC), along with Australia, Brazil, Chile, India,Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and Thailand, requested WTO consultations with the United States on theCDSOA, arguing that it violated the WTO Antidumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidiesand Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), and other WTO obligations. Canada and Mexicofiled a separate complaint in May 2001. The complainants based their argument in part onprovisions in the Antidumping and SCM Agreements prohibiting WTO Members from maintainingany \"specific action against\" dumping and subsidization, as the case may be, except for action takenin accordance with the GATT 1994, as interpreted by the respective Agreement. (34) The complainants alsoargued that the payments provided \"a strong incentive to the domestic producers to file or supportpetitions for anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures, thereby distorting the application of the standingrequirements\" in the Antidumping and SCM Agreements. (35) These provisions require a specified level of domestic industrysupport for an antidumping or countervailing petition before an investigation may be initiated. Complainants further argued that the CDSOA \"makes it more difficult for exporters subject to anantidumping or countervailing duty order to secure an undertaking with the competent authorities[i.e. suspension agreement], since the affected domestic producers will have a vested interest inopposing such undertakings in favor of the collection of anti-dumping or countervailing duties.\" (36) ", "In addition to the arguments just described, Mexico also challenged the statute \"as such,\"claiming that the payments distributed under the act constituted \"specific subsidies\" as defined inArticle 1 of the SCM Agreement, which may cause \"adverse effects\" to Mexico's interests in theform of nullification and impairment of benefits.

(39) At the same time, the panel rejected complainants' argument thatthe act would make it more difficult for the United States to enter into suspension agreements, alongwith Mexico's claim that the act itself constituted a subsidy.", "The Appellate Body upheld the panel's finding that the statute created a \"specific actionagainst\" dumping and subsidization not allowed under WTO agreements, but reversed the panel onits conclusion regarding industry support requirements. (40) The Appellate Body concluded that a \"specific action against\"dumping and subsidization existed for purposes of Article 18.1 of the Antidumping Agreement andArticle 32.1 of the SCM Agreement because the statute fulfilled two basic elements of theabove-quoted phrase. First, the CDSOA constituted \"specific\" action because offset payments werefound to be \"inextricably linked to, and strongly correlated with a determination of dumping ... ora determination of a subsidy\" or, as alternatively characterized by the AB, the payments \"can bemade only following a determination that the constituent elements of dumping or subsidization arepresent.\" (41) Second,the AB stated that a measure would be considered to be an action \"against\" dumping or subsidizationif it \"has the effect of dissuading the practice of dumping or the practice of subsidization, or createsan incentive to terminate such practices.\" (42) The AB found that, given its \"design and structure,\" the CDSOA\"effects a transfer of financial resources from the producers/exporters to their domestic competitors\"and as a result the requisite incentives are created. (43) Since the CDSOA did not take the form of the responses todumping or subsidization permitted under WTO agreements, the AB concluded that the statute fellwithin the scope of the prohibitions in above-cited articles. (44) The Appellate Bodyrecommended only that the United States \"bring the CDSOA into conformity with its obligations\"under WTO agreements and did not follow the panel's broader recommendation that the statute berepealed.", "The appellate and modified panel reports were adopted January 27, 2003, and the complianceperiod was subsequently determined by arbitration to expire December 27, 2003.

(49) ", "Retaliation Authorized. In awards issued August31, 2004, the WTO Arbitrator (a panel of three) determined that each of the eight Members couldimpose countermeasures on an annual basis in an amount equal to 72% of the CDSOAdisbursements for the most recent year for which official data are available relating to antidumpingand countervailing duties paid on imports from the Member at that time. (50) The Arbitrator stated thatthe disbursements \"operate, in economic terms, as subsidies that may generate import substitutionproduction\" and used an economic model to determine the level of nullification or impairment ofbenefits, or what the Arbitrator characterized as \"a value of trade\" affected by application of theCDSOA. (51) TheArbitrator also made clear that each Member would need to ensure that the total value of U.S. tradesubject to the proposed duty increase did not exceed the total value of trade determined to constitutethe level of nullification or impairment, or else propose other forms of suspending concessions tothe DSB that were less likely to have trade effects exceeding this level in terms of value of U.S.exports to the country involved. For example, of the $190 million collected in FY2003, about $121million was collected (and distributed pursuant to the CDSOA) in duties on imports of theco-complainants.

Although many Members acknowledge thatthere are benefits received by liberalizing trade flows, there is sometimes disagreement on the properbalance between these benefits and the transition costs incurred to domestic industries, firms, andworkers by increased global competition. Because the added welfare from trade tends to be diffusedover the population as a whole, while losses fall disproportionately on import-competing industriesand regions, Members' perceptions of free market policies differ. With regard to the CDSOA,supporters maintain that the measure helps level the playing field by compensating U.S. producersadversely affected by unfair trading practices. Now that some co-complainants have assessedWTO-authorized retaliatory duties on U.S. exports, however, Congress may later face as muchpressure to repeal the measure from U.S. exporters as it does from the domestic producers whobenefit from the measure.", "The debate over CDSOA compliance is also related to the issue of differing viewpoints inCongress on the merits of WTO membership, a topic which has also been addressed in the 109thCongress. (95) As aninternational organization designed to ensure that global trade flows more easily, predictably andfreely, the WTO serves as a forum for multilateral trade negotiations and the settlement ofdisputes. (96) Questionsmay arise as to the overall benefit of WTO dispute settlement, which the United States has used toensure that U.S. exporters receive open access and fair treatment in foreign markets, (97) but which has also resultedin rulings that various U.S. laws, regulations, and regulatory actions, particularly in the trade remedyarea, are violative of WTO agreements.

", "This section provides an analysis of issues Congress is likely to consider as it debates the prosand cons of repealing the CDSOA from these perspectives. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economic Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Trade remedy actions in general are a source of controversy among economists and otherpolicy makers. Some believe that the CDSOA increases the level of economic inefficiency broughtabout by these actions, while others assert that the small amount of inefficiency brought about by themeasure is worth the cost of preserving U.S. industries and jobs adversely affected by unfair tradingpractices. What follows is an analysis of the economic arguments by both supporters and opponentsof the CDSOA.", "Opposing Viewpoints. Most economists supportthe most efficient allocation of resources in an economy. Therefore, they believe that tradeliberalization provides for optimal domestic and global economic welfare because nations are ableto specialize in the production and export of products in which they have a comparative advantagein terms of costs and resources, and buy or import products for which they do not have an advantage. Economic theory indicates that these benefits accrue even if a country unilaterally lowers its barriersto trade, and that countries that impose trade barriers are the ones that are harmed the mosteconomically. (99) ", "Therefore, most economists believe that trade remedy actions (the vast majority of which areAD or CVD cases) in and of themselves introduce inefficiencies in both domestic and internationaleconomies that result in decreased economic welfare. Some economists hold that if other countriesand firms decide to subsidize or dump goods at lower cost in the U.S. market, it amounts to anadditional benefit to the U.S. economy in the long run, especially if the practice continues over time.", "Most analysts, however, acknowledge that allowances for a certain amount of inefficiencyresulting from trade remedies must be made in order to maintain public support for tradeliberalization. Others argue that efficiency is secondary when preserving industries consideredcritical to U.S. national and economic security interests. However, opponents of the CDSOA assertthat the measure provides a type of \"double\" remedy to domestic producers, thus enhancing theeconomic inefficiency of AD and CVD actions. ", "Injury to Downstream Industries. Trade remedyactions often lead to price increases on targeted goods -- many of which are industrial inputs usedby other domestic industries. To the extent that the CDSOA encourages domestic producers to fileadditional AD or CVD claims, the measure also contributes to these price increases. Downstreamindustries (for example, the automobile and housing industries which use steel and lumber tomanufacture their products) bear the cost of trade remedies in the form of higher-cost inputs for theirproducts. As a result, these industries may have to raise the price of their goods. At a recent HouseSmall Business Committee hearing, for example, a manufacturer of specialty automotive partscomplained that inflated prices for steel inputs, brought about in part by trade remedy actions, causedunintended \"collateral damage\" which threatened his business. (100) ", "In addition, since the EU and Canada have already begun retaliating against U.S. exports,products targeted for increased duties may also become uncompetitive in the receiving market. Therefore, many economists contend that the CDSOA, while providing a benefit to many domesticfirms injured by dumping or subsidies, may in turn cause injury to U.S. downstream producers,exporters, and ultimately, consumers.", "Distribution of Benefits. According to aCongressional Budget Office (CBO) memorandum on the CDSOA, the statute may lead to unequaldistribution of benefits within an industry that could give some firms an advantage over domestic,as well as global, competitors. (101) ", "First, according to the CDSOA, only the firms in support of an AD or CVD petition resultingin an AD or CV duty order are eligible to receive disbursements. Therefore, even though allcompanies in an industry that producing the targeted product may benefit from the remedial effectof trade remedy action, companies are only eligible for CDSOA payments if they are able to certifythat they supported the initial investigation. Those producers within the industry who decide not tosupport the trade remedy action could be placed at a disadvantage vis a vis their domesticcompetitors. (102) ", "Additionally, due to the considerable transaction costs involved in filing and supporting traderemedy petitions (estimated to range from $500,000 for the simplest case to millions of dollars formore complex ones), it is possible that more efficient firms in an industry might be less likely tosupport a trade remedy petition. Thus, opponents argue the CDSOA mechanism could adverselyaffect the more efficient firms in a domestic industry, while more inefficient firms receive abenefit. (103) ", "For these reasons, the decisions of U.S. manufacturers in some industries to pursue AD orCVD investigations have caused intense and vocal debate within the domestic industry as a whole. For example, when some U.S. furniture makers and worker unions decided to file a petition onwooden bedroom furniture from China, many larger furniture retailers strongly objected, saying thatthey would lose jobs and business on the retail side if the petition went forward, while producersmaintained that far more manufacturing jobs were being lost than would be lost on the retail side ofthe business. (104) Inthis particular case, many U.S. furniture manufacturers in support of the investigation speculated thatthe cost of lost business from U.S. retailers in retaliation for their support may well exceed thecombined benefit of the AD order and CDSOA disbursements. (105) ", "According to the CBO, CDSOA payments may also reduce the receiving industry's incentiveto take the necessary steps to remain competitive, such as changing the product mix or developingmore efficient methods of production. Since the affected industry only qualifies for disbursementsas long as it manufactures a particular product, firms may decide to produce the good longer thanit is efficient to do so, rather than allocating resources to producing alternative products that couldhelp firms return to competitiveness. (106) Because CDSOA payments are also linked to productioncosts, firms may be encouraged to increase output beyond the levels signaled by market incentives,ultimately driving down the cost of the product. (107) ", "Supporting Viewpoints. Many Members havewitnessed the substantial benefits that the CDSOA has conferred on industries and workers in theirstates and congressional districts. In a February 2005 hearing before the U.S.- China Economic andSecurity Review Commission, some Members testified that the CDSOA enabled U.S. firms -- manyof them small, family-run companies -- to purchase new machinery, hire more workers, and competehead-to-head with unfairly traded imports from China. (108) ", "Supporters of the CDSOA believe that U.S. producers are facing an uneven playing field dueto price discrimination and artificial competitive advantage brought about by unfairly dumped orsubsidized imports. Continued dumping of the targeted merchandise causes U.S. products to remainless competitive, despite additional duties assessed. Therefore, supporters believe that the CDSOAcreates an additional disincentive for foreign exporters to continue dumping and compensatesdomestic producers with financial resources that can be used to maintain competitiveness.", "Proponents of this view believe that trade remedies, combined with the added benefitprovided by the CDSOA, are worth the cost of the economic inefficiency because they promote tradefairness, restore competitive balance, and preserve critical U.S. industries and jobs. Supportersbelieve that many countries limit outside competition in their economies by creating \"sanctuarymarkets\" -- limiting both domestic and international competition -- thus enabling chosen firms tocharge higher prices for goods at home to offset the lower prices charged in the foreign market -- at the expense of industries abroad that produce similar merchandise. Therefore, some supportersbelieve that trade remedy actions, combined with the CDSOA may actually encourage internationaltrade by providing an \"interface mechanism\" between two radically different economic systems. (109) ", "Some recent economic research also suggests that the CDSOA could actually lead to higherwelfare for the domestic economy, as well as lower overall antidumping duties, if the goal ofadministrative authorities is to provide affected domestic industries with higher CDSOA payments.According to this theory, since the CDSOA gives the duty revenue to the domestic industry, theaffected industry is interested in receiving the proceeds from AD or CVD action as well as profits. If administrative authorities and policy makers are, in turn, concerned about the affected industry,they may actually choose to assess lower AD or CV duties so that imports of the subject merchandisewill continue. Thus, greater revenues could be collected by the industry, and lower trade remedyduties could reduce the overall economic inefficiency of the actions. (110) However, since thecongressional intent of the CDSOA and trade remedy actions in general seems to be to discourage ,rather than encourage, continued dumping of subject merchandise, modifications to the existingstatutes would be required if increased duty proceeds were desired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WTO and Other Trade Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Many policymakers believe that a multilateral, rules-based trading system that enhancespredictability and progressively reduces barriers to trade is desirable. Many also believe that theWTO dispute settlement mechanism, of which the United States was a primary architect, is a uniqueand effective means toward achieving that end, because it helps ensure that WTO members' tradepractices are consistent with their GATT/WTO commitments. Those who share this view believethat U.S. compliance with WTO rulings is an important demonstration of U.S. credibility andleadership in the global economy, and will in turn generate increased confidence in the multilateraltrading system. ", "Dispute Panels Overreached? Although CDSOAsupporters do not necessarily disagree with the value of the WTO or its dispute settlementmechanism, some believe that in the CDSOA ruling, WTO panels overreached by creatingobligations for the United States beyond those agreed to. According to this view, the panels violatedArticle 3.2 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), which states thatrecommendations and rulings of the Dispute Settlement Body cannot add to or diminish rights andobligations in the covered agreements. These supporters believe that the WTO panels infringed onU.S. sovereignty by mandating an uncalled-for change to U.S. laws, and in addition encroached onthe constitutional authority of the U.S. Congress to decide how government revenues should bespent. (111) Moreover,supporters argue that since the complaining parties were unable to demonstrate sufficiently that theireconomies suffered \"nullification or impairment\" through CDSOA implementation, the measureshould have been found to be in compliance with WTO obligations. (112) ", "Those who favor CDSOA repeal respond that the United States, along with other WTOmembers, agreed voluntarily to limit the means by which they would shield affected industries fromthe effects of import competition (including unfair trade) when they agreed to join the WTO. Furthermore, as the Appellate Body report states, the DSU provides that where a violation of anyWTO agreement is found, there is normally a presumption that the violation has an adverse impacton other parties to the agreement. Thus, they say, the panel properly found that the CDSOA nullifiesor impairs benefits accruing to the complaining parties even if they could not demonstrate actualeconomic impairment. (113) ", "Discourages Suspension Agreements. Some whofavor CDSOA repeal also believe that the law may discourage administrative authorities fromaccepting alternative arrangements to trade remedy actions, such as mutually agreed-upon suspensionagreements or quantitative restrictions -- also called \"price undertakings\" in the WTO agreements. These observers believe that if the affected industry expects to receive CDSOA disbursements,petitioners might put pressure on administrative authorities not to negotiate or accept suspensionagreements. ", "Such alternative arrangements are favored by many WTO members because they seem toinflict a lesser amount of economic damage on the exporting industry, and by many economistsbecause they may reduce the overall level of economic inefficiency in the global trading system. (114) The United States, forexample, has in force ten such agreements (known in U.S. law as suspension agreements ), includingalternative measures on hot-rolled steel imports from Brazil and Russia; cut-to-length carbon steelplate from Russia and Ukraine; and tomatoes imported from Mexico. (115) ", "Some of the complaining parties in the WTO dispute argued that the United States violatedthis provision in the WTO agreements. However, the dispute settlement panel rejected theirarguments on the grounds that both the Antidumping and SCM Agreements stipulate that membercountries' acceptance of such alternative measures is strictly voluntary. Additionally, WTO panelsfound that U.S. law requires the consideration of the interests of all parties, including downstreamindustries and consumers, before accepting such an agreement. (116) ", "Concern of Emulation. When the CDSOA wasenacted, some supporters of trade liberalization predicted that the availability of CDSOAdisbursements would provide a direct incentive for U.S. import-competing industries to file AD andCVD petitions in a country that was already one of the most aggressive users of trade remedies. (117) Initially, it seemed asif this prediction might be accurate, as U.S. AD and CVD initiations jumped from 54 in 2000 to 94in 2001. However, U.S. initiations actually dropped in 2002 to 39, and the number was only slightlyhigher in 2003 with 41 initiations. (118) Therefore, there is little evidence to suggest that the CDSOA,in itself, has led to an escalation of total U.S. AD or CVD petitions. ", "One reason that the number of U.S. trade remedy initiations has not increased may be that,for most industries, the transaction costs involved in filing AD and CVD petitions far outweigh theadditional benefits received, even if CDSOA payments are factored in. Although a few businesseshave received millions of dollars in annual payments (including the roller bearings, steel, seafood,pineapple, and candle industries), the vast percentage of companies received much less. Forexample, of the more than 500 companies that received CDSOA payments in FY2004, only about100 received more than $100,000. A few companies that filed for disbursements in FY2004 foundthat they had been overpaid in previous years and were liable to pay back the difference.", "Some observers have also expressed concern that other countries might follow the U.S.example and establish similar laws, thus exacerbating an already apparent increase in trade remedyactions worldwide prior to 2001. In this view, such increases could be harmful to U.S. exports andincrease the decline in international economic welfare already brought about by trade remedy actions. However, to date, no other WTO member has adopted similar laws, and AD and CVD initiationshave declined worldwide, from a total of 393 in 2001, to 319 in 2002, and to 246 in 2003. (119) Some observersbelieve that the decline in trade remedy actions is only temporary, however, and attribute it tointernational restraint pending talks on trade remedies in the Doha Round. ", "Doha Development Agenda Negotiations. Somebelieve that it may be in the U.S. interest to comply with the Byrd Amendment ruling in view oflarger U.S. goals in the ongoing Doha round of WTO multilateral negotiations, especially if theUnited States seeks to fend off major modifications to the Antidumping or SCM Agreements. Sincemany countries regard trade remedy reform as a \"make or break\" issue in terms of their acceptanceof any final Doha Development Agenda (DDA) agreement, some observers believe that lack ofaction on CDSOA repeal could weaken the U.S. position in the ongoing trade remedy negotiations. This could be problematic because the gap in negotiating positions between the United States andother WTO countries on trade remedies is large and may be difficult to narrow.", "Some in Congress are also concerned about the ability of the USTR to negotiate on traderemedy modifications in a manner favorable to their manufacturing constituents, because theybelieve that the USTR did not expend very much effort in attempting to keep trade remedynegotiations off the table in the DDA. (120) This perception, combined with the Bush Administration'srepeatedly declared support for CDSOA repeal, may have contributed to increased resistance in ofsome in Congress toward WTO rulings and proposals that might weaken U.S. trade remedy laws ingeneral, and repeal of the CDSOA in particular.", "Many CDSOA supporters favor seeking a negotiated change to the Antidumping Agreementin DDA talks that would permit all WTO members to distribute duties collected pursuant to AD orCVD action. (121) Thisis the approach Congress instructed the Bush Administration to take as part of the 2004 and 2005Omnibus Appropriations. Many CDSOA supporters believe that this is the proper approach tofollow if there is genuine concern that dispute settlement panels created additional obligations forthe United States in the CDSOA ruling.", "Other Trade Agreements and Issues. The UnitedStates has entered into free trade agreements (FTAs) with four of the complaining parties in theCDSOA dispute -- Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Chile -- and is actively pursuing trade agreementswith others, including Thailand. U.S. trade remedy policy in general, and the CDSOA in particular,might dampen the economic welfare effects accruing to U.S. businesses, investors, and consumersfrom these FTAs due to higher costs brought about by the measure (and eventual retaliation), evenas these FTAs have led to significant tariff reductions on both sides. With respect to Canada, thepossible availability for disbursement to U.S. lumber producers of several billion dollars inantidumping and countervailing duties on Canadian softwood lumber has added complexities to theresolution of the ongoing dispute between the United States and Canada over lumber trade.", "Secondly, the Bush Administration has often used access to the U.S. market in general, andtrade agreements, in particular, to promote economic growth and development in lesser developedcountries. Preferential market access is provided to many countries, including some of thecomplaining parties in the CDSOA dispute, through the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)and other programs with a view toward fostering economic and governmental stability. For example,Indonesia and Thailand, both complainants in the CDSOA dispute, are also countries that the 9/11Commission identified as vulnerable to penetration by anti-American Islamic terrorist groups. (122) Although it is unclearthat these or other nations have actually suffered monetary \"nullification or impairment\" as a resultof the CDSOA, the act is seen by some as potentially counterproductive to U.S. economicdevelopment goals in some developing nations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Options for Congress", "paragraphs": ["The adoption of WTO panel and Appellate Body reports by the WTO Dispute SettlementBody cannot in itself effect a change in U.S. law. (123) In this case a statute has been found to be in violation of WTOagreements. Since the Executive Branch cannot amend or remove the measure under existingstatutory authorities, congressional action would be needed to do so. Under WTO rules, withdrawalof a violative measure is ordinarily the main objective of a WTO dispute settlement proceeding. Nevertheless, a defending Member may choose to seek other avenues of resolving a dispute. If theMember does not comply by the end of an established compliance period, however, it may alsobecome subject to sanctions until the measure is removed. According to WTO rules, however, anyretaliation must be temporary, lasting only as long as a Member is not in compliance or until amutually satisfactory arrangement is reached.", "If the CDSOA remains in force in its current form, it will continue to be a part of U.S. traderemedy law, and import-competing industries that are parties to successful AD and CVD petitionswill continue to receive benefits under the act. However, since two of the complaining parties(accounting for a large percentage of U.S. exports) have already taken steps toward retaliation, U.S.exporters could begin to experience the effects of retaliation in mid-to-late 2005. These exportersmay then begin to lobby Congress for CDSOA repeal.", "Were the statute to be repealed, the United States would be in compliance with the WTOrulings and any retaliation that has begun would need to cease. At the same time, CDSOA repealcould lead to additional, if temporary, instability to import-competing industries already identifiedas vulnerable because they may have become dependent on CDSOA disbursements to some degree. Were Congress to consider a gradual reduction of benefits over time, complaining parties may stillview the remaining benefits as WTO-inconsistent and may continue to retaliate as long as theamended measure remains in place. However, the Administration might be able to negotiate amutually satisfactory arrangement with the complaining parties, provided full repeal of the measurewere assured at the end of the process. Repeal of the CDSOA itself would do nothing to affect otherU.S. AD or CVD laws, procedures or actions, and domestic industries would continue to benefitfrom these measures.", "In the event the CDSOA were repealed, Congress might at the same time establish anotherprogram in its place that would deal in some other way with the adverse effects of international tradeon firms, workers, and communities in a way that might be considered WTO-compliant. S. 1299 (Snowe), the \"TRADE for America's Communities Act,\" introduced in the108th Congress, sought to repeal the CDSOA and deposit the duties instead into a \"CommunityTrade Readjustment and Development Enhancement Trust Fund\" that would assist communitiesadversely affected by unfair trade. Many CDSOA supporters maintained that this approach (alongwith similar proposals to expand Trade Adjustment Assistance for firms and workers with AD andCV duties) was not acceptable, however, because protection afforded by the CDSOA could keepfirms operating and workers in the jobs they currently have, rather than reacting to job losses andeconomic dislocation after damage had occurred.", "As evident in recent appropriations legislation, Congress has also favored negotiationsleading to recognition of the existing right of WTO Members to distribute collected AD and CVduties in a manner similar to the CDSOA. This course of action is favored by manyimport-competing business associations, according to industry sources.
