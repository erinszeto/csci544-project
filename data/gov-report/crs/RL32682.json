In 2007 12.8 million children (17.6% all children) were considered poor under the official U.S. definition. In records dating back to 1959, the incidence of poverty among related children in families has ranged from a peak of 26.9% in 1959 to a low of 13.8% in 1969. Poverty affects a child's life chances; by almost any indicator, poor children fare worse than their nonpoor counterparts.", "Family living arrangements, indicated by the presence of just one or both parents, greatly affect the chances that a child is poor. In 2007, 43.0% of children in female-headed families were poor, compared to 8.5% of children in married-couple families. In that year, 24% of children were living in female-headed families, more than double the share who lived in such families when the overall child poverty rate was at its historical low (1969). Children who are racial or ethnic minorities are at particular risk of being poor. In 2007, a little more than one-third of black children (34.2%) and almost three out of ten Hispanic children (28.3%) were poor, compared to about one in ten white non-Hispanic children (9.7%).", "Work is the principal means by which families with children support themselves. Without family earnings, a child is almost certain to be poor. However, earnings often fail to overcome poverty. In 2007, about one-third (32.4%) of all poor children lived with at least one adult who was a full-time, full-year worker; another one-third were in families with a worker who either worked part-year or (less likely) part-time; another third lived in families without an adult who worked during the year. Higher child poverty rates were observed for those whose parents had less, rather than more, education. Children of younger parents, with less potential time and experience in the workforce, were more likely to be poor than children of older parents. Additionally, dramatic gains have occurred in recent years in work by lone mothers\u2014especially among those with preschool children. Employment rates of single mothers with children under age 3 rose from 35.1% in March 1993 to 59.1% in March 2000, but have since remained below their 2000 level, standing at 54.5% in March 2008. Nonetheless, many of these working single mothers (and their children) remained poor.", "The social safety net for children consists of (1) earnings-based social insurance programs and (2) need-based transfers of cash and noncash benefits. Need-tested benefits have undergone a radical transformation during the past 20 years, capped by the 1996 welfare reform law. Cash welfare caseloads have plummeted since the reforms of the mid-1990s, so that many families receiving need-tested aid only receive noncash benefits (e.g., Medicaid and food stamps) whose value is not reflected in official poverty statistics. Further, the welfare reforms of the mid-1990s were accompanied by expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which supplements the earnings of low-income families with children. (The value of the EITC is also not considered in official poverty statistics.) The result has been to curtail benefit availability for nonworking families while raising the returns to work.

However, some are poor despite the work\u2014even the full-time work\u2014of a parent. They are among the working poor.", "Poverty affects children's life chances, their prospects of realizing their full potential, and their ability to successfully transition into adulthood. By almost any indicator, poor children fare worse than their nonpoor counterparts. Poor children are at greater risk of poor physical health, delayed cognitive development, poor academic achievement, and risky behavior (particularly among children growing up in poor neighborhoods). Poor adolescent girls are more likely to become teenage mothers than their nonpoor counterparts, contributing to a cycle of poverty from one generation to the next.", "While income poverty is associated with poor child outcomes, lack of income may account for only part of the reason why poor children face poor future prospects. Other factors are arguably as important, if not more so, than income, per se, in affecting children's life chances. Prolonged or deep income poverty among families with children may signal more chronic problems than merely a lack of income. Income support policies may help alleviate economic distress among such families, helping to provide families' basic needs; however, without other social supports or other, more fundamental changes in children's family circumstances, children's prospects may remain limited.", "Numerous programs operate in the U.S. to aid children without a breadwinner, or with one whose earnings are low. These programs, together, constitute the main threads of this nation's income/social safety net:", "Social insurance programs (Social Security and Unemployment Insurance-UI) provide payments for children whose parent has paid payroll taxes but is now out of the workforce. Social Security benefits are paid to children whose parent(s) is dead, disabled, or retired. Unemployment insurance benefits are paid temporarily to some workers who have lost a job (most state UI programs do not provide dependents' benefits, however). Neither program imposes an income test. Benefits are an earned entitlement. Refundable tax credits (the federal Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, and the child tax credit) supplement low earnings of parents. Cash welfare programs make payments to some needy children and their parents. Major welfare programs for children are Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and, for disabled children or children with disabled parents, Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These programs impose an income test (and, usually, an assets test). TANF seeks to move parents into the labor market and requires states to condition eligibility (beyond two months) on parental work. Noncash welfare programs, such as food stamps, subsidized housing, Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) provide in-kind benefits. These programs also are means-tested.", "Government is challenged to maintain family self-support through work-based policies to promote parents' work and family economic self-sufficiency, while at the same time maintaining a safety net that prevents children from falling into abject poverty when parents are unable to work or their efforts are insufficient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Child Poverty in 2007", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, 12.8 million children out of a total of 72.8 million lived in families whose pre-tax money income that year fell short of the poverty threshold.

Children in husband-wife families, despite their relatively low risk of poverty, comprised 34.0% of all poor children, or 4.3 million. The remaining 0.9 million poor children (7.1%) were in male-headed families (no wife present).", "Because of the relatively high poverty rate among children in female-headed families, much of the policy discussion about child poverty centers on this group. Therefore, much of this remaining profile provides information on the poverty rate and composition of poverty for children in single parent families as well as for all children.", "Among children in female-headed families, poverty rates vary by whether the single mother had ever been married (see Figure 3 ). Children with mothers who never married are about twice as likely to be poor (a 54.8% poverty rate) as children whose mothers divorced (poverty rate of 27.6%). Moreover, the number of all children in families where the single mother never married exceeds the number of children in families where the mother divorced.

Also, the cash welfare program for needy children was opened up to some unemployed two-parent families (1961) and, finally (1996) was replaced by a block grant for temporary assistance.", "The social insurance programs are designed to provide benefits when a family loses earnings because its breadwinner is permanently or temporarily out of the labor market (through death, disability, unemployment). At the outset the welfare programs were restricted to persons not expected to work, but over time, work requirements have been added to the cash welfare program for families with children, and it now emphasizes moving families from welfare to work.", "In 1975, Congress enacted a program to explicitly support and supplement the income of working poor parents\u2014the EITC. This provision of the tax code makes payments from the Treasury to parents whose credit exceeds any income tax liability. In tax year 2005, the EITC was claimed by 22.8 million tax filers, with credits totaling $42.4 billion.", "In addition, child care subsidies have been expanded for families receiving cash welfare by the Family Support Act of 1988, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, which created child care programs for the working poor, and the 1996 welfare reform law, which consolidated child care funding. FY2008 appropriations for child care totaled $5 billion ($2.9 billion for the mandatory child care block grant and $2.1 billion for the discretionary Child Care and Development Block Grant).", "Finally, the federal child support enforcement program (begun in 1975) has shifted its role from reimbursing federal and state governments for welfare costs to facilitating income transfers to families with children where one parent (usually the father) is noncustodial. The increased role of child support is particularly important in light of the growth of female-headed families. In FY2006, child support enforcement offices collected $24 billion: $0.9 billion for TANF cash welfare families, $9.5 billion for former TANF cash welfare families, $3.1 billion for families receiving Medicaid (and no TANF), and $11.3 billion for families that never received TANF cash welfare."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Social Security", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, the Social Security Act established an old-age insurance system for workers; and later, social security was enlarged to cover dependents and survivors of retired or disabled workers. With these additions, social security became a system of comprehensive insurance for all families with a worker who paid social security payroll taxes. If the family breadwinner died or became disabled, social security would provide cash for his dependents and survivors. It was widely hoped that coverage by work-related social insurance eventually would eliminate most need for cash relief to families who lost their breadwinner.", "In September 2008, there were 50.6 million social security recipients, of which 3.1 million were children. This means the federal government makes social security payments to about 4% of U.S. children. Total benefits to children totaled nearly $1.5 billion in that month, a rate of $17.5 billion per year.

This program provides temporary unemployment benefits to workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own, provided they have earned a state-determined sum of wages during an established base period, usually the first quarter of the last five completed calendar quarters, and are available for work.", "Historically there has been concern that UI eligibility rules present barriers to low-wage workers with unstable work histories. To what extent might unemployment benefits be available for former welfare recipients who lose a job? Studies of former cash recipients in a number of states conclude that most recipients who leave welfare for work have sufficient earnings to qualify for UI at some point after leaving welfare. However, having sufficient earnings is only one of the qualifying conditions for receiving UI upon losing a job. The job loss must be considered as occurring through no fault of the potential recipient, a definition that varies among the states. A study of welfare leavers in New Jersey, considered a fairly liberal state with respect to UI eligibility rules, found that as many as 60% of those with monetary eligibility might have been disqualified for other reasons\u2014especially the high rates of voluntarily quitting a job. It found that about half of the job quitters did so for a personal reason, such as a health problem, having to care for a child at home, or a transportation issue. Advocates of broadening UI rules to qualify more low-wage workers have recommended that states permit job quits for \"good reason.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cash Public Assistance for Children", "paragraphs": ["Before passage of the Social Security Act in 1935, some states offered \"mothers' pensions\" so that needy mothers could stay home to raise their children. This aid was largely restricted to \"paternal orphans,\" children whose father had died. In response to the Great Depression, the Social Security Act provided federal funds to enable states to help certain needy groups, including children whose second parent was dead, incapacitated, or continually absent from home\u2014Aid to Dependent Children (ADC). The original purpose of AFDC was to help states enable needy mothers to be full-time caregivers at home. Thus, it had no expectation of mothers' work and no requirement for it. In fact, the law penalized work by requiring states to reduce benefits by the full amount of any earnings (including those spent on work expenses).", "However, this changed over the years. Gradually the assumption that AFDC mothers belonged at home faded as more and more nonwelfare mothers went to work and as rising numbers of unwed mothers joined AFDC, altering the character of the caseload.", "Since the early 1960s, Congress has tried to promote work and self-support of welfare families by means of work requirements, financial incentives, and various services. The first work rule (1961) applied to unemployed fathers (a group that Congress admitted to AFDC\u2014at state option\u2014that year). The rule required states to condition AFDC for Unemployed Fathers (AFDC-UF) on acceptance of work. In 1967, Congress established a Work Incentive Program (WIN) for AFDC families and required states to assign \"appropriate\" persons to this education and training program. The 1967 law required states to give AFDC parents who went to work a financial reward: disregard of some earnings when calculating benefits. In 1971, Congress removed from states the discretion to decide who must work or train. Instead, it specified that states must assign to WIN all able-bodied custodial parents except those with a preschool child, under age six. In the Family Support Act of 1988, Congress lowered the young child age threshold for work exemption. It required states to assign to a new Jobs and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training program for AFDC families all able-bodied custodial parents except those with a child under age three (under age one, at state option). However, the law required states to \"guarantee\" child care for children below age six.", "Finally, in 1996, Congress replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant. TANF law requires states to engage certain percentages of adult recipients in specified \"work activities.\" The law exempts no one from work participation, but it permits states to exempt a single parent caring for a child under age one (and to exclude that parent in calculating the state's work participation rate). In addition, the law bars a state from penalizing a single parent with a child under age six for failure to engage in required work if the person cannot obtain needed child care because appropriate care is unavailable (or available care is unsuitable). States decide individual participation rules.", "In June 2008, 3.0 million children were in families that received cash benefits from TANF programs or separate state-funded (TANF) programs. This is down from a historic peak of 9.6 million children in families receiving cash benefits from AFDC in 1994. In FY2006, federal and state spending on cash welfare benefits totaled $9.9 billion\u2014a little less than half the amount spent on cash welfare by the federal government and states back in the mid-1990s."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Money Income Poverty Rates of Children, by Income Source", "paragraphs": ["Although there are numerous government \"safety net\" programs that aid families with children, the chief component of money income for most families with children is earnings.

The rates would have been 21.8% for all related children and 52.4% for related children in female-headed families. The last bars show the official money income poverty rates, 17.6% for all related children and 43.0% for children being raised by the mother alone. In succession, the intervening bars show the poverty-reducing contributions of (1) cash from other family effort (property income, private pensions, child support and alimony), and (2) government cash transfers (social insurance, other cash benefits, and cash welfare).

Work is the principal means by which families with children support themselves. Child poverty rates are correlated with factors associated with wage rates, such as parent(s)' educational attainment and work experience; the amount of work done during the year; and family type, which affects the likelihood that a family will have a second earner. Without family earnings, a child is almost certain to be poor.", "However, earnings alone often fail to overcome poverty. In 2006, one-third of all poor children lived with at least one adult who was a full-time, full-year worker. The economy has many jobs that pay low wages. Parents in such jobs may escape poverty only through job advancement that results in higher wages, possibly only by upgrading skills and education while working. Often, it takes work of both parents to move their children and families out of poverty. This often comes at the cost of arranging child care to permit both parents to work outside of the home. Additionally, work is not always steady, with some parents experiencing spells of joblessness for part of the year.", "Access to the first tier of the \"safety net,\" social insurance, is restricted to families with a current or previous wage earner. Social insurance benefits are established through work, and are characterized as earned rights. Although these programs are not targeted to the poor per se, these programs\u2014which partially replace earnings because of the death, old age, disability or involuntary unemployment of a worker\u2014have a significant impact on reducing poverty among families with children. Over the past 20 years, the social insurance tier of the safety net has remained relatively static. The protections of its cash benefit programs have generally been maintained. However, the social insurance tier has not been revised to take into account changes in the economy, family structure, and work patterns of parents.", "In contrast, the second tier of the \"safety net,\" programs targeted to low-income families and persons, has undergone a radical transformation over the past 20 years. Cash welfare for needy families with children has increasingly been tied to a philosophy of mutual obligations\u2014adult recipients have been expected to engage in either work or activities to move them into work. In the wake of welfare reforms made at the federal and state levels in the mid-1990s, the cash welfare rolls plummeted, so that children in families receiving cash assistance represent a small and decreasing share of both the overall and poverty child populations. Need-tested assistance increasingly is paid to families only in the form of noncash benefits (Medicaid and food stamps) whose value is not reflected in the official child poverty statistics. These programs cast an uneven net of basic support to families. Moreover, when parents receiving need-tested benefits go to work, benefits are often significantly reduced as earnings increase, at times creating a perverse disincentive to work. For many families with limited earnings capacity, the route toward self-sufficiency can be a steep climb, yielding only small economic gain for additional work effort.", "Along with the transformation of need-tested benefits have come expansions of refundable tax credits for families with children, particularly the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). As a work support, the EITC helps offset the financial disincentives relating to work that poor families have traditionally faced under welfare programs. For some families with very low earnings, the EITC may supplement up to 40 cents on every dollar a parent earns. EITC payments (either advance payments, tax refunds, or reductions in tax liabilities that would otherwise be owed) are not included in the official poverty statistics. However, for a single parent with two children, who works full-time, all year at the 2006 federal minimum wage, those earnings combined with food stamps and the EITC are sufficient to lift that family to just above the poverty threshold.", "Thus, recent changes to taxes and benefits targeted to low-income families have sought to increase the rewards to work. However, the world of work does not guarantee steady income. Working parents face risks to financially supporting their children, stemming from job loss associated with either cyclical or structural changes in the economy or interrupted periods of work because of their own or a family members' illness. Moreover, there remain a small but not insignificant group of families with children where no parent has an attachment to the labor force. This creates a series of policy dilemmas which include how to balance protections against economic risk while maintaining a policy that rewards work, and helping children in those families without a worker without undermining the efforts of working parents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
