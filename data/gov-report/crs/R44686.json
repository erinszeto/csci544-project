Moreover, the emphasis on enforcement over administration arguably might have increased after Congress transferred most of ATF from the Department of the Treasury to DOJ.

None of these amendments would have prohibited anyone from receiving or possessing a firearm simply because they were on the \"No Fly\" list, a claim mistakenly but repeatedly made by many mass media outlets. All but one of those \"Terror Gap\" amendments were blocked on procedural votes.

Based on this report, CDC stated that the research to be funded would have addressed questions related to \"youth access to firearms, risk factors for firearm violence, and risks and benefits of firearms ownership, among other issues.\" The Obama Administration made similar requests for FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016, but Congress did not appropriate funding for these purposes.

Neither provision includes futurity language, however.", "NICS Fee Prohibition and Next-Day Destruction of Records", "For FY1999 through FY2012, Congress has included a provision in the annual CJS appropriations acts that prohibits the Department of Justice from using appropriations to levy a fee for firearms-related background checks under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. This provision was crafted to counter a Clinton Administration proposal to levy a $5 fee for such checks. For FY2004 and every year thereafter, along with the fee prohibition, Congress has included a provision that requires the FBI to destroy background check records within 24 hours on persons who are eligible to receive firearms. This provision was originally part of the FY2004 Tiahrt amendment and was crafted in response to a 90-day audit log that was maintained by the FBI during the Clinton Administration for audit and other purposes. For FY2012, Congress inserted a word of futurity (\"hereafter\") in this provision. The language of this provision is as follows:", "Sec. 511. Hereafter, none of the funds appropriated pursuant to this Act or any other provision of law may be used for\u2014", "(1) the implementation of any tax or fee in connection with the implementation of subsection 922(t) of title 18, United States Code; and", "(2) any system to implement subsection 922(t) of title 18, United States Code, that does not require and result in the destruction of any identifying information submitted by or on behalf of any person who has been determined not to be prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm no more than 24 hours after the system advises a Federal firearms licensee that possession or receipt of a firearm by the prospective transferee would not violate subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code, or State law.", "After FY2012, this provision was not included in any subsequent CJS appropriations, possibly because of the words of futurity in P.L. 112-55 , which appear to have been intended to make this provision permanent law.", "Trace Data Limitations and Caveats", "This proviso was first included in the FY2004 CJS appropriations bill as part of the FY2004 Tiahrt amendment. The language of this provision (originally number \u00a7516) is as follows:", "(a) Tracing studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are released without adequate disclaimers regarding the limitations of the data.", "(b) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall include in all such data releases, language similar to the following that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to draw broad conclusions about firearms-related crime:", "(1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced are used in crime.", "(2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected do not constitute a random sample and should not be considered representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general are acquired for use in crime.", "For FY2013, Congress included words of futurity (\"for FY2013 and thereafter\") in this provision that appear to have been intended to make it permanent law.", "Firearms Parts Exports to Canada", "Congress first included this provision in the FY2006 Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to prohibit the use of funds provided under this act to require certain export licenses. This provision was a congressional response to new regulations promulgated during the Clinton Administration (1999) that were based on the Organization of American States (OAS) Model Regulations for the Control of the International Movement of Firearms. As a result of the export licensing provisions in these regulations, it arguably became cost prohibitive for a Canadian resident to acquire certain firearms parts from U.S. gun dealers. Hence, this provision (originally number \u00a7520) makes certain firearms parts exempt from some, but not all export licensing requirements. It reads as follows:", "(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or treaty, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this Act or any other Act may be expended or obligated by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States to pay administrative expenses or to compensate an officer or employee of the United States in connection with requiring an export license for the export to Canada of components, parts, accessories or attachments for firearms listed in Category I, section 121.1 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations (International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR), part 121, as it existed on April 1, 2005) with a total value not exceeding $500 wholesale in any transaction, provided that the conditions of subsection (b) of this section are met by the exporting party for such articles.", "(b) The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export license\u2014", "(1) does not exempt an exporter from filing any Shipper's Export Declaration or notification letter required by law, or from being otherwise eligible under the laws of the United States to possess, ship, transport, or export the articles enumerated in subsection (a); and ", "(2) does not permit the export without a license of\u2013(A) fully automatic firearms and components and parts for such firearms, other than for end use by the Federal Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of Canada; (B) barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or complete breech mechanisms for any firearm listed in Category I, other than for end use by the Federal Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of Canada; or (C) articles for export from Canada to another foreign destination.", "(c) In accordance with this section, the District Directors of Customs and postmasters shall permit the permanent or temporary export without a license of any unclassified articles specified in subsection (a) to Canada for end use in Canada or return to the United States, or temporary import of Canadian-origin items from Canada for end use in the United States or return to Canada for a Canadian citizen.", "(d) The President may require export licenses under this section on a temporary basis if the President determines, upon publication first in the Federal Register, that the Government of Canada has implemented or maintained inadequate import controls for the articles specified in subsection (a), such that a significant diversion of such articles has and continues to take place for use in international terrorism or in the escalation of a conflict in another nation. The President shall terminate the requirements of a license when reasons for the temporary requirements have ceased.", "This provision was included in the Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 , \u00a7517). For FY2013 through FY2016, the House Committee on Appropriations included words of futurity in its versions of that provision, but such language was not included in any of the enacted appropriations laws for those fiscal years.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry signed the ATT on September 25, 2013. The FY2013 language of this provision is as follows:", "Sec. 7075. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be obligated or expended to implement the Arms Trade Treaty until the Senate approves a resolution of ratification for the Treaty.", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ) includes an identical provision (\u00a77062). ", "The Obama Administration transmitted the ATT to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification on December 9, 2016. The purpose of the ATT is to reduce illicit small arms trafficking by creating a legally binding framework to govern arms transfers. The U.S. Department of State argued that the treaty would promote common international standards for the import, export, and the transfer of advanced conventional weapons and, thus, to prevent terrorists, criminals, human rights abusers, and regimes subject to UN embargoes from acquiring certain types of weapons. ", "Under the treaty, the term \"advanced conventional weapons\" includes tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery systems, military aircraft, naval vessels, missiles, missile launchers, combat support equipment, as well as small arms and light weapons. The State Department has maintained that the treaty essentially requires other countries adopting arms export control statutes and regulations that are comparable to current law in the United States. By adopting comparable export controls, the State Department maintains that the international community will arguably be better positioned to address illicit arms trafficking. ", "Opponents of the ATT, including some Members of Congress, have generally opposed any international arms control treaty that could possibly diminish an individual's ability to keep and bear arms as provided under the Second Amendment. The State Department has asserted that the treaty clearly protects the sovereignty of the United States and U.S. interests, including the rights protected under the U.S. Constitution. The ATT's preamble reads, in part:", "\"Reaffirming the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system\"; and \"Mindful of the legitimate trade and lawful ownership, and use of certain conventional arms for recreational, cultural, historical, and sporting activities, where such trade, ownership and use are permitted or protected by law.\" ", "Opponents countered that the treaty pays only cursory attention to the legitimate uses of firearms by individuals and their constitutionally enumerated rights thereto, and that the rest of the document does not adequately address such concerns. ", "Before the United Nations General Assembly adopted the ATT, Senator James Inhofe offered an amendment ( S.Amdt. 139 ) to the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year 2013 ( S.Con.Res. 8 ) on March 22, 2013, that essentially repudiated the treaty. The amendment passed by a roll call vote, in which 8 Democrats joined 45 Republicans in was been characterized by the press as a \"test vote\" on possible Senate ratification of the treaty, which requires a two-thirds majority. According to the Heritage Foundation, though opponents of the treaty may view the United Nations' efforts to thwart illicit arms trafficking commendable, they argue that the methods and strategies devised to counter those illicit activities must be balanced with more adequate protections for the lawful ownership of firearms by civilians. In addition, the National Shooting Sports Foundation maintains that the treaty could increase already existing burdens on the U.S. firearms industry and drastically increase the cost of doing business.
