Both of these were \"narrow\" CRs, in that they only funded certain prior year projects and activities. The first CR, the Pay Our Military Act (H.R. 3210; P.L. 113-39), was enacted on September 30, 2013. It provided funds for certain Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) activities in the absence of a general CR or annual appropriations.

The funding rate for these projects and activities was based upon the amount available under the previous year's appropriations acts, including any reductions to those amounts through provisions in those prior year acts. It also reflected the reductions that occurred pursuant to the March 1 presidential sequestration order. When accounting for the anomalies that were included in the CR, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the annualized budget authority subject to the statutory spending limits was $986.3 billion. The total amount of annualized budget authority (including spending designated for overseas contingency operations/global war on terror, continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, health care fraud abuse control, and disaster relief) was $1.088 trillion.", "To allow additional time to conclude the annual appropriations process, funding provided by the third CR was extended to January 18, 2014, through the enactment of a fourth CR (Making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes; H.J.Res. 106; P.L. 113-73)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund discretionary spending, which supports the projects and activities of most federal government agencies.

", "C overage relates to the purposes for which funds are provided. The projects and activities funded by a CR are typically specified with reference to regular and supplemental appropriations acts from the previous fiscal year. When a CR refers to one of those appropriations acts and provides funds for the projects and activities included in such an act, the CR is often referred to as \"covering\" that act. The duration of a CR refers to the period of time for which budget authority is provided for covered activities. This duration is limited by an expiration date, which may occur prior to the close of the fiscal year (\"temporary\" or \"interim\" continuing appropriations), or may extend through the end of the fiscal year (\"full-year\" continuing appropriations). That expiration date may be superseded by the enactment of annual appropriations or a further CR. A formula is typically used by CRs to provide budget authority at a restricted level without prescribing a specific amount. The formula is used to calculate an annualized rate of budget authority for each project and activity. Alternatively, a continuing appropriations act may provide specific amounts for covered projects and activities in the text of the act, or by reference. Anomalies are provisions in a CR that designate exceptions to the duration, formula, or purpose for which any referenced funding or other authority is extended. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the annualized discretionary spending for FY2014 under these CRs using two different measures: \"total regular appropriations\" and \"total spending.\" Total regular appropriations is an estimate of only the annualized discretionary budget authority that is subject to the Budget Control Act (BCA) discretionary spending limits. Total spending is an estimate of annualized discretionary budget authority that includes budget authority not subject to the discretionary spending limits because it was designated for the purposes of Section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Control Act of 1985 (Title II of P.L. 99-177 , 2 U.S.C. 900-922; BBEDCA).", "The contents of these four FY2014 CRs are discussed further in the subsections below.
