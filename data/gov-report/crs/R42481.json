Under the program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides funds to local public housing authorities (PHAs), which, in turn, provide subsidies to low-income households to use to rent private market apartments. Although the basic structure of the program is governed by federal law and regulations, PHAs have discretion to determine many important elements. How PHAs use their discretion has implications for how families experience the program, how local communities perceive the program, and the program's cost.", "Little comprehensive information is available about how PHAs use their discretion under the HCV program. Thus, to gain insight that might be useful to Congress, CRS conducted a study that looked at a representative sample of PHAs. Data for the study were taken from the administrative plans that PHAs are required to produce. To supplement information from the plans, interviews were conducted with a subsample of PHA officials. Where possible, results of the CRS study were compared to a study conducted by HUD in 2000. The findings of this study may be relevant to policymakers as they consider HCV reform proposals.", "Major Findings", "Almost all PHAs (96%) use local preferences (i.e., specified categories of families) to rank families on waiting lists for assistance. This is a change from 2000, when only about 59% of PHAs used local preferences. All PHAs have policies that consider a family's prior criminal activity and most consider a family's prior unmet financial obligations when evaluating eligibility for assistance. The policies vary in terms of what PHAs look for (types of crime, evidence) and how far back they look. Most PHAs have also adopted policies that allow them to evaluate families on a case-by-case basis. PHAs use similar policies to terminate assistance for criminal activity. Most PHAs (79%) have adopted a minimum rent of more than $0 per month, and the majority (70%) have adopted the maximum allowable minimum rent ($50). Some PHA officials said they saw minimum rents as promoting fairness; cost savings were not generally mentioned. Most PHAs require families to report all changes in income between annual recertfications, but most PHAs do not adjust families' subsidies at that time unless the income increase is above a certain threshold. In interviews, some PHA officials said that the administrative hassle of recalculating subsidies was not worth the savings, but some noted that a recent verification system required by HUD had led them to recertify more frequently than they had been previously. It is commonly understood that most PHAs have long waiting lists and many PHAs have closed their waiting lists to new applicants. When opening their waiting lists, the majority of PHAs (77%) determine who is added based on the date and time the application was submitted. About 18% of PHAs use a random selection method. In interviews, several PHA officials noted that they found it challenging to manage the process of opening their waiting lists because of an overwhelming demand for vouchers. Once a family is selected from the waiting list, it has a limited time in which to use its voucher. Most PHAs provide families with the statutory minimum of 60 days of initial search time, although most also allow families an extension to 120 days without requiring the families to meet other conditions (such as being elderly or having a disability). While PHA administrative plans must be made publicly available, it was difficult for CRS to obtain copies of the plans in several cases. Most PHA officials who were interviewed saw their plans as program guidebooks, which is a different purpose than that envisioned by HUD. It appears that many PHAs have purchased their administrative plans from private companies. Based on CRS interviews with PHA officials, it seems that some PHAs perceive their discretionary authority as being limited to the options provided in the purchased plans, or they are unaware of the full discretionary authority that they have."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program is the federal government's largest needs-based housing assistance program, in terms of both the number of families served and the cost to the federal budget. The program serves roughly 2 million low-income families at a cost of approximately $19 billion (in FY2012) in discretionary appropriations.", "The Section 8 HCV program provides eligible low-income families with subsidies that they can use to rent the housing of their choice from private market landlords. Families are generally eligible to receive a voucher if they are very low income (earning 50% or less of the local area median income) or if they are low income (earning 80% or less of the local area median income) and meet other special criteria such as being elderly or having disabilities. However, 75% of all vouchers available in a year must be provided to extremely low-income families (earning 30% or less of the area median income). The subsidies cover the difference between a family's minimum contribution toward their rent (generally, 30% of family income) and the market rent for the housing unit. ", "The Section 8 HCV program has a unique administrative structure. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides federal funds to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs)\u2014which are state-chartered local government entities\u2014to administer the program. While the basic structure of the program, such as the type of assistance provided and who is eligible, is governed by federal statutes and regulations, many important elements of the program are left to the discretion of local PHAs. That local discretion is the subject of the CRS study presented in this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Evolution of PHA Discretionary Authority", "paragraphs": ["PHAs have been responsible for administering federal housing assistance since the mid-1930s, when the low-rent public housing program was created. Public housing is federally subsidized housing owned by local PHAs and available to low-income tenants for below-market rents. In the earliest years of the public housing program, almost all aspects of the program design were left to PHAs. Over time, the federal government, through both congressional legislation and administrative actions, increased the amount of federal rules and regulations governing the program. By the time the Section 8 housing assistance program\u2014the precursor program to the Housing Choice Voucher program\u2014was enacted in the mid-1970s, federal law governing public housing directed much of the administration of the program, including which families PHAs should serve (both in terms of income eligibility and priorities and preferences for certain types of families) and how much PHAs should charge families for rent. These rules and regulations were designed to promote the federal policy goal of ensuring that housing is safe, decent, affordable, and available to certain populations. The rules were extended to the new Section 8 program, and over time additional rules and regulations were added to Section 8 as additional policy goals emerged\u2014such as promoting tenant choice and family self-sufficiency.", "By the mid-1990s, federal policy had shifted in favor of deregulation and greater local control in federal social assistance programs, a policy often referred to as devolution. Congress passed laws to deregulate federal housing assistance programs throughout the 1990s, culminating with a major assisted-housing reform bill: the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA, P.L. 105-276 ). As a result of QHWRA and earlier deregulation laws, PHAs were given broader latitude in establishing their own tenant selection policies, income and rent policies, and administrative operations policies in both the Section 8 HCV program and low-rent public housing.", "The primary policy goal behind the devolution of social programs, including the HCV program, is to allow states and localities to design their programs differently in order to reflect their different interests, values, and needs. The resulting variations in program policies across PHAs are consistent with that goal. Devolution may also allow communities to experiment with new and innovative models for providing assistance. As such, devolution may serve the federal purpose of increasing efficiency in the program if PHAs find less costly ways to provide housing assistance. On the other hand, devolution might present challenges to achieving federal policy goals, such as promoting consistent and equitable access to assistance. There is also a concern that devolution could lead some PHAs to elect policies that will be less advantageous to low-income populations. Questions may also arise about how best to balance federal policy intentions with the desires of state and local administrators when they are in conflict. Finally, there are concerns that increased devolution may lead to lax oversight of federal funds. Due to these policy tensions, policymakers continue to debate how much discretionary authority should be afforded to PHAs. ", "PHAs have several areas of discretion in the administration of the HCV program; they are able to set some of their own policies and have the flexibility to determine how some federal policies are implemented. For example, PHAs have discretion to determine", "which categories of families to prioritize for assistance (through a practice known as \"local preferences\"), which categories of families to exclude from assistance (through screening, denial of admission, and termination of tenancy policies), how families are chosen for assistance (through waiting list policies), how much time families have to use their assistance (through housing search time policies), how much families will be required to pay in rent (through minimum rent policies), and how often families' rents will be adjusted (through interim recertification policies).", "The decisions made by PHAs in all of these policy areas\u2014which are the focus of this study\u2014and the many other policy areas in which they have discretion have implications for the federal cost of the program and the achievement of federal policy goals, and for how families experience and access the HCV program.

CRS collected data on the following specific PHA discretionary policies: local preferences, screening and denial of assistance, termination of assistance, minimum rent level, interim recertifications, waiting list administration, and search time and extensions. The following summarizes the data sources and the data collection process for this study, and it also describes previous research on PHAs' discretionary authority.

The policies stated by PHAs within their administrative plans are the primary source of data for this study. PHAs were asked to provide their plans during the period from October 2011 through January 2012. The second stage of data collection involved interviews with officials from a subsample of PHAs.

PHAs are required to state their local discretionary policies within their administrative plans. PHAs must update their administrative plans to reflect any new requirements as directed by HUD and to reflect any changes that might be the result of local circumstances. The plans are not required to be updated annually, although in practice it appears that many PHAs frequently update their administrative plans to reflect changes in both discretionary and mandatory policies. HUD discourages the inclusion of mandatory policies within the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher administrative plans, but PHAs functionally use their administrative plans as program guidebooks in which all policies and procedures are transcribed in one document. The administrative plans are thus a rich source of information about the daily administration of the Housing Choice Voucher program as mandatory and discretionary policies intersect. (See Appendix A for a more thorough discussion of PHA administrative plans and issues related to them.)", "In total, 131 PHAs were selected for the study's sample, which represented a PHA universe of 1,732 PHAs. The PHA universe excluded all PHAs that operate outside of typical program rules or models. These include Moving-to-Work (MTW) PHAs, PHAs in territories, and PHAs administering state-level programs. In addition, CRS limited the PHA universe for this study to exclude all PHAs with fewer than 100 units, which is consistent with an earlier HUD study, in order to make the sample size for the study manageable. When selecting PHAs for the sample, CRS ensured that PHAs of all sizes and regions of the country were adequately represented. ", "CRS attempted to collect the administrative plans from PHAs in a manner that would create the least burden for PHAs. When possible, CRS collected the plans by downloading them from PHA websites. When plans were not available from PHA websites, CRS contacted the PHAs and requested a copy of their current plans. A small number of PHAs were unable to provide a copy of a current administrative plan, and opted instead to answer a brief questionnaire that asked them to describe their PHA's discretionary policies. Two PHAs selected for this study did not supply administrative plans or complete a questionnaire and were represented as missing data within research findings.

To ensure that the interviews would serve that purpose, key respondents were identified based on contacts made during the initial stage of data collection.

No attempts were made to independently verify PHAs' stated policies. The data collected through the interview process carries the same limitation. PHA officials' explanations of how their policies were developed were not independently verified. Another limitation of the data is that, although PHAs are required to include their discretionary policies within their administrative plans, not all PHAs did so for all of their discretionary policies. In addition, two PHAs selected for the sample did not provide their administrative plans. ", "Readers should also take into consideration that the data presented within this report reflect CRS's understanding of the Housing Choice Voucher program and CRS's judgment in analyzing information gathered from administrative plans and interviews. At times, PHAs stated their discretionary policies unclearly or in a contradictory fashion; CRS used its knowledge of the program and its best judgment to make determinations of the proper categorization of these policies. It is entirely possible that a knowledgeable individual would categorize ambiguous policies differently. More so, a knowledgeable individual might have developed a different system of categorization, which could have revealed other research findings.

HUD's study, The Uses of Discretionary Authority in the Tenant-Based Section 8 Program: A Baseline Inventory of Issues, Policy, and Practice , was meant to provide a first look at PHAs' use of the discretionary authority made permanent through QHWRA and was designed with future program review in mind. In its study, HUD sampled 167 PHAs administering local Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher programs and interviewed officials from these PHAs about their discretionary policies. HUD's study focused on several areas of discretion, including tenant selection, occupancy and screening, extending housing opportunities (e.g., encouraging tenants to move to areas without concentrated poverty), and rent policies. In addition to surveying PHAs about their discretionary policies, the HUD study described PHA officials' understanding of the factors that influenced their policy choices. ", "While CRS examined PHAs' use of discretionary authority in a similar fashion, several caveats should be kept in mind when making comparisons between HUD's study and this study. First, the data sources for HUD's study were PHA interviews in which PHAs described their discretionary policies, while in this study PHA administrative plans were the primary resources for data (see the \" Data Sources and the Data Collection Process \" section earlier in this report and Appendix A for more detail on the plans). Second, the regulations and guidance for the Housing Choice Voucher program have changed over time, meaning that the areas of PHAs' discretionary authority, as broadly categorized in this study and in HUD's study, have different constraints today than they did in 2000. Yet, the findings of HUD's study are informative as to how PHAs used their discretionary authority when that authority was first made permanent and do offer a useful perspective on how PHAs' use of their discretionary authority has changed since 2000. Thus, this report makes comparisons, when appropriate, between the HUD study and current research findings in order to shed light upon how PHAs may have changed their use of their discretionary authority since it was first granted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Research Findings and Implications", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tenant Selection Policies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Local Preferences", "paragraphs": ["PHAs may place applicants upon their waiting lists based upon the date and time of application or through a random selection process (e.g., lottery). PHAs may also use specific household characteristics, which are called \"local preferences,\" to rank families on their waiting lists. This discretion is particularly meaningful in a program where only one in four income-eligible households receives assistance. The discretion to determine local preferences effectively allows PHAs to determine which low-income populations will be served by the Housing Choice Voucher program, as applicants that are not at the top of the waiting list may be unlikely to be selected to receive assistance. Federal regulations direct PHAs to determine waiting list preferences based upon local housing needs and priorities, as determined by the PHA and as demonstrated through generally accepted data sources. However, beyond that guidance PHAs are left to decide how needs should be prioritized in the distribution of vouchers in their communities. There are no limits to the number of local preferences that a PHA may elect and PHAs may assign varying weights to their local preferences. As a result, some local preferences are more of a determining factor than others in deciding which families are selected from the waiting list.", "PHAs gained the discretion to establish local waiting list preferences first through an appropriations act in 1996 and later through QHWRA (1998). Prior to 1996, PHAs were required to distribute vouchers to families meeting federal preferences, which addressed hardships such as rent burden at more than 50% of household income; involuntary displacement; and substandard housing, which included provisions for the homeless. After 1996, PHAs were allowed to adopt local preferences including (but not limited to) residency (i.e., families who live or work in PHA jurisdiction); working families; victims of domestic violence; single persons who are elderly, displaced, or homeless; and persons with disabilities. Commonly used local preferences are described in Appendix C . "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Findings", "paragraphs": ["The HUD PHA Discretionary Authority Study (2000) showed that PHAs used their newfound discretion in a more limited fashion than PHAs do today. At the time of the HUD study, 29% of PHAs elected to place applicants on their waiting lists solely based on the date and time of application, doing away with preferences altogether. An additional 12% of PHAs placed applicants on their waiting lists based on the old federal preferences, while 30% adopted local preferences in addition to the old federal preferences and 30% adopted local preferences in place of the old federal preferences. In other words, approximately 41% of PHAs did not elect to adopt local preferences in 2000. Today, only 9% of PHAs sampled placed applicants on the waiting list based upon the date and time of application only and none of the PHAs within the sample relied solely on the old federal preferences. However, approximately 26% of PHAs incorporated some part of the old federal preferences into their local preferences.", "The data collected for this study show that PHAs have adopted a wide range of local preferences. (See Table 1 .) Common local preferences include residency (i.e., families who live or work in a PHA's jurisdiction), working families, persons with disabilities, domestic violence victims, elderly, displaced for disaster, homelessness/at-risk of homelessness, veteran/military, families (i.e., households of two or more, households with children), witness protection program, displaced through government action, previously terminated due to insufficient funding, hate crime victims, and displaced through landlord action. In addition, 44% of PHAs sampled had one or more preferences that did not fall into the listed preferences. ", " Table 1 shows the frequency of the common local preferences; it does not show the frequency with which PHAs adopted multiple local preferences. Collected data showed that 63% of PHAs placed applicants on the waiting list based on three or more of the common local preferences; 23% of PHAs placed applicants on the waiting list based on seven or more of the common local preferences; and 6% of PHAs placed applicants on the waiting list based on 10 or more of the common local preferences. Only 11% of PHAs had one common local preference and another 11% had two common local preferences (an additional 2% of PHAs had only one preference, but that preference was not on this list of \"common\" local preferences). ", "It should be noted that one of the most common local preferences, the residency preference (adopted by 41% of PHAs), generally limits access to vouchers to those living or working in the PHA's jurisdiction. Although many PHAs had multiple preferences, the weighting of preferences can mean that unless a household qualifies for one of the most heavily weighted preferences, the household has little chance of receiving a voucher. For instance, the data collected show that at least 18% of PHAs had a residency preference as their most heavily weighted or only local preference. In these jurisdictions, depending on the weighting of the other preferences, only applicants that live or perhaps work inside of the jurisdiction are likely to be chosen from the waiting list. As 62% of PHAs that use local preferences assigned varying weights to these preferences, it calls into question the meaning of having multiple preferences.", "Managing Local Preferences", "During discussions with CRS, PHA officials were asked to explain their local preference policies. PHA officials explained that multiple local preferences made the waiting list difficult to manage, but that the number of local preferences grew over time and in response to community concerns. Several PHA officials stated that there was pressure from their boards, public officials, and nonprofits to serve particular groups. In turn, these PHAs found it challenging to keep the preferences at a manageable number. Several PHA officials thought they had too many local preferences, but doubted that they would be able to reduce the number due to community concern. While PHA officials were concerned at the number of local preferences used to manage waiting lists, they also stressed that the local preferences reflected community needs and were often the result of ongoing conversations at the PHAs and within their communities. More so, several PHA officials mentioned the flexibility that local preferences provided in meeting immediate needs within a community. For example, one PHA established a local preference to meet housing needs caused by the closing of a local mobile home community, while another established a local preference in response to being unable to provide housing to a local resident who lost his home in a fire. However, PHA officials also stated that only the most heavily weighted preferences were meaningful.", "Issues of Fairness", "On the other hand, some PHA officials believed that it was unfair to place the needs of one group over another. One PHA official stated that they tried to limit the number of local preferences used to mange the waiting list because \"everybody has critical needs ... it is too hard to pick and choose.\" Another PHA official stated that they wanted the working poor to have the opportunity to receive a voucher too and used special purpose vouchers (i.e., vouchers competitively awarded by HUD for particular groups such as veterans) as the mechanism to meet the needs of particular groups. In addition, a PHA official shared that the PHA had abandoned its plan for local preferences after being advised that if the waiting list were mismanaged due to multiple local preferences, it would create a liability for the PHA. Finally, several other PHA officials pointed out that some local preferences were easy to manipulate and in turn \"just seemed to be a way to bypass the waiting list.\" The local preference for the homeless or for those at-risk of homelessness was most often cited in interviews as being difficult to verify; several PHA officials stated that they thought that applicants would be willing to stay at a shelter or to double-up in order to qualify for the homeless preference.", "\" Other \" Local Preferences", "As noted previously, 44% of the sampled PHAs had local preferences that did not easily fall into the typology of common local preferences developed for this study. These were categorized as \"other local preferences.\" For the most part, this \"other local preferences\" category reflects administrative preferences and preferences that might serve a particular population but in a more restricted fashion than is reflected in the common local preferences. For instance, one PHA had a preference for families that both live and work within the PHA's area; this preference does not fit easily into the residency preference category, which would allow anyone living or working in the area to claim the preference. It also does not fit in the working family category, as a family must live and work in the PHA's area. Additional examples of narrow local preferences that were included under the category of \"other\" include single-parent households with children under the age of six, families not living in lead-safe housing, grandparents as parents, and foster youth aging out of the child welfare system, among others. ", "Local preferences that created administrative flexibilities between housing programs also fell into the \"other\" local preference category. PHAs had preferences for those graduating from Shelter-Plus-Care (which is a HUD homeless program) and for those who were being displaced from another housing program due to loss of funding or administrative changes. Some PHAs had a local preference that allowed for the settlement of litigation. The local preferences categorized as \"other local preferences\" illustrate the administrative flexibility that PHAs have to meet specific needs in their communities and in their operations, but they also make it difficult to summarize which income-eligible groups the Housing Choice Voucher program serves.

With this information, it would be possible to evaluate if the application of local preferences aligns with federal policy goals.", "Another possible issue was raised during interviews with PHAs regarding the use of preferences and actual or perceived racial discrimination. One PHA official described an instance in which a former official at the PHA had unsuccessfully advocated for a stringent residency preference that the interviewed official believed would have had the effect of reducing the number of racial minorities in the community. Another PHA official thought that it was unclear when a residency preference might be considered discriminatory and the PHA official believed that HUD may bring fair housing actions against some PHAs with residency preferences. As mentioned earlier, 41% of PHAs sampled had residency preferences. Notably, some PHAs define residency preferences strictly in terms of living within the jurisdiction while some PHAs have a more expansive definition extending the residency preference to those who work or are pursuing job training and education in the jurisdiction.

Some low-income housing advocates have been critical of the types of discretionary screening and denial of admission policies adopted by some PHAs and proposals have been made to limit the scope of discretionary screening policies.

This category of denial of assistance is listed among the possible denials of admission in program regulations. In some cases, PHAs only considered the debts that were owed to them, but in most cases, PHAs evaluated whether an applicant owed a debt to any PHA. (See Table 2 .)", "One PHA official who was interviewed mentioned recently revisiting the PHA's policies regarding families with unpaid debt to PHAs. The official mentioned a list, maintained by a private company and purportedly used by most PHAs, that provides information on tenants who have unpaid obligations to PHAs. The official reported that, prior to their recent policy change, families with bad debts from the PHA would remain on the list indefinitely. The PHA recently decided, with the help and encouragement of their local legal aid office, to remove tenant information after seven years. They chose seven years to conform to general standards regarding how long debts remain on consumer credit reports. The PHA official felt that it did not make sense for someone to be on the list for a $50 debt that was 20 years old.", "No PHA plans specifically referenced this list. However, over one-third of PHAs in the study reported conducting a credit check on applicants.

PHA policies varied in terms of what specific crimes they considered and whether they reported that they \"shall\" deny assistance to applicants involved with certain crimes or whether they \"may\" deny assistance. It is important to note that, since PHAs have the discretion to consider mitigating circumstances, a policy that states that the PHA shall deny assistance may still allow for case-by-case discretion.", "The most common type of policy adopted among PHAs included in the study was that the PHA shall deny assistance based on violent or drug-related criminal activity and other criminal activity that may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or persons in the immediate vicinity. Over half (60%) of PHAs in the sample had this type of policy. The second most common policy stated that the PHA may deny assistance (18%) based on violent or drug-related criminal activity and other past behaviors. A smaller number of PHAs had similar policies but limited them to violent and drug-related criminal activity only (11% shall; 3% may). About 8% of PHAs had missing or incomplete information on this topic in their PHA plans.

For example, 10 PHAs in the sample had policies specifically addressing the crime of murder. Several PHAs also had policies specifically addressing sexually based crimes and assaults or other crimes against PHA staff.

Some PHA plans did not specify how far back they looked for evidence of disqualifying behavior (25%, including those missing data). Some PHA plans only specified one time period for all crimes and behaviors; other PHA plans only specified one time period, but it applied only to a specific category of crime or behavior. Roughly half of the PHAs in the sample reported using a single time period. (See Table 6 .) Of those, the most commonly reported policy was a five-year look-back period, but some PHA plans referenced periods of one, three, seven, and 10 years.", "About 22% of PHA plans referenced using multiple look-back periods, generally varying the amount of time depending on the crime or behavior. In these cases, the look-back periods varied from as little as one year to as long as 10 years, and in some cases, over an applicant's lifetime. For example, several PHAs had specific policies relating to the crime of murder, which included look-back periods ranging from seven years to over a full lifetime. One PHA reported a ban related to failing to meet financial obligations that involved a look back of 10 years; this same PHA had a look-back period of five years for felony crimes.", "Eighty-five percent of PHAs reported conducting criminal background checks on applicants, with varying levels of specificity about the source of the data they use (local, state, or federal sources). About 18% of PHAs reported having a policy of conducting fingerprinting, generally if a criminal background check had been inconclusive.

HUD's study found that less than 50% of PHAs reported using formal background checks (20% reported not using a background check and 32% reported using an informal or trigger-based approach). This would appear to be a change in policy, in that it seems more PHAs are using formal background checks today than were in 2000.

Several PHA officials noted that they liked the flexibility to weed out prospective problem tenants, but that they also liked to give people a second chance. One official mentioned that the PHA had concerns about serving certain ex-offenders but had worked with the local legal aid office to develop a Memorandum of Understanding they require certain tenants to sign that conditions their receipt of a voucher on ongoing participation in certain supportive services. The PHA noted that this policy allowed the PHA both to serve the neediest families but also protect itself by allowing more ability to terminate assistance if problems arose. Another official noted that the PHA had changed its policy in recent years to \"lower the bar,\" because in the appeals process during which applicants can challenge a denial of admission, the PHA discovered it was comfortable with a more lenient approach than its previous policy would have permitted.", "Some of the PHA officials interviewed indicated that their PHAs have adopted stricter rules that allow little-to-no room for consideration of circumstances. Generally, these officials indicated that the reason for their strict policies was to combat negative perceptions about the PHA, the program, and the program participants. One official noted that every time the PHA had proposed loosening its strict criminal background requirements, the currently assisted tenants opposed the proposal. A similar sentiment was expressed by an official who noted that the Resident Advisory Board for the PHA had been supportive of recent initiatives to make restrictions stricter in the community. Another PHA official noted that the rental market in the community was tight enough that the PHA worried that if it loosened standards, it would \"burn out\" its already short supply of landlords willing to accept vouchers. The same PHA official stated that the result of \"lowering the bar\" was that the PHA had a policy that was more liberal than that of many local landlords. In turn, this PHA's voucher holders were not always able to find units to lease and returned the vouchers to the PHA unused.", "Several PHA officials specifically mentioned that they had reconsidered their policies in recent years in response to HUD guidance requesting that PHAs assess how they are serving ex-offenders. However, most of the officials who referenced this initiative expressed concern with what it could mean for the integrity or reputation of their programs. One official noted that there was a lot of gang activity in their community and that the PHA was concerned that loosening standards could lead to more \"bad actors\" in the program.", "Several PHA officials noted that the issue of crime- and drug-related denials did not come up that often. Only one official indicated that the PHA's strict crime- and drug-related screening policies resulted in frequent denials of admission. The official thought that probably 20% of applicants were denied because of past criminal activity. Another official who cited a 20% denial rate indicated that most of the denials were related to bad debt or unmet financial obligations rather than criminal activity.", "The sentiments expressed by PHA officials in interviews about the appropriate length of look-back periods varied as one might expect from the variety of policies found in the study. Some officials reported having shortened their look-back periods in recent years, whereas others have lengthened them. One PHA official stated that their policy is to look back as far as possible because they feel that past history is the best predictor of future behavior. Another PHA official stated that their policy\u2014a five-year look back\u2014did not go further because they did not want to punish a tenant for something that had happened 10 years ago, noting that people can change.

While approximately 7 in 10 families selected from waiting lists were able to use their vouchers to lease units in 2000, considering both policy changes and rental market conditions, that may not be the case today.", "It is important to note that PHAs control several factors that may influence their success rates, including applicant screening criteria, the setting of payment standards, the amount of assistance provided to families in their search for housing, and the length of time granted for the search. CRS examined PHA policies on the length of the search time and the search time extensions. Regulations require that the initial search time must be at minimum 60 days, but PHAs have the discretion to allow for longer initial search times. PHAs may also issue one or more search time extensions. In addition, PHAs have the discretion to provide automatic extensions or require that families provide proof of search before granting extensions. HUD encourages PHAs to consider such factors as the tightness of the local housing market and the family's search effort when determining the appropriate length and number of search time extensions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Findings", "paragraphs": ["The data collected for this study suggest that there are several common practices among PHAs when setting search time parameters. The majority of PHAs establish an initial search time of 60 days, which is the minimum required by regulations. Of the sampled PHAs, 79% had an initial search time of 60 days, 6% had an initial search time of 90 days, and 12% had an initial search time of 120 days. (See Table 11 .) The largest number of PHAs (43%) extended the search time to 120 days, while 4% extended it to 180 days, and 4% extended the search time beyond 180 days. Five percent of PHAs gave extensions to only the elderly and those with disabilities. Other search time structures were also common with PHAs. Approximately 20% of PHAs provided extensions without specifying the maximum length for the search time. Another 23% of PHAs provided some form of extension such as extending the search time to 90 days automatically and then to a full 120 days with documentation of an extenuating circumstance; this represents a more stringent extension policy than PHAs that extend the search time to 120 days without further administrative procedures. (See Table 12 .)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications", "paragraphs": ["The comparison of the results of this study to those of HUD's 2000 study may suggest that PHAs have become stricter in terms of extensions. In the HUD study, approximately 91% of PHAs offered an extended search time of 120 days either through a 60-day extension or two 30-day extensions. Of the PHAs sampled within this study, only 43% would easily fall into the same category. Additional PHAs grant extensions that may result in a 120-day search time (and have been counted in the \"other\" category), but only under extenuating circumstances. On the other hand, the HUD study showed that 77% of PHAs required proof of an earnest search before granting an extension, while in this study 63% of PHAs required proof of search or extenuating circumstances before the PHA granted the first extension. For search time extensions, direct comparisons between the HUD study and this study are not possible because some of the extension policies (such as a 30-day automatic extension with an additional extension under extenuating circumstances) did not exist or were not represented in the HUD study. The additional variation within PHA policies may also suggest that PHAs are adjusting their search time policies to their local markets as intended by deregulation."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Considerations for Policymakers", "paragraphs": ["The federal government invests more federal resources in the Housing Choice Voucher program than any other direct housing assistance program for low-income families. However, there is limited information available about how the program is being administered in many communities. This study was designed to expand the knowledge of how PHAs use some of the discretionary authority they are provided under federal law. The choices made by PHAs have implications not only for how they administer their local programs, but also for how families experience the program, how communities and stakeholders perceive the program, and the cost of the program in the federal budget. The implications of specific policy choices and related policy considerations are discussed throughout the report. ", "However, the findings of this study raise a broader set of considerations that may be of interest to policymakers as they relate to program flexibility and accountability. Program flexibility and accountability are elements of an ongoing tension in the administration of many social services programs, including the Housing Choice Voucher program. The balance between flexibility and accountability in the program's structure may affect the achievement of federal policy goals and creates benefits and drawbacks for PHAs and tenants.

Yet, the administration of the program affects the achievement of federal goals, including equitable access to the program. For instance, the local preferences selected by PHAs determine, in part, who has access to assistance. However, it might not be necessary to know about the program's daily administration if PHAs are meeting federal policy goals. In an outcome-based form of accountability, the meeting of federal goals would be monitored; in a regulatory form of accountability, the manner in which PHAs administer the program would be monitored.

PHA industry groups generally support efforts to increase administrative flexibilities, citing the administrative burden and the administrative costs associated with the current HCV program. As federal policymakers look for ways to reduce the cost of the HCV program, there is an ongoing interest in the deregulation of assisted housing programs and expansion of the Moving-to-Work Demonstration (see earlier description of the MTW program). However, there is some indication that the cost savings associated with administrative flexibility have not always occurred in the Housing Choice Voucher program. ", "Within this study, the statements of some PHA officials suggested that some of the discretion granted to PHAs has created its own administrative burden. For instance, one PHA official stated that he wished HUD would develop a uniform policy for denials based on criminal activity so that there would be fewer challenges to the PHA's policy. This finding is supported by testimony PHAs have provided to Congress. One PHA official testified to Congress in 2006 that \"the deregulation contemplated in QHWRA is really re-regulation. We now spend a large amount of staff time on the new administrative provisions of QHWRA, specifically, the agency plan ... the income targeting strategy, rental integrity and its associated PIC reporting.\" The official also shared her belief that the reporting requirements tied to areas of discretion negate the benefit of discretion and are costly for the administration of assisted housing programs.", "This study thus raises the question of whether increased administrative flexibility always leads to decreased administrative burden and decreased administrative costs, particularly when increased administrative flexibility is tied to new reporting requirements and the increased use of tenant protection procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits and Drawbacks of Discretionary Authority for Tenants", "paragraphs": ["Following passage of QHWRA, tenant advocates expressed concern that increased local discretion within assisted housing programs could harm tenants by leading to decreased housing assistance payments and increased tenant rents.

This study does not draw conclusions about whether the discretionary policies adopted by PHAs are more or less advantageous to certain program applicants and participants than prior federal policies. ", "However, this study does provide data on the level of variation within the program. In some areas of PHA local discretion, such as the application of the minimum rent, PHAs appear to be administering the HCV program fairly consistently. On the other hand, there are areas of discretion in which PHA practices diverge, such as local preferences. It may be that these variations in local policy benefit applicants and tenants as PHAs explore the ways in which they use their administrative flexibility to best serve their communities. While this study does not evaluate the effects of local discretionary policies on tenants, it raises the possibility that further research could be valuable.", "Appendix A. Observations about Administrative\u00a0Plans", "According to HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program Guidebook, \"A PHA's administrative plan must describe the policies the PHA has adopted in each area where the PHA has discretion.\" The guidebook goes on to state that \"the housing choice voucher program administrative plan is a supporting document to the PHA plan, and must be made available for public review.\" Since the Section 8 administrative plan must (1) describe a PHA's use of its discretion and (2) be made available to the public, it is an ideal source of information for a study of how PHAs use their local discretion. During the process of collecting and examining PHAs' Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher administrative plans, CRS made a number of observations about the availability of the plans, their content, and their intended purposes that may be of interest to policymakers.", "Availability", "While federal regulations and guidance require that PHAs make the Section 8 HCV program administrative plans available for public review, they do not specify what constitutes \"public review.\" HUD collects other PHA plans, namely the one-year and five-year plans that PHAs are required to develop, and makes them publicly available on the department's website. Section 8 HCV administrative plans do not appear to be similarly collected and posted online in one place. Some PHAs make their administrative plans available on their own websites. Most of the PHAs selected for this study had websites, but the majority did not have copies of their administrative plans readily accessible on their websites.", "For those PHAs that do not make their plans available on their websites, the process through which they can be publicly accessed is less clear. PHA annual and five-year plans generally contain language stating that administrative plans are available for review in a PHA's office and an address is generally given. Since it was not feasible to physically visit the offices of the PHAs whose plans were not readily available from their website, CRS staff emailed or called PHA offices to request a copy. Most PHAs contacted by phone or email were willing to email an electronic copy of the plan. However, a subset of PHAs did not send an electronic copy of their plans via email. Most of these PHAs were willing to mail paper copies of their plans, but a few PHAs preferred to respond to a questionnaire via email in lieu of sending a plan. Some PHAs that preferred to answer a questionnaire felt it was too onerous to send a copy of their plan, while other PHAs felt that their existing plans were out-of-date and therefore did not reflect the PHA's current practices.", "Most PHAs that were contacted sent copies of plans shortly after the request was made, with a minimal number of reminders. Roughly a quarter of PHAs (36 out of 131) required extensive follow-up, which involved multiple phone calls and emails requesting a copy of the administrative plan, and at times formal follow-up letters and HUD field office assistance in obtaining the plans were necessary. Two PHAs failed to supply copies of their plans for the study. The level of effort required to obtain these public documents from many PHAs was unexpected and raised questions about the extent to which the documents are available to HUD, the public, stakeholders, and tenants for both oversight and public information purposes.", "Content and Audience", "As noted earlier, PHAs are required to include their discretionary policies in the HCV administrative plans. HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program Guidebook advises PHAs to limit the scope of their plans to include only their discretionary policies. Specifically, the guidebook states", "Because changes to the administrative plan require formal approval by the Board of Commissioners or other governing body, including HUD regulations in areas where the PHA has no discretion is not advised. The administrative plan should address only those policies areas [ sic ] in which the PHA has discretion. Program regulations and the PHA's operating procedures for complying with those regulations can be addressed in a separate procedures manual that can be updated more easily.", "Despite this guidance from HUD, of the plans reviewed by CRS, all of them included policies beyond those in which the PHA has discretion. Many of them repeated HUD regulations verbatim, although some merely summarized HUD regulations, with references to the regulations. One possible reason for the deviation from HUD's guidance is that plans including all program rules and regulations can serve as a procedures manual for PHA staff. When asked about how the plan was used, nearly all of the PHA officials interviewed for this study reported that the PHA plan was used primarily or at least regularly by program staff. Many of the PHA officials interviewed used terms like \"bible\" and \"guidebook\" to describe their administrative plans.", "When asked about the primary audience for the plan, PHA officials gave different responses, including PHA staff, HUD, local legal aid offices, and tenant advocates. Several PHA officials stated that the plan was meant for landlords and tenants, whereas others stated that they did not think their plans would be understood by residents because of their complexity and the way in which the plans were written. These observations highlight that the administrative plans, in their current forms, have multiple audiences. Further, the observations of PHA officials raise the question of whether the plans meet the needs of their multiple audiences. A limited discretion-only plan would be easier to use for HUD's oversight, and would be administratively easier to maintain for PHAs. However, a discretion-only plan would be less useful as a policy guide. If, as described by PHA officials, the administrative plans are being used as policy guidance for program staff, it follows that the plans would include detail on all of the relevant program rules and regulations. Tenants, landlords, and advocates (such as legal services attorneys) may also find an exhaustive listing of PHA policies more useful than a discretion-only plan.", "Although PHAs appeared to use these plans as definitive guides, at times the plans reviewed contained contradictory information or unclear policies. This may have resulted from PHAs stating all of the options provided under the regulations as well as their own choices of policies from those options. Further, most of the plans were lengthy (i.e., hundreds of pages), and some were dated more than 5 to 10 years before the date of this study. Several PHA officials, during the data collection process, remarked that their plans needed to be updated; several noted that updating the plans was a cumbersome process because they are so large. The infrequency of updating and the length of the plans themselves may also contribute to contradictions and unclear policies within some plans.", "Policymakers and PHAs may wish to revisit the current administrative plan model, and/or the plans themselves, to ensure they meet the intended purposes and are relevant to the intended audiences.", "Form", "A number of PHA officials who were interviewed mentioned that they purchased their Section 8 administrative plans from private companies. These officials thought that the purchase of the plan, and a related updating service, was worth the cost to ensure that the PHA was in compliance with program rules. Among the PHAs in this study, 42% had plans that appeared to come from an outside consultant.", "The private, for-profit companies that sell plan templates generally provide PHAs a set of options from which to choose in order to customize their plans. As noted in the findings of this study, in several cases PHAs appeared to view their policy discretion in the Housing Choice Voucher program from the perspective of the options provided in the plan they had purchased rather than from the perspective of the full set of discretionary options provided under the law.", "The high percentage of PHAs purchasing plans from private entities may raise several questions for policymakers. One question may be whether the existing program guidance could be streamlined or improved so that PHAs could redirect the funds spent on plans for other purposes. A related question is how well PHAs understand the authority they are currently granted under the program and what value it has to PHAs. To the extent that PHAs are not fully exercising their local discretion to tailor their programs to local needs, a final question is whether it is appropriate that private companies are effectively establishing a set of dominant local policies.", "Appendix B. Methodology", "The sampling frame used for this research limits the Public Housing Authority (PHA) universe, takes a census of very large PHAs (those with more than 6,000 units), and takes a random sample of the remaining PHA universe consisting of large, medium, and small PHAs. CRS defined the PHA universe and the PHA groupings similarly to the HUD study in 2000 on PHA discretionary authority, The Uses of Discretionary Authority in the Tenant-Based Section 8 Program , as described below. The chosen sampling frame allowed CRS to observe the discretionary choices of very large PHAs and to make comparisons between very large PHAs and a statistical representation of all other PHAs in the PHA universe. In this report, comparisons between very large PHAs and a statistical representation of all other PHAs have not been made, but the data collected could be used to do so in future reports.", "PHA Universe", "The PHA universe excludes all PHAs that operate outside of typical program rules or models. These include Moving-to-Work (MTW) PHAs, PHAs in territories, and PHAs administering state-level programs. While these types of PHAs also have discretionary authority, the parameters for their discretionary choices differ from those of the typical PHA and thus are not used for comparison. For instance, PHAs participating in the Moving-to-Work demonstration have greater discretionary authority than that of a typical PHA and are able to act outside of many of the statutory and regulatory rules that govern assisted housing programs. (For more information, see CRS Report R42562, Moving to Work (MTW): Housing Assistance Demonstration Program , by [author name scrubbed].) In addition, the PHA universe for this study excludes all PHAs with fewer than 100 units, which is consistent with the earlier HUD study. Although there is an interest in the discretionary choices of PHAs with fewer than 100 units, the time and resource constraints of this study required a limited PHA universe to reduce the necessary sample size. Although PHAs with fewer than 100 units represent approximately 24% of all PHAs, they represent only 1% of all vouchers in the program. Therefore, despite the exclusion of PHAs with fewer than 100 units and the exclusion of MTW and state-level PHAs, the PHA universe of this study, containing 1,732 PHAs, represents 99% of housing vouchers.", "Sample Size", "As noted earlier, the sampling approach used for this study has two components: a census and a stratified random sample. Very large PHAs (those with more than 6,000 units) represent only 2% of all PHAs, but they administer 29% of all subsidies in the program. Given the outsized impacts of the policies of this relatively small group of PHAs, CRS chose to include all very large PHAs in the sample. This census approach captured the discretionary choices of the 40 very large PHAs with statistical certainty. A stratified random sample was then drawn from the remaining 1,692 PHAs. To make the study size manageable, a sample of 91 PHAs was drawn, which was sufficient to allow a confidence level at 95% and a margin of error at +/- 10%. CRS believes this level of sampling accuracy is appropriate for this study, as it is an initial examination of PHA discretionary choices in which the results will be used for further research and analysis.", "The time constraints of this study did not allow for stratified random sampling based upon the size and regions of PHAs, but the study includes PHAs from the various size categories and regions to ensure that the sample does not inadvertently exclude a particular type of PHA. The size and region groupings replicate those of HUD's study to ensure similar representation. The size groupings for the sample are small (100-999 units), medium (1,000-2,499 units), and large (2,500-5,999 units). The region groupings for the sample include the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, the South, the Midwest, the Southwest, the West, and the Northwest. We randomly selected four or five PHAs from each size-region cross-section to meet the minimum sample size of 91 PHAs. Cross-sections representing the largest number of PHAs were assigned five PHAs in order to slightly reduce their under-representation.", "The sampling frame below reflects the random sampling of small, medium, and large PHAs and the census of the very large PHAs. In total, data were collected from 131 PHAs. With these data, CRS was able to describe the stated discretionary choices of very large PHAs with certainty and the stated discretionary choices of all other PHAs in the PHA universe with 95% confidence and a margin of error of +/- 10%. CRS did not attempt to make observations about the size or region groupings within this report.

Some PHAs have a broad definition for those that are homeless, while other PHAs have a more limited definition. There are PHAs that require a referral from a shelter or a social service agency to prove an applicant's homeless status, and some PHAs limit their homeless preference to households leaving transitional services. PHAs that only had a preference for homeless individuals that were graduating from the Shelter-Plus-Care program were not included in the homeless preference category because such a preference would only apply to a subset of the homeless population.", "Reference to Old Federal Preferences: PHAs that refer to rent burden, substandard housing, and displaced persons are marked as possibly deriving from the old federal preferences.
