Studies suggest that crop yields can increase as a result of applying biochar as a soil amendment. Some contend that biochar has value as an immediate climate change mitigation strategy. Scientific experiments suggest that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced significantly with biochar application to crop fields.", "Obstacles that may stall rapid adoption of biochar production systems include technology costs, system operation and maintenance, feedstock availability, and biochar handling.

It has the potential to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental hazards in the near term and to benefit agricultural producers as a soil amendment and source of renewable energy. Thus far, biochar use in the United States has been confined to small-scale applications reflective of the limited but growing number of researchers in this area over the last few years. ", "Biochar is similar in appearance to potting soil or to a charred substance, depending on the feedstock ( Figure 1 ). Modern biochar production is based on an ancient Amazon technique for creating a nutrient-rich soil, terra preta . As a charcoal containing high levels of organic matter, biochar is formed from plant and crop residues or animal manure under pyrolysis conditions. Pyrolysis is the chemical breakdown of a substance under extremely high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. The quantity and quality of biochar production depends on the feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, and pyrolysis processing time. A \"fast\" pyrolysis (~500\u00b0C) produces biochar in a matter of seconds, while a \"slow\" pyrolysis produces considerably more biochar but in a matter of hours. ", "Biochar production via pyrolysis is considered a carbon-negative process because the biochar sequesters carbon while simultaneously enhancing the fertility of the soil on which the feedstock used to produce the bioenergy grows ( Figure 2 ). The biochar production system is operated using energy produced by the system. The three main outputs of a biochar production system are syngas, bio-oil, and biochar ( Figure 3 ).

Studies suggest that biochar sequesters approximately 50% of the carbon available within the biomass feedstock being pyrolyzed, depending upon the feedstock type. The remaining carbon is released during pyrolysis and may be captured for energy production. Large amounts of carbon may be sequestered in the soil for long time periods (hundreds to thousands of years at an estimate), but precise estimates of carbon amounts sequestered as a result of biochar application are scarce. One scientist suggests that a 250-hectare farm could sequester 1,900 tons of CO 2 a year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction", "paragraphs": ["Primary greenhouse gases associated with the agriculture sector are nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ). Cropland soils and grazing lands are an agricultural source of nitrous oxide emissions. Livestock manure management and enteric fermentation are leading agricultural sources of methane emissions. When applied to the soil, biochar can lower greenhouse gas emissions by substantially reducing the release of nitrous oxide. One report showed a 40% reduction in emissions of this greenhouse gas, which is approximately 310 times stronger than carbon dioxide in terms of global warming potential. Laboratory studies suggest that nitrous oxide emission reductions from biochar-treated soil are dependent on soil moisture and soil aeration. Greenhouse gas emission reductions may be 12%-84% greater if biochar is land-applied instead of combusted for energy purposes.

To date, feedstock for biochar has consisted mostly of plant and crop residues, a primary domain of the agricultural community. There may be a role for the forestry community to be involved, as woody biomass is deemed a cost-effective, readily available, feasible feedstock. Little is known about the advantages of using manure as a biomass feedstock. According to a group of researchers in Australia, manure-based biochar \"has advantages over typically used plant-derived material because it is a by-product of another industry and in some regions is considered a waste material with little or no value. It can therefore provide a lower cost base and alleviate sustainability concerns related to using purpose-grown biomass for the process.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biochar Handling", "paragraphs": ["The spreading of biochar as a soil amendment is ripe for further exploration.

In addition to direct carbon capture and sequestration activities, Congress may consider the role of biological (indirect) sequestration\u2014such as biochar production technology\u2014that can be implemented by agricultural producers at the field level. The establishment of an offset program, identification of eligible project types, carbon offset ownership, and offset verification may be pertinent to the adoption of biochar production technology.", "Congress may examine the use of biochar as an indirect carbon sequestration technology that could be used to offset carbon emissions from major emitters. In 2008, 6% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were attributed to the agricultural sector. While not as large as the amounts produced by some other sectors, agricultural emissions come from a large number of decentralized sources, leading many to conclude that controlling such emissions would be difficult. On the other hand, some argue that soil carbon sequestered as a result of biochar application is easily quantifiable and transparent, which may be ideal for carbon trading requirements. Others contend that ancillary benefits could include additional revenue earned by agricultural producers through the sale of carbon credits earned from biochar application or the sale of biochar as a soil amendment. Energy costs for a producer's operation may be reduced by using the energy generated from the biochar production system.

Others argued that the legislation lacked specific actions regarding technology transfer or commercial development of biochar production systems.", "The discussion draft of the American Power Act offered during the 111 th Congress contained three provisions relevant to biochar. The first provision identified projects for biochar production and use as an eligible project type under the domestic offsets program. The second provision instructed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to submit to Congress a report on the sources and effects of black carbon emissions, and strategies to reduce black carbon emissions, including \"research and development activities needed to better characterize the feasibility of biochar techniques to decrease emissions, increase carbon soil sequestration, and improve agricultural production, and if appropriate, encourage broader application of those techniques.\" The third provision directed the Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants for up to 60 facilities to \"conduct research, develop, demonstrate and deploy biochar production technology for the purpose of sequestering carbon.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Farm Bill", "paragraphs": ["The 110 th Congress promoted biochar development through the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ), which listed it under grants for High Priority Research and Extension Areas.
