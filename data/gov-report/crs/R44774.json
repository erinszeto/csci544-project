Surveys and assessment reports conducted over the past two decades have evaluated the benefits and challenges related to federal requirements for academic research. Among specific areas of concern frequently brought forth by researchers and academic administrators are the amount of time spent on completing administrative tasks compared to conducting research; the increasing number, and lack of harmonization, of requirements across federal funding agencies; the adequacy of stakeholder engagement in the review and modification of federal regulations; and the need for updated requirements for human subjects and animal research.", "Legislation was enacted in the 114th Congress that addressed a number of the concerns, including the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA, P.L. 114-329), and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA, P.L. 114-328). Enacted provisions addressed a subset of issues focused on specific agencies, including conflicts of interest disclosure, financial reporting, and subrecipient monitoring. Enacted provisions also addressed cross-agency efforts by directing the establishment of an advisory committee (Research Policy Board) with federal and non-federal stakeholders, as well as an interagency working group (WG) on federal research regulations.", "The 115th Congress may conduct oversight as agencies work to implement the provisions enacted in the 114th Congress.

Federal funds provide more than half of the total amount U.S. universities and colleges spend on R&D each year. Institutional funds from U.S. universities and colleges are the next largest source of support, providing approximately one-quarter of the total R&D funds spent each year. Businesses, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations, among others, provide the remaining sources of funding for academic R&D. ", "Federal funds are provided through grants and other mechanisms by more than two dozen federal agencies. Over 90% of this funding comes collectively from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ( Table 1 ). NIH alone provides U.S. universities and colleges with more than 60% of all federal funding for academic R&D ( Figure 1 ). ", "A 2012 survey by the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) to \"determine the impact of federal regulations and requirements on the research process\" found that researchers spent on average 42% of their time on federally funded projects meeting administrative requirements rather than conducting research directly. According to the survey, \"most respondents agreed that administrative workload associated with federally-funded research has increased in the past 5 to 6 years.\" ", "Furthermore, a 2015 report by Vanderbilt University estimated the cost of compliance with federal research regulations across 13 U.S. universities and colleges at between 11% and 25% of each institution's research expenditures. ", "Broadly, the academic community has indicated an interest in harmonizing federal regulations across agencies and eliminating some regulations. In a joint statement, the Association of American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and Council on Governmental Relations asserted the following: ", "Minimizing administrative and compliance costs ultimately will provide a cost benefit to the Federal government and to university administrators, faculty, and students by freeing up resources and time to directly support educational and research efforts. ", "A similar sentiment has been expressed by some Members of Congress. For example, in a 2016 subcommittee hearing, a few Members raised concern that federal laws, regulations, and reporting requirements are creating a situation where too much time and resources are spent on complying with federal requirements. In a 2014 subcommittee hearing, the NSF Inspector General highlighted the importance of maintaining accountability in efforts aimed at reducing investigators' administrative workloads, stating:", "As accountability professionals, my office and the IG community are committed to striking the appropriate balance between reducing burden and maintaining proper accountability. To that end, we are focused on ways to ensure that that balance is maintained or strengthened, not diminished."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Research Grant Requirements", "paragraphs": ["As described in a 2016 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, federal research grants can be divided into several stages\u2014pre-award, award, post-award implementation, and closeout\u2014that are each associated with specific administrative requirements. For example, after a grant is awarded, grant recipients must meet a number of federal requirements associated with post-award implementation, including documenting personnel expenses and the purchase of research equipment and supplies, managing and reporting on the project's budget, and reporting on any subaward recipients. ", "While this report focuses on federal requirements, academic institutions also develop internal policies for managing awards more broadly, including federal, state, and nonprofit awards. Requirements set by the institution facilitate compliance with federal regulations but may also add to the administrative workload. Institutional requirements vary depending on such factors as the size and focus of the institution and its research program, as well as the availability, or lack of, a sponsored research office.

The single audit concept focuses on reviewing a federal grant recipient's internal controls rather than looking closely at specific expenditures of a grant award. The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 ( P.L. 106-107 ) included provisions to simplify reporting requirements and required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to coordinate a common application and reporting system for grants. Subsequently, Grants.gov was created in 2003, through which grant-seekers can find and apply for discretionary funding opportunities from federal agencies. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act, P.L. 113-101 ) included requirements that OMB and the Department of the Treasury standardize data element definitions and design \"a pilot for developing recommendations to reduce recipient reporting burden.\" GAO reports that, while steps are being taken, more work is needed to fully implement the DATA Act's requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uniform Guidance", "paragraphs": ["In 2013, OMB consolidated and streamlined numerous circulars pertaining broadly to federal awards into a final guidance document, called the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (commonly referred to as the Uniform Guidance or UG).

", "In some cases, in addition to standard forms used across federal agencies, supplemental agency-specific forms are also required. For example, Standard Form 424 Research and Related is a government-wide application form, but many agencies require an additional form to be submitted through either Grants.gov or an agency-specific website (e.g., FastLane for NSF).

The GAO report concluded that some of the efforts by OMB and agencies to allow more institutional flexibility (e.g., expanded authorities for certain aspects of budget management and revised requirements for personnel documentation) had led to reduced administrative workloads and costs, though more could be done. The NAS report concluded that a new framework was needed \"to ensure that regulatory requirements are justified, proportional to the problems being addressed, and harmonized across funding agencies so as to create a more effective and efficient partnership between funding agencies and research institutions.\" ", "Additionally, in 2014, the National Science Board (NSF's governing body) released a report examining administrative workload of federally funded investigators, which asserted a \"consensus that some of these [administrative and compliance] requirements are interfering with the conduct of science out of proportion with the accepted need to ensure accountability, transparency, and safety.\" And as previously discussed, the Federal Demonstration Partnership released reports from survey findings in 2012 and 2005 indicating a substantial portion of a researcher's time is spent addressing administrative tasks.

In 1999, the author concluded that a number of issues were \"not new, often having been identified by other studies\" and addressing them would require \"sustained attention.\"", "Across these reports, stakeholders have cited a variety of areas as contributing to administrative workload and costs. These include grant proposal preparation, financial management, effort reporting and personnel management, monitoring of grant subrecipients, and progress reporting.
