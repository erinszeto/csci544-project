{"id": "RL32608", "title": "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: Selected Legislation from the 108th Congress", "released_date": "2005-01-11T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1801 et seq. , (FISA) as passed in1978, provided a statutory framework for the use of electronic surveillance in the context of foreignintelligence gathering. In so doing, Congress sought to strike a delicate balance between nationalsecurity interests and personal privacy rights. Subsequent legislation expanded federal laws dealingwith foreign intelligence gathering to address physical searches, pen registers and trap and tracedevices, and access to certain business records. The Uniting and Strengthening America byProviding Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Actof 2001, P.L. 107-56 , made significant changes to some of these provisions. Further amendmentsto FISA were included in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, P.L. 107-108 , andthe Homeland Security Act of 2002, P.L. 107-296 . In addressing international terrorism orespionage, the same factual situation may be the focus of both criminal investigations and foreignintelligence collection efforts. The changes in FISA under these public laws facilitate informationsharing between law enforcement and intelligence elements. In The 9/11 Commission Report, FinalReport of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (W. W. Norton2004) ( Final Report ), the 9/11 Commission noted that the removal of the pre-9/11 \"wall\" betweenintelligence and law enforcement \"has opened up new opportunities for cooperative action withinthe FBI.\"", "In the 108th Congress, a number of intelligence reform bills were introduced, including somewhich pre-dated the release of the Final Report of the 9/11 Commission, while others emerged afterits release. On December 17, 2004, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, P.L. 108-458 ( S. 2845 ), was signed into law. It included several provisions related toFISA. In addition to P.L. 108-458 , a variety of other bills were introduced with FISA-relatedprovisions. The FISA provisions of some of these measures were part of larger intelligence reform proposals. Still others were more narrowly focused measures that would also have impacted FISAinvestigations in the post-9/11 environment. This report briefly discusses the FISA-related aspectsof these proposals. For purposes of this report, the bills addressed are divided generally into twocategories: intelligence reform or reorganization proposals that have FISA provisions, including P.L.108-458 ( S. 2845 ), H.R. 10 , H.R. 4104 , H.R. 5040 , H.R. 5150 , S. 6 , S. 190 , S. 1520 , S. 2811 , S. 2840 , and Senator Pat Roberts' draft bill; and otherFISA-related bills, including H.R. 1157 , H.R. 2242 , H.R. 2429 , H.R. 2800 , H.R. 3179 , H.R. 3352 , H.R. 3552 , H.R. 4591 , H.Amdt. 652 to H.R. 4574 , S. 113 , S. 123 , S. 410 , S. 436 , S. 578 , S. 1158 , S. 1507 , S. 1552 , S. 1709 , S. 2528 , and S.Amdt. 536 to S. 113 .
