Prior to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended), DSH payments were provided by a statutory formula that increased the IPPS reimbursement amount based on the disproportionate patient percentage (DPP). The DPP is based on a hospital's share of low-income patients, defined as the share of Medicare inpatient days for beneficiaries receiving Supplementary Security Income (SSI) benefits out of total Medicare inpatient days plus the share of Medicaid inpatient days out of the hospital's total inpatient days. Figure 6 provides an illustration of the DPP. DSH payment adjustments may be made if a hospital's DPP exceeds the necessary DPP threshold.", "In a 2007 report to Congress, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) estimated that current DSH funding exceeded its empirically justified rate. A provision in the ACA modified DSH funding that otherwise would have been provided in FY2014 and following fiscal years as empirically justified DSH payments and additional payments that reflect uncompensated care. The ACA modification specified that empirically justified DSH payments would be distributed based on the traditional DPP (see Figure 6 ) and necessary thresholds but reduced payment adjustments by 75%. The remaining 75% of DSH payments that otherwise would have been provided prior to this modification would be distributed as uncompensated-care payments, but these payments would be reduced over time by changes in the rate of individuals without health insurance in the United States.", "Uncompensated-care payments are provided each fiscal year based on each hospital's share of uncompensated care out of the total amount of uncompensated care of all hospitals that receive DSH (including in Puerto Rico). In contrast to the DSH payment adjustment, which is a percentage increase to the IPPS payment, uncompensated-care payments are calculated as an aggregate dollar amount and distributed to each hospital through the IPPS payment. Each hospital's aggregate dollar amount of uncompensated-care payment is distributed on a per Medicare discharge basis. The ACA requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to determine the amount of uncompensated care based on the most appropriate data available. Currently, the Secretary uses each hospital's share of Medicare SSI inpatient days and Medicaid inpatient days as a proxy for uncompensated care; however, beginning in FY2018, the Secretary has proposed to gradually transition from this proxy to uncompensated-care information (defined as charity care plus non-Medicare bad debt costs) contained in hospital-submitted cost reports. This transition is proposed to be complete beginning FY2020.", "Individuals residing in Puerto Rico are ineligible for SSI benefits. Rather, Puerto Rico provides assistance under Title XVI of the SSA\u2014Assistance to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled. Because Medicare SSI inpatient days are used both in the DSH payment-adjustment formula and for distributing uncompensated-care payments, advocates have argued that the DSH payment-adjustment formula disadvantages hospitals in Puerto Rico. Beginning in FY2017, the Secretary has proposed to use 14% of a Puerto Rican DSH hospital's Medicaid days as a proxy for SSI days in calculating the proxy for uncompensated care (Medicare SSI inpatient days and Medicaid inpatient days). This proxy will be used for each Puerto Rican DSH hospital's share of uncompensated care and will be included in the total amount of uncompensated care of all hospitals. Therefore, beginning in FY2017, Puerto Rican DSH hospitals may receive uncompensated-care payments based on their share of uncompensated care (defined as Medicaid inpatient days plus an additional 14% of their Medicaid inpatient days in FY2017) of the total amount of uncompensated care of all DSH hospitals. Beginning FY2018, the Secretary has also proposed to gradually transition from using 14% of Medicaid days as a proxy for SSI days for Puerto Rican DSH hospitals to uncompensated care information (defined as charity care plus non-Medicare bad debt costs) contained in hospital-submitted cost reports. In the same manner as non-Puerto Rican DSH hospitals, this transition for Puerto Rican DSH hospitals is proposed to be complete beginning FY2020.

Further, Puerto Rico does not have an MSP to assist low-income Medicare beneficiaries with their Part B premium payments. Therefore, automatically enrolling low-income individuals into a program that carries a premium could subject them to costs that they cannot afford.

Per capita spending varied across the country, as did payments to private plans. Plans primarily chose to serve areas where Medicare spending was high or areas that had a long history of managed-care participation. The plans often offered generous supplemental benefits, such as prescription drug coverage and low cost sharing. ", "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA97; P.L. 105-33 ) created the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program and a formula for determining plan payments. The formula was designed to (1) slow the growth of payments in high-expenditure areas, (2) raise payments to a minimum, or floor rate , in areas with low per capita FFS spending, and (3) blend local rates toward a national average over time, all subject to a budget-neutrality provision. The portion of the formula that created the floor rate was designed to encourage participation in areas that previously had not been served. Subsequently, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA; P.L. 106-554 ) created a second floor rate, sometimes referred to as the urban floor rate , which applied to counties within metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with a population of more than 250,000 people within the 50 states and DC.", "Private plan participation expanded slightly after BBA97 but then experienced a period of retraction that lasted through 2003. The goal of controlling spending by slowing the growth of payments in higher spending areas may have dampened the interest of private plans to develop new markets and add plan options, although the reasons for the reduction in plan interest may have been more complex. Regulatory burden, difficulty establishing provider networks, and\u2014at least in the late 1990s\u2014market competition all could have played a role as well.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA; P.L. 108-173 ) replaced the M+C program with the Medicare Advantage program and added an optional outpatient prescription drug benefit (Part D). The MMA again changed how plans were paid. It instituted the payment method based on bids and benchmarks described above (see \" How Are Private Plans Paid Under MA? \") and established the previous payment rates under the M+C program as the beginning benchmarks for the MA program. Each county benchmark was increased yearly by the growth in overall Medicare spending; however, in certain years designated by the HHS Secretary as rebasing years , the benchmark was the greater of either (1) the previous year's benchmark increased by the growth in overall spending or (2) projected per capita FFS spending in that county. This methodology increased benchmarks. ", "Plan participation and enrollment expanded. For the first time starting in 2006, all beneficiaries had access to at least one MA plan. However, because the benchmarks were set at amounts above per capita spending in original Medicare in many parts of the country, estimated spending to provide covered benefits to MA enrollees exceeded what would have been spent had those beneficiaries remained in original Medicare. In 2010, benchmarks for all MA plans exceeded estimated FFS spending by 17% and payments to MA plans exceeded estimated FFS spending by 13%. ", "Whereas changes to private plan payment methodology between 1997 and 2010 reflected policies designed to increase participation, another set of changes made as part of the ACA sought to establish neutrality between payments to plans and expenditures under original Medicare. The ACA changed the benchmark calculation, bringing it closer to or below the value of FFS spending. Under the ACA, county benchmarks are set at a percentage of FFS spending in each county. The percentage multiplied by per capita FFS spending in each county is either 95%, 100%, 107.5%, or 115%, with higher percentages applied to counties with the lowest FFS spending. In other words, the 25% of counties with the lowest FFS spending will receive the highest percentage (115%) of per capita FFS as their MA benchmark. The 25% of counties in the 50 states and DC with the highest FFS spending will receive the lowest percentage (95%) of per capita FFS. The transition to the new methodology will take place over two, four, or six years, with a longer transition period for counties expected to have larger benchmark decreases. ", "As of 2015, 27% of counties are still transitioning to the ACA benchmark calculation methodology. Benchmarks for all MA plans exceeded estimated FFS spending by 7%, and payments to MA plans exceeded estimated FFS spending by 2%.

These provisions were in BBA97, BIPA, and the ACA.", "First, under the BBA97 methodology, the minimum payment (or floor rate) was set at $367 in 1998 in the 50 states and DC; for areas outside of the states and DC (including Puerto Rico and the other territories), the payment was limited to 150% of the annual per capita payment rate in effect in 1997 (which was 95% of average per capita FFS spending in the county, with adjustments). The county payment rates in Puerto Rico in 1997 ranged from $149 to $259 per person per month, with an enrollee-weighted average of $201 per person per month. The payment rates in Puerto Rico for 1998 reflected the change specified by BBA97 and ranged from $223 to $367 per person per month, with an enrollee-weighted average payment of $302 per person per month. The floor calculation for Puerto Rico under BBA97 represented a payment increase for 1998, but given that per capita FFS spending in Puerto Rico was low, the new payments for Puerto Rico were often less than payments in the 50 states and DC.", "The BIPA payment provision also was different for Puerto Rico (and the other territories). That legislation established the second minimum, or floor payment, rate for urban areas, as described above. The urban floor rate for qualifying counties in the 50 states and DC was set in statute at $525 for 2001. Outside of the states and DC, a county that otherwise would qualify as an urban floor based on its MSA status received a 2001 payment rate that did not exceed 120% of its payment in 2000. The county payment rates in Puerto Rico in 2000 ranged from $243 to $401 per person per month, with an enrollee-weighted average of $329. The urban floor calculation for Puerto Rico under BIPA again represented an increase relative to rates prior to BIPA, but it was lower than the $525 level specified for the 50 states and DC.", "Until the ACA, all other payment provisions applied to Puerto Rico in the same manner as in the 50 states, including the provisions for updating county-level payments (and later benchmarks). Just as average benchmarks rose above the level of per capita FFS spending in the 50 states and DC (118% of per capita FFS spending), so too did benchmarks rise in Puerto Rico. In 2009, all but one benchmark in Puerto Rico was set at the statutory floor rate, which at that time was 180% of estimated FFS spending in the county.", "The third payment provision to MA plans that was specifically different for Puerto Rico (and all territories) was in the ACA. Under the benchmark-calculation provisions\u2014in which benchmarks are set at a percentage of FFS\u2014Puerto Rico is not included in the original calculation of the county quartiles. The 50 states and DC are separated into low, medium-low, medium-high, and high per capita FFS expenditure counties, where 25% of all counties are in each of the four groups. Once the level of per capita spending that distinguishes each of the four groups is determined, Puerto Rican counties are allotted to the appropriate group based on their per capita FFS spending. In 2015, all Puerto Rican counties are in the lowest spending quartile group. This methodology does not so much benefit Puerto Rico as allow more counties in the 50 states to occupy that lowest spending quartile where the benchmarks are set at the highest percentage of FFS spending.", "The transition to the ACA methodology represents a decrease in MA benchmarks in Puerto Rico.
