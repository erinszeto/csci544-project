In recent years, HMTF annual expenditures have remained relatively flat while HMT collections have increased due to rising import volume (except in 2009 when collections declined along with import volume). Consequently, a large \"surplus\" in the HMTF has developed. The maritime industry seeks to enact a \"spending guarantee\" to spend down the surplus in the HMTF (see H.R. 104 and S. 412 ). Some harbor channels are reportedly not being maintained at their authorized depth and width, requiring ships with the deepest drafts to \"light load\" or wait for high tide. Harbors primarily used by fishing vessels or recreational craft have also complained of insufficient maintenance dredging. Since spending from the HMTF requires an appropriation from Congress, spending more from the HMTF could reduce available funding for other Energy and Water Development activities under congressional budget caps.

In the past, Congress has taken measures to ensure temporary solvency of the IWTF, either by appropriating federal funds beyond the aforementioned 50% federal requirement (FY2009 and FY2010), or by limiting IWTF expenditures to the amount available under current year fuel tax revenues (FY2011 and FY2012).

These programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and replacement of components. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009.

An LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile is ongoing; its FY2010 actual appropriation was $231.9 million and the FY2011 enacted figure was $248.2 million. The FY2012 request was $257.0 million for the W76 LEP and $223.6 million for the B61 LEP. The latter represents a shift \"from a feasibility study to a full LEP\"; no funds were requested in FY2010 or FY2011 for the B61 LEP. This LEP is intended to extend the service life of B61 mods 3, 4, and 7 nuclear bombs\u2014combining them into a new mod, B61 mod 12\u2014for another 30 years, with the first production unit to be completed in FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $278.6 million for the B61 for FY2012 in order to begin the LEP. It allowed NNSA to spend up to half that amount until it meets certain reporting requirements, such as \"a cost-benefit analysis of any warhead enhancements.\" For the W76 LEP, the committee recommended $255.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $180.0 million for the B61 LEP and $257.0 million for the W76 LEP. The committee called the B61 LEP \"the most ambitious and extensive refurbishment of a weapon system to date.\" Further, \"NNSA plans to incorporate untried technologies and design features to improve the safety and security of the nuclear stockpile. The committee supports enhanced surety of weapon systems \u2026 but it should not come at the expense of long-term weapon reliability.\" The committee directed the submission of two reports and a certification on this LEP. The final appropriation was $257.0 million for the W76 LEP and $223.6 million for the B61 LEP. Of the latter amount, the conference agreement withheld $134.1 million until NNSA provided the appropriations committees with results of a design definition and cost study. While the November 2010 1251 report stated that the W76 \"LEP will be fully funded for the life of the program at $255 million annually,\" the FY2013 request was $174.9 million. Donald Cook, Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, NNSA, reportedly said that the revised plan would meet the Navy's operational needs for W76s by the end of 2018 but would delay completion of production for extra W76s as a hedge force until 2021. This approach, he said, would free up funds for the B61 LEP. The House Appropriations Committee noted its deep concern about NNSA's \"ability to deliver on its production requirements.\" It recommended adding $45.1 million above the request for the W76 LEP to raise the production rate beyond what NNSA had planned in the FY2013 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed its concern about a \"significant funding decrease\" given that the W76 is \"the largest share of our nuclear deterrent on the most survivable leg of the Triad.\" It noted that shifting funds to the B61 \"is not fully justified\" because the B61 LEP is behind schedule, it \"will not be able to efficiently spend the requested amount,\" and there are carryover balances. Accordingly, it increased funds for the W76 LEP by $30 million and reduced funds for the B61 LEP by the same amount. Regarding the B61 bomb, the 1251 report stated that NNSA \"will accelerate\" work \"that is necessary to retain the schedule for the completion of the first production unit in FY 2017.\" However, the FY2013 request planned for the first production unit in FY2019. According to one report, \"NNSA was able to delay the project by two years due to new assumptions about the need to replace limited life components in the bomb.\" (These components have a service life shorter than that of the rest of the weapon, so must be replaced from time to time.) The FY2013 request for the B61 LEP was $369.0 million, an increase of more than 50%, compared to FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended the amount requested. Noting its concern over funds spent on a higher-cost option for the B61 LEP even though a lower-cost option was subsequently chosen, the committee directed NNSA \"to report the total amount of funding it has spent to date for development and experimental activity associated with the full option for the B61 life extension program.\" In addition to recommending a reduction in B61 LEP funds by $30 million, as noted, the Senate Appropriations Committee stressed that a validated cost, schedule, and scope baseline for this LEP is essential for evaluating life cycle costs, assessing the impact of this LEP on other programs, and determining if the proposed schedule meets military requirements, among other things. Accordingly, it \"directs that no funding be used for B61 life extension program activities until NNSA submits to the Committee a validated cost, schedule, and scope baseline.\" Stockpile Systems. This program involves routine maintenance, replacement of limited-life components, surveillance, assessment, and the like for all weapon types in the stockpile. For FY2012, the request was $497.6 million and the final appropriation provided the same amount. Of these funds, it directed NNSA to use $175.0 million for surveillance and $99.5 million for W78 Stockpile Systems. The FY2013 request was $590.4 million, a 20% increase over FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $454.2 million for Stockpile Systems. The request included $76.6 million under W78 Stockpile Systems for studying the feasibility of a common W78/W88 warhead, and $59.7 million for a W88 program (\"Alt 370\") that included consideration of commonalities between the two warheads. The House Appropriations Committee recommended fully funding these latter two amounts under a new category, Stockpile Assessment and Design, in order to help distinguish these costs from routine stockpile work. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding Stockpile Systems as requested, with the requested amounts for the W78 LEP study and the W88 Alt 370 program, and at least $181.0 million for surveillance. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD). The President and Congress have agreed on the desirability of reducing the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security, and numbers of warheads have fallen sharply since the end of the Cold War. Because of the large number of warheads being retired, there is a need to dismantle some warheads and to further break down some components to \"prevent storage problems across the [nuclear weapons] enterprise.\" WDD involves interim storage of warheads to be dismantled; dismantlement; and disposition (i.e., storing or eliminating warhead components and materials). The FY2012 request was $56.8 million and the appropriation provided that amount. The FY2103 request was $51.3 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended fully funding this request; the latter committee commended NNSA for completing two dismantlements (W62 and B53) a year ahead of schedule. Stockpile Services. This category includes Production Support; R&D Support; R&D Certification and Safety; Management, Technology, and Production; and Plutonium Infrastructure Sustainment. NNSA states, \"Stockpile Services provides the foundation for the production capability and capacity within the nuclear security enterprise. All enduring systems, LEPs, and dismantlements rely on Stockpile Services to provide the base development, production and logistics capability needed to meet program requirements. In addition, Stockpile Services funds research, development and production activities that support two or more weapons-types, and work that is not identified or allocated to a specific weapon-type.\" The FY2012 request was $928.6 million and the final appropriation provided $854.5 million, of which $64.0 million was to be used for surveillance. The FY2013 request was $902.7 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $838.5 million, including an increase of $25.0 million for Production Support \"for investments needed to modernize manufacturing processes\" and a reduction of $46.6 million to R&D Certification and Safety to deny funds for certain new development activities and limit future requests for this activity to annual assessments of the stockpile and investigating warhead problems. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $892.7 million, expressed its concern about significant recent increases for Production Support on grounds that it \"is relatively insensitive to major shifts in activities,\" and \"directs NNSA to provide additional information in future budget justifications to explain these increasing costs.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Campaigns", "paragraphs": ["These are \"multi-year, multi-functional efforts\" that \"provide specialized scientific knowledge and technical support to the directed stockpile work on the nuclear weapons stockpile.\" Many campaigns have significance for policy decisions. For example, the Science Campaign's goals include improving the ability to assess warhead performance without nuclear testing, improving readiness to conduct nuclear tests should the need arise, and maintaining the scientific infrastructure of the nuclear weapons laboratories. Campaigns also fund some large experimental facilities, such as the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The FY2013 request included five campaigns:", "Science Campaign. According to NNSA, this campaign \"develops our nation's scientific capabilities and experimental infrastructure used to assess the safety, security, reliability, and performance of the nuclear explosives package (NEP) [the explosive component of a nuclear weapon] without reliance on further underground testing.\" The FY2012 request was $405.9 million and the final appropriation provided $334.0 million. The FY2013 request was $350.1 million. Much of the increase was for increasing the rate at which a certain experiment is conducted, and developing \"expanded predictive science capabilities needed for national security assessments motivated by intelligence community requirements for foreign nuclear weapon assessments.\" The House Appropriations Committee recommended $27.0 million above the request as a result of realigning funding from Directed Stockpile Work for certain experimental activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. Engineering Campaign. This campaign \"provides the modern tools and capabilities needed to ensure the safety, security, reliability and performance of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile \u2026 [It] funds activities that assess and improve fielded nuclear and non-nuclear engineering components without further underground testing.\" For FY2012, the request was $143.1 million, and the appropriation provided that amount. The FY2013 request was $150.6 million; the subprogram with the largest dollar increase, of $4.9 million, was Enhanced Surety, the goal of which is to \"modernize and enhance surety options\" for LEPs and other changes to weapons. (\"Surety\" includes such characteristics as safety, security, and use control.) Enhanced Surveillance was reduced by $2.6 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $8.0 million above the request as a result of realigning funding for some surety technologies from Directed Stockpile Work. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign. This campaign is developing the tools to create extremely high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory\u2014approaching those of a nuclear explosion\u2014to support weapons-related research and to attract scientific talent to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. NNSA states, \"Virtually all of the energy from a nuclear weapon is generated while in the high energy density (HED) state. High-energy density physics (HEDP) experiments conducted at ICF facilities are required to validate the advanced theoretical models used to assess and certify the stockpile without nuclear testing. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) extends HEDP experiments to include access to thermonuclear burn conditions in the laboratory, a unique and unprecedented scientific achievement.\" The centerpiece of this campaign is NIF, the world's largest laser. While NIF was controversial in Congress for many years and had significant cost growth and technical problems, controversy waned as the program progressed. The facility was dedicated in May 2009. Between February 20, 2011, and March 20, 2011, NIF personnel conducted 34 \"successful target shots \u2026 in support of HEDSS [High Energy Density Stockpile Stewardship].\" In 2011, personnel conducted a total of 283 NIF shots of all types. For FY2012, the appropriation was $476.3 million. The FY2013 request was $460.0 million. The House Appropriations Committee noted the possibility that NIF will not achieve ignition in FY2012 and stated, \"the considerable costs [for NIF] will not have been warranted if the only role the National Ignition Facility (NIF) serves is that of an expensive platform for routine high energy density physics experiments.\" Further, the committee noted that in past years NNSA had permitted Livermore to use a lower overhead rate for operating NIF. \"This practice misrepresented the full costs of these activities and shifted those costs onto other programs at the laboratory.\" The committee recommended adding funds \"to mitigate any unintended adverse impacts in fiscal year 2013.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. It directed NNSA to use up to $140 million of Livermore's \"internal additional direct purchasing power \u2026 to increase the level of the laboratory's Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities funds dedicated to supporting NIF,\" and recommended that NNSA move NIF's operating budget line to RTBF \"consistent with the facility's transition to regular operations.\" The committee expressed its concern over the prospects of NIF achieving ignition by the end of FY2012 and directed NNSA to establish an advisory committee on this and related topics. Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign. This campaign develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons that integrate data from other campaigns, past test data, laboratory experiments, and elsewhere to create what NNSA calls \"the computational surrogate for nuclear testing to determine weapon behavior.\" In addition, \"ASC plays an important role in supporting nonproliferation, emergency response, nuclear forensics and attribution activities.\" Some analysts doubt that simulation can be relied upon to provide the confidence needed to certify the safety, security, and reliability of warheads, and advocate a return to testing. The campaign includes funds for hardware and operations as well as for software. For FY2012, the request was $628.9 million and the final appropriation was $620.0 million. The FY2013 request was $600.0 million. The reduction was caused by completion of an academic alliance program and delay of its follow-on program to FY2014, lower funding for exascale computing (a new and controversial initiative intended to boost computing capability by a factor of a thousand), and completion of procurement of a supercomputer. The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing the funds requested. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $620.0 million, and within these funds recommended using $69.0 million for the exascale initiative. Readiness Campaign. This campaign \"operates the capability for producing tritium to maintain the national inventory needed for the nuclear weapons stockpile and selects and matures production technologies that are required for manufacturing components to meet \u2026 requirements.\" The FY2012 request was $142.5 million, and the final appropriation was $128.6 million.

The committee recommended funding the NNSA's Capabilities-Based Facilities and Infrastructure program under Maintenance and Repair of Facilities \"in order to provide more clarity into the purpose of this funding.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and directed NNSA to \"identify funds for maintenance and operations by site as separate line items\" under RTBF in order to \"increase transparency in NNSA's efforts to sustain existing physical infrastructure.\"", "Perhaps the most controversial activity in the Weapons Activities account is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. It would replace the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building, which was built in 1952. Among other things, CMR houses research into plutonium and supports pit production at Los Alamos. Since 2005, cost estimates for CMRR have doubled or tripled, and some critics have argued that it is not necessary. For FY2012, NNSA requested $300 million for CMRR but the conference report directed that \"no construction activities are funded for the CMRR-Nuclear Facility during fiscal year 2012.\"", "NNSA requested no funds for FY2013 for CMRR. According to the request justification,", "NNSA has determined, in consultation with the national laboratories, that existing infrastructure in the nuclear complex has the inherent capacity to provide adequate support for plutonium chemistry, plutonium physics, and special nuclear materials. NNSA proposes deferring CMRR Nuclear Facility construction for at least five years. Studies are ongoing to determine long-term requirements. Instead of the CMRR Nuclear Facility, NNSA will maximize use of existing facilities and relocate some nuclear materials. Estimated cost avoidance from FY 2013 to FY 2017 totals approximately $1.8 billion.", "At the same time, another project, the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF), which will replace old facilities at the Y-12 National Security Complex, showed an increase from $160.2 million enacted for FY2012 to $340.0 million requested for FY2013; the increase was to accelerate UPF design and construction. UPF, if approved, would conduct operations involving enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and naval reactors. It would also conduct downblending of enriched uranium (i.e., reducing the fraction of fissile uranium-235 and increasing the fraction of non-fissile uranium-238) to make it unusable for weapons in support of nuclear nonproliferation. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended the amount requested.", "The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for CMRR-NF.

The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended no funds for CMRR-NF. It recommended that $35.0 million, as requested, within Nuclear Operations Capability Support be used to accelerate cleanout of the PF-4 vault.

It includes special vehicles for this purpose, communications and other supporting infrastructure, and threat response. For FY2012, the appropriation provided $243.3 million. The FY2013 request was $219.4 million; much of the decrease was due to deferring production of special vehicles for this program, completion of upgrades to the program's aviation fleet, and anticipated savings from these upgrades. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended the amount requested. Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response \"responds to and mitigates nuclear and radiological incidents worldwide and has a lead role in defending the Nation from the threat of nuclear terrorism.\" For FY2012, the appropriation was $222.1 million. The FY2013 request was $247.6 million. Much of the increase was to augment support for teams that would respond to a radiological or nuclear emergency, to accelerate \"experimental activities in support of non-stockpile nuclear weapons assessments,\" and to develop tools and methods to render \"nuclear threat devices\" safe. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $225.4 million. It stated that many activities of the newly established Office of Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation are closely linked to technologies being developed by Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) and should, in the future, be integrated with the request for DNN. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the amount requested, but expressed its concern \"that NNSA does not have a clear strategy in place that links the unique capabilities of the labs and supporting NNSA infrastructure to clear mission goals and funding requirements to support the Department of Defense and the intelligence community.\" Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) \"continues its mission to restore, rebuild and revitalize the physical infrastructure of the nuclear security enterprise.\" It focuses on \"elimination of legacy deferred maintenance.\" For FY2012, the appropriation was $96.4 million. No funds were requested for FIRP for FY2013 due to completion of the program. Some of the type of work it did will be continued by the Capability-Based Facilities and Infrastructure program, which NNSA describes as \"an enterprise-wide, program-informed investment approach to ensure infrastructure is in place to execute program workload.\" The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for FIRP but stated that \"Maintenance and Repair of Facilities [within RTBF] also includes additional funding requested for major multi-year operating expense recapitalization projects.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended no funds for FIRP but stated under Nuclear Operations Capability Support that it \"believes it is important that NNSA continue to reduce deferred maintenance on aging infrastructure and reduce the size of its footprint.\" Site Stewardship seeks to \"ensure environmental compliance and energy and operational efficiency throughout the nuclear security enterprise.\" It was a new program for FY2010, consolidating several earlier programs. For FY2012, the appropriation was $78.7 million. The FY2013 request was $90.0 million. The main increases were in the Energy Modernization and Investment Program and Corporate Project Management. The main decrease, in Nuclear Materials Integration, reflected completion of removal of certain nuclear materials from Livermore, slowing the removal of certain radioactive waste from Livermore, and deferring disposition of nuclear materials at several sites. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $79.6 million and provided no funds for the Energy Modernization and Investment Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $88.2 million and \"encourages NNSA to report on cost savings and cost avoidances related to its energy modernization and investment program.\" Safeguards and Security consists of two elements: (1) Defense Nuclear Security provides operations, maintenance, and construction funds for protective forces, physical security systems, personnel security, and the like. It \"provides protection from a full spectrum of threats, especially terrorism, for NNSA personnel, facilities, nuclear weapons, and information.\" For FY2012, the appropriated amount was $698.0 million. The FY2013 request was $643.3 million. The decrease was largely due to removal of certain nuclear materials from Livermore, which permits a reduction in protective forces, and the projected completion of the Nuclear Materials Safeguards and Security Upgrades Project in FY2013. The main increases were in physical security systems and program management. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $663.3 million. \"While efforts to reduce costs are encouraged, the NNSA has not performed a new multi-site security assessment that would justify the five percent reduction in protective forces proposed in the budget request and it is not clear how those proposed reductions would impact the security posture of NNSA facilities.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. \"The Committee is encouraged by NNSA's efforts to find cost efficiencies while still meeting security requirements.\" (2) Cyber Security \"provides the requisite guidance needed to ensure that sufficient information management security safeguards are implemented throughout the NNSA enterprise.\" For FY2012, the appropriation was $126.6 million. No funds were requested for this program for FY2013, as discussed next. NNSA CIO [Chief Information Officer] Activities is a new program for FY2013; the request was $155.0 million. It will consolidate cyber security and information technology programs. Of the requested amount, $111.0 million was for cyber security, $14.0 million was for enterprise secure computing, and $30.0 million was for federal unclassified information technology. The latter will provide \"commodity computing infrastructure\" that will support a \"shift from a traditional, costly desktop support model to a cloud-provisioned virtualized desktop-based solution.\" This shift is intended to facilitate collaboration, save money, aid recruiting, and improve security. The House Appropriations Committee recommended renaming NNSA CIO Activities as Information Technology and Security, and recommended adding $5.0 million above the request \"in order to restore funding for Technology Application Development to the fiscal year 2012 level.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested funds. Legacy contractor pensions: Certain employees at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories had defined-benefit pension plans through the University of California (UC), which had been the contractor for these laboratories. However, the current contracts for the laboratories are between DOE and a consortium of contractors, one of which is UC. The current contracts (one for each laboratory) gave employees hired while UC was the sole contractor a choice between the equivalent of the UC pension plan and another plan. Many employees chose the former, which cost more than the current plan. Payment to UC's retirement plan to compensate for the added cost is a legacy cost of the UC-Los Alamos and UC-Livermore contracts. The final appropriation for FY2012 was $168.2 million; the conference report stated, \"NNSA requested these funds within Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities and a separate line is provided to improve transparency.\" The FY2013 request for this item within Weapons Activities was $185.0 million; NNSA stated that \"the amount of the annual payment is determined by actuarial valuation.\" Another $62.0 million was requested for FY2013 for this item within Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended providing funding for this purpose in both programs in the amounts requested.

In 1989, DOE established what is now the Office of Environmental Management to consolidate its responsibilities for the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities that had been administered under multiple offices. These cleanup efforts are broad in scope and include the disposal of large quantities of radioactive and other hazardous wastes generated over decades; management and disposal of surplus nuclear materials; remediation of extensive contamination in soil and groundwater; decontamination and decommissioning of excess buildings and facilities; and safeguarding, securing, and maintaining facilities while cleanup is underway. The Office of Environmental Management also is responsible for the cleanup of DOE facilities that were involved in civilian nuclear energy research, which generated wastes and contamination. These research facilities add a non-defense component to the office's mission, albeit smaller in terms of the scope of their cleanup and associated funding.

Cleanup remedies are in place and operational at the majority of these facilities. The responsibility for their long-term stewardship has been transferred to the Office of Legacy Management and other offices within DOE for the operation and maintenance of cleanup remedies and monitoring. See the \" Office of Legacy Management \" section of this report. Some of the smaller sites for which DOE initially was responsible were transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers in 1997 under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). The cleanup of these sites is funded within the civil works budget of the Corps. (See Table 4 .) Once the Corps completes the cleanup of a FUSRAP site, it is transferred back to DOE for long-term stewardship under the Office of Legacy Management.", "Much work remains to be done at the facilities that are still administered by the Office of Environmental Management. DOE expects cleanup to continue for several years or even decades at some of these facilities, necessitating billions of dollars to fulfill the cleanup liability of the United States. As of the beginning of FY2012, the Office of Environmental Management administered 17 facilities in 11 states at which cleanup was not yet complete. Although cleanup is scheduled to be complete at some of these facilities over the next several years, cleanup is expected to continue at some of the larger and more complex facilities for decades. The Hanford site in the state of Washington has the lengthiest estimated time frame, with cleanup scheduled to continue possibly as late as 2062 based on more conservative assumptions. DOE estimates that the costs to complete the cleanup of these 17 facilities could range between $174 billion and $209 billion, exceeding the past costs already incurred across the entire inventory of facilities.", "DOE periodically revises its estimates as project baselines and assumptions change. The estimates have varied widely over time by many billions of dollars. DOE typically estimates a range of costs, rather than a single dollar amount, to reflect uncertainties in the cleanup process. For example, final decisions have yet to be made at some facilities to determine the actions that will be necessary to remediate contamination. Methods to dispose of vast quantities of wastes, and the scheduling of these actions, also could affect cleanup costs and time frames. The costs of long-term stewardship also are excluded from the above estimates.

EPA and the states are responsible for overseeing DOE's performance of the cleanup of each facility under these agreements and enforcing the milestones.", "Although the cleanup milestones are legally binding, the ability to meet deadlines depends upon the availability of funding to carry out necessary actions, the technical feasibility of those actions, and in some cases, the resolution of other regulatory issues upon which a milestone may be based. Consequently, the availability of funds is not the sole factor that may determine whether DOE is capable of attaining a cleanup deadline. Furthermore, not all of the Office of Environmental Management's annual budget is available for attaining cleanup milestones, as funding also is needed for safeguarding, securing, and maintaining facilities while cleanup is underway.", "According to DOE, the President's FY2013 request for the Office of Environmental Management would support the completion of all enforceable cleanup milestones with deadlines that fall within the fiscal year. Although the House Appropriations Committee recommended less than the President requested for certain facilities, the committee observed in its report on H.R. 5325 that many schedules in existing compliance agreements were not realistic in terms of the availability of funding and technical and management challenges. The committee expressed its support for DOE to update its estimates of the completion of cleanup to provide an \"accurate accounting to all stakeholders\" for a basis to negotiate a \"clear, affordable, and attainable path forward\" at \"sites where the current schedule for cleanup will not be met.\"", "As discussed above, terms of the compliance agreements are binding and enforceable, and revisions must be negotiated among the parties to avoid potential violations if milestones or schedules cannot be met. DOE has negotiated revisions to many of its compliance agreements on multiple occasions in past years, as the challenges have become better understood over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Tank Wastes", "paragraphs": ["Cleanup progress especially has been a concern at DOE's largest nuclear weapons production facilities where high-level radioactive wastes are stored in hundreds of tanks. Under existing law, these wastes eventually are to be permanently disposed of in a geologic repository. However, the need to first remove the wastes from the tanks and treat them in a manner that would be suitable for permanent disposal has presented many technical difficulties. The availability of a geologic repository to dispose of the tank wastes once they are removed and treated could present challenges that may delay permanent disposal and thereby lengthen cleanup time frames and affect costs. The availability of such a repository also could present challenges for the permanent disposal of DOE's inventory of high-level wastes that are in the form of spent nuclear fuel. See the \" Nuclear Waste Disposal \" section of this report for a discussion of a geologic repository.", "DOE facilities where high-level tank wastes are stored and managed include the Hanford site in Washington, the Savannah River site in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory. DOE reports that there are approximately 88 million gallons of high-level wastes stored in tanks at these three locations combined. Of this inventory, 54 million gallons are stored in 177 tanks at Hanford, 33 million gallons in 49 tanks at the Savannah River site, and nearly 1 million gallons in 4 tanks at the Idaho National Laboratory. DOE reports that funding for the construction of facilities at each location that would process and treat these wastes for permanent disposal represents \"one of the primary risk and cost drivers\" for the Office of Environmental Management. The most recent estimate to complete the construction of these high-level waste treatment facilities alone is $14.2 billion. Once they are operational, additional funding and time would be needed to remove the wastes from the tanks and to process the wastes into a more stabilized form for permanent disposal.", "Because of these substantial challenges, long-term funding needs for the cleanup of Hanford, the Savannah River site, and the Idaho National Laboratory are expected to continue for decades. DOE estimates that cleanup may not be complete at Hanford until as late as 2062, at the Savannah River site until 2040, and at the Idaho National Laboratory until 2044. These lengthy time frames in part are due to the time estimated for the treatment and disposal of the substantial volumes of high-level wastes stored at these facilities. However, these estimated dates do not reflect the additional time necessary for the long-term stewardship of these sites, once the initial cleanup is completed under the Office of Environmental Management, likely resulting in even lengthier horizons for total federal responsibilities at these sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uranium Enrichment Facilities", "paragraphs": ["The source and availability of funding for the cleanup of three DOE uranium enrichment facilities has been a recurring issue in the appropriations debate. These facilities enriched uranium both for national defense purposes and the generation of electricity by commercial nuclear utilities. These facilities are located in Paducah, KY; Piketon, OH (Portsmouth plant); and Oak Ridge, TN. Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ) established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to pay for the cleanup of these facilities, and to reimburse uranium and thorium licensees for their costs of cleaning up sites that supported the enrichment facilities.", "The House Appropriations Committee recommended $425.5 million in appropriations for FY2013 from the available balance in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $442.5 million, the same amount that the President requested. Each of these amounts is less than the appropriations of $472.2 million enacted for FY2012. The overall decrease among each proposal is attributed to a reduction in funding for the Portsmouth facility, whereas funding for the Oak Ridge and Paducah facilities would increase. See Table 14 for a breakout of funds for each facility. (The Paducah and Portsmouth facilities also receive funds within the Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account.) Neither the House nor Senate Appropriations Committee, nor the President's request, included any dedicated funding within the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for reimbursement payments to uranium and thorium licensees in FY2013. However, the House Appropriations Committee highlighted the importance of the cleanup of the uranium and thorium sites to affected communities, the outstanding claim balances and total liabilities, and the need for progress in remediation.", "To finance the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, Congress originally authorized the collection of special assessments from nuclear utilities based on the portion of enrichment services each utility purchased from the federal government. Congress also authorized payments by the federal government to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund out of the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to annual appropriations. The original requirement for both the federal government, and the nuclear utilities that purchased enrichment services, to contribute to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was based on the premise that both the United States and the nuclear utilities benefitted from the production of enriched uranium and therefore should share the liability for the cleanup of facilities involved in these activities.", "The authority to collect the utility assessments, and the authorization of appropriations for the federal payment, expired on October 24, 2007. Since that time, Congress had continued federal payments to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund through the annual appropriations process, without enacting separate reauthorizing legislation. The federal payment had been made through a transfer from the Defense Environmental Cleanup account to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The federal payment is not available to DOE for obligation until it is appropriated out of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. Congress ceased the federal payment in FY2012, with no funds provided for it in P.L. 112-74 . The last federal payment of $33.6 million in FY2011 was intended to fulfill the remaining balance of the required federal contribution to the fund, as originally authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.", "Whether to reauthorize the utility assessments and the federal payment has been an issue, as repeated DOE estimates continue to suggest that the remaining balance of the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund does not appear sufficient to pay for the completion of the cleanup of the three federal uranium enrichment facilities over the long-term. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that $3.85 billion will remain available in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for appropriation by Congress, as of the beginning of FY2013. In December 2010, DOE had estimated an $11.8 billion shortfall over the long term to meet all remaining cleanup needs, and projected that the fund would be exhausted by FY2020 without additional deposits.", "Similar to prior years, the President's FY2013 request includes a proposal to reauthorize appropriations to resume the federal payment and to reauthorize the collection of the nuclear utility assessments. The President's proposal is intended to increase resources in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund that would be available for appropriation by Congress. The President's FY2013 request states the Administration's position that reauthorization is necessary \"due to higher-than-expected cleanup costs.\" OMB estimates that reauthorization of the nuclear utility assessments would generate $200 million in revenues in FY2013, and the President's FY2013 request included $463 million within the Defense Environmental Cleanup account to resume the federal payment, subject to reauthorizing legislation. Neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations Committee proposed appropriations to resume the federal payment in FY2013.", "In this debate, the nuclear utilities have asserted that they have fulfilled their share of the cleanup liability, as originally authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, the amounts envisioned in the statute were based upon estimates of funding needs at that time. As waste disposal and remediation challenges have become more defined in the intervening years, DOE estimates that greater funding is needed to complete the cleanup of the uranium enrichment facilities than initially thought. Whether the remaining cleanup liability should be shared by the nuclear utilities and the federal government continues to be an issue. If the available balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is expended, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 still requires DOE to pay the costs of cleanup, subject to annual appropriations. If the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is not reauthorized and becomes fully expended, the remaining cleanup costs could be borne at the expense of the federal taxpayer alone.", "To augment the existing balance of the fund and extend its availability for appropriations, DOE has transferred portions of excess federal uranium inventories in exchange for cleanup services performed by private parties. The President's FY2013 request includes a plan to transfer up to 1,750 metric tons of excess uranium within that fiscal year. The value of this material in terms of offsetting the need for appropriations would depend on the actual amounts that are transferred and the market value at the time of transfer. Although DOE has relied upon these transfers to accomplish certain aspects of cleanup efforts in recent years, the department's authority for the contracting mechanisms that are used to execute the transfers, and the potential impact on uranium markets, have received heightened attention within Congress.", "The House Appropriations Committee addressed some of the above issues in its report on H.R. 5325 , expressing its concern about the costs of reinstating the nuclear utility assessments on industry and ultimately on electricity consumers at a time of rising energy prices. The committee also questioned the reliability of DOE's estimates of long-term funding needs to complete the cleanup of the three federal uranium enrichment facilities as the basis for the President's proposal to reinstate the nuclear utility assessments and to resume the federal payment. Regarding the transfer of excess federal uranium inventories, the committee voiced its concern that this mechanism has focused on enhancing cleanup at the Portsmouth facility and has not included the Paducah facility so far. The committee also questioned the lack of congressional oversight in the use of these transfers in exchange for cleanup services, observed the uncertainty these exchanges raise in terms of Congress determining the annual funding level that is needed to augment them, and directed DOE to \"clearly outline all potential impacts\" on the domestic uranium mining industry in the update of its excess federal uranium inventory management plan.", "In the first session of the 112 th Congress, related legislation ( H.R. 2054 and S. 1135 ) was introduced to authorize the re-enrichment of excess federal inventories of depleted uranium for sale. As introduced, both bills would authorize a pilot program to re-enrich depleted uranium owned by the federal government, and would direct proceeds from the sale of the re-enriched uranium into the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The quantity that could be sold would be limited to minimize the impact on domestic markets. These proceeds would be authorized as mandatory funds that would be available directly to DOE for cleanup purposes, without being subject to discretionary appropriations. A substitute amendment to H.R. 2054 , approved in a House Subcommittee markup in the First Session on July 27, 2011, would make the proceeds deposited into the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund subject to discretionary appropriations prior to being made available to DOE for obligation to perform cleanup activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of Legacy Management", "paragraphs": ["Once cleanup remedies are in place under the Office of Environmental Management, DOE's Office of Legacy Management administers the long-term stewardship of the facilities that do not have a continuing mission. The Office of Legacy Management also is responsible for the long-term stewardship of sites that had been transferred from DOE to the Army Corps of Engineers under the FUSRAP program in 1997. Once the Corps completes the cleanup of a site under this program, it is responsible for the initial two years of operation and maintenance, after which time the site is transferred back to DOE's Office of Legacy Management for long-term stewardship. The Office of Legacy Management also manages the payment of pensions and retirement benefits of former contractor personnel who worked at DOE facilities that do not have a continuing mission, among other supporting activities. The federal role in the management of these former contractor pensions and benefits stems from the long-term nature of the projects and the associated length of employment for the personnel who performed the work for DOE. These pensions and benefits are earned and accrued by contractor employees while in active employment at DOE facilities and are payable after their employment ends.", "The Office of Legacy Management is funded within DOE's Other Defense Activities account. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $173.9 million within this account for DOE's Office of Legacy Management in FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the President's FY2013 full request of $177.9 million. Each of these proposed amounts is an increase above the $169.6 million in appropriations enacted for FY2012. Accounting for an additional $12 million in prior year unobligated balances, DOE reports that the total budget authority for the office in FY2012 was $181.6 million. In its report on H.R. 5325 , the House Appropriations Committee noted that additional prior year unobligated balances should be available to meet funding need in FY2013, to offset the decrease of $4 million in new appropriations it recommended below the President's request.", "Funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management are likely to increase beyond current levels over time, as more facilities are cleaned up and transferred from the Office of Environmental Management and the FUSRAP program of the Corps for long-term stewardship. Over the next 10 years, DOE projects that the total number of facilities administered by the Office of Legacy Management will rise from 91 in FY2011 to 129 in FY2020. In FY2012 alone, the Office of Legacy Management assumed two new responsibilities: long-term stewardship of the Mound site in Miamisburg, OH, once the cleanup was complete under the Office of Environmental Management, and the management of records and former contractor pensions and benefits for the terminated Yucca Mountain project.", "Estimating the long-term funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management is inherently challenging because of the lengthy time horizons that are involved. For example, actions may be necessary for many decades to operate and maintain cleanup remedies and monitor contaminant levels to ensure the effectiveness of the remedies over time. At sites where the cleanup entails the permanent containment of radioactive wastes, long-term stewardship may continue indefinitely because of the time needed for radioactivity to decay to acceptable levels. Enforcement of land use restrictions or other institutional controls also may be necessary in perpetuity at facilities that are not cleaned up for unrestricted use, in order to prevent potentially harmful exposure. These and other factors make it difficult to reliably estimate the financial liability of the United States for long-term stewardship of sites contaminated from the historic production of nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear energy research in the 20 th century."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Power Marketing Administrations112", "paragraphs": ["DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs)\u2014Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA)\u2014were established to sell the power generated by the dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers.
