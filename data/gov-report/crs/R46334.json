Examples of MCMs include biologics (e.g., vaccines), drugs (e.g., antivirals), and devices (e.g., diagnostic tests and personal protective equipment, or PPE).", "The CARES Act includes several provisions to address such shortages, including expanding reporting requirements for firms that experience interruptions in drug and device manufacturing; explicitly requiring that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) contain PPE, ancillary medical supplies, and other applicable supplies; and extending liability protections for certain respiratory protective devices used during emergencies. The CARES Act also requires a study of U.S. dependence on critical drugs and medical devices imported from or manufactured in other countries.", "Vaccine access and cost. A vaccine(s) for the COVID-19 virus, if and when it becomes available, will be provided or required to be covered without cost-sharing to patients and beneficiaries of federal health programs and most private health insurance enrollees, pursuant to numerous provisions in Division A, Title III, of the CARES Act. The CARES Act does not explicitly address vaccine access for the uninsured. However, with available appropriations and preexisting authorities, the HHS Secretary could assist safety net providers (e.g., health centers), health departments, and other entities in furnishing vaccines to this population. ", "The medical workforce. The CARES Act makes a number of changes to health workforce programs. Some changes aim to extend the services available during the COVID-19 period and beyond, particularly for rural or otherwise underserved populations. For example, the CARES Act confers medical malpractice liability on health professionals who choose to volunteer during the emergency period and amends the program rules for the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program to permit individuals to volunteer during the emergency period. The CARES Act also reauthorizes a number of health workforce programs that had been considered for reauthorization during the 116 th Congress, but prior to the CARES Act no reauthorization of these programs was enacted. ", "Marketing of over-the-counter drugs. The CARES Act establishes a new process for the marketing of certain over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, including hand sanitizer and sunscreen. Specifically, Title III replaces the current OTC drug monograph rulemaking process with an administrative order process\u00e2\u0080\u0094a less burdensome alternative.

", "The report does not discuss cost estimates for specific provisions; however, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) provided a preliminary estimate of the budget effects of the CARES Act. Overall, the act is estimated to increase federal deficits by $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period. This estimate breaks down these budgetary effects into three categories: a $988 billion increase in mandatory outlays; a $446 billion decrease in revenues; and a $326 billion increase in discretionary outlays from supplemental appropriations. The estimates that CBO generated for health programs in Title III include programs in Subtitle E of Part IV of Title III, \"Health and Human Services Extenders,\" which are not discussed in this report. Among the provisions discussed in this report, JCT estimates that Section 3702, which expands the products that are eligible for tax-advantaged distributions from health savings accounts (HSAs), health flexible spending arrangements (FSAs), and other similar tax-advantaged savings arrangements, will reduce revenues by $9 billion over a ten-year period from 2020-2030. CBO also estimated the costs of a number of Medicare payment changes included in CARES Sections 3701-3715. These provisions generally increase the amount that Medicare will reimburse for services; as such, CBO estimates that they will increase Medicare spending from 2020-2030. CBO also noted that some provisions\u00e2\u0080\u0094e.g., the requirement for Medicare to cover the costs of vaccines for COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0094cannot be estimated because no such vaccine has been developed at this time.

Perhaps most salient has been the impact of COVID-19 on the availability of PPE, such as respirators for health care personnel, and other respiratory devices, such as ventilators for patients. Although the federal government and states generally have stockpiles of PPE and ventilators to distribute during public health emergencies, stockpiled quantities have been insufficient to meet current needs.

Recent reports have identified limitations in FDA's ability to oversee foreign drug manufacturing facilities and have indicated that FDA inspections of these facilities have decreased since 2016.

Medical device manufacturers are required to report this information to FDA at least six months prior to occurrence, or as soon as is practical.

In this guidance, the agency detailed four policies, whereby manufacturers or laboratories could develop, use, or market laboratory-developed tests or test kits for COVID-19. Two of these policies allowed for laboratories and test kit manufacturers to begin using or distributing their tests prior to receiving an EUA from the agency, as long as they submitted an EUA application within 15 business days of beginning clinical testing or distribution of the test kit and notified the agency that the test was in use. Therefore, tests and test kits would be in clinical use without having been granted an EUA (or 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization, or premarket approval). In addition, the agency outlined a policy allowing states to authorize laboratories within their state to carry out testing without FDA involvement; therefore, these tests would also be in clinical use without authorization from the FDA (or 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization, or premarket approval).

The Privacy Rule also recognizes that PHI may be useful or necessary in circumstances besides health care treatment and payment for a given individual or general health care operations, or entirely unrelated to health care or the health care system. For this reason, the rule lists a number of \"national priority purposes\" for which covered entities may disclose PHI without an individual's authorization or opportunity to agree or object.

The program enables eligible public or private entities, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, and Indian or tribal organizations to propose and administer innovative, community-based ways to decrease U.S. infant mortality rates (IMRs), improve perinatal and maternal health outcomes, and reduce ethnic and racial health disparities in perinatal health. ( I nfant mortality refers to the death of an infant before his or her first birthday. An infant mortality rate refers to the comparison of the number of infant deaths against 1,000 live births in a given year.) Healthy Start participants consist of women, men, infants, children, and involved parties such as family members. The program requires participants to reside in communities with IMRs that are at least 1.5 times greater than the U.S. IMR and/or have high rates of adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm births and maternal deaths. The program's authorization of appropriations, which expired in 2013, was \"the amount authorized for the preceding fiscal year increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers for such year.\"", "Provision", "Purpose and considerations in making grants.

The Secretary instead must require applicants to include state substance abuse agencies, participants, and former participants of project areas as participants in community-based consortiums.", "The Secretary, when considering grant awards, is required to consider factors that contribute to infant mortality, including poor birth outcomes (e.g., low birthweight and preterm birth) and social determinants of health.
