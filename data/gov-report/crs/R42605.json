Six categories comprise the human resources \"superfunction\": education, training, employment, and social services; health (largely Medicaid); Medicare; income security; Social Security; and veterans programs.", "President Obama submitted a detailed FY2013 budget proposal to Congress in February. The House subsequently passed an FY2013 budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 112), based on a proposal by Budget Committee Chairman Ryan. Several proposals have been offered by Members of the Senate, including a resolution by Budget Committee Chairman Conrad that is based on recommendations of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Simpson-Bowles Commission). Although the House and Senate have not agreed on a budget resolution, the FY2013 appropriations process is underway. The House has also passed a reconciliation bill (H.R. 5652) intended to replace an automatic budget reduction (i.e., \"sequestration\") scheduled to occur on January 2, 2013, under provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011.", "Spending for human resources peaked in FY2010 at 16.6% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), will have dropped to 15.5% in FY2012. This decline reflects the assumed economic recovery, lower spending for programs that respond automatically to economic conditions (e.g., Unemployment Insurance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), and expiration of funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. CBO projects that human resources spending will rise again as a share of GDP and reach 16.1% in FY2022, due to continuing effects of the baby boom's retirement and enrollment in Medicare and Social Security, real growth in Social Security benefits, medical cost inflation, and spending under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. (Note that CBO's baseline does not yet reflect any potential impact of the Supreme Court's June 28 decision on the ACA.)", "Reflecting these trends, all projected growth in human resources spending will occur in three categories: health (i.e., Medicaid), Medicare, and Social Security. CBO estimates that spending for income security (which includes Unemployment Insurance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and selected low-income, retirement, and disability programs) will contract as a share of GDP over the next decade, as will the two smallest human resources categories (i.e., education, training, employment, and social services; and veterans benefits and services).", "Both the Administration and Conrad/Fiscal Commission budgets assume human resources spending over the next 10 years at levels close to the CBO current law baseline, although the President requests increased spending in the initial years for economic stimulus. The House resolution assumes gradually decreasing spending for human resources as a share of GDP, but also assumes that spending would rise slightly at the end of the decade. As noted above, CBO projects human resources spending will equal 16.1% of GDP in FY2022 with no change in policy. This compares with 16.1% under the Administration proposal, 16% under the Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution, and 14% under the House resolution. The most significant reductions from the CBO baseline assumed by the House would occur in three categories: education, training, employment, and social services; Medicaid (which would be converted into a block grant); and income security.

", "Congress begins formal consideration of the annual budget resolution after the President submits his detailed budget request for the coming fiscal year. The congressional budget resolution is not signed by the President and does not become public law. Rather, it is an internal blueprint for Congress to use in its consideration of appropriations acts and other legislation for the coming fiscal year. The resolution establishes enforceable levels for projected spending (budget authority and outlays) and revenues, along with an estimate of the deficit (or surplus) and the national debt. The resolution includes amounts for the coming fiscal year and projections for subsequent years.", "Unlike the President's budget request submitted each February, the congressional budget resolution does not specify spending levels by program but instead establishes aggregate spending amounts for each of the functional categories referred to above. These aggregate amounts are based on certain \"assumptions\" about spending for specific programs. However, these assumptions are not typically specified in the resolution, nor are they binding on the appropriations committees or committees with jurisdiction over mandatory spending or tax provisions. Key assumptions are sometimes identified in the Budget Committee report that accompanies the concurrent resolution. ", "The congressional budget process includes tools for enforcing the annual budget resolution. Members of Congress may raise points of order to bar consideration of legislation that would violate the spending ceilings or revenue floors in the resolution, among other provisions. Congress also has used the \"reconciliation\" process to implement budget policy. For example, the House-passed budget resolution for FY2013 ( H.Con.Res. 112 ) contains reconciliation instructions to six authorizing committees to find a specific amount of deficit reduction over 10 years. The committee report accompanying the budget resolution identified \"illustrative\" policy options by which to achieve these savings, but the committees are free to report whatever changes they want within their jurisdictions in response to a reconciliation directive. In response to the reconciliation instructions in H.Con.Res. 112 , the six committees reported their recommendations to the House Budget Committee, which assembled them into a single reconciliation bill ( H.R. 5652 ) that was passed by the House on May 15, 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Budget Control Act and the CBO Baseline", "paragraphs": ["The BCA, enacted in August 2011, provided for increases in the debt limit and established procedures designed to reduce the federal budget deficit. Two components of the BCA are relevant to understanding the CBO \"current law\" baseline for human resources programs, as it is presented in this report. ", "First, Title I of the BCA established enforceable limits on discretionary spending for FY2012 through FY2021. For FY2012 and FY2013, the law provided separate amounts for discretionary spending in the \"security\" and \"nonsecurity\" categories. \"Security\" was defined broadly to include the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA), Homeland Security (DHS), and State, in addition to the Department of Defense and certain other activities; and \"nonsecurity\" was defined as everything else. For FY2014 and subsequent years, no distinction was made between security and nonsecurity; that is, Title I of the law established a single discretionary spending limit for each of those years. ", "Second, the BCA established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with developing legislation by November 23, 2011, to achieve $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the FY2013-FY2021 period. If Congress failed to pass such legislation by January 15, 2012, reducing the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion, a series of automatic spending reductions would be triggered, specified in Section 302 of the act. In fact, the Joint Committee did not meet its deadline and the necessary legislation was not enacted. Thus, under current law, the first automatic spending reductions are scheduled to take effect on January 2, 2013. ", "These automatic procedures include sequestration of mandatory spending for each of FY2013-FY2021, a one-year sequestration of discretionary spending for FY2013, and lower discretionary spending limits for FY2014-FY2021. In addition to being lowered, the original discretionary spending limits (discussed above) are redefined so that security now consists only of budget Function 050 (which is primarily the Department of Defense). Spending reductions are to be equally divided between security and nonsecurity, which means that half the reductions triggered by failure of the Joint Committee process will come primarily from the Department of Defense, and the other half will come from the remainder of the federal budget. It should be noted that a significant amount of nonsecurity spending is either exempt from the sequestration process or otherwise subject to a special rule that limits the size of the reduction. ", "In its overall current law baseline estimates and projections, CBO incorporated the discretionary spending limits imposed by Title I of the BCA (referred to in this report as the \"original BCA spending limits\") and the additional spending reductions triggered by failure of the Joint Committee process (referred to as the \"additional BCA spending reductions\"). However, with limited exceptions, insufficient information was available for CBO to estimate the impact of these BCA provisions at the budget function level. ", "Thus, CBO allocated all budgetary effects of the BCA\u2014other than those related to defense and Medicare\u2014to budget Function 920 (allowances), which is used, among other purposes, as a placeholder category for budgetary effects not yet assigned elsewhere. This means that CBO's baseline for the human resources superfunction, and for each of the individual functions within, does not reflect the original discretionary spending limits or the additional spending reductions of the BCA. The sole exception in the human resources area is Function 570 (Medicare), where CBO was able to estimate the amount likely to be sequestered under the BCA provisions, which limit sequestration of most Medicare spending to 2%.

Specifically, the figure shows that human resources spending accounted for 5.6% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in FY1962 and rose to a peak of 16.6% in FY2010. As a share of GDP, human resources spending dropped slightly in FY2011, to 16.1%.

On the other hand, cost-mitigating factors in the first part of the decade include the assumed economic recovery, lower spending for programs that respond automatically to economic conditions such as Unemployment Insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the expiration of all stimulus funding provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ).", "The figure illustrates that spending in the human resources superfunction has been dominated by four categories: health (Function 550, which primarily consists of Medicaid), Medicare (Function 570), income security (Function 600), and Social Security (Function 650).

In contrast, CBO projects that income security programs under Function 600 will shrink from 23% of human resources spending in FY2012 to 14% in FY2022. And, the two smallest functions also will each contract as a share of the superfunction, from 4% in FY2012 to 3% in FY2022 for Function 500 and from 5% in FY2012 to 4% in FY2022 for veterans programs under Function 700.

A review of low-income assistance programs shows the same general trend applicable to the human resources superfunction overall; that is, health care is growing as a share of the economy while spending for other purposes (other than Social Security) contracts. A CRS analysis of federal outlays for major federal low-income assistance programs shows all projected growth in these programs over the next decade will be for health programs, specifically Medicaid, CHIP, and the refundable portion of a health insurance tax credit created under the ACA of 2010, which is scheduled to begin in 2014.
