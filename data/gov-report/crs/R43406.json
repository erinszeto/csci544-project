Until 1989, the Rocky Flats Plant (CO) mass-produced pits. Since then, the United States has made at most 11 pits per year (ppy). U.S. policy is to maintain existing nuclear weapons. To do this, the Department of Defense states that it needs the Department of Energy (DOE), which maintains U.S. nuclear weapons, to produce 50-80 ppy by 2030. While some argue that few if any new pits are needed, at least for decades, this report focuses on options to reach 80 ppy.", "Pit production involves precisely forming plutonium\u2014a hazardous, radioactive, physically quirky metal. Production requires supporting tasks, such as analytical chemistry (AC), which monitors the chemical composition of plutonium in each pit.", "With Rocky Flats closed, DOE established a small-scale pit manufacturing capability at PF-4, a building at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). DOE also proposed higher-capacity facilities; none came to fruition. In 2005, Congress rejected the Modern Pit Facility, viewing as excessive the capacity range DOE studied, 125-450 ppy. In 2012, the Administration \"deferred\" construction of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility (CMRR-NF) on grounds of availability of interim alternatives and affordability.", "Nonetheless, options remain:", "Build CMRR-NF. Congress mandated it in the FY2013 cycle, but provided no funds for it then, and permitted consideration of an alternative in the FY2014 cycle. Remove from PF-4 tasks not requiring high MAR and security. Casting pits uses much plutonium that an accident might release (\"Material At Risk,\" MAR) and requires high security. Making 80 ppy would require freeing more MAR and floor space in PF-4 for casting. Provide regulatory relief so RLUOB could hold 1,000 grams of plutonium with few changes to the building. AC for 80 ppy needs much floor space but not high MAR or high security. Several options involve LANL's Radiological Laboratory/Utility/Office Building (RLUOB). Regulations permit it to hold 26 grams of weapons-grade plutonium, the volume of two nickels; AC for 80 ppy would require 500 to 1,000 grams and perhaps space elsewhere. Augmenting RLUOB to hold the latter amounts within regulations would be costly even though the radiation dose if the building collapsed would be very low. Regulatory relief would save time and money, but would raise concerns about compliance with regulations. A complementary option is to perform some AC at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory or Savannah River Site. Move plutonium-238 work to Idaho National Laboratory or Savannah River Site. Fabricating plutonium-238 into power sources for space probes entails high MAR, but not high security because it is not used in pits. Moving it would free MAR and floor space in PF-4. At issue is whether to conduct all plutonium work at LANL, the plutonium \"center of excellence.\" Build concrete \"modules\" connected to PF-4. This would enable high-MAR work to move out of PF-4, so PF-4 and modules could do the needed pit work. At issue: are modules needed, at what cost, and when.", "Several options have the potential to produce 80 ppy and permit other plutonium activities at relatively modest cost, in a relatively short time, with no new buildings, and with minimal environmental impact. Determining their desirability and feasibility would require detailed study.", "Observations include:", "Differing time horizons between Congress and DOE, and between political and technical imperatives, cause problems. Doing nothing entails costs and risks. Keeping a 1950s-era building open while options are explored exposes workers to a relatively high risk of death in an earthquake. Congress may wish to consider limiting a building's permitted plutonium quantity by estimated dose instead of MAR. A facility can be safe even if it is not compliant with regulations. The political system is more flexible than the regulatory system. Regulations derive their authority from statutes. Regulators, bound by these statutes, cannot make cost-benefit tradeoffs regarding compliance. In contrast, the political system has the authority, ability, and culture to decide which tradeoffs are worth making."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Of all the problems facing the nuclear weapons program and nuclear weapons complex over the past several decades, few, if any, have been as vexing as pit production. A \"pit\" is a hollow plutonium shell that is imploded, creating an explosion that triggers the rest of the weapon. The Rocky Flats Plant (CO) manufactured pits on a large scale during the Cold War until production halted in 1989. It took until FY2007 for the United States to produce even a small quantity, 11 pits per year (ppy), for the stockpile. Yet the Department of Defense (DOD) calls for a capacity to produce 30 ppy by 2021 as an interim goal and 50 to 80 ppy by around 2030. At issue is how to reach the higher capacity.", "This report is intended primarily for Members and staff with a direct interest in pit issues, including Members who will be making decisions on pit projects that could total several billion dollars. Since the issues are complicated, this report contains technical and regulatory details that are needed to understand the advantages, drawbacks, and uncertainties of various options. It may also be of value for Members and staff with an interest in nuclear weapons, stockpile stewardship, and nuclear policy more broadly. This report begins with a description of plutonium, pits, and pit factory problems. It next considers several pit production options. It notes studies that could provide information to assist Congress in choosing among options, and concludes with several observations. There are several Appendixes, including a list of abbreviations.", "The pit issue is important because of the relationship between pit production infrastructure and national goals, as shown in Figure 1 . National goals include minimizing the risk of nuclear war and, for the longer term, \"the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons,\" as President Obama declared in his 2009 Prague speech. The Nuclear Posture Review sets out policy objectives, such as \"preventing nuclear proliferation,\" \"reducing the role of U.S. nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy,\" \"maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at reduced nuclear force levels,\" \"strengthening regional deterrence,\" and \"sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal.\" Various strategies, such as deterrence, counterproliferation, and arms control, seek to implement policy. In turn, delivery systems, such as heavy bombers and long-range ballistic missiles, are one means of implementing strategy. Nuclear weapons (a term used in this report to refer to nuclear bombs and warheads) arm delivery systems. The Nuclear Posture Review declares, \"The United States will not develop new nuclear warheads.\" Accordingly, the United States will retain the weapons in its arsenal for the foreseeable future. Yet weapons deteriorate over time. Extending the service life of existing weapons requires replacing or modifying some components. While \"life extension programs\" (LEPs) for some weapons can use existing pits, DOD and the Department of Energy (DOE) state that LEPs for other weapons will require newly manufactured pits. The current infrastructure cannot produce pits at the capacity DOD requires, and many efforts stretching back to the late 1980s to produce pits have been canceled or have otherwise foundered. A concern is that if a type of nuclear weapon could no longer perform satisfactorily, an inability to make new pits in the quantities required so the weapons could be replaced could lead to that weapon type being removed from service. That, in turn, would leave missiles and bombers without those weapons, which would undermine strategies, the policies they seek to implement, and the ability to attain national goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["This section begins by discussing plutonium, pits, pit production, programs to extend the service life of nuclear weapons, and production capacity required.

It has several undesirable characteristics, and is difficult to work with. According to Siegfried Hecker, a plutonium metallurgist and a former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), ", "Plutonium is an element at odds with itself\u2014with little provocation, it can change its density by as much as 25 percent; it can be as brittle as glass or as malleable as aluminum; it expands when it solidifies; and its freshly-machined silvery surface will tarnish in minutes, producing nearly every color in the rainbow. To make matters even more complex, plutonium ages from the outside in and from the inside out. It reacts vigorously with its environment\u2014particularly with oxygen, hydrogen, and water\u2014thereby, degrading its properties from the surface to the interior over time. In addition, plutonium's continuous radioactive decay causes self-irradiation damage that can fundamentally change its properties over time.", "To make plutonium more stable, it is typically alloyed with other materials, such as gallium.", "Handling and safeguarding plutonium poses significant risks. Plutonium is hazardous: if minute particles are inhaled and lodge in the lungs, their radiation (in the form of alpha particles) can cause lung cancer. In addition, terrorists might be able to build an improvised nuclear device if they were to obtain enough plutonium, so facilities holding more than a small quantity of certain plutonium isotopes require extremely high security.", "Plutonium does not occur in nature except in trace amounts. It is manufactured by exposing uranium fuel rods to neutrons in nuclear reactors, and then using chemical processes to separate it from other elements in the fuel rods. The result is a mix of plutonium isotopes. The isotope desired for nuclear weapons is plutonium-239, which fissions readily when struck by slow or fast neutrons. Weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) consists mainly of plutonium-239 and a small fraction of other plutonium isotopes. (Note: When an isotope of plutonium is mentioned, such as plutonium-239, it is abbreviated using its chemical symbol, e.g., Pu-239.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pits", "paragraphs": ["A pit is the trigger for detonating a thermonuclear weapon, or hydrogen bomb. It is a hollow shell of plutonium and other materials surrounded by chemical explosives. When the explosives detonate, they create an inward-moving pressure wave (an implosion wave) that compresses the plutonium enough to make it supercritical. It undergoes a runaway fission chain reaction, that is, an explosion. Various means are used to augment the explosion. This part of the weapon is called the primary stage. The weapon is designed so that energy from the primary stage explosion implodes the weapon's secondary stage, in which nuclear fission and fusion release most of the weapon's total explosive force.", "While some pits in older weapons were made of uranium and plutonium (\"composite pits\"), modern pits use only plutonium because much less of that material is required to generate a given explosive force, permitting nuclear weapons to be smaller and lighter. Reducing the size and weight of weapons was important during the Cold War to maximize the number of weapons that could be fitted on a missile and to maximize the explosive force of a weapon of given weight. All nuclear weapons in the current U.S. nuclear stockpile were designed and tested during the Cold War; all but a handful were built during that time.", "Because plutonium decays radioactively, there was concern that pits could deteriorate in ways that would cause them to fail. However, several studies have projected increased pit life. In 2003, pit life was thought to be 45-60 years; a 2007 study placed life for most pits at over 100 years; and a 2012 Livermore study placed the figure at 150 years. A 2013 Los Alamos study raised uncertainties on the latter claim:", "Since 2006, plutonium aging work has continued at a low level. That research does not indicate any [e]ffects that would preclude the possibility of pit reuse. However, additional studies that had been planned were never undertaken, leaving some aging questions unanswered for the range of plutonium alloys in the stockpile, and for the potential applications of pit reuse now under consideration.", "Penrose Albright, then Director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, testified in 2013,", "And there has been a pretty concerted effort at both Los Alamos and at Livermore over the last decade or more that has been looking at plutonium aging, and we actually have samples that we keep in our laboratory\u2014and Los Alamos does the same\u2014that are 40, 50, 60 years old that so far show no\u2014that support the conclusions that the last decade of study has implied, which is that these pits are good for many, many more decades to come.", "Longer pit life means that a stockpile of given size can be maintained with a lower pit production rate and opens the possibility of reusing retired pits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Pit Production Process", "paragraphs": ["Pits must be made to exacting standards in order to function as designed. This requires precision in fabricating them and in supporting tasks.", "As plutonium decays, it produces other elements, such as americium. That radioactive element increases the radiation dose to workers and is an impurity to weapons-grade plutonium. Plutonium scrap, such as from old pits or from faulty castings, may pick up other impurities. Accordingly, plutonium must be purified for use in new pits. This may involve nitric acid processing, high-temperature processing, electrorefining, and other processes. Such processes result in a substantial stream of waste contaminated with radioactive material, acid, and other harmful substances. This waste must be processed and disposed of; waste processing requires a substantial infrastructure.", "Pits are fabricated as \"hemishells\" (half-pits) that are welded together. Rocky Flats Plant made pits using a wrought process, in which sheets of plutonium were run through rollers to attain the desired thickness, then punched into a die. LANL, where pits are currently made, uses a cast process, in which plutonium is melted in crucibles in a foundry, poured into a mold, and finished. The plutonium is analyzed chemically, and each hemishell is inspected through such techniques as physical measurements and x-ray imaging to ensure that there are no flaws. Given the many steps required, it typically takes three months to make a pit.", "Various tasks support production. Materials characterization (MC) examines bulk properties of plutonium samples, such as tensile strength, magnetic susceptibility, and surface characteristics. Such properties must be determined to be correct to assure that a pit will, for example, implode symmetrically. MC is generally used to qualify manufacturing processes and to troubleshoot production problems. As such, it does not generate a large number of samples during production, and that number is largely independent of the number of pits to be produced. Of relevance to options considered below, MC does not require a large amount of laboratory floor space.", "In contrast, analytical chemistry (AC) is performed across the entire manufacturing process, from metal purification through waste processing. Samples are analyzed for isotopic composition of plutonium and for the type and amount of various impurities. AC is performed on an average of 22 samples per pit. Metal samples taken directly from hemishells are typically 5 grams each. In preparing for AC, these samples are cut into smaller pieces. Most of the smaller pieces are dissolved in acid because most AC instruments do not use samples in solid form. The resulting plutonium-acid mixture is split into still smaller samples, many of which contain milligram or microgram quantities of plutonium. Each sample must be prepared in a specific way, and analyzed using specific equipment, depending on the type of analysis that it is to undergo. In addition, before plutonium ingots are used for a hemishell, their purity must be assayed. This involves taking a sample from a piece of the purified product as well as plutonium standard and reference materials for comparison. In order to provide one assay result for the plutonium, the assay process is typically run 10 times.", "Pit fabrication generates waste, such as the plutonium-acid samples used in AC, the MC samples, and any shavings or trimmings from finishing hemishells. Accordingly, pit production requires a way to handle the waste. It is treated two ways at Los Alamos; in some cases by extracting plutonium, and in other cases by solidifying it for burial at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) (NM)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Life Extension Programs", "paragraphs": ["While pits may last for many decades, other weapon components do not. Weapons contain organic components like explosives and adhesives that deteriorate under the influence of heat and radiation given off by plutonium; they may change characteristics over time. Some components, such as electronics, become hard to support after several decades, would be even harder to support several decades from now, and would be difficult to make compatible with new delivery systems like aircraft. Beyond that, some in the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and DOD want to increase the surety (safety, security, use control, and use denial) of weapons. (NNSA is the semiautonomous DOE agency responsible for nuclear weapons maintenance, several nuclear nonproliferation programs, and all naval nuclear propulsion work.) Accordingly, the Nuclear Weapons Council, a joint DOD-NNSA body that oversees and coordinates nuclear weapon programs, plans a life extension program (LEP) for each weapon type, including some LEPs that may combine two or more weapon types. LEPs range in scope from replacing a few components to a major overhaul that includes new pits, new electronics, and new surety features. Some dispute the need for LEPs that do more than the minimum needed to keep a weapon in service. They argue, for example, that features to further enhance surety are unnecessary given the perfect safety record of U.S. nuclear weapons and that these features add greatly to cost and may impair weapon performance. Nonetheless, LEPs are underway for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile and the B61 bomb, and both Congress and the Administration support them. Additional LEPs are being planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pit Production Capacity: How Much Is Needed?", "paragraphs": ["Some LEPs can use the original pit and replace other components, while other LEPs might reuse pits from retired weapons if that proves feasible, and still other LEPs are expected to require fabrication of new pits.

The full range of LEP approaches will be considered: refurbishment of existing warheads, reuse of nuclear components from different warheads, and replacement of nuclear components.", "In any decision to proceed to engineering development for warhead LEPs, the United States will give strong preference to options for refurbishment or reuse. Replacement of nuclear components would be undertaken only if critical Stockpile Management Program goals could not otherwise be met, and if specifically authorized by the President and approved by Congress.", "The need for new \"nuclear components,\" pits in this case, drives pit capacity requirements. However, the pit production capacity considered has varied greatly, from 10 to 450 pits per year. The Nuclear Weapons Council has decided that, to meet the likely demands of future LEPs, a production capacity of 50 to 80 ppy is needed. Andrew Weber, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs, testified in April 2013 that \"there is no daylight between the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense on the need for both a near-term pit production capacity of 10 to 20 and then 30 by 2021, and then in the longer term for a pit production capacity of 50 to 80 per year.\"", "While this range of pit production drives the planning for the U.S. plutonium strategy, it is not a precise range based on a careful analysis of military requirements. When asked to explain the basis for this range, Linton Brooks, former Administrator of NNSA, and John Harvey, then Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs, responded: ", "MR. HARVEY: We established that requirement back in 2008 for a capability to produce in the range of 50 to 80 per year. That evolved from a decision to basically not take the path that we originally were taking with the Modern Pit Facility, but to go and be able to exploit the existing infrastructure at Los Alamos to meet our pit operational requirements. The capability at Los Alamos was assessed to be somewhere in the range of 50 to 80 per year that they could get with the modernization program they anticipated. The Nuclear Weapons Council looked at that number. It's a capacity-based number, and said it's probably good enough. We'll have to accept some risk, but it's probably good enough.", "MR. BROOKS: So you can't tie it to a specific \u2013 you can't tie it to a specific deployment schedule or something. It's a judgment that is a combined judgment on yeah, you can probably do this, and yeah in the most reasonable world this will be enough.", "MR. MEDALIA: But there's a big difference in the facilities, between 50 and 80. Is it 80 or is it 50 to 80?", "MR. HARVEY: We understood that the capability to deliver, based on the anticipated modernization at Los Alamos which would include the CMRR or equivalent, coupled with the PF-4 production, appropriately reconfigured, could deliver in that range. So it was a range. I mean, it's always been cited as single shift range. By going to double shifts you could probably get the higher end of that range.", "MR. BROOKS: But no person now living can tell you for sure the answer to that question. I mean, you know, beware of spurious precision. \u2026 Fifty to 80 is probably as precise as the facts will allow people to be, although people will say other things.", "NNSA was also imprecise as to required production capacity. It stated in a 2013 report, \"Preliminary plans call for pit production of potentially up to 80 pits per year starting as early as FY 2030. NNSA continues to develop options to achieve a higher production rate as part of the plutonium strategy.\" John Harvey subsequently added, \"The level of 50-80 ppy was consistent with existing PF-4 production capacity plus the analytical chemistry capacity anticipated for the planned CMRR-NF. However, NNSA officials in 2006 believed that a capacity in the range of 125 ppy was needed to respond to anticipated requirements and provide some resilience to surprise. Thus the 50-80 ppy level, while the best that could be done, accepted significant risk in their view.\"", "It may be possible to reduce the capacity required below 80 ppy and still meet DOD's requirements. This might be done in several ways:", "One option under serious study is reusing retired pits in LEPs. Whether this could be done for a particular LEP depends on details of the LEP, whether there are suitable pits available, and whether such pits are available in the quantity required; decisions would have to be made on a case-by-case basis. In some LEPs, it may be possible to simply reinstall a weapon's original pit. Neither that method nor reuse of retired pits from other weapons require AC or foundry work. By producing new pits while another LEP is underway with retired or original pits, LANL could use its otherwise-unused capacity to produce pits ahead of schedule for a LEP requiring new pits. Stockpiling new pits would enable lower rates of production and of AC to produce the aggregate number of pits needed by the time they are needed, even if the maximum production rate attainable is less than 80 ppy. In addition, keeping the pit production and support line in continuous operation would be useful if not essential for maintaining processes, equipment, and worker skills, and for training new workers. On the other hand, LEPs require considerable planning and design work, and designs for new pits would have to be certified. In the near term, it might not be possible to do this work far enough in advance to permit continuous production. Since the figure of 80 ppy was based on LANL's presumed pit production capacity using PF-4 and CMRR-NF (an existing building and one that has been deferred for at least five years), not on a strategic analysis of military needs, and since the range cited is 50 to 80 ppy, a capacity of less than 80 ppy might suffice.", "The Union of Concerned Scientists stated regarding required pit production capacity:", "If pits last 150 years or more, there is no need to replace aging pits for the foreseeable future, and no rationale for expanding production capacity beyond the existing 10 to 20 annually for this purpose. Even if the NNSA finds that pits will last only 100 years and that all need to be replaced by 2089, production capacity of 50 per year would be adequate.", "The NNSA could replace all existing pits by 2089 if it started doing so in 2019, based on the agency's conservative assumption that the U.S. stockpile will remain at 3,500 warheads. However, the United States is likely to reduce its arsenal in coming decades. In that case, the NNSA could either wait longer to begin producing replacement pits \u2026 or reduce the annual rate of production. \u2026", "Thus, even under the most conservative assumptions about pit lifetime and arsenal size, there is no need to expand pit production capacity beyond 50 per year to replace aging pits. Because both pit lifetime and the future size of the arsenal are uncertain, it makes no sense to expand production capacity until it is needed.", "In contrast, John Harvey argues that there is risk in not providing margin to accommodate unknowns:", "Required pit production capacity cannot be based solely on known LEP requirements. We must consider the possibly of surprise: either technical problems in the stockpile that arise unexpectedly or geopolitical reversals. For example, we cannot anticipate at this point a need to increase stockpile size based on renewed threats, but we should not rule out that possibility in setting our pit production needs. Some reserve production capacity is required above and beyond known LEP needs to ensure we have some ability to respond to surprise.", "This is entirely consistent with the President's NPR [Nuclear Posture Review] vision for a responsive nuclear infrastructure. The longer we wait on achieving needed capacity, the greater the risk we are accepting in not having responsive capabilities.", "It could be argued that an ability to meet the higher requirement\u2014the most challenging case\u2014would enable the United States to meet lower requirements and would put this nation in a better position to meet higher requirements should that be deemed necessary. Further, if 80 ppy proves unattainable, an effort to reach that goal might increase the likelihood that this nation could reach 50 ppy, the lower end of the range.", "On the other hand, it could be argued that it is not desirable to have a goal of 80 ppy if that is excess to needs. According to Greg Mello, Executive Director of Los Alamos Study Group,", "It is not clear that efforts to reach a larger pit production capacity will enable lesser pit production capacities. History shows that efforts to acquire pit production capacity above that which is clearly needed, have failed. Facilities to support a larger-than-needed pit production capacity cost more for construction and operation than smaller facilities, and are more likely to encounter political objections. So trying for 80 pits per year may decrease the probability of successfully acquiring 50 pits per year, and trying for 50 pits per year may decrease the probability of achieving 30 pits per year. It may be far better to acquire the minimum necessary pit production capacity, and include a contingency plan that can be activated should conditions warrant.", "Because of concern over required pit production capacity, Section 3147 of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 112-239 , directed the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, to \"assess the annual plutonium pit production requirement needed to sustain a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapon arsenal.\" The accompanying Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference states that the assessment shall include \"an assessment of cost and national security implications for various smaller and larger pit production rates from the current 50-80 pit requirement. The conferees note that rates including 10 to 20 pits per year, 20 to 30 pits per year, 30 to 50 pits per year, 50 to 80 pits per year, and larger should be included as part of the analysis.\" Note that reducing required capacity would reduce facility requirements and might permit delaying facility construction.", "The purpose of this report, however, is not to address contending arguments on the capacity needed, but to discuss options for acquiring the maximum capacity DOD states that it needs, 80 ppy, by 2030. Even if in 16 years it turns out that a lower capacity would suffice, it is difficult at best to know that so far in advance.", "The difference between 50 and 80 ppy has consequences. As discussed above, the Nuclear Weapons Council reasoned that a capacity to build 50 ppy in single-shift operations could be scaled up to produce 80 ppy in double-shift operations, that is, double-shift operations can produce 1.6 times as many pits as single-shift operations. But if the actual need is 50 ppy, then by using the same ratio, a capacity to build approximately 30 ppy in single-shift operations could be scaled up to 50 ppy by using two shifts. Deploying and operating a smaller capacity would be less costly and easier to implement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plutonium-238", "paragraphs": ["Pu-238 is an isotope of plutonium.

Some are much more radioactive than Pu-239, and there are many other radioactive substances. It is convenient to convert all radioactive materials to a single standard for purposes of assessing the radiological hazard from a building in the event of an accident. That standard is \"plutonium-239 equivalent,\" abbreviated as Pu-239E in this report. Because WGPu is more radioactive than pure Pu-239, 1 gram (g) of WGPu has the radioactivity of 1.49 g of Pu-239. Similarly, Pu-238 is very much more radioactive than Pu-239; 1 g of Pu-238 has the radioactivity of 275 g of Pu-239.", "Hazard Categories (HCs) and Radiological Facilities : Nuclear facilities are categorized in several ways. One is by the hazard they could pose in the event of a major accident. HCs are based on \"the consequences of unmitigated releases of hazardous radioactive and chemical material.\" 10 CFR 830, \"Nuclear Safety Management,\" Appendix A, \"General Statement of Safety Basis Policy,\" divides these consequences into three categories; Table 1 also includes a related category.", "Hazard Categories are determined by the amount of Pu-239E a building is designed to hold; each category has the potential for certain consequences in the event of a major accident. 10 CFR 830, Appendix A, states that \"the hazard categorization must be based on an inventory of all radioactive materials within a nuclear facility.\" The HC structure builds in a conservative feature: \"The final categorization is based on an 'unmitigated release' of available hazardous material. For the purposes of hazard categorization, 'unmitigated' is meant to consider material quantity, form, location, dispersibility and interaction with available energy sources, but not to consider safety features (e.g., ventilation system, fire suppression, etc.) which will prevent or mitigate a release.\" Hazard Categories apply to the design and construction of a building, not to its operation. For example, a building intended to hold 5,000 g of Pu-239E must be designed to HC-2 standards, while a building intended to hold 1,000 g of Pu-239E must be designed to HC-3 standards, which are less stringent.

It is not part of the HC system because the amount of material is so small as to pose little threat; a hospital, for example, might be a Radiological Facility. The Radiological Laboratory/Utility/ Office Building (RLUOB) figures in several options below and is discussed in \" Existing Buildings at Los Alamos for Plutonium Work .\" As a Radiological Facility, HC standards limit it to 38.6 g of Pu-239E, or 26 g of WGPu, far less than enough to perform the AC needed to support production of 80 ppy.", "Design Basis Earthquake (DBE): The DBE is used to set standards for the resilience to earthquakes that buildings in various HCs must have. LANL provided the following information: ", "The design basis earthquake is defined as the ground motion that has an annual frequency of 4 x 10 -4 or [once in] 2,500 years. This is the ground motion that structures, systems, and components (SSCs) are designed for using national consensus codes and standards. This approach would lead to a failure probability of the SSCs for loads associated with the design basis ground motion of 1-2%. Using this approach it is also expected that at ground motion associated with an annual frequency of 1 x 10 -4 , or [once in] 10,000 years, the failure probability of the SSCs would be about 50%.", "Design Basis Accident (DBA): This is the accident scenario against which a nuclear facility must be designed and evaluated. Each HC building is required to be built to survive a DBA, the worst-case accident that could plausibly affect the building. Because each building will face different threats, the DBA is necessarily building-specific. For one building, the DBA might be a flood; for another, an explosion of a nearby gas main; for a third, a tornado; and for a fourth, an earthquake. For the plutonium buildings at Los Alamos, described next, the main threat is an earthquake, so the DBA involves (1) an earthquake more powerful than the DBE that (2) collapses a building and (3) starts a fire that involves all material at risk in the facility and (4) releases a certain fraction of the plutonium into the air as plutonium oxide particles. The fraction, in turn, is based on (1) the Airborne Release Fraction (ARF), the fraction of the MAR that the postulated fire could release into the air; (2) the Leak Path Factor (LPF), the fraction of ARF that actually escapes from the building into the air; some of it would be trapped, such as by the collapse of the building; and (3) the Respirable Fraction (RF), the fraction of the plutonium oxide particles released into the atmosphere that are of a size (3 microns or less) that could readily be inhaled and lodge in the lungs, where they would cause biological damage and, quite possibly, lung cancers; larger particles would fall to the ground or would be trapped in the nose. Other variables enter as well; Appendix B discusses them in detail.", "The frequency of the DBA is much less than the frequency of the DBE because several steps must occur for the DBE to result in the DBA. NNSA commented on this difference:", "There is also margin in the assumed accident frequencies (e.g., once in 5,000 years); these were based on the structural failure probabilities and did not consider other conditional probabilities, such as the conditional probability of a large fire starting and growing within the facility and progressively effecting and engaging all of the assumed material at risk; this refinement would reduce the frequency of the event from once in thousands of years to once in hundreds of thousands of years.", "The difference between DBE and DBA is crucial because the path from the one to the other can be interrupted at many places and in many ways in order to reduce the probability of the DBA, as discussed in \" Increasing Safety ,\" below.", "Radiological Facilities like RLUOB do not have a DBA and do not have to be designed to survive a DBA because they have so little radioactive material, though, as discussed in Appendix E , RLUOB was built (but not certified) to HC-3 standards. If RLUOB were to be converted to an HC-3 building, it would need a DBA and might need structural and other upgrades to be able to survive it. Appendix D describes some of the tasks needed to convert RLUOB to HC-3.", "Material At Risk (MAR): DOE defines this term as \"the amount of radioactive materials (in grams or curies of activity for each radionuclide) available to be acted on by a given physical stress.\" For purposes of this report, it is a measure of the amount of plutonium that might be dispersed in a DBA. Molten plutonium or plutonium shavings in a crucible that topples over in an earthquake, spilling plutonium onto the floor, would be MAR because a fire would create plutonium oxide particles, while plutonium in specially designed containers that are fire-resistant and rugged enough to survive a building collapse would not face this risk and thus would not be counted as MAR.", "Maximally-exposed Offsite Individual (MOI) and other exposure standards: An MOI is a hypothetical person located at the spot\u2014outside the site boundary but nearest to a specific building\u2014where a member of the public could reasonably be, such as a dwelling or a public road. The guideline set by DOE is that the MOI should receive a dose of no more than 25 rem for an exposure of 2 hours (or up to 8 hours in certain situations). \"The value of 25 rem TEDE [total effective dose equivalent] is not considered an acceptable public exposure either. It is, however, generally accepted as a value indicative of no significant health effects (i.e., low risk of latent health effects and virtually no risk of prompt health effects).\" To avoid \"challenging\" the 25-rem dose, another DOE document sets the dose at 5 rem, and sets a guideline of 100 rem TEDE for nearby (\"collocated\") workers.", "Documented Safety Analysis (DSA): Once an HC-2 or HC-3 building is built, a DSA must be prepared for it. A DSA is an agreement on how much MAR it can contain in order to stay within the dose limits for a collocated worker (for an HC-3 building) or an MOI (for an HC-2 building). The DSA MAR limit is typically less than the upper bound for an HC-3 building; for an HC-2 building, the DSA MAR limit is a specific figure because HC-2 sets no upper bound. For two HC-2 buildings at LANL, CMR and PF-4, discussed below, the agreement is between NNSA and Los Alamos National Security, LLC, the site contractor. The MAR permitted is building-specific based on hazard analysis, including accident scenarios, and on multiple measures designed to contain radioactive material in an accident. For CMR, the MAR permitted by the DSA is 9 kg of Pu-239E; for the main floor of PF-4, the comparable figure is 2,600 kg. A DOE document provides detailed standards for preparing a DSA. No DSA is required for a Radiological Facility because MAR is so small that such facilities fall outside the Hazard Category system.", "Security Category (SC): DOE places uranium and plutonium into SCs depending on their attractiveness level, such as to terrorists. SC I and II pertain to facilities with Special Nuclear Materials (SNM, mainly uranium highly enriched in the isotope 235 and plutonium) in quantities or forms that would pose a severe threat if seized by terrorists. The highest level, SC-I, includes assembled weapons and 2 kg or more of plutonium ingots. SC I and II require armed guards, a special security fence, and similar measures. SC-IV requires much less security. It includes less than 200 g of metallic plutonium and less than 3 kg of solutions of less than 25 g of plutonium per liter.

As Los Alamos is on several seismic faults, earthquakes pose the greatest threat to CMR. It is not seismically robust. Its design, in the late 1940s, gave little consideration to seismic loads. Further, when it was constructed, there was a steel shortage due to a steel strike and the Korean War. To save on steel, each concrete beam in CMR is reinforced with only two steel reinforcing rods, which are of different diameters, while the concrete floor between the beams is 2 to 4 inches thick, reinforced with chicken wire. A Los Alamos seismic expert calculates that, for CMR, \"the annual probability of failure [i.e., building collapse, is] somewhere between 1 in 370 years and 1 in 333 years.\" This means that for ground motion that might be associated with an earthquake that may occur approximately every 250 years, there is a 50% probability of collapse.

RLUOB (pronounced \"rulob\") was intended to conduct unclassified R&D on plutonium and some AC in support of pit production; the latter amount was to be very small because CMRR-NF was intended for that purpose. Nonetheless, the design of RLUOB is suitable for AC because it uses open hoods instead of gloveboxes as in PF-4; hoods are more efficient for most AC because it is much easier to work with small samples in them, but they require a powerful ventilation system, which RLUOB has, as shown in Figure 6 .

Given the state of flux of the plutonium program, NNSA has not prepared an EIS on it since then, though in 2011 it prepared a Supplemental EIS narrowly focused on the CMRR-NF component of the CMRR project. ", "However, Greg Mello, Executive Director of Los Alamos Study Group, a nongovernmental organization, argues that \"an EIS must precede NNSA's choice between post-CMRR-NF plutonium sustainment alternatives.\" He prepared the following analysis in August 2013 for this report. Since the study group has filed four NEPA lawsuits against Los Alamos construction projects over the past two decades, this analysis merits particular attention.", "The main elements of the NEPA landscape are (1) a statute that elevates environmental values to a major purpose of governance, establishes a procedural approach to integrating those values in decisions, and creates a Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to oversee this process; (2) CEQ regulations that are binding on agencies; (3) agency regulations, harmonious with CEQ's but tailored to each agency; (4) CEQ guidance that lacks the force of law but is frequently cited by courts; and (5) a body of case law, based on thousands of cases, that creates a sort of NEPA \"common law\"\u2014some universally binding, some binding in some federal districts, and some influential for such reasons as lucidity. Early NEPA case law established some basic parameters of implementation, such as that citizens could sue agencies to enforce NEPA compliance. Over time, a body of NEPA law has developed that is relatively settled for most basic legal issues but contested in other areas, especially where decisions depend on particular facts. ", "DOE requires an EIS and a Record of Decision (ROD) as early steps for all major projects that may have significant impacts. In the case of CMRR-NF, a careful EIS that really compared alternatives realistically would have noticed the earthquake-amplifying stratum of volcanic ash beneath the site and incorporated the latest seismic information, problems that later bedeviled the project. The underlying weaknesses in purpose and need could have been vetted as well, and hundreds of millions of dollars in design costs and many years of delay in acquiring safer plutonium capabilities could have been avoided. Sound EISs and formal RODs would strengthen DOE's project management.", "I believe that an EIS must precede NNSA's choice between post-CMRR-NF plutonium sustainment alternatives. An EIS requires objective environmental analysis of all reasonable alternatives prior to actions that irreversibly commit federal resources or bias the agency toward an alternative, with an initial business-case analysis used to establish which alternatives are reasonable. Because NNSA has proposed alternatives to CMRR-NF that are major federal actions that could have significant effects on the human environment, and since NNSA has no EIS that analyzes the impact of these alternatives, NNSA must initiate an EIS to do so. Some proposed CMRR-NF alternatives encompass multiple states and sites and may cost billions of dollars. All alternatives will have significant environmental impacts over much of this century. ", "The relative environmental benignity of upgrading RLUOB to an HC-3 facility might tilt the scales toward that choice but is not a reason not to do an EIS. Upgrading RLUOB may not be the whole of the post-CMRR-NF redirection in plutonium programs. Other nuclear weapons complex sites are under consideration for involvement, including [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Nevada National Security Site, Waste Isolation Pilot Plant], and perhaps [Savannah River Site]. LANL is also considering building \"modular\" plutonium facilities and is actively briefing this option to Congress. An EIS is definitely required for choices of this magnitude. None of these alternatives, let alone \"all reasonable alternatives\" as the law requires, have been weighed and their impacts compared in any EIS. Furthermore, NEPA's regulations and case law are clear that an agency cannot analyze one project's alternatives and build something quite different, or take one action today and significantly add to that action later, or do so contemporaneously with separate but connected projects. Congress has been anxious to see a formal plan for plutonium sustainment; the formality of NEPA process would help provide that plan while also serving as a barrier to \"scope creep\" and associated cost escalation.", "It cannot be overemphasized that NEPA's analysis of alternatives serves public purposes beyond environmental ones. As John Immele, former director of LANL's nuclear weapons program, wrote in late 1999 regarding the NEPA process, \"A ... lesson from the weapons program of the early and mid 1990s as well as the fissile materials disposition program is the necessity for and (surprising) success of publicly vetting our strategies through environmental impact statements.\"", "A thorough EIS analysis of plutonium program alternatives would be a way of complying with NEPA, would be responsive to congressional desires to have NNSA analyze alternatives, would reduce the likelihood that lawsuits filed to challenge the alternative chosen would succeed, and would thus reduce the likelihood that such lawsuits would be filed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Options", "paragraphs": ["Many options are possible.

LANL estimates that PF-4 could be used to manufacture 30 ppy without having to move out any ongoing programs. Attaining this higher capacity would require several actions including reconfiguring existing space and \"invest[ing] in new equipment (acquire/install) to increase capacity to 30 pits per year.\" As a hedge against inadequate plutonium processing capacity, NNSA's Plutonium Metal Processing subprogram would process plutonium alloy from pits returned from Pantex so as to create an inventory of metal for pits before it is needed; doing so \"helps ease constraints on Analytical Chemistry (AC) capacity and reduce out-year risk to achieve capacity targets.\" Both of these activities serve to increase pit-manufacturing capacity without requiring additional laboratory space.", "Furthermore, NNSA's plutonium strategy is considering ways to make better use of space in PF-4 and RLUOB to support the transition of AC and MC capabilities from CMR. Some space would be made available for this transition by reclaiming or \"repurposing\" rooms in PF-4 that are no longer in use (e.g., because the projects they housed have been completed), and some would come from reconfiguration, that is, rearranging equipment to increase efficiency. The former would add net space for AC/MC; the latter would not. AC equipment also would be added in RLUOB. In total, these actions would affect 8,000 sf in PF-4. A Los Alamos study considered using a facility at Livermore (see Option 7) and RLUOB for AC but did not consider having PF-4 perform all the AC work itself. In part this is because AC is space-intensive and PF-4 would not have sufficient space for production of 30 ppy plus the AC needed to support that capacity.", "AC would pose this problem because PF-4 is not configured for a large amount of AC. While some AC operations that use gram quantities of plutonium can be performed in gloveboxes, most AC operations use tiny samples, such as milligram or microgram quantities of plutonium dissolved in acid and placed in very small containers. Manipulating them is much easier in open-front hoods using thin gloves; it would be much harder to manipulate these samples with the multiple layers of gloves required for PF-4 glovebox work. However, hoods require a powerful ventilation system to create negative pressure in the hoods (so no fumes or plutonium escape), and multiple large HEPA filters. Gloveboxes require much less ventilation capacity since any air that flows into them does so through small leaks. PF-4, which is mostly outfitted with gloveboxes, does not have sufficient air handling capacity to support the hoods needed for 30 ppy. It would be difficult to replace gloveboxes with open-front hoods in PF-4 because the PF-4 ventilation system was not configured for the large airflow that hoods require. Upgrading PF-4 ventilation to support the large number of hoods needed to provide high AC capacity would at best be extremely costly. Indeed, the ventilation system to support open-front hoods is so bulky, as shown in Figure 6 , that it might not be possible to retrofit it into PF-4 at any cost. By extension, even if all of PF-4 were devoted to pit manufacture and supporting tasks, it appears highly improbable that PF-4, by itself, could do all the work needed to produce 80 ppy. There would also be the issue of where to house the tasks that would be moved out. ", "Given those problems, why not \u2026"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Option 2.

One option would go beyond currently planned maintenance and upgrades so as to keep it in operation longer. Just as PF-4 is being upgraded on an ongoing basis to reduce the risks of building collapse and fire, keeping it in operation until 2039, more substantial upgrades to CMR might in theory keep it in service well beyond 2019. So doing would provide AC and other capability until a new building could be built.", "This option has many problems and uncertainties. As noted, a congressional commission called CMR \"genuinely decrepit\" and a DNFSB study found it to be \"structurally unsound.\" Multiple wings of the building have been stripped to bare walls and floors to reduce nuclear material and prepare for decommissioning. A manager at Los Alamos indicated that CMR was built to the standards of the 1950s and there is a \"vast mismatch\" between the safety requirements of then and now. This individual pointed to problems with heating, electrical, and ventilation systems, and stated that refurbishing the ductwork would be \"cost-prohibitive.\" A tour of the building in September 2013 by the author revealed drains that had been concreted shut, gloveboxes with plastic bags instead of drain connections, gloveboxes with little to no anchoring to the floor, patches to pipes to keep them in operation, and water leaks in the ceiling. Laboratory staff stated that utility panels behind walls were contaminated with radioactive material and that corrosion in some piping had greatly reduced the inside diameter. Since NNSA plans to halt CMR operations in approximately 2019, there have been no studies of how to extend its service life well beyond that time, or what it would cost to do so. However, the fatal flaw in this option is that CMR lacks seismic robustness. Given these problems, it appears that retrofitting CMR to provide adequate utility and seismic robustness may not be possible at any reasonable cost.", "Despite these problems, if no other facility is ready to do the work of CMR by 2019, there would appear to be no other option than keeping CMR operational beyond that date, which would entail additional costs, inefficiencies, and the risk of keeping workers in a seismically fragile structure.", "Given problems with some obvious options, are other options available?

As such, this work requires high security and high MAR. PF-4 is HC-2/SC-I, and has the necessary equipment and supporting infrastructure for pit work. PF-4 is the only building in the nuclear weapons complex with this combination of attributes. Therefore, the most efficient use of PF-4 is for tasks requiring high MAR and high security. As a corollary, pit production capacity and efficiency can be increased by moving tasks that do not require high MAR and high security out of PF-4.", "Low SC/High HC: Producing 80 ppy would require casting more hemishells, increasing MAR substantially. While LANL has not done a detailed analysis, this added MAR could raise PF-4 above the limit allowed by the Documented Safety Analysis unless countervailing steps are taken. One approach, discussed in Option 12, would be to build a new module at LANL to hold the pit foundry. A second approach, discussed in Options 6 and 12, is to move Pu-238 work out of PF-4 to a module at LANL or to another site. Pu-238 is an ideal \"candidate\" to be moved out of PF-4. It is 275 times as radioactive as Pu-239, and even though it is a small fraction of plutonium by weight in PF-4, it accounts for 40% of its MAR allowance. It is in a low security category because it would be unattractive to terrorists. Moving Pu-238 out of PF-4 would also free up 8,000 sf of floor space, which could be made available for pit work.", "Low SC/Low HC: Casting hemishells for 80 ppy would also require increasing floor space dedicated to that task. AC is floor-space intensive. At the same time, it involves low MAR; indeed, the MAR is so low, and the form of the material (typically tiny samples of plutonium dissolved in acid) of so little value for use in a nuclear weapon if captured by terrorists, that much less security is required than PF-4 provides. The same holds for MC using samples of several grams of metallic plutonium. Accordingly, AC and some MC can be performed in SC-III/IV buildings. Thus, floor space could be made available in PF-4 by performing AC and some MC elsewhere. Manufacturing 10 ppy in PF-4 would have required 2,400 sf of floor space for AC in PF-4, plus about 7,000 sf for AC in RLUOB. The amount in PF-4, 2,400 sf, is a small fraction of that building's space, but since AC for 80 ppy would require considerably more floor space and ventilation capacity, the key value of conducting AC elsewhere would be in keeping additional AC from moving into PF-4. Options for moving AC out of PF-4 are discussed in Options 7-11. Moving the PF-4 gas gun (see Figure 12 ) out of that building and into a building for AC would release 1,200 sf of floor space, and a small amount of MAR, from PF-4.", "In sum, moving (and keeping) AC and some MC out of PF-4 would free up space but little MAR, while moving Pu-238 out of PF-4 would free up substantial space and MAR. In combination, these measures would free up much space and MAR in PF-4, making it more likely that it could produce 80 ppy and conduct other plutonium work.", "High SC/Low HC: This is a null set; no plutonium tasks require high security for low MAR.", "A note on vault storage space: A vault for storing plutonium is an integral part of pit production. It acts as a buffer to hold plutonium because one production task may not dovetail precisely with another. For example, pit production requires a place to hold plutonium metal that has been qualified for use in pits until it is needed, to hold hemishells until they can be joined into completed pits, and to hold completed pits until they are shipped to Pantex for incorporation into weapons. A vault is also needed to store pits from weapons that have been returned from deployment sites for surveillance. PF-4 is the only building at Los Alamos with a vault qualified to hold the large quantity of plutonium that such tasks require.", "When CMRR-NF was being designed in the early 2000s, SNM vault space at PF-4 and other sites was mostly filled and the final disposition of material from other sites was unknown. Accordingly, NNSA decided to add vault space to CMRR-NF. RLUOB could not have a vault because it was designed as a Radiological Facility. At issue is whether there is enough vault space in PF-4 to support production of 80 ppy.", "Over many years, the PF-4 vault has accumulated much material that is no longer needed for programmatic operations. Some, in excess to current or foreseeable needs, can be de-acquisitioned and shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for permanent disposal, to Savannah River Site for other disposition, or to Y-12 for uranium items. Plutonium that might be needed for future operations could be stored elsewhere, such as Pantex Plant, which stores thousands of pits, or the Device Assembly Facility at the Nevada National Security Site, an HC-2/SC-I facility that has space available for storage of plutonium, or the K Reactor at Savannah River Site, which is currently used to store plutonium. Thus there are many ways to reduce the amount of material stored in the PF-4 vault, and NNSA accelerated vault cleanout as a mitigation effort associated with the deferral of CMRR-NF. Cleaning out the vault at PF-4 will make more room available for plutonium needed for production. LANL has not studied whether cleanout would provide enough space to support production of 80 ppy, but it appears likely that an effort focused on this goal and coordinated with other sites could do so.

While LANL is DOE's center of excellence for plutonium, Pu-238 work is readily separable from Pu-239 work because the two isotopes have very different properties and applications. Pu-239 is used in weapons and might be used as mixed oxide fuel (a mixture of oxides of Pu-239 and uranium isotopes) for nuclear power reactors, while kilogram quantities of Pu-238 are used to generate heat for conversion to electric power for defense and space missions.", "In a report of May 2013, DOE examined several options for processing Pu-238 for fabrication of radioisotope power systems. One was to upgrade the existing line in PF-4; however, this would not address the possibility of reducing Pu-238 MAR in order to release MAR for weapons work. The report also considered performing Pu-238 work at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) or Savannah River Site (SRS). It did not address the LANL proposal to build modules connected to PF-4, one of which might perform Pu-238 work.", "INL currently conducts operations with clad heat sources of Pu-238. It operates the Space and Security Power Systems Facility, which further encapsulates the Pu-238 heat sources produced by LANL, mates them to the power systems that convert their heat to electric power, tests the resulting system, and delivers them to users.", "INL states that all current LANL Pu-238 operations could be transferred to INL, such as recovery, purification, and source fabrication, and that INL would have a capacity of processing 5 kg per year. The option to bring Pu-238 source fabrication to INL would use an existing building, CPP-1634, that was built in 1993 as an HC-2 building and was since downgraded. It would have to be upgraded back to HC-2 in order to handle 5 kg of Pu-238 per year. INL would also build an addition to CPP-1634 that would more than double its size. The upgrade would require modifying the safety analysis report and upgrading the building's safety systems (such as ventilation) and equipment (such as gloveboxes) to be consistent with the hazards and operations proposed. Pu-238 in quantities of up to 16 kg is SC-III because it is unattractive for use in making a nuclear weapon. CPP-1634 would have more security than is needed to meet SC-III requirements because it would be within the INL security perimeter.", "The DOE report noted several advantages of establishing this capability at INL, including a new design that minimizes down time and maintenance cost, and process improvements that minimize operational costs and worker exposure and improve product quality. Also, locating the program in a facility owned by DOE's Nuclear Energy program, which is responsible for plutonium-238, would allow \"more control and lower operational costs as compared to operating within TA-55 that seems to have large overhead costs resulting in high operational costs.\" Drawbacks include \"inexperience with Pu-238 processing operations,\" \"loss of co-location and leveraging with related NNSA program,\" risk due to uncertainty in safety requirements because \"no new Pu-238 processing facility has been constructed in many years,\" and \"risk of moving Pu-238 operations away from DOE's plutonium operations center of excellence,\" that is, LANL.", "There is also an SRS option. From the mid-1960s to early 1980s, SRS produced Pu-238 in its reactors by bombarding neptunium-237 target tubes with neutrons. It then dissolved the target tubes, separated and purified Pu-238 in H Canyon, turned the Pu-238 into plutonium oxide in HB-Line, pressed that material into heat sources, and clad them in iridium in the 235-F facility. In 1983, the last neptunium-237 targets were irradiated and in 1985-1986, Pu-238 operations were moved to LANL. Subsequently, the last SRS reactor was shut down in 1993. Work is underway to develop the capability to produce Pu-238 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (TN).", "SRS has two buildings that could be used for Pu-238. Its H Canyon is a large, highly shielded concrete structure, approximately 1,000 feet long by 120 feet wide by 75 feet high, that began operations in 1955. It was built to process irradiated targets and fuel rods from SRS reactors for various nuclear materials. These targets and fuel rods had very high levels of radioactivity, so they required processing in a facility that was heavily shielded and remotely operated. As such, it is off limits to personnel, and all material is processed by moving it through pipes or handling it with a remotely operated crane. It is the only remaining U.S. facility that is heavily shielded and remotely operated and that can chemically process large quantities of radioactive material, such as spent fuel rods. It is currently operational, processing irradiated fuel stored in an underwater pool at SRS. SRS also has the HB-Line, which is built atop H Canyon to provide a work space with heavily shielded gloveboxes for work on Pu-238. It became operational in the late 1980s. It is currently operating, but its Pu-238 lines would have to be restarted, which could take three or four years. A third building at SRS that was used in the Pu-238 program, Building 235-F, contained a process line that fabricated heat sources from Pu-238 oxide. However, the facility has not been operated since 1984 and is not part of the current proposal due to high levels of contamination.", "In the SRS plan, Pu-238 could arrive at the plant as irradiated target tubes of neptunium-237 from a DOE reactor, as unpurified Pu-238 oxide from Russia, or as scrap Pu-238 oxide. These oxides would be dissolved in nitric acid in the HB-Line. This solution would be transferred through pipes to H Canyon, where it would be purified by removing other chemical elements. The purified Pu-238 solution would be transferred back to HB-Line, where plutonium would be precipitated out of solution and then turned into plutonium oxide, a solid. In an option in the SRS plan, a new Plutonium Testing and Processing Facility (PTPF), consisting of prefabricated hot cells (capable of handling highly radioactive material) and gloveboxes, would be installed in H Canyon. This facility would press plutonium oxide into pellets, which would be fabricated into heat sources, clad in iridium, and sent to INL, where they would be mated with power generating equipment and then delivered to end users.", "The DOE report noted several advantages and disadvantages of this option. H Canyon and HB-Line can process a wide quantity range of Pu-238, from 1 to over 30 kg per year. These facilities are built to high safety standards. Infrastructure requirements are well understood, such as environment, safety, and health, material control and accountability, and waste management; there is also an AC capability. On the other hand, the length of time that missions will support H Canyon is not clear because \"its mission length is defined by a campaign by campaign basis.\" Operations there are planned until 2018-2020, with operations beyond that time uncertain. ", "Further, required production \"[does] not necessitate a large throughput capacity. Thus, revitalization of the facilities may not be justified.\" And without a long-term mission, there is no clear advantage to building PTPF. At issue: There is value to the weapons program in removing Pu-238 from PF-4. Would processing Pu-238 be a long-term mission that would justify, and that might contribute funding to, PTPF?", "The DOE report compared cost and schedule estimates for these two options, as follows. ", "For the INL option, $12 million for technology development taking three years, and $110 million to $260 million for general-purpose heat source fabrication capability, taking five years. For the SRS option, $28 million to $45 million for plutonium purification revitalization, taking 3\u00bd to 4\u00bd years, and $125 million to $170 million for PTPF, taking four to five years. Combining these figures, the INL option would cost $122 million to $272 million and take eight years, and the SRS option would cost $153 million to $215 million and take 7\u00bd to 9\u00bd years.", "It must be emphasized that these estimates are preliminary and are not based on extensive analysis.", "DNFSB commented that \"H-Canyon is exhibiting degradation of systems and structures that if not addressed, could challenge safe operations and pose a risk to facility workers. \u2026 DOE completed repairs to address some of the identified deficiencies \u2026 There are some safety-related repairs that have not yet been completed.\"", "Having addressed Pu-238, this report now turns to options to address analytic al chemistry \u2026"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Option 7: Conduct Some or All Analytical Chemistry at LLNL or SRS", "paragraphs": ["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has a large building, Building 332, that is part of its \"Superblock\" complex. Building 332 was built for plutonium work. One wing (\"Increment 1\") was built in 1961; another wing (\"Increment 3\") was built in 1975. Increments 1 and 3 are laboratory buildings; Increment 2 is the control room, without laboratory space. Building 332 was a Hazard Category 2/Security Category I facility, like PF-4, so it was used to handle hundreds of kilograms of plutonium. Its ventilation systems (including fans and HEPA filters) and electrical systems have been updated in the past decade. Even though Livermore is in a seismically active area, Building 332 was designed to take into account seismicity, and an analysis showed that it does not require an upgrade to make it more seismically robust. Its gloveboxes (new and retrofitted) are reinforced so as not to fall over in an earthquake.", "Building 332 remains an HC-2 building, but its plutonium quantity is limited by its Security Category. It was SC-I. To reduce vulnerability and security costs, NNSA consolidated SNM to fewer facilities at fewer sites. As part of that plan, LLNL removed all SC-I/II quantities of SNM from the lab, a task completed in September 2012. Building 332 is now SC-III, which limits it, as a first approximation, to 400 g of plutonium metal and 16,000 g of plutonium in solution. Plutonium in solution poses much less risk\u2014is less attractive to terrorists\u2014than metallic plutonium, which is why much more plutonium is allowed in solution than in metal form.", "Building 332 has ample space for AC work. It has 24,000 total sf of laboratory space, as compared to 19,500 sf for RLUOB and 22,500 sf in the CMRR-NF design. Some space is being used to fabricate plutonium samples for experiments that subject plutonium to impact (such as from a gas gun projectile) and for material processing studies. LLNL is currently using 5,000 sf for AC and MC, and could make another 6,000 sf available. Building 332 has a substantial excess of air handling capacity, which would support the use of open-front hoods. LLNL believes that Building 332 has sufficient air handling capacity to support AC for 80 ppy.", "Once analyzed, samples would be processed as waste. For final disposition, waste is shipped to WIPP. Since WIPP does not accept liquids, liquid waste is solidified by mixing it with cement. LANL and LLNL differ in how they would handle waste. LANL has the capability to recover plutonium from liquid samples and to process the waste stream, solidifying it for shipment to WIPP. LANL uses AC to support these operations. LANL also uses AC to send liquid waste to LANL's Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility because that facility places requirements (such as the amount of mercury) in the waste it accepts for treatment. LLNL does not have these capabilities, and would not perform AC on material (liquids and solids) to be disposed of as waste. However, the liquid waste generated by the AC for 80 ppy would be very much less than the waste that LANL generates for various other missions, so LLNL holds that simply cementing the liquid waste would be a satisfactory way to prepare its liquid waste for shipping.", "There are several potential drawbacks. All DOE sites that handle plutonium have their own AC operations rather than shipping samples to another site because AC is a basic capability required for many purposes in addition to pit manufacturing, such as measuring quantity of material for material control and accountability, recovering plutonium from waste streams, and for various types of pit work including development of processes for fabrication, qualification of processes, and certification. At issue is whether LLNL would have the needed capacity to support AC for 80 ppy while performing AC for other missions. Having LLNL perform the AC could add schedule risk to any LLNL program that needed AC.", "While commercial carriers have shipped plutonium for some years, there might be public concern about shipping many hundreds of samples per year. As a related point, while LLNL could stay within MAR limits if plutonium shipments arrived weekly, a LANL engineer observed, \"I have been associated with pit manufacturing for several decades and it hasn't ever reached steady state yet. The notion of standardized delivery dates is inconceivable to me. The manufacturing process is too fragile and is constantly interrupted leading to feast or famine sample delivery.\" Further, it takes five days to dissolve a certain type of plutonium samples (plutonium oxide fired at very high temperature). Might these problems result in exceeding MAR limits?", "Performing all AC work in support of pit production would bring more plutonium work to LLNL. This would have the advantage of distributing plutonium expertise more widely in the nuclear weapons complex. LLNL currently has only four chemists doing AC on plutonium. This option would require adding staff and equipment, strengthening LLNL's capability, which could prove useful for peer review of plutonium issues as well as for AC. On the other hand, LANL is the center of excellence for plutonium in the nuclear weapons complex, and this option would dilute LANL's plutonium capability. According to a LANL staff member,", "If all DOE sites were making steel, there would be ample opportunities to consolidate AC using commercial vendors. With plutonium, AC is too inherent to processing for one site to be completely reliant on off-site AC measurement. Manufacturing war reserve pits demands the highest quality level and the broadest suite of analytical techniques. Since LANL has the country's main plutonium facility, it would need substantial in-house AC capability, and there is inherent capacity in the capability. The logistics of a split-capability mission (manufacturing at LANL, AC elsewhere) does not seem amenable to a smoothly operating enterprise. That said, LANL's 2012 \"60-day study\" acknowledged that LLNL could perform some AC when LANL needed additional capacity.", "Savannah River Site (SRS) offers another option. It has been involved with plutonium for many decades. It had five large reactors for producing plutonium, the first of which began operations in 1953. In total, these reactors produced 36 metric tons of plutonium, most of which was WGPu, with the largest annual amount, 2.1 metric tons, produced in 1964. All the plutonium produced had to be characterized, which required AC. Because SRS supplied plutonium to Rocky Flats Plant, SRS needed an industrial-scale AC capability to characterize the plutonium for the weapons program and to perform AC for other tasks, such as for Pu-238. Part of this capacity is currently unused, but SRS retains the infrastructure and equipment.", "While SRS no longer produces plutonium\u2014an SRS reactor last produced plutonium in 1988\u2014SRS continues to conduct a great deal of plutonium AC. It has repurposed its K Reactor, which used to produce plutonium, to store tons of plutonium from across the nuclear weapons complex and elsewhere. For example, plutonium from Rocky Flats and the Hanford Reservation (which used to produce plutonium) was moved to the K Reactor, as was plutonium de-inventoried from LLNL in order to move Superblock to Security Category III, plutonium oxide produced from retired pits by ARIES at PF-4, and plutonium from foreign sources. More is being added on an ongoing basis. All this plutonium requires AC in order to characterize the isotopic composition and impurities of plutonium stored in drums at K Reactor. For example, AC would detect chlorides and fluorides in the plutonium mixture that would corrode storage drums. AC is also used for characterizing plutonium produced at HB-Line for use in mixed oxide (MOX, a blend of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide) fuel for nuclear reactors.", "As with many industrial operations, SRS nuclear materials processing facilities operate 24/7, so SRS conducts AC 24/7 because some processing operations require a short turnaround time for AC, and personnel must be available at all times in case of problems.", "SRS currently uses F/H Laboratory (the laboratory that supported H area, where H Canyon and HB-Line are located, and F area, which also has a canyon and a B-line) for AC. F/H Laboratory (see Figure 10 ) is large, 80,000 sf as compared to 60,000 sf for PF-4 and 19,500 sf for RLUOB. Also at SRS is Building 773-A, which is larger than F/H Laboratory. Since both labs were sized for a time when the United States produced many thousands of nuclear weapons, they have between them a great deal of excess capacity in terms of hoods and gloveboxes for AC. SRS believes that F/H Laboratory, with Building 773-A for redundancy or a spike in workload, could handle the AC for 80 ppy, though they would need some new instruments and SRS would have to hire perhaps 20 technicians and several analytical chemists. Both labs have a very large ventilation capacity. For example, F/H Laboratory is equipped with six large fans, but SRS calculated that two of them could be shut down and the others would still provide sufficient ventilation capacity. SRS could perform the AC and Pu-238 missions concurrently, as they would use different facilities\u2014H Canyon and HB-Line for Pu-238, and F/H Laboratory, Building 773-A, or both for AC.", "SRS has worked closely with LANL on AC. SRS is part of LANL's quality assurance program. LANL sends SRS metal samples once a year for SRS to perform AC on as part of the Plutonium Metal Standards Exchange. In that program, multiple sites, including the United Kingdom's Atomic Weapons Establishment, exchange plutonium samples and perform AC on them as a check on each other's AC capabilities. LANL, through its accreditation program, has also qualified SRS to perform the AC for plutonium to supply the MOX plant.", "The drawbacks of conducting all AC for 80 ppy at SRS are similar to those discussed for LLNL, though LANL would not be opposed to conducting some AC at another site if it needed extra capacity to handle a spike in workload, or on a routine basis if production increased to 80 ppy.", "Many plans proposed over the past two decades for plutonium work have sought to consolidate that work at a single site .

Of particular importance are the upgrades to the pit fabrication wing of the building. These upgrades will remove currently unused gloveboxes from the manufacturing space, consolidate laboratory space, and improve the equipment layout to enhance process flow. These steps would increase PF-4's pit production capacity. CMR, RLUOB, or both would conduct some AC necessary to support pit manufacture.", "Space consolidation offers an opportunity to repurpose space to add equipment to achieve capacities of up to 80 ppy for several, but not all, flowsheet operations. (A \"flowsheet\" is a sequence of operations that must be followed precisely to make a pit.) The capacity of other operations could be boosted in other ways, such as by adding shifts. The challenge is determining what actions are needed to ensure that every operation in the flowsheet could handle up to 80 pits per year because there is not enough space in PF-4 to scale all operations, including support operations like AC, up to a capacity of 80 ppy.", "LANL has not analyzed space-fit issues for producing 80 ppy. But based on comparison to past analyses, it seems likely that achieving a capacity of 80 ppy in PF-4 is possible if LANL could fully use the laboratory space in RLUOB. The usefulness of that space, 19,500 square feet, is currently limited by a requirement that RLUOB can hold only 26 g of WGPu, the volume of two nickels. (See Figure 11 .) Increasing that limit to 1,000 g would provide enough MAR in RLUOB for the AC to support production of 80 ppy, as well as some MC. It is not clear that RLUOB has sufficient floor space to do that much work. However, as discussed in Appendix F , it seems likely that RLUOB with a MAR of 1,000 g WGPu, plus space made available in PF-4 through reconfiguration (8,000 sf) or by moving out Pu-238 (a separate 8,000 sf), plus improving pit fabrication operations (such as by using multiple shifts or improving efficiency of equipment or processes), would provide enough space and free up enough MAR to produce 80 ppy and to perform the AC needed to support that level of production.", "To hold 1,000 g WGPu while complying with regulations, RLUOB would have to be converted to an HC-3 building. There are several advantages. So doing would support LANL's ability to perform the pit work that DOD requires. It would permit LANL to move AC equipment from CMR, enabling that building to halt plutonium operations. It would permit LANL to free up floor space in PF-4 by moving out equipment for AC and for some MC (see Figure 12 ), and to make operations more efficient, such as by moving out a large MC instrument now placed in the middle of an AC room.", "A drawback is that it would take a substantial effort to convert RLUOB to HC-3. As a Radiological Facility, RLUOB is not subjected to federal, state, local, and laboratory requirements for an HC-3 building. To comply with these requirements, many tasks would have to be conducted; Appendix D lists about 100 of them. Many, such as preparing an environmental assessment and perhaps an EIS, developing safety design reports, developing engineering functions and requirements documents, developing an updated fire hazards analysis, and developing a final material control and accountability plan, would require much time and effort; others would require less effort. But the work would not stop with preparing these documents because many would lead to physical modifications to RLUOB. For example, an engineering ", "task listed in Appendix D \u2014\"Develop design and analysis for seismic upgrades as required. RLUOB safety Structure, System and Components (SSCs) are not currently required to be operational following a seismic event per [NNSA's Los Alamos Field Office] direction\"\u2014could easily lead to seismic upgrades to RLUOB unless a decision were made to accept the risk in light of cost-benefit considerations.", "LANL has not estimated the cost or schedule to complete these tasks, and the upgrade could prove to be expensive. However, given the historical record of cost growth, schedule delays, cancellations, and deferrals in constructing new plutonium facilities, upgrading RLUOB to HC-3 would probably be a quicker and less costly way to obtain the needed capacity than building a new building.", "Regulations limit the quantity of WGPu that RLUOB can hold to the volume of two nickels . What would happen if that limit were not applied to RLUOB ?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Option 10. Use RLUOB, with Regulatory Relief, for Analytical Chemistry, with PF-4 Conducting the Balance of Pit Work", "paragraphs": ["Many regulations impose burdens on the nuclear weapons complex, including plutonium facilities, that to some analysts may seem disconnected from end goals, such as reducing dose in the event of an accident to a level below a specified threshold. Two quotes are instructive; many more could be added. SEAB stated in 2005, ", "The DOE has burdened the Complex with rules and regulations that focus on process rather than mission safety. Cost/benefit analysis and risk informed decisions are absent, resulting in a risk-averse posture at all management levels.", "And an NNSA report of 2006 stated that the complex of that time had", "A culture that sometimes seeks to eliminate all risks at an unsustainable cost no matter how small the probability of occurrence and to substitute oversight recommendations for responsible line decisions.", "Hazard Category regulations limiting the amount of plutonium in a building are intended to limit the dose to emergency responders, collocated workers and the general public. However, a calculation in Appendix B shows that if RLUOB held 1,010 g of WGPu and a Design Basis Accident occurred in which the building collapsed, the dose for a collocated worker (CW) and a maximally-exposed offsite individual (MOI) would be far less than the guideline set forth in DOE regulations. Specifically, the dose to a CW would be 10.41 rem, vs. a guideline of 100 rem, and the dose to an MOI would be 0.49 rem, vs. a guideline of 5 to 25 rem. And as discussed under \" Increasing Safety ,\" the probability and consequences of a DBA can be reduced in many ways. Accordingly, Option 10 focuses on how RLUOB might be used for AC/MC in support of pit production if Congress were to waive the limit of 38.6 g Pu-239E (26 g WGPu) for RLUOB.", "While the option has not been studied, it appears, as noted under Option 9, that a MAR limit of 1,000 g WGPu would be enough for RLUOB to perform the AC needed to support 80 ppy, as well as some MC tasks, though more floor space might be needed. Appendix F shows the space breakout for AC under several plans. CMRR-NF would have had about 22,500 sf of lab space. Of that, 9,750 sf would have been used for AC. Another 6,750 sf in RLUOB would have been used for AC. The current plan, with the 26 g WGPu limit, is to use 10,500 sf in RLUOB and 5,600 sf in PF-4 for AC. However, most AC work is less efficient if done in PF-4 than in RLUOB because PF-4 uses gloveboxes and because PF-4, which is SC-I, requires particularly rigorous security measures. If RLUOB could hold 1,000 g WGPu, 15,000 sf could be used for AC, 3,500 sf for MC, with the remaining 1,000 sf available for support activities. PF-4 could use 2,400 sf for sample preparation, which uses a large amount of plutonium and is done in a small lab room already set up for this purpose in PF-4.", "Option 10 may merit further study because, if it proves feasible, it would offer advantages that address concerns Congress has raised for many years. Option 7 (AC at LLNL or SRS) would offer some of these advantages as well.", "1. Option 10 would reduce cancellation risk. The history of pit production efforts includes cases where decisions by Congress or the Administration have halted a major plutonium building after planning had started but before construction had begun. Conducting pit production support tasks in a building that already exists would reduce this risk. 2. Option 10 would greatly reduce the risk of a plutonium building being built, found unsuitable, and torn down. As described in \" Two Other Failed Attempts ,\" this situation occurred with Building 371 at Rocky Flats Plant and the Nuclear Material Storage Facility at LANL. 3. Using RLUOB would reduce the risk of large cost growth. Congress is concerned about NNSA's record of cost growth in its nuclear facility construction projects, which may be why Congress, in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 112-239 , Section 3114, capped spending for UPF and CMRR-NF, and why Section 3112 of P.L. 113-66 , FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act, established a Director for Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation in NNSA. RLUOB has much lab space, and procuring added equipment would not add to the marginal cost if such equipment would be procured for another nuclear facility. Converting more space in RLUOB, strengthening it, or making other changes to reduce risk and increase efficiency would probably not cost as much as a new facility. 4. Equipping RLUOB for AC and some MC would be the fastest way to augment capacity. RLUOB has an infrastructure to support work on small samples, some lab space is already equipped, and empty lab space could be equipped. The capacity should be available before it is needed, providing time to work out process kinks. In contrast, adding equipment to PF-4 would be difficult, costly, and time-consuming because changes to PF-4, an HC-2 building, must comply with many requirements and workers must undergo security checks, and space may not be available. Minimizing the risk of delay is also of value because delay typically increases cost and could disrupt the schedule for weapons work. 5. Section 3114 of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 112-239 , requires the Secretary of Energy to construct a building to replace the functions of CMR at a cost not to exceed $3.7 billion. If RLUOB could replace the functions of CMR while avoiding the need to build CMRR-NF, it would save the cost of the latter facility, which NNSA estimated at between $3.7 billion and $5.9 billion in its FY2012 budget request. The savings could be higher. A five-year deferral, NNSA estimates, would add two years to the time to complete CMRR-NF, and delay typically adds cost. CMRR-NF might be canceled in favor of a modular strategy, which Section 3117 of the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes. The two modules referenced in Section 3117 would presumably be less costly than CMRR-NF, especially as they would be between 3,000 sf and 5,000 sf, vs. 22,500 sf for CMRR-NF. However, modules would be HC-2 and at least SC-II. As such, the cost of two modules could reach the billions of dollars. 6. Using RLUOB would avoid or minimize design and construction risks, such as design errors. These risks are different than cost and schedule risks, though they may lead to such risks. A case in point from 2013 occurred with UPF. According to the Senate Appropriations Committee, \"Most recently, a space fit issue that required raising the roof of the building by 13 feet to fit critical equipment resulted in more than $500,000,000 in additional costs to U.S. taxpayers.\" 7. As Appendix E shows, RLUOB is much more seismically resilient than CMR. Option 10 could permit NNSA to halt work in CMR by 2019. It might even permit halting this work before then, reducing the time in which CMR poses a safety hazard to its workers and the public. If no other facility is in place by 2019 for AC and some MC, it might be necessary to extend CMR's service life beyond then. However, there is no assurance that that could be done, which would make it harder to meet the 2021 pit production goal. As a cautionary example, the redesign of UPF might push completion of that facility past the date when Building 9212 can no longer be kept in service. 8. Option 10 could make 1,200 sf of lab space available in PF-4 by enabling the gas gun (see Figure 12 ) to be moved out. The target is typically 20-25 g of WGPu. With a MAR limit of 26 g WGPu for RLUOB, the target would take up so much MAR that much other plutonium work in RLUOB would have to be stop and the material containerized when a gas gun experiment was in progress. A MAR limit of 1,000 g of WGPu would avoid that problem. 9. Option 10 would increase efficiency in other ways. For example, PF-4 houses a highly sensitive spectrometer that had to be placed near an outside wall to minimize vibrations. The only suitable space available was in the middle of a room filled with gloveboxes. Moving it to RLUOB would remove clutter from the room. At the same time, it would be easier to use the instrument in a laboratory room outfitted to accommodate it. 10. NNSA anticipates that upgrades will enable PF-4 to remain in service until 2039. Based on experience with other plutonium buildings, RLUOB, which was completed in 2009, should have at least a 50-year service life. If PF-4 and RLUOB can remain in service for another quarter-century, Congress may be able to defer decisions on other plutonium facilities for at least a decade, and defer substantial expenditures on such facilities longer than that. 11. Even if NNSA ultimately moves high-MAR activities from PF-4 to modules, as discussed in Option 12, it would still be desirable if not necessary to use RLUOB for AC to support production of 80 ppy because RLUOB, unlike PF-4 or the modules, is well suited for low-MAR work that uses a substantial amount of floor space. Thus upgrading RLUOB would likely be a component of the module plan, in which case any difficulties attendant upon upgrading RLUOB would be present under the module plan. 12. Placing the pit program on a fiscally and politically sustainable path soon would avoid years of uncertainty for the entire plutonium program, providing a long-term foundation for the rest of the program. That would help NNSA plan that program, other facilities, disposition of excess nuclear material, and budgets. 13. Upgrading existing buildings, rather than building new buildings or transporting material to other sites as part of pit production, should minimize environmental impact. As a result, compliance with NEPA should be simpler and an EIS prepared to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of that law should be less vulnerable to a successful legal challenge.", "At the same time, there are several concerns about this option.", "1. RLUOB might collapse in an earthquake. The building was designed to have a 50% chance of surviving the 1995 design basis earthquake (DBE), but the 2009 DBE is more powerful. The lowest two floors of RLUOB (basement, utilities; and first floor, laboratory) are built of thick reinforced concrete, and the second floor (lowest office floor) has thick concrete columns; all are seismically robust. The upper two office floors are designed to the structural requirements of an emergency response building, like a hospital or fire station. While the upper two floors are less robust than the lower floors, they are much sturdier than a standard office building, and its seismic robustness could be increased through several methods discussed in \" Increasing Safety .\" (The \"utility\" component of RLUOB is the Central Utility Building, separated from RLUOB by about a foot.) It appears that detailed analysis would be needed to determine the seismic performance of RLUOB as is, whether a collapse of the office would breach the laboratory ceiling, what reinforcements would be suitable, how effective they would be, and what they would cost. 2. Non-governmental organizations and members of the public might be concerned about any efforts to relax standards pertaining to nuclear facilities. Safety and other standards exist for a reason; would relaxing them add risk, and if so, by how much? Some might oppose introducing more than 26 g of WGPu into RLUOB on grounds that so doing could pose a direct threat to the surrounding area in the event of an earthquake that collapsed the building. 3. Relaxing standards for one building could set a precedent for so doing for other nuclear weapons buildings or other projects more generally. 4. Some might fear that this project could open the way for other plutonium projects at Los Alamos. As discussed in Option 12, the laboratory is considering a modular option, with a tunnel built to connect PF-4 and RLUOB and reinforced-concrete underground rooms or \"modules\" built off the tunnel for high-MAR plutonium operations. In this view, using trucks to transport samples between PF-4 and RLUOB would forestall or delay the modular option. Others might favor the tunnel in part because it would facilitate the modular option. 5. Some may fear that NNSA might not do an adequate EIS. One of the tests for a Categorical Exclusion in DOE regulations (10 CFR 1021.410) is", "(3) The proposal has not been segmented to meet the definition of a categorical exclusion. Segmentation can occur when a proposal is broken down into small parts in order to avoid the appearance of significance of the total action. The scope of a proposal must include the consideration of connected and cumulative actions, that is, the proposal is not connected to other actions with potentially significant impacts (40 CFR 1508.25(a)(1)), is not related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(7)), and is not precluded by 40 CFR 1506.1 or \u00a7 1021.211 of this part concerning limitations on actions during EIS preparation.", "Similarly, CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.7) define \"cumulative impact\" as follows:", "\"Cumulative impact\" is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.", "An EIS does not meet regulatory requirements if it avoids considering all reasonable alternatives, or if only a segment of a proposed action is analyzed, or if the cumulative impacts of multiple actions are not taken into account. \"Up-equipping\" RLUOB (adding equipment so it can handle more AC/MC to support pit production), building a tunnel to connect RLUOB and PF-4, building one module, building a second module, and building additional modules could easily be segmented. While the modules would be HC-2, and thus significant by themselves, up-equipping RLUOB and building a tunnel to connect it to PF-4 might be seen as \"small\" actions that would not appear significant. But the cumulative impact of those small actions plus modules would be much larger than just an up-equipped RLUOB plus a tunnel. Further, since there is a possibility of building modules given that the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act authorized NNSA to spend funds on a modular building strategy, once certain conditions have been met, the EIS would need to analyze the impact of that alternative, including the entire suite of projects involved (such as the tunnel), before committing to any of them. 6. RLUOB, as currently planned, would dedicate a substantial amount of laboratory space to unclassified research on plutonium. This research could explore such areas as basic properties, nuclear forensics, nuclear power plants, and Pu-238. The space would be open to individuals without clearances. Providing space for postdoctoral fellows to conduct plutonium research would benefit LANL by attracting potential recruits to the lab, and discoveries made by these individuals or foreign nationals could benefit the weapons program. If RLUOB is permitted to have 1,000 g of WGPu in order to support the weapons program, most if not all of the unclassified laboratory space would be converted to classified space.", "Since the laboratory space at RLUOB could perform AC and some MC work, but questions remain about seismic robustness in light of the possible collapse of the office floors, would it be possible to \u2026"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Option 11. Build a Copy of RLUOB Minus the Office, with Regulatory Relief, for Analytical Chemistry, with PF-4 Conducting the Balance of Pit Work", "paragraphs": ["A concern with RLUOB, even with regulatory relief, is that the office component could collapse in an earthquake and breach the ceiling of the laboratory, releasing plutonium. A simple way to avoid that problem would be to build an \"RLB,\" or Radiological Laboratory Building. Construction of RLUOB was completed in FY2010. The FY2012 NNSA budget request shows the total project cost of the facility as $164.0 million, including the office floors and the Central Utility Building (CUB), and another $199.4 million for installing equipment. An RLB built as a copy of the laboratory space in RLUOB should cost considerably less (when adjusted for inflation) than RLUOB because the office structure would be eliminated, the plans for the lab space already exist, and lessons learned from RLUOB could be applied to facilitate construction. The CUB was intended to provide utilities to CMRR-NF, a larger building than RLUOB, as well as to RLUOB; CUB should thus have the capacity to support most of RLB's needs. If RLB were built as a copy of the basement and laboratory floor of RLUOB, it would need regulatory relief in order to hold enough plutonium to do the AC/MC work needed to support 80 ppy.", "Regulatory relief would be unnecessary if RLB were to be built as an HC-3 building. However, meeting HC-3 standards would result in a substantial cost increase for paperwork, studies, and testing to certify the same equipment (fans, filters, fire suppression equipment, etc.) because the standards would be much higher. Another issue for RLB is that that structure would probably be sited in the location previously planned for CMRR-NF. In that case, building it there could preclude modules. Some would see that as a plus, others as a minus.", "If regulatory relief for RLB were not forthcoming, or if an HC-3 RLB proved too costly for a building holding 1 kg of WGPu, or if RLB plus PF-4 did not provide enough space or MAR for all the pit work that would be needed to produce 80 ppy, another approach would be to \u2026"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Option 12. Build Modules Connected to PF-4 for High-MAR Plutonium Work", "paragraphs": ["Los Alamos's preferred approach to the plutonium strategy is a three-part plan: maximize use of RLUOB, repurpose space in PF-4, and build modules linked to PF-4. This section discusses the modules and their pros and cons.", "In concept, the modules would be like \"RLB\" in that they would be seismically reinforced laboratory-only space. There would be key differences: the modules would be completely buried instead of mostly aboveground, would be designed and built as HC-2, would do high-MAR work instead of AC/MC, and each would be for a single purpose.", "PF-4 is built as modules under one roof. They all utilize the infrastructure and supporting systems of PF-4, such as shipping, receiving, waste management, nondestructive assay, entry control, and security, but are designed so plutonium accidentally released in one room would be contained within that room. The LANL approach envisions building a tunnel from PF-4 to RLUOB with modules connected to the tunnel. The first modules would be for tasks involving large amounts of MAR: Pu-238 processing, a pit foundry, or processing plutonium dissolved in acid. Moving these tasks out of PF-4 would remove about 70% of the MAR in PF-4. So doing would make more MAR available for other tasks involving MAR while staying within the limit prescribed for PF-4.", "A key lesson learned from seismic simulation studies of PF-4 and RLUOB is that the larger the dimensions of the structure, the greater the seismic loads imparted to equipment anchored to the floor. As currently envisioned, modules, at 3,000 to 5,000 square feet, would be smaller than RLUOB (19,500 sf) and PF-4 (60,000 sf). They would be lower in height and narrower than those buildings and made of thick concrete heavily reinforced with rebar. They would be constructed in the 3-acre excavated area between RLUOB and PF-4 that was dug out for CMRR-NF (see Figure 4 ) and then buried with a special concrete that matches the density of the rock (called tuff) on which the modules would sit. By matching the density of the tuff, a seismic wave would pass through the concrete more smoothly, reducing its impact on the modules. Surrounding the structure with concrete would reinforce the walls. A buried structure has the added advantages of minimizing concerns regarding securely transporting plutonium between the modules, PF-4, and RLUOB, and avoiding such natural phenomena as fires and high winds.", "Los Alamos recognizes that the \"big box\" approach\u2014building a single large building like PF-4 or CMRR-NF\u2014no longer appears politically and fiscally sustainable over the decades required to plan and build such a facility. As Senator Lamar Alexander said, \"if the NNSA does not find a more effective [way] to deal with design of these large multi-billion dollar facilities that NNSA builds it's going to lose congressional support for those facilities.\" Part of the problem is that a big box design is typically too ambitious and too cautious at the same time. It is too ambitious because when there is an opportunity to build a plutonium facility only once in 25 or 50 years, there is a tendency for the design to include everything that might possibly be needed over the building's life. It is too cautious because it must comply with a vast and growing body of regulations, often of increasing specificity. Meeting goals and requirements simultaneously is difficult, a difficulty compounded because uncertainties concerning goals and requirements increase the further out projections are made.", "Accordingly, in this view, a new approach is needed. Los Alamos argues that modular construction offers numerous advantages. Since modules would be much smaller than large buildings, they could be built faster and at lower cost. Since each module would house a single operation, safety planning could be specific to each module instead of, as at present, accommodating the highest-risk type and quantity of material. Modules could be built as needed, rather than having to incorporate in a single building all the functions that it might need to perform at some point during its service life. The modular approach, it is argued, would permit a steady level of funding rather than the large spikes of funding involved with construction of a large building like CMRR-NF, making the funding profile more predictable for Congress and the Administration. Design and construction of each module would benefit from lessons learned from previous modules, reducing cost. Reducing MAR in PF-4 would extend that building's service life if future regulations were to reduce its permitted MAR, as was the case with CMR.", "While the modular building strategy is, at this point, only a concept, it is gathering steam. Preliminary design work, cost estimates, and schedule estimates are underway and, as noted, the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes this strategy. Nonetheless, several questions bear on its desirability:", "Is it needed? Could PF-4 plus RLUOB with regulatory relief produce 80 ppy and perform other plutonium tasks without the modules at acceptable risk levels? Would moving Pu-238 work to INL or SRS obviate the need for modules? Pu-238 accounts for 40% of MAR permitted for PF-4, and 8,000 sf of lab space. Would moving it out free enough MAR and space for PF-4, especially in conjunction with RLUOB, to do the added pit work needed to reach 80 ppy? Is there a need to move 70% of the MAR out of PF-4? Is it needed now? Future requirements for plutonium work might require added space. But NNSA projects that the TA-55 Reinvestment Project will extend the service life of PF-4 to 2039, for a total of 61 years, a projection not contingent on building modules. If RLUOB has a 50-year service life, it could remain operational until 2059. Can a decision on modules be delayed? While modules might save money by drawing on PF-4 infrastructure, they would be HC-2 buildings. As such, they would need their own ventilation, continuous power, fire suppression equipment, emergency access, and the like, all of which would be safety class and thus very expensive. What would the modules cost? NNSA has experienced delays and cost growth in many of its larger nuclear construction projects. The modular approach offers features that could help avoid these problems, such as a smaller scale, application of lessons learned from building previous modules, and construction of each module to accommodate only the purpose for which it is built. But the modules would be separate new facilities. Given NNSA's track record, can Congress have confidence that the modules would not encounter cost and schedule problems? Two arguments for modules are that they would make the funding profile more predictable and that modules could be built as needed. But if the schedule for module construction cannot be predicted, neither can the funding profile. Compared to modules, would it be faster and less costly to upgrade PF-4, use RLUOB for AC, and move Pu-238 out of PF-4? MAR limits in PF-4 are conservatively set. Mitigation measures, discussed next, would further increase the difference between the frequency of the DBE and the frequency of an accident resulting from that earthquake. Could MAR limits be raised without serious adverse potential consequences? Would that reduce the need to build modules as a way of reducing MAR in PF-4?"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Making RLUOB/PF-4 Options Safer and More Efficient", "paragraphs": ["Safety and efficiency are not static.

The key point is that the DBA sequence is not inevitable; a DBA would show many points at which the accident sequence could be interrupted.

If RLUOB is to be used for 1,000 g of WGPu, whether upgraded to an HC-3 building or not, it may prove desirable to strengthen it. This could be done in several ways; note that these measures could reduce the consequences as well as probability of building collapse.", "The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California has facilities built near the San Andreas Fault, so seismic resistance is a design consideration. Matthew Wrona, Director of the Facilities Division at SLAC, noted that most buildings typically are designed to resist vertical loads, as they must bear the gravity loads. An earthquake, however, imposes lateral (horizontal) loads as well as vertical loads, and seismic resistance requires resistance to both. Wrona pointed to several methods to strengthen an existing building to resist seismic loads:", "Strengthen connections between columns and (horizontal) beams, such as by using welded moment resisting connections, to increase lateral load resistance of the building. Install diagonal bracing in load bearing exterior and interior walls. Add steel plates to the inside or outside of a building to stiffen it against lateral loads. Use buttresses anchored to the ground and to the outside of the building. Buttresses would resist lateral loads. Strengthen floor diaphragms to distribute lateral loads to supporting walls. ", "SLAC has used several of these techniques to brace office buildings, as Figure 13 shows.", "As Figure 14 shows, buttresses have been used for many centuries to support buildings. Another strengthening method is base isolation technology, as shown in Figure 15 .", "A LANL structural engineer provided the following comment:", "Any number of techniques could be used to strengthen RLUOB to resist higher seismic forces. External bracing could be used, and the use of this technique at SLAC is a good example. Other possibilities may be to strengthen the internal steel-to-steel connections or the installation of internal shear walls and/or bracing. Base isolation has been applied to some structures to reduce the seismic loads that they would see during an earthquake. It might be applicable to RLUOB, either at the building foundation or at the junction between the concrete structure and the steel office structure above it. Another option may be to install internal dampers that absorb the energy of seismic motion that reduce structure displacements and accelerations which lead to reduced seismic loads. The point is that there are effective upgrades that could be implemented to improve seismic resistance. To choose the most effective set of upgrades, seismic/structural engineers need to complete a thorough analysis of the existing facility with an understanding of the performance required and using the appropriate ground motion in conjunction with applicable federal, state, and local seismic codes.", "NNSA has undertaken several projects to reduce the risk of building collapse for PF-4.

AC at present is performed much as it has been since the Cold War, as discussed in \" The Pit Production Process .\" Improved analytic instruments and improved understanding of plutonium and its impurities might permit reducing the number of samples. It may also be the case that these numbers reflect an excess of caution and an abundance of resources characteristic of the nuclear weapons program during the Cold War. Taking fewer samples per pit would reduce the sample prep workload in PF-4, the AC workload in RLUOB, and the workforce and floor space required in both buildings. Perform fewer analyses per sample. Sometimes multiple analyses are performed to reduce the risk of missing needed information in process control. Reducing redundant analyses should have similar benefits as reducing the number of samples per pit. Accept less precision of measurement. While an AC procedure that originated decades ago might require precision to within plus or minus 1%, precision to within plus or minus 5% or 10% might suffice. That could permit faster sample processing, reducing MAR per pit. In addition, relaxing the requirement would, in some cases, permit one analysis technique to perform several types of measurements, while more precise techniques might require a piece of equipment for each measurement type. Using fewer pieces of equipment would also free up floor space in PF-4 or RLUOB. Devise ways to reduce the time that various AC techniques require. Faster processing would reduce the number of hours that material is at risk for each pit, and would permit more work to be done in a given amount of floor space, perhaps with fewer workers, reducing aggregate worker exposure to radiation.

Congress could direct an independent organization to study the adverse consequences of using RLUOB for 1,000 g of WGPu as is, that is, with AC equipment installed but no steps to convert the building to HC-3. If it is determined that RLUOB as is would not provide adequate safety with 1,000 g WGPu, a related study could examine if there are additional steps short of full conversion to HC-3 that would provide adequate safety, and what they would cost.", "Study of having LLNL, SRS , or both perform some AC to support pit production : LLNL and SRS have infrastructure to perform AC to support pit production, though beyond some level of capacity they would need to upgrade equipment and hire additional staff. There would be benefit from dispersing AC expertise, capacity, and work to other sites in the nuclear weapons complex, but also benefit from concentrating them at LANL, the plutonium center of the nuclear weapons complex. It seems unlikely that a site other than LANL would perform all AC to support pit production. At issue: Should one or more sites other than LANL perform some AC to support pit production? If so, how much capacity should be dispersed to other sites? Which site or sites should be chosen? What would it cost to upgrade the site or sites for that capacity?

DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy prepared a study on this topic. However, that study did not consider the costs and benefits to the weapons program of moving Pu-238 out of PF-4; those costs and benefits might change the calculus of that move. Specifically, if moving Pu-238 to another site made a major contribution toward permitting production of 80 ppy without building new buildings, the value to the weapons program would be significant, and reducing MAR in PF-4 could help extend its service life. On the other hand, while DOE has estimated the cost of the INL or SRS options for Pu-238 to be several hundred million dollars, other costs would be involved, as well as temporary disruption of the Pu-238 program. Congress could direct NNSA to contract with an independent organization to study these costs and benefits.", "Study of cost implications of the regulatory system: A Radiological Facility is able to hold 38.6 g Pu-239E (26 g WGPu). As shown by RLUOB, such facilities can be affordable and can be built. In contrast, the history of the past quarter-century, as discussed in \" A Sisyphean History: Failed Efforts to Construct a Building to Restore Pit Production ,\" has been that a facility intended to hold more than 26 g WGPu has seen cost and schedule escalate to the point where it cannot be acquired. These efforts have resulted in the expenditure of billions of dollars with the net result of canceled programs, unusable buildings that had to be demolished, and continued operations in \"decrepit\" facilities. Congress could task NNSA to report on cost implications of the current regulatory system governing nuclear facilities, focusing on tradeoffs between cost and risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Long-term planning is difficult for all parties concerned . Delays and cost growth by NNSA on its major facilities reduce confidence in NNSA's cost and schedule projections, making it difficult for Congress and the Administration to budget for these facilities. NNSA sources say that congressional budgeting outside the regular budget process, such as sequesters and short-term continuing resolutions, and withdrawal of congressional support, such as the termination of MPF, make it difficult for NNSA to plan. Changes in Administration planning, such as the deferral of CMRR-NF, make it difficult for Congress and NNSA to plan.", "Long-term planning for pit production has proven particularly difficult . NNSA provides plans going out 10 to 20 years. However, these plans have often been stretched out, canceled, or modified substantially. Pit production at Rocky Flats Plant halted in 1989, yet LANL did not produce its first war reserve pits until 2007, NNSA has not needed to expand its small capacity, and there is still no plan for larger-scale pit production. Planning for MPF began in 2002, and Congress canceled it in 2005, followed by planning for CMRR, with the Nuclear Facility deferred \"for at least five years\" by the Administration in its FY2013 budget request. Similar delays have occurred with other nuclear weapons complex construction projects and with LEPs. While organizations need long-term plans as general guides to future plans, this history raises questions about the value of such planning.", "Requirements for pit production capacity have been fluid, reducing their credibility . The options studied for MPF in a 2003 EIS were between 125 and 450 ppy. Even if pits had a service life of 45 years, as was thought at the time, a 450-ppy capacity would support a stockpile of some 20,000 weapons, far more than the stockpile had. Then, the interim capacity at LANL was 10 ppy, with a goal of 30 ppy by 2021 and a requirement of 50-80 ppy by around 2030. Yet this latter requirement was not based on an analysis of weapons, targets, and scenarios, but on what NNSA estimated that Los Alamos could produce with PF-4 and CMRR-NF. Despite the deferral of CMRR-NF, and congressional authorization for NNSA to pursue a modular strategy as an alternative to that facility, the requirement for 50-80 ppy remains, and it is unclear if the number needed is 50 or 80. At the same time, steady increases in estimates of pit life, steady reductions in numbers of weapons, and the possibility of reusing pits from retired weapons may reduce the required capacity. As a consequence, it is hard to know what capacity is needed, and thus what new facilities or modifications to existing ones are needed.", "Differing time horizons between Congress and NNSA, and between political and technical imperatives, cause problems . Congress and the Administration, on the one hand, and DOE, NNSA, the labs, and the plants, on the other, work on very different timescales. It takes well over a decade, at best, for NNSA to bring a major nuclear facility project from initial approval to design, construction, and operation. In contrast, Congress and the Administration have changed course often on a plutonium strategy, sometimes from one year to the next. The more time from start to finish of a project, the more chance there is for intervening events to alter plans. Thus it would be to NNSA's advantage to drastically shorten the time from start to finish of a project. A construction cycle of a decade or more (or 24 years and counting in the case of a new plutonium facility) faces great difficulty when its funding hinges on a political cycle of one or a few years.", "For a successful plutonium strategy, Congress would find unacceptable management that allows costs to grow immensely, 10-fold in some cases, or that allows multi-year delays. At the same time, Congress and the Administration cannot expect a project to be completed in a couple of years. Analysis of alternatives, site surveys, compliance with NEPA requirements, planning, contracting, and construction typically take years.", "Thus, time is of the essence and delay is the enemy. This is a problem for Congress, the Administration, DOD, NNSA, the nuclear weapons complex, and the nation. Is there is a meeting-ground between the political and technical worlds? Can NNSA define the need for a major nuclear facility construction project, then quickly design it, comply with various federal, state, and local regulations, and build it? How could NNSA expedite the process? Can it avoid cost growth, delay, and mission creep? Conversely, once a project is defined, can Congress and the Administration commit to it on a longer-term basis?", "NNSA would need to gain the confidence of Congress in its ability to manage major construction projects. The capacity range studied for MPF implied the nominal ability to support a stockpile far larger than the then-current and likely future stockpile. CMRR-NF experienced a several-fold increase in estimated cost and years of schedule slippage. Failing to provide a realistic estimate of required capacity or to stay remotely close to cost and schedule estimates had consequences. Congress canceled MPF, and the Administration proposed to \"defer\" CMRR-NF for \"at least five years.\" And as noted in \" Two Other Failed Attempts ,\" two plutonium buildings were built, found to be unusable for their intended purpose, and were torn down. Congressional support for a modular strategy\u2014yet another change in plans\u2014increases the likelihood that the deferral of CMRR-NF will be a cancellation. Many believe that NNSA weakens its case for future projects when it releases estimates that are far in excess of a capacity that seems reasonable, or that are far below the ultimate cost and schedule, or when it changes its plans repeatedly.", "There are costs and risks to doing nothing . Time spent in planning and construction for new buildings to support pit production can reduce risk, for example by studying the impact of the facility on the environment, by studying the seismicity of the construction site, by designing the facility to meet requirements (such as for Hazard Category 2 or 3), and by incorporating measures in the design to reduce dose that individuals could receive from a major accident. However, if history is a guide, it could take many years before a new facility could become operational. Until then, whether the new facility is at Los Alamos or elsewhere, CMR must be used to provide AC support for pit production in PF-4. This entails multiple risks and costs:", "CMR is at high risk of collapse in the event of even a moderate earthquake. Collapse would kill many workers in the building. Pit production requires much more AC than PF-4 can accommodate. Collapse of CMR, without another building to conduct AC, would\u2014not could\u2014disrupt pit production until another facility for AC came on line, which could take years. Bringing another facility online on an emergency basis would probably cost more than doing so in an orderly manner, and shortcuts taken to expedite design, siting, and construction could increase the risk of problems down the road. CMR has a MAR of 9 kg of Pu-239E, and all the plutonium in that facility is considered at risk because no vault or container could be counted on to survive that building's collapse. Dispersal of some of that plutonium could place collocated workers and members of the public at risk. Depending on specifics of the collapse (wind direction, fire, form of plutonium, amount of plutonium escaping, etc.), dispersal of the plutonium could contaminate and force the closure of parts of the laboratory, possibly for months or years. That would disrupt laboratory operations, with operations affected at random based on which areas were contaminated. Cleanup of a large area contaminated by plutonium would be extremely costly and time-consuming. It would be a more effective use of those funds to avoid that problem by moving operations out of CMR as soon as possible.", "A facility can be safe without being compliant . As Appendix B shows, if RLUOB had 1 kg of WGPu, all of which was released in a DBA, the accident would result in doses well below DOE guidelines. Yet RLUOB would be in compliance with DOE regulations as a Radiological Facility only if it had less than 26 g of WGPu. As a corollary, there is a tradeoff between cost and regulatory compliance: Where is the point of diminishing returns?", "Should plutonium quantity in a building be limited by MAR or dose? The regulatory system defines a building's Hazard Category by MAR. An HC-3 building can hold between 38.6 grams and 2,610 grams of Pu-239E; a Radiological Facility can hold up to 38.6 grams. The objective is safety; however, MAR is a surrogate for safety. It is simple for regulators to measure MAR. In contrast, determining dose to a collocated worker or a maximally-exposed offsite individual requires a complex analysis for each building, taking into account such factors as details of construction, measures taken to increase seismic robustness and fire suppression, and assumptions on the amount of plutonium that would be lofted into the air in an earthquake, wind speed, and wind direction. Yet it is dose, not MAR, that determines whether an individual is safe, and as shown in Appendix B , even with MAR of 2,610 g Pu-239E (1,750 g of WGPu) for RLUOB, the maximum permitted in an HC-3 building, dose to those individuals would be far below DOE guidelines.", "Weapons and infrastructure constrain policy and strategy . Logically, these four elements should be linked, and policy and strategy should drive weapons and infrastructure. But given cancellations, multi-year schedule slippages, and major cost growth for LEPs and infrastructure facilities, even if strategy calls for having certain numbers of a certain weapon by a certain year, if an LEP is delayed by cost growth or infrastructure delays, it is the strategy that adapts.", "The political system is more flexible than the regulatory system . Regulators are bound by statutes, regulations, orders, and standards, and can only determine if a plan complies with these rules without regard to cost. Standards define acceptable risk: a Radiological Facility must have less than 38.6 grams of Pu-239E; a Security Category IV facility can have up to 200 grams of pure plutonium; the DOE guideline is for an MOI to receive a dose of no more than 25 rem over 2 hours. But this system is inflexible. It does not have a way of trading risk (and the benefit of reducing it) against cost (and the benefit of reducing it). As a result, it may force the expenditure of years, and many millions of dollars, to further minimize an already-minimal risk. In order to inject cost-benefit calculations into recommendations by DNFSB, Section 3202 of H.R. 1960 , the FY2014 defense authorization bill as passed by the House, required DNFSB to provide an analysis of the costs and benefits of its recommendations if requested to do so by the Secretary of Energy; in such instances, the Secretary would also be required to conduct a similar analysis. This provision, however, was not included in the final legislation, P.L. 113-66 .", "Even so, while the regulator can present costs and benefits, only the political system has the authority, ability, and culture to decide which tradeoffs are worth making, and to offer regulatory relief. For example, political decisions could make the difference between whether or not a RLUOB/PF-4 option is feasible. If the DOE hazard categorization standard is applied, so that RLUOB could hold only 26 grams of WGPu, then RLUOB could provide very limited AC support for pit production. If it were upgraded, the regulatory system could determine only if the upgrades would meet HC-3 requirements. In contrast, the political system could judge whether certain upgrades would reduce the risk to an MOI enough, with \"enough\" a matter of political judgment, and if the reduction in risk from these upgrades was worth the cost. The political system could also decide if the risk was acceptable without upgrades.", "There are several potential paths forward: Several options discussed in this report have the potential to produce 80 ppy, resolve the Pu-238 issue, and permit other plutonium activities, all at relatively modest cost, in a relatively short time, with no new buildings, and with minimal environmental impact.

The distance from RLUOB to MOI is assumed to be 1200 meters. A Collocated Worker is an onsite worker 100 meters from the building. Dose is calculated by multiplying the factors in this table. The calculation is specific to RLUOB; values for some factors would differ for other buildings. The calculation assumes a worst-case accident, that is, an earthquake that collapses the building, causing plutonium-containing material to spill out of containers, followed by a fire that aerosolizes the plutonium.", "The factors are as follows:", "Material At Risk (MAR): The amount of material, in this case plutonium, acted upon by an event. It is measured in units of grams of plutonium-239 equivalent (g Pu-239E), a standard used to compare the radioactivity of diverse materials. Table B-1 assumes a MAR of 500 g Pu-239E; Table B-2 uses several values of MAR.", "Damage Ratio (DR): The amount of damage to the structure, with 0 being no damage and 1 being complete collapse. The calculation uses a value of 1, that is, complete collapse of RLUOB, the worst case.", "Airborne Release Fraction (ARF): The fraction of Material At Risk released into the air as a result of the event. ARF is specific to the type of material (e.g., plutonium oxide, plutonium metal, plutonium in solution). The material in this accident is assumed to be 90% liquid (plutonium in solution) and 10% waste (such as rags with plutonium oxide particles).", "The value for ARF used in the calculation is 0.002, so this one value reduces dose by a factor of 500. Thus the dose resulting from an earthquake that collapsed RLUOB with 1,000g WGPu could be much higher than shown in Table B-1 if that value is in error. A DOE handbook shows that the factor 2E-3 (i.e., 0.002) is for airborne droplets containing plutonium oxide rather than for solid plutonium oxide particles that result from the aqueous solution containing plutonium having boiled away. \u00a0 In response to a question on the validity of using that figure in Table B-1 , Los Alamos stated:\u00a0 \"the ARFs and RFs are almost always VERY conservative. In most of the experiments the average value was about 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than the value recommended for use in Safety Analysis. So, no there is not a problem. It really more goes the other way.

Instead, it is composed mainly of that isotope as well as small amounts of other plutonium isotopes, some of which are more radioactive than Pu-239. The ratio of Pu-239 to other plutonium isotopes varies slightly from one batch to another, and the ratio changes over time as plutonium undergoes radioactive decay, with each isotope having a different rate of decay. It is useful to convert all radioactive material in a building to a single unit, in this case g Pu-239E, to facilitate compliance with MAR limits. Given the isotopic variance inherent in WGPu, no single factor can precisely convert g WGPu to g Pu-239E for all batches of WGPu.

Comparison of Seismic Resiliency of CMR and RLUOB", "Structural engineers strive to make buildings safe against possible earthquake ground motion. The model building codes are constantly evolving and incorporate lessons learned from the response of buildings in real earthquakes. Prior to the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, the model building codes had very few seismic requirements. This earthquake led to new requirements being added to codes. Another big change in design codes came after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, which showed that reinforced concrete buildings with certain characteristics were prone to collapse in large earthquakes. Since that time, the codes have implemented much stricter rules for the design of both steel and reinforced-concrete buildings.

In fact, it is a \"non-ductile reinforced concrete moment frame\"\u2014the very type of structure that the 1971 San Fernando earthquake proved to be vulnerable to collapse in earthquakes. LANL estimates that it is vulnerable to collapse in an earthquake expected to strike with a frequency of once in 167 years to once in 500 years. ", "While RLUOB, as a Radiological Facility, could have been built of light-duty design and materials because it was to have only about 6 grams of WGPu, NNSA decided to build it to a much higher standard in order to understand issues that could be encountered in building CMRR-NF. Specifically, RLUOB was designed and built to the 2003 Edition of the International Building Code supplemented to meet the requirements for seismic Performance Category 2 as provided in DOE Standard 1020-2002, that is, able to withstand ground motions associated with an earthquake expected to strike with a frequency of once in 2,500 years. It has a special reinforced concrete structure for the basement, first (laboratory), and second (office) floors. The third and fourth floors, which are also for offices, are constructed of steel framing designed to the standards of an emergency response building (e.g., a hospital or fire station), so they are more seismically robust than a typical office building. As a result, RLUOB is much sturdier than it needed to be.", "Based on LANL's models of seismic performance, collapsing RLUOB would take an earthquake with 4 to 12 times more force than an earthquake that would collapse CMR. Its better performance is largely the result of being able to dissipate energy through bending deformations in its steel frame. This energy absorption is key in seismic design. Brittle structures, such as CMR, cannot dissipate energy and are hence more susceptible to collapse when the ground motions exceed the building's design basis. In addition, the earthquake risk in the Los Alamos area is much better known today than it was when CMR was constructed. For example, it is now known that there is a seismic fault directly under CMR but not under RLUOB. Designing RLUOB with a more accurate understanding of the seismic characteristics of the underlying geology increases the ability of that building to withstand potential ground motion.", "Appendix F. Space Requirements for Analytical Chemistry to Support Production of 80 Pits Per Year", "LANL has never analyzed the space requirements for AC to support 80 ppy. However, in 2007 it analyzed the AC capacity of CMRR-NF plus RLUOB, and found that they could, together, support AC for 40-50 ppy. In the original plan for building both RLUOB and CMRR NF, there was to be a total of 16,500 square feet (sf) of laboratory space devoted to AC (see table below). If RLUOB were allowed to hold 1,000 g WGPu and CMRR-NF were to remain deferred, the amount of space for AC in RLUOB would exceed that value without incurring the operational penalty of having to use gloveboxes in PF-4 to the extent that would otherwise be required.", "Regarding the latter point, a few types of AC can be done in gloveboxes. For example, sample management, which involves cutting pieces of plutonium from a larger sample, and analysis that uses solid samples on the order of 1 to 5 g of plutonium, can be done in gloveboxes because they do not require fine manipulation. In contrast, most AC uses samples of a few drops of liquid with milligram (or smaller) quantities of plutonium; such samples require fine manipulation, which is much easier to do in hoods. Performing AC tasks of the latter type in gloveboxes exacts a penalty in the time required to do the analysis, which slows throughput and thereby reduces capacity.", "By performing AC tasks best suited for hoods in RLUOB and AC tasks that can be performed in gloveboxes in PF-4, by studying how to maximize efficient use of space for AC, and perhaps by using two shifts per day instead of one, it seems likely that a configuration of PF-4 plus RLUOB with 1,000 g WGPu would have the space both to fabricate 80 ppy and to provide the AC necessary to support that level of production. A detailed analysis would be needed to reach this conclusion with confidence. ", "Appendix G. Abbreviations"], "subsections": []}]}}
