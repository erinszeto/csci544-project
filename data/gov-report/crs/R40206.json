Congress first authorized this program in 2002, and made significant changes to it in the 2009 economic stimulus package (P.L. 111-5). The 2009 revisions were aimed at making it easier for farmers and fishermen to qualify for program benefits, and provided over $200 million in funding through December 2010. Subsequently, P.L. 112-40 (enacted in October 2011) authorized $202.5 million through December 2013, but no new program activity has occurred since December 2010 for lack of appropriated funds. In June 2015, Congress passed H.R. 1295, the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, authorizing TAAF through FY2021, and the President signed the bill into law on June 29, 2015, as P.L. 114-27. Any program activity would still be contingent on the appropriation of funds.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is required to follow a two-step process in administering TAAF. First, a group of producers must be certified eligible to apply. Second, a producer in a certified group must meet specified requirements to be approved for benefits.", "To be certified, a group must show that imports were a significant cause for at least a 15% decline in one of three factors: the price of the commodity, the quantity of the commodity produced, or the production value of the commodity. Once a producer group is certified, an individual producer within that group must meet three requirements to be approved for program benefits. These include technical assistance with a training component, and financial assistance. A producer must show that (1) the commodity was produced in the current year and also in one of the previous three years; (2) the quantity of the commodity produced decreased compared to that in a previous year, or the price received for the commodity decreased compared to a preceding three-year average price; and (3) no benefits were received under any other trade adjustment assistance program. The training component is intended to help the producer become more competitive in producing the same or another commodity. Financial assistance is to be used to develop and implement a business adjustment plan designed to address the impact of import competition.", "From 2009 to 2011, USDA certified 10 of 30 petitions filed by producers of 5 commodity groups\u2014shrimp, catfish, asparagus, lobster, and wild blueberries. USDA approved TAAF benefits for about 4,500 individual producers in FY2010, and for about 5,700 producers in FY2011.", "In a 2012 audit of TAAF, the Government Accountability Office recommended that USDA require spouses who apply for assistance to submit documentation on how they contribute to producing a commodity, take steps to ensure that the program's financial assistance component is used for intended purposes, and adopt a longer-term approach to evaluate its effectiveness. A 2013 audit by USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) identified several shortcomings in administering the program, including determining eligibility and providing effective oversight.", "The 2015 reauthorization of TAAF programs follows directly in the wake of the enactment of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation (P.L. 114-26) that President Obama had requested of Congress to facilitate the conclusion of regional free trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with 11 other Pacific-facing nations. Under P.L. 114-27, TAAF is authorized to receive $90 million annually for FY2015 through FY2021, subject to annual appropriations.

The report described the existing trade adjustment assistance (TAA) programs that provided (1) limited technical assistance to help business firms (including some that produced agricultural and food products) regain economic competitiveness or to shift into producing other goods, and (2) training assistance to workers (including those employed by some agricultural firms) to facilitate their transition into other occupations. It noted that the provision of direct financial assistance (such as income supplements) to farmers, or efforts to financially enable them to continue producing the commodity adversely affected by imports rather than help them adjust to employment in other sectors, would be inconsistent with the objectives of the then-existing TAA programs.", "Observers stated that farmers and ranchers typically did not qualify for the TAA workers program because they were self-employed (and thus rarely were eligible for unemployment benefits) and were less likely to want to be retrained for a new occupation (particularly if earning income from producing other crops or from non-farm sources). Others pointed out that agricultural producers who are most likely to be affected by import surges are those producing a commodity that receives little or no price protection and does not receive direct payments under traditional farm subsidy programs. Frequently cited at the time was the impact of increased competition that U.S. fruit and vegetable growers, as well as livestock producers, have encountered due to imports from Mexico and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of TAAF Program", "paragraphs": ["The Trade Act of 2002 established a new Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers program by amending the Trade Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-618 ). The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is the lead administrative agency for the TAAF program, with responsibility for certifying eligible commodities and producer groups. USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) has responsibility for processing and approving individual applications for assistance under TAAF, and for disbursing cash payments to eligible producers. A third USDA agency, the National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), provides training and technical assistance to producers who are approved for TAAF benefits. As amended by the enacted 2009 economic stimulus package ( P.L. 111-5 , Division B, Subtitle I), the program assists agricultural producers who have been adversely affected by competition from imports of a commodity that they produce. An \"agricultural commodity producer\" is defined as a \"person that shares in the risk of producing an agricultural commodity and that is entitled to a share of the commodity for marketing, including an operator, a sharecropper, or a person that owns or rents the land on which the commodity is produced,\" or a person who reports a gain or loss on a federal income tax return from \"the trade or business of fishing.\" Support is available in the form of enhanced technical assistance and seed money to enable a producer to formulate and implement a business adjustment plan. Producers of raw and natural agricultural commodities (crops, livestock, farm-raised aquatic products, and wild-caught seafood that competes with aquaculture products) and of \"any class of goods within an agricultural commodity\" must follow a two-part process to receive benefits.", "First, a producer group must be certified by USDA as eligible to apply for program benefits (see \" Requirements for a Commodity Group to Be Certified \").

In making a determination, the Secretary must compare the volume of imports of \"articles like or directly competitive with the agricultural commodity\" produced by the group in the marketing year in which the petition is filed, to the average volume of imports in the three preceding marketing years. The addition of two other qualifying factors\u2014\"quantity of production\" and \"value of production/cash receipts\"\u2014besides price gives the Secretary greater flexibility in determining if a commodity group is eligible to access program benefits.

Such assistance is to include information on what steps could be taken to improve the yield and marketing of that commodity, and on exploring the feasibility and desirability of substituting one or more alternative commodities for the one being produced. USDA can provide supplemental assistance to cover reasonable transportation and subsistence expenses that a producer incurs in accessing initial technical assistance if provided in a location outside a normal commuting distance.", "A producer who completes this initial phase is eligible to participate in intensive technical assistance. This includes training courses to assist the producer in improving the competitiveness of the same commodity or an alternative commodity, and financial assistance to develop an initial business plan based on the courses completed. USDA is required to approve a producer's initial business plan if it reflects the skills gained by the producer through the courses taken. Further, this plan must demonstrate how the producer will apply these skills to his circumstances. If the plan is approved, the producer is entitled to not more than $4,000 to implement this plan, or to develop a long-term business adjustment plan.", "A producer who completes the intensive phase and whose initial business plan has been approved is then eligible for assistance to develop a long-term business adjustment plan. USDA is required to approve this adjustment plan if it includes steps calculated to materially contribute to the producer's economic adjustment to changing market conditions, takes into account the interests of the workers employed by the producer, and demonstrates that the producer will have sufficient resources to implement the business plan.

Under Section 223 of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-40 ), Congress authorized $90 million in each of FY2012 and FY2013, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of FY2014 (i.e., October through December 2013). This provision, unlike those in the 2002 and 2009 authorizations, did not appropriate any funds.

GAO discovered that the 2009 changes in the criteria used to determine whether a commodity can be certified were a factor leading to four of the five commodity certifications. For example, FAS under the pre-2009 criteria would not likely have been able to certify asparagus or shrimp solely on the basis of a decline in price.

This would address instances where USDA may have approved the applications of spouses who did not engage in producing a certified commodity, and thus had no assurance that TAAF assistance was appropriately targeted to intended recipients. Take steps to help ensure that any financial assistance payments made to producers are used for intended purposes (e.g., by requiring them to detail in their business plans how they plan to use these funds). This would address the acknowledgement made by USDA officials that some producers likely use the payments for unrelated expenses. Broaden the program's evaluation approach to help ensure that USDA can comprehensively evaluate the impact of the TAAF program on producers' competitiveness. GAO noted that the performance measures and surveys used by USDA do not measure quantifiable outcomes or cover all key areas of the program. To illustrate, conducting a final survey 6-12 months after producers complete the program does not allow for gathering insights into their perceptions of TAAF's long-term effectiveness. Also, USDA has not corroborated the results of surveys to help isolate the program's impact from other influences.", "USDA commented that it generally agrees with these recommendations, and that if a future TAAF program retains the same statutory requirements, it will consider specific ways to address them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA OIG Audit Called for Improved Oversight", "paragraphs": ["In an audit report of TAAF dated October 2013, the USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) identified a number of shortcomings in the administration of the TAAF program.

More specifically, the audit sought to determine whether (1) TAAF program recipients were eligible for program participation; (2) funds were properly obligated, distributed in a timely fashion, and accurately calculated; (3) program reporting requirements were met; and (4) oversight was sufficient to ensure that TAAF was administered in an accountable and equitable manner. A sampling methodology was developed to carry out this task. In brief, the OIG found the agencies did not have the appropriate controls in place to ensure that TAAF program participants were eligible, that payments were accurate, or that oversight was sufficient. The audit made a number of recommendations that follow from four key findings below. Agency responses to the findings and recommendations advanced by OIG are included in the audit report.", "1. At the end of FY2009, FAS did not return unobligated TAAF program funds to the Department of the Treasury, nor did it provide evidence to show that all remaining funds were needed to meet future financial obligations. 2. FAS did not sufficiently analyze the documentation submitted by producer groups in support of their request for price pre-certification approvals for their commodities under a streamlining procedure. As a consequence, FAS applied the pre-price certification approvals in an overly broad manner, with the result that two of five such approvals that OIG examined did not meet the criteria established for approval. 3. Although FAS was the lead agency with oversight responsibility for the TAAF program, the agency failed to effectively monitor, or conduct reviews of, the two other agencies' day-to-day administration of the program, with the result that OIG identified 85 ineligible producers who participated in the TAAF program and who received approximately $284,000 in program benefits to which they were not entitled. 4.
