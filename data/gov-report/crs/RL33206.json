Disruption of concentrated infrastructure could have greatly disproportionate effects, with costs potentially running into billions of dollars and spreading far beyond the immediate area of disturbance. Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Ivan in 2008, have demonstrated this kind of geographic vulnerability by disrupting much of the U.S. energy and chemical sectors.", "Congress has been examining federal policies related to the geographic concentration and vulnerability of critical infrastructure.

Some federal policies have been developed specifically to address perceived threats to critical infrastructure. These influences often have been in place for decades, gradually driving critical infrastructure to its geographic configuration today.", "Some analysts may argue that little government intervention is necessary to alleviate geographic vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure because the private sector will adjust its practices out of its own financial interest. However, if Congress concludes that federal intervention is needed, it may employ a number of policy options to encourage geographic dispersion (including eliminating policies that encourage concentration ), ensure survivability, or ensure that effective infrastructure recovery capabilities are in place to mitigate impacts of concentrated infrastructure disruption. Addressing geographic vulnerabilities may call for a combination of options. Congress may also consider whether other legislative proposals with the potential to affect critical infrastructure development\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014are likely to relieve or exacerbate geographic vulnerability.

Accordingly, Congress has a strong interest in the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to natural hazards, accidents, or terrorism. Since September 11, 2001, legislators, government agencies, and industry increasingly have been focused on the sources of infrastructure vulnerability and potential measures to address those vulnerabilities through operational changes and capital investment.", "When infrastructure is physically concentrated in a limited geographic area it may be particularly vulnerable to geographic hazards such as natural disasters, epidemics, and certain kinds of terrorist attacks. Whereas a typical geographic disruption is often expected to affect infrastructure in proportion to the size of an affected region, a disruption of concentrated infrastructure could have greatly disproportionate\u2014and national\u2014effects. A catastrophic ice storm in metropolitan Chicago, for example, would undoubtedly create local emergencies, but could also temporarily disrupt rail transportation and associated commerce throughout the country because Chicago is a major railway hub. Extended closure of the port of Long Beach, the largest port in the nation, would greatly harm California's economy, but could also disrupt vital supply chains for a number of national industries. The social and economic impacts of geographic disasters are often difficult to quantify, but their costs can quickly run into the billions and can spread far beyond the area of the event itself. In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated this kind of geographic impact by disrupting a substantial part of the national U.S. energy and chemical sectors, both heavily concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike have caused similar disruptions, renewing concerns about geographic vulnerability.", "As the nation's responses to recent natural disasters continue, and as its homeland security activities evolve, Congress has been examining federal policies related to the geographic concentration and vulnerability of critical infrastructure.

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ( P.L. 107-56 Section 1016e) contains the federal government's most recent definition of \"critical infrastructure.\" According to the act, \"critical infrastructure\" is", "systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters (Section 1016e).", "This definition was adopted, by reference, in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 , Section 2.4) establishing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Alternatively, the collection of regional assets could make up an infrastructure hub, accounting for a nationally significant fraction of commodity or service flows through that infrastructure sector or subsector. The threshold above which such assets could be considered \"nationally\" concentrated would depend upon the type of impact resulting from a prolonged disruption. From strictly a market perspective, for example, some policy makers have suggested that a change in energy infrastructure capacity of as little as 10% to 15% could have an exaggerated effect on related market prices. The corporate merger guidelines used by the United States, Canada, and the European Union variously assume that a company must have a 25% to 35% market share to exercise market power, and so uncompetitively influence market prices or supplies. Although the loss of critical infrastructure would have effects beyond market price, other possible metrics of concentration (e.g., environmental) offer little additional clarity on concentration thresholds.", "Many of the critical infrastructure sectors identified in the NIPP exhibit some degree of geographic concentration, as illustrated by the following examples.", "Chemicals (chlorine)\u2014Over 38% of U.S. chlorine production is located in coastal Louisiana.

These locations are generally far from Northeastern urban centers which are the primary locations of oil and gas demand. Consequently, large oil and gas pipelines tend to be concentrated between these widely separated resource regions and the Northeast, as shown in Figure 1 . Likewise, production of phosphoric acid, a key component of agricultural fertilizer, is concentrated in Florida, which has the nation's largest deposits of phosphoric rock. Agricultural production is also driven by geography, since particular crops require particular climates, weather conditions, and types of soil. Terrain may also be a driver of infrastructure concentration. There are relatively few natural harbors suitable as deepwater ports in the western United States compared to the eastern part of the country. Consequently, the ports that exist, such as Long Beach, have become very heavily utilized.

The concentration of semiconductor manufacturing in Silicon Valley illustrates such economies. Silicon Valley emerged near major research institutions (e.g., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), with the ready availability of highly skilled graduates from leading research universities (e.g., U.C. Berkeley, Stanford University), and with access to both product suppliers, computer manufacturers (e.g., Apple Computer), and software companies.

This observation led to larger pipes having lower unit costs.", "In addition to pipelines, researchers have identified scale economies across many critical infrastructure sectors. The size of new chemical plants, for example, increased by a factor of five between the late 1950s and early 1980s, in part due to scale economies. Some analysts likewise suggest that the concentration of shipping container traffic among several U.S. \"megaports\" is partly due to economies of scale in warehousing and terminal operations.

Since 2000, developers have proposed the construction of over 70 new LNG terminals in U.S. ports or U.S. waters, many near major natural gas markets in California and the Northeast. But most near-to-market terminal proposals have struggled for approval due to community concerns about LNG safety, effects on local commerce, and other potential negative impacts. Due primarily to local community opposition, LNG developers have withdrawn terminal proposals in Alabama, California, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Florida. Other terminal proposals in Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey are facing stiff community opposition. In some cases state and local agencies also have been at odds with federal agencies over LNG terminal siting jurisdiction. Communities in only a few states, notably Louisiana and Texas, have encouraged the siting of new LNG facilities.

Since most U.S. critical infrastructure is in the private sector, capital efficiency has long influenced how and where private companies have invested in infrastructure capacity. Attention to capital efficiency sharply increased in the 1990s, however, as financial markets grew dissatisfied with other measures of company performance such as simple revenue growth. This attention, in turn, led a range of capital-intensive infrastructure companies, such as electric utilities, telecommunications providers, pipelines, and other industrial companies, to sharply reduce annual capital requirements from historical levels. Economic deregulation of the energy, telecommunications, and transportation industries, among others, accelerated this trend.", "In some cases companies reduced capital requirements by cutting \"excess\" infrastructure capacity\u2014reducing reserve capacity in capital equipment or reducing inventories of production supplies (\"just-in-time\" inventory). For example, power generation capacity margins for the U.S. electric utility industry as a whole fell by almost 40% between 1992 and 2000. There has been a similar reduction in excess capacity among other critical infrastructures, many of which now operate near or at capacity. Oil refineries, for example, have seen capacity utilization rise from below 77% in 1985 to 89% in 2005.

For example, the federal government sited and constructed the Panama Canal in the early 1900s, encouraging a concentration of military and commercial shipping through the new waterway which persists today. (The canal carried over a third of U.S. grain exports in 2006.) In the Pacific Northwest, dams constructed or operated by federal agencies on the Columbia River system account for 28% of U.S. hydroelectric generation capacity. In other cases, prescriptive federal siting has dispersed critical infrastructure. In the early 1940s, for example, the federal government financed and sited a major steel plant in Utah, far from existing U.S. steel plants and steel markets. A key reason for siting the plant (viewed as critical for shipbuilding during World War II) in Utah was \"as a precaution against steel shortages in the West in case of a Pacific coast invasion or closure of the Panama Canal.\" A more current example is the U.S. Postal Service, which routes no more than 1.3% of all mail through any single processing and distribution center.", "Although the federal government prescriptively sites its own infrastructure, it is difficult to find examples of federal prescriptive siting of private sector infrastructure. One way the government has done so, however, is through its control of federal lands and other federal assets necessary for infrastructure development. For example, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973 ( P.L. 93-153 ) directed the Secretary of the Interior to authorize a right-of-way for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipelines System (TAPS) through federal lands in Alaska. The construction of TAPS physically diversified U.S. oil supplies, although it initiated a new geographic concentration of critical infrastructure in Alaska. TAPS transports nearly 17% of United States domestic oil production. More recently, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ) directs federal agencies to designate \"energy corridors\" on federal lands in 11 western states for the siting of new oil, gas, and hydrogen pipelines and electricity transmission facilities (Section 368).

The construction of the transcontinental railroad and telegraph is an historic example of such a policy. Under the Pacific Railway Act of 1862, the Congress provided private companies with 30-year bonds, federal land grants, and other incentives to construct a rail and telegraph line along a specified route from Nebraska to the Pacific coast. The federal government continues to offer such financial incentives for critical infrastructure projects today. For example, in 2004 Congress passed the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act ( P.L. 108-324 , Div. C) offering an $18 billion loan guarantee, accelerated depreciation, and investment tax credits to private developers for the construction of a new natural gas pipeline similar to the existing Trans-Alaska oil pipeline.

State coastal management plans implemented under the CZMA may affect the geographic concentration of infrastructure by encouraging or discouraging the siting of coastal infrastructure. Research has shown, for example, that one third of states with coastal management plans under CZMA appear to have adopted policies seeking to confine the physical expansion of ports to areas already committed to port and industrial uses. Energy industry representatives have argued that state plans under CZMA have also been used to block the development of new energy infrastructure in many parts of the country.", "The Clean Air Act of 1970 (CAA, P.L. 91-604) created a national program to mitigate the harmful effects of air pollution by regulating pollution sources. Among other provisions, the CAA requires that new facilities emitting certain air pollutants install best available control technology as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency. New facilities being sited in counties not in attainment of federal air quality standards may have more stringent\u2014and potentially more costly\u2014emissions control requirements than facilities sited in counties that are in attainment of those standards, depending upon a state determination of the lowest emission rate available and the need to acquire emissions offsets. By affecting facility costs in this way, some analysts argue that the CAA encourages the concentration of infrastructure in geographic \"pollution havens,\" or, alternatively, encourages the dispersion of facilities away from existing infrastructure in polluted regions. One empirical study in New York, for example, suggests that air quality regulations have significantly affected the destination choices of relocating manufacturing plants. Because facility siting decisions are complex, however, other empirical studies of CAA effects on siting concentration, specifically, have been less conclusive.", "While the environmental regulations under the CZMA and CAA apply generally to many regions in the United States, some federal environmental policies have been directed at more specific geographic areas. Congressional moratoria on oil and natural gas development in specific parts of the outer continental shelf (due to concerns about local economic and environmental impacts) are one example of such federal policy.

Under the Federal Power Act of 1935 (FPA), for example, retail electricity sales and generation investments of investor-owned electric utilities are regulated by the states. State regulators have historically required utilities to meet state electric generation needs by constructing in-state plants, or by jointly constructing plants with neighboring utilities. Consequently, privately-owned electric power plants have been geographically dispersed among the 50 states. The largest shares of U.S. generating capacity in individual states are 10% in Texas and 6% in California. By contrast, the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) had plans in the 1960s to construct 17 nuclear power reactors at seven sites. Although TVA only completed six reactors due to changes in the energy market and nuclear safety regulation, its original plans would have created a nationally significant concentration of nuclear generating capacity within TVA's territory. It is interesting to note that the recent restructuring of the electric utility industry, which exempts new generation plants from state economic regulation, appears to be encouraging the geographic concentration of new generating plants near certain transmission corridors because plant developers are no longer constrained by state regulators in their site selection."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Policy Options to Reduce Infrastructure Vulnerability", "paragraphs": ["Since helping to reduce the overall vulnerability of critical infrastructure is an objective of the federal government, it is useful to outline what options, if any, may be considered to reduce vulnerabilities and potential national consequences arising specifically from the geographic concentration of such infrastructure.", "Some analysts may argue that little government intervention in infrastructure concentration is necessary because the private sector will appropriately adjust its infrastructure practices out of its own financial interest.

In the case of the economic deregulation, for example, geographic concentration often provides the consumer cost reductions and service improvements that deregulation was intended to achieve. In the case of environmental laws, concentration is often viewed as a desirable means of preserving undisturbed natural areas from destructive development. Would the CZMA be able to fulfill its fundamental balance of environmental protection and economic development if states were not free to concentrate infrastructure where they choose to? The resolution of such policy questions would require a careful and complex reconsideration of long-standing policy objectives in light of evolving concerns about critical infrastructure risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Encouraging Geographic Dispersion", "paragraphs": ["Another remedy for geographic vulnerability is to encourage the geographic dispersion of concentrated assets where such dispersion is possible. As discussed in this report, the federal government may implement a range of targeted policies, including prescriptive siting, economic incentives, and regulation, to help bring about infrastructure dispersion. Such dispersion could involve the development of new infrastructure capacity or the shifting of critical goods and services among existing infrastructure. Some transportation analysts, for example, have proposed shipping containers through Mexican ports and then on to the United States by rail as a means of reducing cargo traffic in Southern California's ports. Shifting concentrations of critical supplies and services to alternative infrastructure already in place (and not itself concentrated) may be one way to alleviate geographical vulnerabilities relatively quickly. If the alternative infrastructure lies outside the United States, however, such a strategy may create new vulnerabilities since it might no longer be under U.S. protection or administration.", "While encouraging infrastructure dispersion through federal policy may be helpful, doing so may be challenging. It may be difficult, for example, to identify and prioritize geographic infrastructure concentrations amenable to such dispersion. Predicting the long-term effects of such polices on market economics, especially the effects on market competition, may also be uncertain. If incentives are involved, dispersion policies may also be costly to the federal government, potentially drawing resources away from other federal programs. Furthermore, since infrastructure development is mostly in private and regional government (state and local) hands, ensuring that regional infrastructure projects are consistent with federal objectives may also be a problem. As the Congressional Budget Office has stated,", "The federal government's most important role in infrastructure provision is as a source of finance.... Thus, for infrastructure to be managed in a way that furthers national objectives, federal agencies must offer incentives for local managers to align their choices with the welfare and equity goals of federal programs. Choices for infrastructure systems that aim at such broad objectives must similarly be based on wide searches among new investments, rehabilitation efforts, or operational changes. They must also be derived from consistent evaluations of the long-term effects of these possible choices on the efficiency of activities using the infrastructure.", "Infrastructure owners and regional governments are also likely to have vested interests in existing concentrations of critical infrastructure and may oppose dispersion on competitive or other economic grounds. State and local governments may also have concerns about federalism, particularly where federal policies affecting infrastructure dispersion may supercede local infrastructure priorities.", "Notwithstanding the challenges of promoting infrastructure dispersion, Congress appears to be pursuing such policies with respect to the siting of new energy infrastructure, including LNG import terminals, oil refineries, electric transmission lines, and an Alaska gas pipeline. Even where such federal policies may be implemented successfully, however, it may still take years or decades to achieve dispersion objectives because critical infrastructure often develops slowly. For example, industry experts project that it would take five to seven years, absent community opposition, to construct a new U.S. oil refinery. It would take at least nine years to build the Alaska natural gas pipeline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring Infrastructure Survivability", "paragraphs": ["For geographic concentrations of critical infrastructure that are difficult to diversify, or that may take a long time to diversify, Congress may wish to ensure their near-term ability to function, or \"survivability,\" during and after a major geographic disaster. Particularly where resource location provides few geographic alternatives (as in the case of ports) reducing vulnerability through infrastructure protection may be effective. Such an approach would broadly align with the President's existing strategy for protecting critical infrastructure from terrorist attack as stated in the NIPP, although it would incorporate explicitly geographic vulnerabilities. In the context of the NIPP or other emergency management programs, geographic vulnerability could be viewed as a distinctive type of infrastructure vulnerability and therefore considered in federally mandated risk assessments.", "Increasing standards for design, construction, and operation, and retrofitting existing infrastructure to higher standards may also enhance infrastructure survivability. While there are numerous industry and government building standards for protection from earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods in regions where such hazards exist, such standards may not account for the critical nature of certain types of assets. In particular, the degree of general survivability these standards impose on critical assets may not appropriately reflect the economic and social costs that might arise should such an asset fail. Federal authority to change such standards may be limited, however, if they fall primarily under state or local jurisdiction.", "A principal challenge to alleviating geographic infrastructure vulnerabilities is incorporating the geographic dimension appropriately into the broader infrastructure risk management and decision-making process. One key question is whether survivability measures in place to protect against a facility-specific event would be effective against a regional event. Backup supply networks, redundant control centers, and other systems intended to \"harden\" infrastructure may themselves be subject to disruption from a geographic hazard. Although history does provide some guidance as to the likelihood of disruptive natural events and their potential effects, quantifying such geographic vulnerabilities in a way that allows comparison to a broader set of vulnerabilities may be analytically complex. Predicting the likelihood of future terrorist attacks, for which history provides little guidance, adds considerable uncertainty. Attempting to allocate limited public resources for critical infrastructure survivability based on geographic considerations may also be challenging. In particular, it could complicate the use of quantitative, risk-based formulas to distribute federal support for critical infrastructure protection. Increasing the private costs of infrastructure through new construction standards to improve survivability could also be controversial."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring Infrastructure Recovery Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["In addition to policies promoting geographic dispersion and survivability, Congress may consider infrastructure recovery as a means of mitigating the impacts of geographic hazards on concentrated critical infrastructure. The federal government, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other agencies, provides a range of emergency aid programs for communities affected by disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or terrorist attacks. Among other assistance, these federal programs can provide grants, loans, loan guarantees, food, and shelter to disaster victims. They may also provide long-term infrastructure assistance, such as repair of public utilities, to affected communities.", "While the evolving objectives of federal emergency assistance programs are a topic of ongoing debate in Congress, the programs traditionally have been intended to assist primarily in the recovery of an immediate disaster area. However, if a natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other regional incident disrupts critical infrastructure, it may have serious social or economic consequences far beyond the area where the disaster occurs. The loss of concentrated natural gas supplies in the Gulf of Mexico after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, for example, sharply increased U.S. energy prices and threatened to create significant shortages of fuel for home heating and electric power generation in New England. These natural gas shortages prompted congressional calls to increase federal aid for low income households nationwide facing high natural gas bills. In light of the far-reaching impacts like these, Congress may wish to incorporate into existing federal infrastructure recovery plans and aid programs measures that account for the distinctive vulnerabilities of concentrated critical infrastructure. Measures related to the restoration or alternative provision of critical infrastructure services away from the immediate area of a geographic incident may warrant particular attention."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Geographic concentrations of critical infrastructure exist across a number infrastructure sectors. Although such concentrations often provide substantial economic and social benefits, they may also be distinctly vulnerable to catastrophic geographic disruption. Any public policy addressing critical infrastructure concentration must try to balance these benefits and potential costs. Both government and industry have taken steps to try to protect critical infrastructure from natural disasters, epidemics, and terrorist attacks. Nonetheless, questions remain as to whether these steps appropriately address such geographic vulnerabilities. If Congress concludes that more federal intervention is needed to alleviate vulnerabilities due to geographic concentration, it may employ a number of policy options to encourage geographic dispersion (including eliminating policies that encourage concentration ), ensure survivability, or ensure that effective infrastructure recovery capabilities are in place to mitigate impacts of concentrated infrastructure disruption. Because geographic hazards exist today, and geographic dispersion would likely take decades to achieve, addressing geographic vulnerabilities may call for a combination of options.", "In addition to these issues, Congress may assess how geographic infrastructure vulnerability and survivability fit together in the nation's overall infrastructure policies. As Congress evaluates diverse proposals with the potential to affect critical infrastructure development\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014Congress may consider whether such proposals are likely to relieve or exacerbate geographic vulnerability. The economic or social benefits of adding capacity (e.g. refinery, airport, shipping) to an existing concentration of critical infrastructure, or developing additional infrastructure in a new location, may be outweighed by the increased geographic risk implicit in such an expansion. Fiscal implications, especially related to the economic efficiency of public critical infrastructure and the efficient use of federal funds for infrastructure projects, may also be an important consideration. Reviewing how such infrastructure priorities fit together could be an oversight challenge for Congress."], "subsections": []}]}}
