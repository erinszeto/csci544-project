Generally, the FFDCA provides that an article must be refused admission into the United States, with some exceptions, on the following bases:", "[i]f it appears from the examination of [samples of food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics which are being imported or offered for import into the United States] or otherwise that (1) such article has been manufactured, processed, or packed under insanitary conditions ..., or (2) such article is forbidden or restricted in sale in the country in which it was produced or from which it was exported, or (3) such article is adulterated, misbranded, or in violation of section 505.", "Under the FFDCA, the FDA can automatically detain a product without physically examining it. Automatic detention occurs as a result of the issuance of import alerts, which \"identify problem commodities and/or shippers and/or importers and provide guidance for import coverage,\" such as if \"those products or shippers ... have met the criteria for automatic detention.\" Importers whose products have been detained because of import alerts can petition for the release of their products by presenting testimony from private, or third-party, laboratories that shows that their products are compliant. In order to do this, they submit either their products or samples of their products for testing to the private laboratories. For the products to be released, the private laboratories must then present test results that indicate that the products do not violate the FDA's entry standards. The test results can be returned to the importer, who will give it to the FDA, or the lab can turn in the results directly to the FDA. The FDA may then use this data \"to determine whether the imported food complies with the [FFDCA] and can be released into the United States.\"", "The FDA has recognized these private laboratories as an integral part of food import safety. According to the FDA, the third-party labs help ensure that the food reaching the market complies with agency standards and allow agency laboratory resources to be devoted to other regulatory matters. However, there has been criticism regarding the autonomy given to the importers and private laboratories. Such criticism varies from the manner in which the samples are collected for testing to the reporting of test results by the importers to the FDA. For example, at a 1998 hearing before a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee, a former customs broker testified regarding the abuses of the private laboratory system in relation to the product samples given to the private laboratory. He recounted how some importers selected samples for testing that were from shipments that had not been detained or they submitted multiple samples for testing until a sample was found to be compliant. As the FDA has noted, \"[b]oth of these activities permit importers to market adulterated or misbranded foods in the United States, representing a health hazard.\"", "Another example occurred early in 2008, when the chairman of a private laboratory that samples and tests FDA-regulated goods testified at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing. His testimony concerned encounters with importers who deleted information from test results that evidenced FDA violations and then submitted the altered results to the FDA, as well as suggestions for improving the FDA's regulation of imported foods via the use of laboratories and existing FDA programs. Additionally, he stated that the FDA should be able to visit and audit laboratories at their physical location at any time. Currently, the FDA may conduct voluntary, on-site assessments of such laboratories. Recent agency, administration, and legislative proposals address various ways to curb the potential for such abuses by monitoring private laboratories."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Bush Administration Proposals", "paragraphs": ["The FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs publishes a Laboratory Manual with a section on Private Laboratory Guidance. The Guidance \"seeks to establish a uniform, systematic, and effective approach to ensuring that private labs performing analyses on FDA-regulated imported commodities submit scientifically sound data.\" To that end, the Guidance provides recommendations on sampling techniques, information regarding the training and experience of private lab analysts, considerations for reviewing the analytical packages, and suggested criteria for collecting audit samples. In general, a guidance document is a type of policy statement, \"issued by an agency to advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.\" General statements of policy do not \"impose any rights and obligations,\" nor do they \"establish a 'binding norm'\" because they are \"not finally determinative of the issues or rights to which [they are] addressed.\"", "In April 2004, the FDA proposed a rule to regulate imported food product sampling services and private laboratories. It was withdrawn without comment on August 5, 2005. Some of the recommendations from the FDA's Laboratory Guidance were put forth in the proposed rule. The proposed rule would have required \"samples to be properly identified, collected and maintained.\" The proposed sampling requirements outlined specific provisions for identification, collection, and documentation from the time the sample was collected to the time the sample was delivered to a private laboratory. Particularly, the proposed rule placed an emphasis on an \"independent\" execution of the sampling, to ensure that the sampling and the tests are conducted without the importer's influence. It went further to require \"laboratories to use validated or recognized analytical methods, and to submit analytical results directly to FDA.\" It purposefully omitted a laboratory accreditation requirement. ", "In November 2007, the FDA prepared a report entitled the Food Protection Plan . The FDA's plan is integrated with a separate plan, prepared for President Bush by the Interagency Working Group on Import Safety, called an Action Plan for Import Safety . Both reports highlight how the Bush Administration would like to improve food import safety. The Food Protection Plan recommends legislation that would give the FDA the authority to accredit private laboratories. The Action Plan for Import Safety notes that the FDA plans to issue guidance \"that would set standards for the sampling and testing of imported products, including the use of accredited private laboratories submitting data to FDA to assist in evaluating whether an appearance of a violation may be resolved.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Proposals from the 110th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Several bills introduced in the 110 th Congress addressed the issue of private laboratory regulation.
