If diplomats reach agreement, free trade in the hemispherecould occur by 2020.", "Negotiations on FTAA's agriculture component have become contentious. FTAA's negotiating objectives for agriculture call for removing tariffs and other barriers to agricultural imports in eachcountry, developing disciplines on the use of export subsidies and other mechanisms that distortagricultural trade, and ensuring that rules on food safety and animal and plant health are not used asdisguised trade barriers. Following an agreed-upon timetable, FTAA countries during 2003exchanged detailed offers and counteroffers designed to reduce and eliminate tariffs and quotas onall traded goods. The agriculture chapter in the second draft consolidated text of an FTAAagreement issued in November 2002 continues to reflect differences in viewpoints among countrieson substantive agricultural issues. Strong differences currently exist between the United States andBrazil over how to address in the FTAA the issue of domestic farm subsidies and agricultural exportsubsidies. This issue has become pivotal in efforts to reach an agreement on FTAA's scope(comprehensive or scaled back) in the period leading up to the FTAA Ministerial in Miami onNovember 17-21.", "Much of U.S. agricultural trade with Canada and Mexico already occurs free of barriers under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Accordingly, an FTAA would primarily affect U.S.agricultural trade with the countries of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.

Agricultural imports from these three regions, by contrast, account for 17% of all such U.S. imports.", "A 1998 U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis finds that U.S. agriculture would benefit to some degree with U.S. participation in an FTAA that eliminates all tariffs throughout the region. According to this analysis, U.S. farm income would be $180 million (1%) higher than without anagreement, U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $580 million (1%), and U.S. agriculturalimports would rise by $830 million (3%).", "Some agricultural product sectors expecting to gain from increased sales are supportive of the FTAA initiative. Others appear to be ambivalent, preferring instead that the Bush Administrationplace more emphasis on liberalizing agricultural trade on a multilateral basis under the WTO. Producers of import-sensitive food products (i.e., sugar and orange juice) are concerned aboutincreased competition. They seek to be excluded from FTAA coverage or be covered by the longesttransition periods possible.

In other words, trade in agriculture is not to be treatedany differently than trade in manufactured goods. The U.S. position is reported to advocateprocedures that \"ensure that the benefits of free trade are broadly distributed,\" and proposed thatmost tariffs be rapidly reduced. USTR stated, with likely implications for agricultural trade, that thedetails of the U.S. position take into account \"product sensitivities in a framework that is fullyconsistent\" with WTO disciplines. ", "Average Agricultural Tariffs in FTAA Area. Average tariffs on agricultural imports are lower in the Western Hemisphere compared to many otherregions around the world. The global average tariff on such imports is 62%, compared to the U.S.average (12%). For regions covered by the FTAA, the average bound tariff is 25% for NorthAmerica, 39% for South America, 54% for Central America, and 86% for the Caribbean Islands. (9) However, applied tariffs can be considerably lower than bound rates. For example, applied tariffsfor agricultural products averaged between 11% and 17% for Central and South America during the1995-99 period. These regional averages mask the range of protection between commodities in anycountry, and do not fully reflect the use of TRQs by many countries in the Western Hemisphere(including the United States), many of which apply prohibitive tariffs on above-quota imports. Reflecting FTAA's objective, the target would be to reduce tariff levels to zero and to eliminateTRQs by the end of the agreed-upon transition period, likely to be about 2020. This part of thenegotiating process will be a difficult process, as some countries seek exceptions for specificcommodities or products that currently receive protection under restrictive TRQs.", "Transition Periods. The U.S. proposal on FTAA's timetable and pace of tariff elimination is based in part on WTO rules, which requirecountries in a free trade area to eliminate tariffs and other forms of protection on most of their tradewithin 10 years. Some FTAA participants, though, acknowledge that some politically-sensitiveagricultural products may need to be allowed a transition of up to 20 years to adjust to competitionbefore tariffs or quotas disappear. They refer to the precedent set in NAFTA, which provided fora 15 year transition to free trade on the most sensitive agricultural products scheduled to enterMexico and the United States (i.e., frozen concentrated orange juice, peanuts, and sugar importedinto the United States from Mexico; and corn, dry beans, milk powder, and sugar imported byMexico from the United States).", "U.S. Market Access Offer.

On politically-sensitive farm products, AmbassadorZoellick stated that the United States proposes to eliminate tariffs with specific timetables that woulddiffer between countries or regional groups. Transition periods could be 5 or 10 years, or evenlonger, depending upon a country's size and its level of economic development, and on the type ofagricultural product.

Though the WTO Agreement introduced some discipline on the use of export subsidies, WTO rules still allow countries tosubsidize exports of commodity surpluses. As a result, export subsidies continue to distortinternational trade in agricultural and food products by giving a price advantage to the exporter. Though subsidized sales reduce the price an importing country pays, the price that other exportingcountries receive for the same product sold into other markets frequently is less than would beotherwise.", "Two FTAA negotiating objectives agreed to by hemispheric trade ministers in their 1998 San Jose Declaration address this issue. One calls for the elimination of \"agricultural export subsidiesaffecting trade in the Hemisphere.\" The other requires agricultural negotiators \"to identify othertrade-distorting practices for agricultural products, including those that have an effect equivalent toagriculture export subsidies, and bring them under greater discipline.\"", "The U.S. position reaffirms the FTAA's goal of eliminating the use of export subsidies within the hemisphere, and proposes that the FTAA countries at the same time \"establish mechanisms toprevent agricultural products from being exported to the FTAA by non-FTAA countries with the aidof export subsidies.\" This is likely aimed at the European Union, which heavily subsidizes itsagricultural exports and actively promotes such sales to Latin American markets. The initial U.S.proposal states that the United States does not consider export credits, credit guarantees, insuranceprograms, and international food aid \"to constitute an export subsidy.\" The U.S. position reflectsthe use of the same definition of agricultural export subsidies (i.e., direct subsidies) as is used in theURAA.

Thisrefers to government program spending to support commodity prices and raise incomes ofagricultural producers. These countries argue, with the United States and enactment of the 2002farm bill in mind, that such spending encourages farmers to produce commodity surpluses, that whenexported into world markets, depress the price that their producers receive for the same products. They view some forms of domestic support as more distorting of agricultural trade than tariffs orother border measures, and want to include this issue in the negotiations. The impetus behind theircall appears to be concern that the access they gain to the U.S. market under FTAA liberalization willnot result in much benefit to them, since the level of U.S. protection on agricultural imports isalready quite low. Therefore, these countries' strategy appears to be to offer to lower their higherlevel of border protection on agricultural products only if the United States agrees to reduce its levelof domestic farm support.", "U.S. negotiators continue to reject this linkage.
