Still, they approach trade policy quite differently, areat odds over how to proceed regionally with the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and shareconcerns over specific trade policies and practices.", "Brazil's trade strategy can be explained only in part by economic incentives. Its \"tradepreferences\" also reflect deeply embedded macroeconomic, industrial, and foreign policies. WhereasU.S. trade strategy emphasizes the negotiation of comprehensive trade agreements on multiple fronts,Brazil is focused primarily on market access issues as they pertain to its economic dominance inSouth America. Brazil exercises this priority in all trade arenas, such as pursuing changes toagricultural policies in the WTO, expanding the Southern Common Market (Mercosul) in SouthAmerica, and resisting the FTAA for lack of a balance conducive to Brazilian interests.", "Brazil has a modern, diversified economy in which services account for 53% of GDP,followed by industry and manufacturing at 37%, and agriculture at 9%.

These foundational ideas, whichrecognize the value of both imports and exports, remain valid today for explainingwhy countries generally wish to pursue freer trade and why trade liberalization hasbeen at the center of the economic reform debate in much of Latin America.", "In practice, however, few countries have opted unilaterally to throw opentheir borders to unfettered free trade, and the call to maintain trade barriers iscommon even if it is understood that they come with a cost to society as a whole. There are many reasons for this. Perhaps most transparent is resistence by firms andworkers who stand to bear most of the adjustment costs of freer trade, even ifnational welfare is ultimately enhanced through lower priced goods and services, agreater selection of choices from imports, and overall efficiency gains that can leadto higher national income. Less obvious is that countries adopt diverse trade policiesbased on historically, socially, and politically determined \"trade preferences\" thatcannot be explained solely by a calculus of economic costs and benefits.", "The \"trade preference\" framework helps explain Brazil's trade strategy.

The most important aspects of tradepolicy, therefore, are driven less by commercial interests and often are subordinatedto a larger foreign policy imperative, primarily, enhancing Brazil's influence in LatinAmerica and the world. In the Western Hemisphere, this implies taking on theUnited States.

Brazil, for example, is known for its historical accommodation toinflation, having employed for decades a comprehensive system of wage, price, andinterest rate indexation as part of its macroeconomic management. Inflation ran at\"manageably\" high rates for years and was fought, albeit unsuccessfully, with anumber of stabilization plans. By the 1970s, however, it eventually spiraled out ofcontrol following the oil price shocks. This led Brazil to the 1980s debt crisis alongwith much of Latin America. (13) By the 1990s, the economy was defined by itsgrowing deficits and debt, failed efforts at stabilization, slow growth (averaging only2.3% from 1980 to 2004), and reluctance to embrace reforms. An important factorin Brazil's sluggish economic performance was poor productivity growth due tomicroeconomic policy distortions discussed above, macroeconomic problems, andto some degree, also its closed trade policy. (14) ", "Brazilian trade policy also had to adjust to encroaching globalization in the1990s, including multilateral efforts (the conclusion of the Uruguay Round), newregional talks (the FTAA), and U.S. subregional initiatives (the North American FreeTrade Agreement -- NAFTA). Brazil responded with some unilateral liberalization,the formation of Mercosul in 1991 with Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay toconsolidate its trade positions in South America, and the adoption of agovernment-assisted export promotion policy to help address its large and growingexternal debt. The average tariff in Brazil fell from 51% in 1988 to 14% in 1994, butthe selective preferences given under Mercosul belied the liberalization message asBrazil continued to limit trade outside the regional pact, allowing it to managecarefully the degree to which foreign competition would be accepted. (15) ", "Brazil's trade policy shifted again in 1994 to accommodate the Real Plan, aprice stabilization policy imposed by then-Finance Minister (and later-President)Fernando Henrique Cardoso. It was named for a new currency that was pegged to theU.S. dollar to serve as an anchor to bring down hyperinflation. The plan actuallyworked where others had not, but in pegging the real to the dollar, the differences ininflation between the two countries caused a large real appreciation of the Braziliancurrency, as price levels between the two countries diverged. This resulted in asudden turn to trade deficits in 1995 (see Figure 2 ), an economic consequence thatran counter to the political priority given to running trade surpluses. To offset theexchange rate effect on the balance of payments, Brazil raised interest rates andredoubled its protectionist policies. (16) ", "The macroeconomic story was further complicated by a major financial crisisin 1998 that resulted in a currency devaluation and return to a floating exchange ratein 1999, Argentina's financial collapse in 2001, and a financial panic in 2002exaggerated by the impending presidential election of longtime Worker's Party leaderLuiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva. Today Brazil's macroeconomic priorities still constraintrade and other policy choices. The economy is stable, but growing at inadequatelevels to bring about desired development goals. To control inflation, the LulaAdministration has had to maintain very high real interest rates, while Brazil's largedebt service obligation has required a large primary budget surplus, approaching 5%of GDP in 2005, and a trade surplus. (17) ", "The cost of this development strategy has been accepting the microeconomicdistortions discussed above and inadequate social spending, which raises the prospectfor future social and political unrest given the already very high levels of incomeinequality and poverty. Subordinating trade liberalization to debt reduction and othergoals also diminishes Brazil's growth prospects, a key variable in reducing poverty. Therefore, as may be seen, Brazil's \"trade preferences,\" which point to a cautious(some would say protective) and carefully managed approach to trade liberalization,reflect a combination of industrial, foreign, and macroeconomic policy priorities thatoften outweigh purely trade-related economic arguments, and deters progress inBrazil's long-term development.

To date,Mercosul remains an incomplete customs union with many exceptions to the CET. Early successes were measured by the doubling of intra-Mercosul trade by 1995, astariffs came down according to schedule, and cooperation remained largely positive. This trend reversed course in the late 1990s because of financial crises in Argentinaand Brazil, and the absence of macroeconomic coordination and other policyproblems. Brazilian trade within Mercosul expanded by only 13% from 1999 to2004, with Brazil's trade balance shifting from a nearly balanced position to anuncomfortably large surplus of $2.5 billion by 2004, as imports from all threeMercosul partners stagnated or declined.

The United States and Europe remain the dominant markets for Brazilianmanufactures and agricultural goods, respectively, as well as, the major suppliers ofcapital goods.

Thesedecisions suggest that Mercosul continues to operate based primarily on politicalincentives.", "Mercosul has been negotiating with the European Union for an FTA for manyyears. These talks, once considered promising, have bogged down on market accessand other issues that have similarly hindered progress on the FTAA. Brazil wantsbetter access for agricultural goods, while the EU wants Brazil to lower tariffs onindustrial goods.

(22) Still, support for the pact is strong despite itstroubles. The smaller economies benefit from preferential access to the largeBrazilian market, and Brazil sees a unified Mercosul as being the definitivecounterbalance to the United States in FTAA negotiations, where the FTAA isviewed as a complement to, not a substitute for, Mercosul. The technical distinctionbetween a free trade agreement and a customs unions becomes important here. Acustoms union with a CET implies that its members will negotiate trade agreementscollectively with the outside world, or the union becomes largely meaningless.

Brazil relies on the customs union to strengthen its regional economicleadership, and by extension, its trade negotiating position outside of Mercosul. Conversely, Brazil's strength would be undermined if any members of Mercosulopted for FTA status or chose to go their own way with extra-regional negotiations,a position Uruguay flirted with in January 2006, although apparently with no realconviction. Mercosul also serves Brazil's trade strategy precisely because Brazil canset the levels of deepening to ensure a balance between maintaining its industrialpolicy and co-opting regional voices in approaching the EU, WTO, or FTAA.

The gains for Mercosul as a whole would comefrom its comparative advantage in agriculture vis-a-vis the United States, providedbarriers to trade in this sector are meaningfully lowered. For Brazil, opening up theU.S. market to agricultural products is critical, but the United States is also its majormarket for many value-added manufactured exports (frozen orange juice concentrate,steel, aircraft, petroleum). There is, it seems, the potential for considerablecommercial gains for Brazil should a far-reaching FTAA be completed. (26) ", "The cost and benefit calculus, however, is more complicated. For the smallerMercosul countries, an FTAA means giving up preferential access to the largeBrazilian market, which could mean a net loss in welfare for some sectors. TheFTAA would also mean greater access to the U.S. and other Latin American markets,and reduced costs for capital goods and other imports that no longer face a highMercosul CET (e.g. 35% in the case of automobiles). The smaller economies mightalso consider the effects of any future economic setbacks from potentialmacroeconomic problems in Brazil or Argentina. Brazil also is reticent to push foran FTAA precisely because with Mercosul (and more so with a functioning SouthAmerica Community of Nations), it is the hub and industrial center of a majorpreferential trade arrangement, which would certainly change in importance if theFTAA comes to be.", "With an FTAA, Brazilian manufacturing industries that compete directly withmore efficient U.S. firms (e.g. machinery and chemicals) could lose in the short run. Combined with possible trade restructuring that other Mercosul countries might face,Brazil's comparative advantage might shift, to some degree, from industrial productsin a regional economic union to more agricultural goods in a hemispheric one. Giventhe economic and political strength of the United States, the FTAA might alter thebalance of power in the region, to the possible detriment of Brazil's regionalleadership. The potential for these relative changes, compounded by Brazil'sconcerns over its ability to conform to provisions covering enforceable intellectualproperty rights, services trade, and investor protection, point to why Brazil remainsreluctant to advance an FTAA, particularly if U.S. agricultural protection remainsrelatively untouched. Stated more succinctly, although an FTAA could providecommercial (and certainly consumer) gains to Brazil, it may come at a cost toindustrial and foreign policy priorities.

It follows that market access discussions between the two countries usuallyfind the United States focusing on reduction of industrial tariffs, whereas Brazilemphasizes U.S. peak tariffs on agricultural imports subject to TRQs.

The purpose is to maintain the domestic price of sugar abovea set minimal level. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) allocatesquotas among eligible countries, with Brazil receiving approximately 13% of theworld total. In-quota imports are subject to a very low duty. Amounts enteringabove the quota are subject to a tariff computed by the USITC to be 78% ad valoremin 2003.

Brazil mayactually have more to lose, however, because as much as both countries couldimprove their economic well-being from greater trade liberalization, as a developingcountry, Brazil seems to have the most to gain from not only reducing foreignbarriers to its exports, but unilaterally opening its economy further, particularly aspart of completing its ongoing economic reform agenda.", " Appendix 1.
