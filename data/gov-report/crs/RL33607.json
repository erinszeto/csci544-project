Defense planners recognized andcalculated the effect a perceived balance or imbalance of conventional and nuclear forces might haveon deterrence, crisis stability, and the outcome of potential conflicts in Europe. Specifically, theUnited States sought to \"extend\" deterrence and protect its NATO allies with both conventional andnuclear forces. For much of the Cold War, NATO's conventional forces were perceived to be weakerthan those of the Warsaw Pact and were allowed to stay that way in part, because nuclear weaponswere seen as a less costly alternative to large conventional force structure. Many analysts argued thatunder these circumstances, the United States and NATO could deter a Soviet and Warsaw Pactattack by threatening to escalate the conflict to nuclear use. Others, however, questioned whethersuch threats were credible, in light of the fact that the Soviet Union could have responded withnuclear attacks of its own. As a result, analysts often argued the pros and cons of increasing NATO'sconventional force capabilities, and the potential this might have for enhancing deterrence and\"raising the nuclear threshold.\" (3) ", "DOD's 2002 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) constructed a \"new triad\" consisting of offensivestrike weapons, missile defense, and the nuclear weapons infrastructure to describe the capabilitiesthat are a part of the U.S. nuclear posture.

Thus, the newtriad appears to be a much broader construct.", "One noteworthy aspect of the new triad's offensive strike component is the planned interplaybetween nuclear and conventional weapons. DOD seeks to integrate nuclear and conventionalcapabilities in some military plans and applications where hitherto only nuclear weapons werethought to play a role. Administration officials suggest that this integration may reduce potentialU.S. reliance on nuclear weapons.", "Studies and analyses subsequent to the NPR have sought to consider whether the additionof conventional weapons to U.S. nuclear plans might alter the role of nuclear weapons. Few appearto have asked, however, whether the integration implied in the new triad might alter the role orrequirements for U.S. conventional weapons. Further, very few, if any of these considerationsappear to have informed the debate over budget and procurement of conventional weapons.", "Some DOD leaders say that today's conventional and nuclear forces are well suited to deterstate-on-state conflict, and that the primary challenges are deterring non-state actors.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Unionwas the primary country to be deterred by U.S. military forces. The United States sought to developa policy and nuclear forces that it believed were needed to convince the Soviet Union that anynuclear attack on the United States would be met with a retaliatory attack against the full range ofvalued targets in the Soviet Union. Other countries, such as China and the countries of EasternEurope, were covered by U.S. nuclear war plans, but their presence reflected their relationship withthe Soviet Union more than any independent threat they might pose to the United States or its allies. ", "The United States also expected its nuclear weapons to deter a Soviet nuclear attack,conventional attack, or coercion aimed at U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. (13) Many believed the UnitedStates needed to threaten nuclear retaliation to deter these threats because the Soviet Union and itsWarsaw Pact allies had far greater numbers of conventional forces than did the United States andits NATO allies. According to this view, if a war was fought with only conventional weapons, U.S.and NATO forces could be overrun. Therefore, the United States fielded a variety of strategic,theater and tactical nuclear weapons that might be used to repel and defeat such an attack.", "This doctrine came to be known as extended deterrence. The theory underlying this doctrinewas that if any level of aggression against U.S. allies could escalate into a nuclear conflict that mightinvolve attacks on the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union might be deterred from all levels ofaggression. This theory was not without critics, however, as some analysts questioned whether theSoviet Union would believe that the United States would use nuclear weapons to defend its allies,particularly if such use might invite a Soviet nuclear attack on the United States. ", "Strategic Doctrine and Targeting. During the 1950s,the strategic doctrine known as \"massive retaliation\" envisioned a \"simultaneous, massive,integrated\" U.S. nuclear strike against targets in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China if theSoviet Union or its allies initiated any nuclear or conventional attack against the United States or itsallies. (14) ", "In the early 1960s, the United States developed a doctrine of \"damage limitation,\" whichcalled for attacks against Soviet conventional and nuclear military forces. This \"counterforce\"strategy explicitly excluded attacks designed to destroy cities and focused instead on attacks thatwould impede the Soviet Union's warfighting capability. (15) In particular, it sought to destroy those weapons that the SovietUnion might use to attack U.S. cities. In the mid-1960s, DOD developed the doctrine of \"assureddestruction,\" a strategy that was designed to convince the Soviet leadership that Soviet society wouldbe destroyed if the Soviet Union launched an attack on the United States or its allies. But, by theearly 1970s, many again questioned the credibility of a doctrine that called for massive strikesagainst Soviet society, particularly if the Soviet Union could threaten to strike back against U.S.cities. Therefore, the United States shifted its doctrine once again, to \"Flexible Response\" in themid-1970s and \"Countervailing Strategy,\" in the late 1970s. These policies emphasized retaliatorystrikes on Soviet military forces and war-making capabilities, as opposed to attacks on civilian andindustrial targets, and they called for limited, focused attacks on specified military targets, insteadof large-scale attacks on a greater number of sites. (16) ", "Post-Cold War.", "Deterrence. In its 1995 National Security Strategyreport, the Clinton Administration stated that \"the dissolution of the Soviet empire has radicallytransformed the security environment facing the United States and our allies. The primary securityimperative of the past half century -- containing communist expansion while preventing nuclear war-- is gone.\" (17) TheAdministration did, however, determine that Russia remained a concern for U.S. national securitybecause it continued to control the only nuclear arsenal that could threaten the survival of the UnitedStates. The Clinton Administration also argued that \"nuclear weapons served as a hedge against anuncertain future, a guarantee of our security commitments to allies and a disincentive to those whowould contemplate developing or otherwise acquiring their own nuclear weapons.\" (18) ", "The Clinton Administration did not consider China to pose a direct threat to the United Statesas a regional or global adversary. Nevertheless, DOD officials testified that China's small nuclearforce \"is still formidable\" and \"China continues to make steady efforts to modernize those forces.\" Assistant Secretary of Defense Ted Warner stated that the United States could not be sure that itwould not need nuclear weapons to deter China in the future. (19) The ClintonAdministration also identified other threats to U.S. national security, specifically noting in itsNational Security Strategy Report for 1998, that \"weapons of mass destruction pose the greatestpotential threat to global stability and security.\" (20) ", "Strategic Doctrine and Targeting. Although theClinton Administration maintained the U.S. focus on deterring a potential Russian threat, it did issuenew guidelines for U.S. nuclear strategy in late 1997. In a document known as PDD-60 theAdministration stated that \"our military planning for the possible employment of nuclear weaponsis focused on deterring a nuclear war rather than attempting to fight and win a protracted nuclearexchange.\" (21) Inpractice, this probably meant that the United States would not seek to cause as much damage againstas wide a range of targets as it had planned on attacking in previous war plans. But ClintonAdministration officials also noted that this did not alter the structure of U.S. nuclear war plans orthe variety of options available to the President for a U.S. retaliatory strike.", "Many press reports about PDD-60 highlighted the provisions covering the use of U.S. nuclearweapons to deter nations other than Russia, and viewed this as an \"expansion\" of the role of U.S.nuclear weapons. However, the United States has never maintained a \"no first use\" policy, and hasalways retained the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks by conventional, chemical,or biological weapons. These policies did not change in the 1990s.", "Present Environment.", "Deterrence. The George W. Bush Administration hasemphasized that nuclear weapons \"continue to be essential to our security, and that of our friends andallies.\" (22) As the onlyweapons in the U.S. arsenal that can hold at risk the full range of targets valued by an adversary, theycontinue to play a key role in U.S. deterrent strategy. However, in contrast with the ClintonAdministration's focus on a potential Russian threat, the Bush Administration has stated that Russiaand the United States are no longer enemies. Even though Russia retains thousands of nuclearweapons, the increased cooperation between the two nations has allowed a \"new strategicframework\" to replace the Cold War's adversarial relationship. The Bush Administration hasemphasized, however, that the United States faces threats from \"multiple potential opponents,sources of conflict, and unprecedented challenges\" (23) and that these challenges must be taken into consideration whenthe United States plans its nuclear weapons policy and force posture. According to theAdministration, these adversaries could include non-state actors and terrorists as well as nations suchas China, (24) Iran, NorthKorea, and others.", "In the past, U.S. policy essentially viewed nuclear weapons apart from the rest of the U.S.military establishment, with nuclear weapons serving to deter a global nuclear conflict with theSoviet Union or Russia. In contrast, the Bush Administration has described a more comprehensiverole for nuclear weapons, arguing that nuclear weapons, along with missile defenses and otherelements of the U.S. military establishment, not only deter adversaries by promising an unacceptableamount of damage in response to an adversary's attack, they can also assure allies and friends of theU.S. commitment to their security by providing an extended deterrent, dissuade potential adversariesfrom challenging the United States with nuclear weapons or other \"asymmetrical threats\" byconvincing them that they can never negate the U.S. nuclear deterrent; and defeat enemies by holdingat risk those targets that could not be destroyed with other types of weapons. (25) ", "Doctrine and Targeting. In describing the future roleof nuclear weapons, the Bush Administration has stated that the United States will not only rely onthe threat of nuclear retaliation, but will also seek to deter and defeat adversaries with precisionconventional weapons, which are hoped to be capable of destroying some targets that were assignedto nuclear weapons in the past, and ballistic missile defenses, which might deter attack by denyingan adversary the ability to threaten U.S. targets with ballistic missiles. (26) The Administration refersto this change as \"tailored deterrence,\" with the United States developing more specific responsesthat would rely on a broader range of military capabilities to respond to the threats posed byemerging adversaries.", "Moreover, the Bush Administration has stated that the United States will no longer size andstructure its nuclear forces to address the \"Soviet threat.\" (27) Instead, it will employ a \"capabilities-based\" strategy, where itwould \"look more at a broad range of capabilities and contingencies that the United States mayconfront\" and tailor U.S. military capabilities to address this wide spectrum of possiblecontingencies. (28) Specifically, the United States would identify potential future conflicts, review the capabilities ofits possible adversaries, identify those capabilities that the United States might need to attack orthreaten with nuclear weapons, and develop a force posture and nuclear weapons employmentstrategy that would allow it to attack those capabilities. The Bush Administration has not discussed,publicly, how it will identify specific targets or allocate weapons in its \"capabilities-based\" strategy.", "The most specific and visible change to emerge from this new targeting strategy has been thereplacement of the Cold War SIOP (single integrated operational plan) with a new war plan knownas OPLAN (operations plan) 8044. This document contains the major strike options and majorcontingency plans that had been included in the SIOP, but could also include plans for a wider rangeof options against a greater number of adversaries. Some press reports indicate that theAdministration has also developed a companion contingency plan, CONPLAN 8022-22, which plansfor the prompt U.S. response to a number of contingencies with nations other than Russia. Reportsindicate that most of the options in this new plan call for the use of conventional weapons, but somealso allow for the use of nuclear weapons early or at the start of a conflict. (29) As a result, it is evidentthat the Bush Administration has not altered the U.S. policy that permits the possible first use ofnuclear weapons. Further, the Administration has stated that the United States would develop anddeploy those nuclear capabilities that it would need to defeat the capabilities of any potentialadversary whether or not it possessed nuclear weapons.

To be certain that it can retaliate after a nuclear attack, a nation with aminimum deterrent would need forces that could survive a direct assault by another nation's nuclearweapons. This strategy of threatening retaliation against major population centers with even a smallnumber of nuclear weapons is assumed to be sufficient to deter a nuclear attack. However, U.S.estimates of the PRC's evolving nuclear forces have been uncertain, including both over-estimatesof the speed of deployment of new missiles as well as concern over China's ability to surprise withundetected military modernization. (31) In their frequent reevaluations of the Chinese People's LiberationArmy's (PLA) capabilities, U.S. experts have questioned whether the PLA has shifted or consideredshifting its nuclear doctrine to one of \"limited deterrence.\" (32) The two countries lackdialogue over their respective strategic nuclear forces and doctrine as well as confidence-buildingmeasures.

(34) The PLA also has 10-14JL-1 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), but the operational status of the singleXia-class ballistic missile submarine has been questionable.

(36) Still, U.S. government estimates have changed, and China coulddeploy significant new capabilities, such as multiple warheads. Also, some experts have chargedU.S. intelligence with over-estimating dramatic improvements, as the modernization of China'smissile force has been slower than predicted for about 15 years. (37) ", "China employs a variety of basing modes, such as hardened silos and mobile launchers, alongwith concealment and deception techniques, to ensure that its missiles can survive a first strike. These basing modes can add hours or days to the amount of time that China would need to prepareits missiles for launch. This long launch time could seriously hamper any effort by China to usethese missiles in a first strike against the United States, because the United States would be able todetect launch preparations and, possibly, preempt the attack. However, these basing modes couldensure the survivability of China's missiles in the event of a U.S. attack and help to guarantee thatChina would be able to launch a retaliatory strike.", "The PRC has expressed strong opposition to U.S. plans to deploy ballistic missile defenses. U.S. national and theater missile defenses, even with limited numbers of interceptor missiles andlimited capabilities, could possibly undermine the credibility of China's deterrent by denying itsmissiles the ability to reach U.S. targets in theater or in the United States a retaliatory strike.

", "Some observers note that declaratory policy is a poor measure of nuclear strategy, becausepolicy statements need not be consistent with actual military plans or warfighting. Others however,believe that China is sincere in this policy of no-first-use because its nuclear forces lack commonlyrecognized first strike capabilities. Because of their propellant type, and current deploymentpatterns, China cannot launch its missiles promptly, upon warning of an attack or early in a crisis,and add that the missiles lack the accuracy to destroy an enemy's retaliatory forces, which could bea key objective of a nuclear force strike. The PLA's strategic nuclear modernization, however,combined with the occasional statements by some PRC officials about China's ability to strike theUnited States, have led some to question whether China will change its minimum nuclear deterrent. ", "Some have questioned whether China might pursue a more proactive \"limited deterrence\"strategy with its nuclear weapons. (40) This strategy presumes that nuclear weapons can deter bothnuclear and conventional conflicts and that, if deterrence fails, a nation could use nuclear weaponsto control escalation and compel the enemy to back down. With this strategy, China might not waitfor an adversary to use nuclear weapons before it employed its own nuclear forces. It could respondto conventional attacks with nuclear weapons or it could threaten nuclear attack to compel anadversary to cease hostilities or other actions short of war that it perceived as threatening to itsinterests. Many analysts believe that such a strategy would be more useful to China if it sought todeter U.S. intervention in a crisis with Taiwan, particularly if it feared that the United States couldachieve its objectives with advanced conventional weapons and without resorting to nuclear attacks. Such a strategy also would address some of China's concerns about U.S. missile defenses, becausea Chinese first strike might contain more warheads than a retaliatory strike and, therefore, might bemore capable of penetrating U.S. missile defenses.", "However, a \"limited deterrence\" strategy would place added demands on China's nuclearforces. They would need to do more than simply survive and retaliate against cities or wide-areatargets after an attack. China would need a variety of delivery vehicles and warheads types, alongwith relatively high accuracies on its weapons, so that it could credibly threaten to attack the fullrange of targets, from forces in the field to military facilities and urban areas. It would also need todevelop relatively complex warfighting strategies and would need advanced command and controlcapabilities so that it could direct its attacks and monitor their effects. China might seek to developthese capabilities in the longer term, but DOD reports no evidence that China's \"no first use\" doctrinehas actually changed.

For example, in Scenario C (combined arms attack),neither U.S. nor Chinese nuclear forces appear postured in a way that would exacerbate a crisis overTaiwan. Neither is vulnerable to a first strike from the other. However, the same may not be trueof conventional forces. China may believe that its forces are vulnerable to an attack by either Taiwanor the United States., and that such an attack is about to occur. It may then believe that, in spite ofthe risk of escalation and possible attacks (conventional or nuclear) on its own territory, that it wouldbe better off initiating the conflict during the crisis. In essence, then, the U.S. ability to defendTaiwan by attacking targets, especially \"centers of gravity,\" in China could actually make a crisisworse, and could spur China to begin or expand its attack on Taiwan.", "It can also be argued that potent conventional forces, those that truly overmatch China'sdefenses, may weaken deterrence. As described in the background section of this report, during theCold War, relatively weak U.S. conventional forces were viewed by many as consistent with strongdeterrence because the United States would have to quickly fall back on nuclear weapons if attackedby more potent Warsaw Pact forces in Europe.
