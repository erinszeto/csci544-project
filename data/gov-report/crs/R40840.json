NOAA was created in 1970 by President Nixon's Reorganization Plan No. 4. The reorganization plan was designed to unify the nation's environmental activities and to provide a systematic approach for monitoring, analyzing, and protecting the environment. NOAA's administrative structure has evolved into five line offices that reflect its diverse mission, including the National Ocean Service (NOS), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the National Weather Service (NWS), and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR). In addition to NOAA's five line offices, Program Support (PS), a cross-cutting budget activity, supports the NOAA Education Program, Corporate Services, Facilities, and the Office of Marine and Aviation Services.
