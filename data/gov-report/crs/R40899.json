Further, data from a nationally representative sample of children in families investigated for abuse or neglect show that as a whole\u2014and without regard to whether a child protective services (CPS) investigator determines that abuse or neglect has occurred\u2014children in families who come into contact with CPS agencies are at higher risk for poor development and behavior outcomes than children in the general population. In addition, that survey shows that these children live in families that often face challenges to their ability to care for and nurture their children, including trouble paying for basic necessities, low social support, and only one supportive caregiver in the family. In FY2007, states reported an estimated 3.5 million children were in families investigated or assessed by CPS workers and some 794,000 were identified as victims of abuse or neglect.", "In 1974, Congress enacted the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA, P.L. 93-247) to create a single federal focus for preventing and responding to child abuse and neglect. As a condition of receiving state grant funds under that act, states are required to have procedures in place for receiving and responding to allegations of abuse or neglect and for ensuring children's safety. Further, they must define child abuse and neglect in a way that is consistent with CAPTA, which defines the term as \" at a minimum, any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.\"", "Since its enactment, CAPTA has been reauthorized numerous times, most recently by the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-36). Currently, it authorizes formula grants to states to help improve their child protective services; competitive grants and contracts for research, demonstration, and other activities related to better identifying, preventing, and treating child abuse and neglect; and formula grants to states for support of community-based child abuse and neglect prevention services. Funding authorization for these CAPTA programs expired with FY2008. However, Congress appropriated $110 million for CAPTA in FY2009 (P.L. 111-8) and a similar amount has been proposed for FY2010 (H.R. 3293). In addition, CAPTA authorizes grants to improve the prosecution and handling of child abuse and neglect cases. These formula grants to states, commonly referred to as Children's Justice Act grants, are funded via an annual set-aside of up to $20 million from the Crime Victims fund.", "This report begins with discussion of the issue and scope of child abuse and neglect, followed by a discussion of the manner and scope of the work of the CPS agency in receiving and responding to allegations of child abuse or neglect, and then looks at some identified risk factors for poor child and family outcomes among all children in families investigated for abuse or neglect.

", "Between 1963 and 1967, every state and the District of Columbia enacted some form of child abuse and neglect reporting law to permit individuals to refer cases of suspected child abuse or neglect to a public agency. The rapid adoption of these laws was aided by a model reporting law disseminated by the Children's Bureau, which is housed within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In 1974, Congress passed the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA, P.L. 93-247 ) and state reporting laws were modified to conform to the standards it established. In creating CAPTA, Congress sought to increase understanding of child abuse and neglect and improve the response to its occurrence by establishing a single federal focal point on the issue. Since its enactment 35 years ago, the law has been reauthorized and amended numerous times, most recently by the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-36 ). Currently, CAPTA authorizes: ", "State Grants : Formula grants to states and territories to help improve their child protective service (CPS) systems, in exchange for which states must comply with various requirements related to the reporting, investigation, and treatment of child maltreatment cases. The FY2009 appropriation was $26.5 million. Discretionary Activities : Federal data collection, dissemination, and technical assistance efforts related to child abuse prevention and treatment, as well as competitive grants to a range of eligible entities for research and demonstration projects or other activities related to the identification, prevention, and treatment of child abuse or neglect. The FY2009 appropriation was $41.8 million (including a $13.5 million set-aside for the ACF home visitation initiative, $500,000 for a feasibility study related to a national child abuse and neglect offender registry, and $2.4 million for other congressional projects designated in the Explanatory Statement accompanying the FY2009 appropriations bill). Community-Based Grants: Formula grants to each state and territory for support of community-based activities and services to prevent child abuse and neglect. The FY2009 appropriation was $41.7 million. Children's Justice Act Grants: Formula grants to states and territories to improve investigation, prosecution, and handling of child maltreatment cases, particularly those cases related to child sexual abuse or exploitation. For FY2009, $20 million was provided out of the federal Crime Victims Fund, including a $3 million set-aside for tribes.", "Funding authorization for most grants or activities authorized under CAPTA expired with FY2008. However, as shown above, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 111-8 ) provided roughly $110 million out of the general treasury for CAPTA grants and activities in FY2009. In addition, as required by the Victims of Crime Act ( P.L. 93-247 , as amended), $20 million was set aside from the Crime Victims Fund for grants to improve the investigation, prosecution, and handling of child abuse and neglect cases (commonly referred to as \"Children's Justice Act grants\").

For most children, their parents are both capable and committed to providing this necessary care and support. For some, however, this is not true. Any person who knows or suspects that a child is being abused or neglected may contact child protective services (CPS) with this information. Local CPS agencies are called on to screen these referrals, investigate or assess the allegations as warranted, and identify children in need of additional services. In carrying out this job, CPS workers must discern the difference between children whose home situations are safe, those whose homes may be made safe if additional supports and services are provided, and those for whom removal\u2014even if temporary\u2014is necessary for the children's protection. ", "This first part of this report includes a discussion of definitions of child abuse and neglect and a description of how CPS agencies receive and respond to allegations of child abuse and neglect. Tasks done by CPS workers are described, including the manner in which children are ultimately counted as \"victims\" or \"non-victims\" of child abuse or neglect. It continues with a look at certain demographic characteristics of children found to be victims and a brief description of services provided to children and their families following a child abuse or neglect investigation. Finally, this part of the report concludes with a short review of some risk factors for poor child outcomes that are seen disproportionately in children whose families are investigated for abuse or neglect, and lists some circumstances prevalent among the families or caregivers of these children that may also put these children at risk for poor outcomes. ", "CPS agencies are sometimes referred to as the \"front-end\" of the child welfare services continuum. The number of children and families who come to the attention of CPS each year is far greater than the number of children found to be victims of child abuse or neglect and the even smaller number of children who are placed in foster care. Figure 1 shows the scope of children and families who come in contact with the CPS/child welfare agency.

All states receive CAPTA state grant funds and many states have developed more detailed definitions of child abuse and neglect, which is sometimes referred to as child maltreatment. Typically, these definitions elaborate on the meaning of different types of maltreatment, including (1) physical abuse, generally involving non-accidental physical injury to the child and, in some states, substantial threat of injury; (2) neglect, including failure to provide necessary food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision and, typically, for reasons other than economic inability to do so; (3) sexual abuse/exploitation; and (4) emotional abuse or mental injury. Some states also incorporate specific language defining other forms of abuse and neglect, including, for example, abandonment, or harming or exposing a child to harm because of substance abuse or the manufacture of a controlled substance. Consistent with the federal definition in CAPTA, many state child abuse and neglect definitions also specify that a finding of child abuse or neglect may only occur if the perpetrator of the maltreatment is a parent or caregiver of the child. In FY2007, 80% of the perpetrators in substantiated abuse or neglect cases were one or both of the child's parents, 5% were other relatives of the child, and 3% were the unmarried partner of the parent. Other types of non-parent caregivers (e.g., foster parents, residential facility staff, and legal guardians) typically represented less than one-half of 1%, each, of the perpetrators of child abuse or neglect.

In FY2007, child protective services agencies received 3.2 million allegations of abuse or neglect concerning an estimated 5.8 million children. More than one-third of the allegations (38%) were \"screened out\" and no investigation followed. However, investigations or assessments were conducted with regard to the majority of allegations received (62%), involving some 3.5 million children. Of these children, an estimated 794,000 were determined to be victims of child abuse or neglect\u2014or roughly 11 children per 1,000 children in the population. (For data on the number of referrals, investigations, and victims of child abuse by state, see Appendix A .)", "Any person can make a child abuse and neglect allegation to CPS. Most states require certain individuals (e.g., health personnel, teachers, police officers, lawyers, and workers at social service agencies) to report any instance of known or suspected child abuse or neglect. Individuals may make reports of abuse or neglect to local law enforcement or a local CPS agency, and states typically operate a 24-hour hotline to receive this information as well. Under the CAPTA state grant program, states must have procedures for cross-agency cooperation and states have policies (often in statute) regarding how information is to be shared across these entities. States or localities also develop their own rules for when an allegation of child abuse or neglect will be \"screened out.\" For example, these might include\u2014when the allegation received does not meet the state's definition of child abuse or neglect or does not include enough information to permit an investigation or assessment to occur; when the children in the referral were determined to be the responsibility of another agency or jurisdiction (e.g., a military installation or a tribe); or when the alleged victim was older than 18. If an allegation is screened out, there is generally no additional CPS response, although, in a limited number of localities, information on screened-out allegations may be referred to community-based groups for possible follow-up. By contrast, when an allegation is \"screened-in,\" it is called a \"report\" and a CPS investigation or assessment follows. ", "Among the child abuse and neglect referrals screened in for investigation or assessment in FY2007, 58% were made by professionals\u2014that is, individuals who encountered the alleged child victim as part of their job. These professionals, who, as noted earlier, may be required under state law to report known or suspected abuse or neglect, included education personnel, who were the source of 17% of all reports investigated; legal, law enforcement, or criminal justice personnel (16%); social services personnel (10%); medical personnel (8%); mental health personnel (4%); and foster care or child day care providers (2%). Reports made by non-professionals in FY2007 included those made by anonymous individuals (8% of all reports investigated), relatives (7%), parent(s) (6%), and friends or neighbors of the child (5%)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is an Investigation?", "paragraphs": ["Typically, a single investigation involves more than one child. The number and rate of children who are the subject of a child abuse and neglect investigation trended upward between 1990 and 2004, but has remained relatively flat since that year. Annually, about 3.5 million to 3.6 million children are the subject of CPS investigations or assessments; this translates to a rate of roughly 48 children being the subject of an investigation (or assessment) for every 1,000 in the population. ", "The primary focus of an investigation is a determination concerning the safety of a child. The CPS investigator must assess risk to the child in the home\u2014both whether abuse or neglect has already happened and whether it might occur. In addition to this task, a 2005-2006 national survey of local CPS agencies found that nearly every agency required investigators to make a separate determination of whether any other children in the family were maltreated (98%). A very large majority of these agencies (92%) also required the investigator to make an assessment of service needs of the child during the investigation and, separately, to make a recommendation for court intervention if needed. Finally, in roughly three-fourths of the local CPS agencies surveyed, investigators were required to provide short-term services to the family as necessary (during the investigation) and to refer the family for further (post-investigation) services if needed. ", "In making these determinations and assessments, local CPS agencies commonly instruct investigators to review any prior CPS records relevant to the family; visit the family without making an appointment; discuss the case with other CPS workers; and interview relevant individuals, such as family members other than the caregiver, professionals known to the family, witnesses, and/or the person who made the report of abuse or neglect.

In these places, reports of abuse or neglect where children are deemed (at the screening stage) not at imminent risk of harm or at lower risk may be referred for alternative response rather than investigation. An alternative response focuses primarily on assessing family strengths and needs to ensure children's safety. In many localities, referral to an alternative response precludes a formal determination that abuse or neglect occurred (or didn't occur).", "A 2005-2006 survey of local CPS agencies found that 39% had implemented some form of \"alternative\" or \"differential\" response. That survey found that in the large majority of those agencies, workers providing an alternative response were required to follow standard practices. These included making assessments of the underlying causes of the alleged maltreatment (a standard practice at 84% of the surveyed agencies), the service needs of the family (86%), and the service needs of the child(ren) (86%). Most local CPS agencies (71%) also required the worker providing an alternative response to refer the family for further services if needed. Activities conducted as part of alternative response typically included interviews with caregiver(s) of the child(ren); interviews with (or formal observation of) the child(ren); and discussion of the case with other CPS workers.

For most \"non-victims\" (72% in FY2007), this means the CPS investigation concluded with a determination that abuse or neglect was \"unsubstantiated.\" This finding category is used by all states but is often not defined. It is commonly understood to mean that there was not sufficient evidence under state law to conclude that the child was maltreated or was at risk of maltreatment. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the difference between children for whom an abuse or neglect case is substantiated as opposed to unsubstantiated may be more a matter of degree than absolute difference. As noted above, states that require stronger levels of evidence tend to have lower rates of substantiation. Further, as discussed later, children in families who are investigated for abuse or neglect, in general, exhibit greater developmental and other risk factors than do children in the general population, and many children who are not found to be victims of abuse or neglect receive post-investigation services nonetheless.", "There are a variety of additional \"non-victim\" finding categories reported by states. More than 1 in 10 \"non-victims\" (13% in FY2007) had a finding of \"no alleged maltreatment.\" This may be the result of an increasing number of states in which all children living in the home of a child for whom an abuse or neglect case is reported are viewed as subjects of the investigation. Thus, this group of non-victims is presumed to be siblings of children for whom abuse or neglect was investigated and for whom a victim determination was not made. A smaller percentage of \"non-victims\" (less than 8% in FY2007) are reported as having been served by an \"alternative response\" and with no finding of child maltreatment. (Only 11 states reported data in this category in FY2007.) \"Non-victims\" also include children for whom the case was \"closed with no finding.\" In FY2007, 23 states reported \"non-victims\" in this category, and they represented less than 2% of \"non-victims.\" Generally, \"closed with no finding\" means that the agency could not complete the investigation (e.g., because the family could not be located).

Analyzing survey data among the nationally representative sample of children in families investigated for abuse or neglect, researchers determined that as many as 34% of the youngest children in these families (those under age three) had a developmental delay that would qualify them for special education services under the eligibility criteria used in most states for the Part C program. The comparable percentages among the general population for children with developmental delay is 2% to 23%, depending on the study used.

These procedures must include a requirement that health care providers who are involved in the delivery or care of an infant who has been affected by prenatal exposure to illegal substances notify CPS of the infant's condition. Further, they must provide that designated individuals at health care facilities promptly notify CPS of suspected medical neglect and that the state CPS have procedures for coordinating and consulting with those individuals on all cases of reported medical neglect. With regard to each investigation (or assessment) of reported child abuse and neglect, the state must require that a CPS worker, at the initial time of contact with the alleged perpetrator, advise that individual of the allegations made against him or her and do this in a manner consistent with laws that protect the rights of the person who made the allegation of abuse or neglect. The state must also have provisions by which individuals who disagree with an official finding of abuse or neglect can appeal this finding. Further, the state must provide, by law and regulation, for the immunity from prosecution of any individual making a good faith report of suspected instances of child abuse or neglect. Ensuring c hildren's s afety and m aking r eferral s to other s ervices : A state must have procedures to refer children not at risk of imminent harm to a community organization or voluntary preventive service. A state must also have procedures to immediately ensure the safety of any child who is abused or neglected, as well as any child who may be at risk of abuse or neglect by the same caretaker, and to ensure children's placement in a safe environment. Special procedures or laws must be in place to respond to (1) child maltreatment victims under three years of age (i.e., the state must have provisions for their referral to early intervention services under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act); (2) for infants identified as being affected by prenatal exposure to illegal substances (i.e., the state must have provisions for development of a plan of safe care); and (3) for cases involving medical neglect (i.e., the state must have a law that grants CPS the authority to pursue legal remedies, including those necessary to provide medical care or treatment when necessary). Legal representation of c hildren in abuse and neglect judicial p roceedings : States are required to have provisions for the appointment of an appropriately trained guardian ad litem (an attorney, court-appointed special advocate, or both) to represent each child abuse or neglect victim who is involved in a judicial proceeding. Confidentiality of records: In general, states must maintain the confidentiality of all records and reports related to their child abuse and neglect investigations. At the same time, a state must have procedures to release information from these confidential records to any federal, state, or local government entity, or an agent of these entities, that needs this information to carry out its responsibilities under law to protect children from abuse and neglect. Two of these entities, child fatality review panels and citizen review panels, are specifically named in the statute and must be given access to confidential information needed to perform their work. Further, the state is required to release to the public information concerning a child abuse and neglect case when it resulted in the death or near death of a child. States are permitted to release child abuse and neglect records to (1) individuals who are the subject of a report; (2) a grand jury or court, if the information in the record is necessary to determine an issue before the grand jury or court; and (3) any other entity or class of individuals that is authorized by state law to receive the information for a legitimate state purpose (e.g., researchers, or employers conducting background checks). Finally, a state is also permitted to allow public access to child abuse and neglect court proceedings, provided that it does so in a manner that ensures the safety and well-being of the child, parent, and families. Individuals or entities who receive confidential information from a child abuse and neglect case are bound by the same confidentiality rules as the state and may not re-release the information. In the case of citizen review panel members, a state must have in place civil sanctions for any member of a panel that re-discloses identifying or other information from a CPS case without specific authorization to do so. States must also have procedures to expunge any records made available to the general public or used for purposes of employment or other background checks in cases where the child abuse or neglect allegation is unsubstantiated or found to be false. This requirement, however, does not preclude state CPS agencies from keeping information on unsubstantiated cases in its casework files to assist in future risk and safety assessments. Finally, unless it is ordered to do so by a court, a state is always permitted to refuse to disclose identifying information concerning the person who made a specific allegation of child abuse or neglect. Training , worker r etention , and s upervision: In addition to describing training programs for CPS workers and mandatory reporters in their state plan (see \" Description of Use of Funds and Program Coordination \"), states are required to have provisions to improve the training of caseworkers, as well as methods for training or informing CPS workers regarding their legal duties (\"in order to protect the legal rights and safety of children and families from the initial time of contact during investigation through treatment\"). States must also have provisions related to improving retention and supervision of caseworkers. Establishment and s upport of citizen review p anel s : States are required to establish no less than three citizen review panels (or no less than one in less populous states). The panels must be composed of volunteers who are \"broadly representative\" of the community, including members with expertise in the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect, and may include foster care review boards or child fatality panels. Citizen review panels are required to meet at least once every three months and to evaluate the effectiveness of state and local CPS agencies' policies and practices in protecting children. As part of doing this work, they must provide for public outreach and comment on the impact of CPS work. Each panel must provide to the state an annual written report (which also must be made available to the public) that summarizes its activities and recommendations for CPS improvements at the state and local level. Within six months of receiving the report, the state must submit a written response to the citizen review panel and to state and local child protection systems that describes whether or how the state will incorporate the recommendations of the panel. Finally, to permit citizen review panels to carry out their duties, states must grant them access to information on cases that the panels wish to review and must also provide, as requested, staff assistance to help the panels carry out their duties. Termination of parental r ights : Termination of parental rights is a legal process that severs the legal relationship (rights and responsibilities) between a parent and child. As part of ensuring children's safety and permanency, states are required to have provisions for the expedited termination of parental rights in the case of an infant who has been abandoned. States must also have provisions ensuring that no child whose parent has been convicted of a heinous crime against that child or a sibling of that child (e.g., murder, voluntary manslaughter, conspiracy to murder, or felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury to the child or sibling) be required to be reunited with that parent. In addition, once a state has those provisions in place, it must establish by state law that those same crimes against the child (or a sibling of the child) are grounds for termination of parental rights. At the same time, case-by-case determinations of whether to seek termination of parental rights remain, under CAPTA statute, at the sole discretion of the state.

The 1988 CAPTA amendments ( P.L. 100-294 ) that added this requirement specified that the system must, to the extent practicable, coordinate existing federal, state, regional, and local child welfare data systems; include state-reported data on the number of deaths due to child abuse and neglect; and include standardized state-reported information on false, unfounded, unsubstantiated, and substantiated reports of child abuse or neglect. Further, it required HHS to compile and make available the state-reported child abuse and neglect data. HHS has established the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) and produces an annual publication ( Child Maltreatment ) that compiles and analyzes child abuse and neglect data reported by states. All states have submitted data to NCANDS on an annual basis, although this reporting is considered voluntary for states. Data collected via NCANDS may also be accessed by researchers for additional study through the HHS-funded National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect housed at Cornell University. Provide te chnical assistance to state and local public and private agencies and community-based organizations , including disability organizations and people who work with children with disabilities. The purpose of the technical assistance is to aid these agencies and organizations in developing, improving, and carrying out programs related to prevention, assessment, identification, and treatment of child abuse and neglect and in replicating successful programs. HHS funds the National Resource Center on Child Protective Services, among other relevant resource centers and projects (including some of those also charged with collecting and disseminating relevant information). Support an ongoing research program designed to provide information on how to better protect children from abuse or neglect and to improve the well-being of abused or neglected children . The research program must be interdisciplinary, and include some field-initiated research projects as well as longitudinal research. HHS must compile, analyze, and publish a summary of the research funded under the program. Further, HHS is required to establish priorities for this research program, solicit public comment on those priorities, and maintain an official record of the comment. HHS makes annual competitive grant announcements for child abuse and neglect related research and has published a notice of research priorities in the Federal Register . The statute includes a list of topics on which HHS may choose to focus its required research topics, including the (1) nature and scope of child abuse and neglect and its causes, prevention, assessment, identification, treatment, cultural and socio-economic distinctions, and consequences; (2) effects of abuse and neglect on a child's development and successful early intervention or other services needed; (3) appropriate, effective, and culturally sensitive investigative, administrative, and judicial systems with respect to child abuse cases (including multi-disciplinary and coordinated decision-making procedures); (4) evaluation and dissemination of best practices to improve child protective services systems; (5) effective interagency collaboration between child protective services and the juvenile justice system to improve delivery and continuity of services; (6) evaluation of redundancies and gaps in services to prevent child abuse and neglect to enable better use of resources; (7) nature, scope, and practice of voluntary relinquishment to foster care or state guardianship for the purpose of receiving health or mental health services for low-income children; and (8) information on the national incidence of child abuse and neglect. Survey the national incidence of child abuse and neglect and report findings to Congress . The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-36 ) required HHS to conduct a fourth national incidence survey of child abuse and neglect (NIS-4) and to report back to Congress by July 2007. Specifically, Congress asked HHS to look at and report on the (1) incidence and prevalence of child maltreatment by an array of demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race, family structure, household relationship, school enrollment and education attainment, disability, grandparents as caregivers, labor force status, work status, and income status); (2) any increase or decrease in the number and severity of child abuse cases; (3) incidence of reported child abuse cases that are substantiated and unsubstantiated; (4) number of substantiated cases that result in a judicial finding of child abuse or neglect or related criminal court convictions; (5) extent to which the number of reports of child abuse or neglect that are not substantiated or are false interferes with a state's ability to respond to serious cases of child abuse and neglect; (6) extent to which lack of resources or adequate training for mandatory reporters contribute to a state's inability to respond to serious cases of child abuse or neglect; (7) number of unsubstantiated, false, or unfounded reports that result in a child's out-of-home placement and the length of that placement; (8) extent to which unsubstantiated reports return as more serious cases of child abuse or neglect; (9) incidence and prevalence of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and physical and emotional neglect in foster care; and (10) incidence and outcomes of abuse allegations reported within the context of divorce, custody, or other family court proceedings, and the interaction between the court and the child protective services system. Survey data were collected from 2005 to 2007, but as of early November 2009, the report to Congress on this research has not yet been made available. Establish a peer review process for awarding certain grants or contracts. The peer review process spelled out in statute is designed to ensure consultation with experts in the field in making grants under the CAPTA research program and to enhance the quality and usefulness of the research. In addition, for certain grants or projects funded via CAPTA, the statute requires evaluations to assess their effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Permitted Activities", "paragraphs": ["Permitted activities for HHS include establishing an Office of Child Abuse and Neglect, establishing an Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, and supporting research or demonstration projects and programs on specific topics listed in the statute that are related to the prevention of child abuse and neglect. These and other permitted activities are described below.", "Establish an Office of Child Abuse and Neglect. HHS has established the Office of Child Abuse and Neglect (OCAN) within the Children's Bureau. As stipulated in law, the purposes of the office are to carry out and coordinate the functions and activities of CAPTA, to ensure the necessary expertise and intradepartmental coordination whenever it is necessary to do this, and to ensure regular intradepartmental and interdepartmental consultation with all agencies involved in child abuse and neglect activities. The Federal Interagency Working Group on Child Abuse and Neglect, with representation from more than 40 federal agencies, meets in-person on a quarterly basis, and some members are in more frequent contact by conference call. The purposes of the working group include providing a forum through which staff from relevant federal agencies can communicate and exchange ideas concerning child abuse and neglect related programs and activities and providing a basis for collective action through which funding and resources can be maximized. Appoint a n Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect. HHS is permitted to establish an Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect to make recommendations concerning specific child abuse and neglect related issues to the agency and Congress. The current law stipulates certain necessary characteristics and qualifications for members appointed to this board. Under prior law, HHS was required to appoint an Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, and during the first half of the 1990s\u2014when the last Board was appointed\u2014it released several reports. Those reports made specific recommendations related to responding to abuse or neglect, preventing abuse and neglect (including through implementation of universal voluntary neonatal home visiting and creation of comprehensive neighborhood-based prevention strategies), and prevention of child abuse and neglect related fatalities (including through increased knowledge of the problem, a primary focus on \"safety\" in all child and family programs, interdisciplinary and other efforts to improve investigation and prosecution of child abuse and neglect related fatalities, and improved family preservation and family support services). Support a dditional research or fund other activities related to the prevention and treatment of child abuse and n eglect. In addition to the required research program, the statute gives HHS authority to fund a range of research or other activities intended to advance cross-agency and cross-discipline links in ways that are expected to improve how CPS responds to and serves children and families. These include projects that encourage linkages across child welfare, law, education, health, mental health, and law enforcement agencies, as well as across public and private agencies, including faith-based and community-based groups. The act specifically suggests collaboration efforts to improve school-based prevention, identification, and assessment of child abuse and neglect; \"triage\" procedures in screening and responding to reports of child abuse and neglect; recognition of substance abuse or domestic violence in neglect situations; and better health evaluations and forensic diagnosis of abuse or neglect. ", "Many projects related to improving training or practice for CPS workers and related personnel are listed in the statute. HHS may choose to make grants to, or contracts with, states, public and private agencies or organizations, or a combination of those entities to improve the training of supervisory and non-supervisory child welfare workers, and for training of child protective services workers regarding, specifically, best practices in working with families from initial contact through the completion of an investigation and concerning their legal duties and responsibilities related to protecting the legal rights of children and families. In addition, HHS may provide grants to support development of risk and safety assessment tools for child protective service workers; training for mandated child abuse and neglect reporters; and improvement in the recruitment, selection, and training of volunteers in public or private child, youth, and family service organizations to prevent child abuse and neglect.", "Finally, HHS is explicitly permitted to make grants or enter into contracts with various entities that provide additional supports to, among other activities, (1) establish and operate safe and family-friendly locations for court-ordered and supervised visitation between children and abusing parents and to facilitate the exchange of children for visits with noncustodial parents in domestic violence cases; (2) develop procedures for safe placement of children with kin; (3) establish or maintain a network of mutual parent support and self-help programs; (4) support respite and crisis nursery programs; (5) provide hospital-based information and referral services to parents of children with disabilities, parents of children who have been abused or neglected, and their children; and (6) support other innovative and promising programs related to preventing and treating child abuse and neglect.", "The Children's Bureau typically awards grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements for its required and permitted activities near the end of the fiscal year and a list of awardees can be viewed online.

Prior to this funding becoming available, HHS used general departmental funds to begin a feasibility study and it issued an interim report in early 2009. That report cited a number of barriers to implementation and had four main conclusions: ", "potential benefits of a national child abuse and neglect registry are largely unknown and no data are available to quantify them; the statute provides for voluntary participation by states, and this could result in a registry that includes little information and fails to fulfill its intent; the statute does not permit inclusion in the registry of sufficient information to accurately identify perpetrators (information is limited to an individual's name, and because many names are common, this would result in many misidentified \"perpetrators\"); and the intent of the registry needs to be clarified (is it for child abuse and neglect investigative purposes only or may it also be used for background checks related to employment or licensing?).", "The report also summarizes some issues related to \"due process\" that the creation of a national registry of substantiated child abuse and neglect would raise. These include differences in the level of evidence used to make decisions to substantiate a report of child abuse or neglect; the strength of hearing or appeal procedures in place locally to challenge those decisions; whether individuals included in the registry must be notified that they are included; and the implications of being included on such a registry. It asserts that \"there can be no federal substitute for procedural protections at the state or local level\" and, further, that \"HHS believes the only feasible way to effectively and efficiently provide due process protections is to require that submitting jurisdictions certify that for cases submitted to the national registry, minimum due process protections were available to the perpetrator.\" ", "HHS has awarded the $500,000 for the final study to Walter R. McDonald and Associates (and subcontractor ABA Center on Children and the Law) to continue work on this issue, including studying (1) how common it is for perpetrators to be listed in multiple states' child abuse registries; (2) states' interest in and concerns about participating in a national registry; (3) the data systems containing current state registries; and (4) legal issues involved and the adequacy of states' due process procedures.
