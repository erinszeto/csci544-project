These requirements apply to activities that are within the scope of PHSA Section 330 grant, but do not apply to other activities. HRSA is required to determine whether health center grantees meet these requirements. In 2012, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) raised concerns that the agency may not be providing sufficient oversight of the program and that some health centers may not be meeting these requirements. In response to this GAO report, HRSA implemented new procedures to increase the agency's oversight of the program and to provide training to health centers to better comply with the program's requirements.

Regardless of the magnitude of the difference, there appears to be consensus that health centers provide less costly health care than other outpatient settings.

The authors of the North Carolina study suggest that health centers provide health care at a lower cost because they can offer discounted services through federal programs (see \" Which Federal Programs Are Available to Health Centers? \"). They also suggest that health centers may provide less costly overall care because their providers work on a salaried basis, and so do not have financial incentives to order additional tests or procedures. This may not be the case in other outpatient settings because providers generally work under a fee-for-service model, where they may receive additional remuneration for providing more services. Other studies note that differences in the cost of services (i.e., the fee for a particular procedure or visit) do not explain the difference because health centers are paid the FQHC rate, which should likely be comparable to, or higher than, the rates reimbursed in other outpatient settings.

As such, health centers are a common source of care for Medicaid patients. Recent research found that Medicaid patients were more likely to obtain an appointment at a health center than they were at private primary care practice.

The FQHC designation makes Section 330 grantees (among others; see text box) eligible for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements rates that are generally higher than the reimbursement rates for comparable services provided in a physician's office. In FY2015, these reimbursements represented 47.8% of the Health Center Program's revenue (see Table 4 ). The FQHC designation was created to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements cover the costs of providing services so that Section 330 grant funds are not used to subsidize these costs. This appendix describes Medicare and Medicaid payments to FQHCs. The Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 , as amended) required that a new Medicare payment methodology be developed.

For information about the prior Medicare payment methodology, see CRS Report R42433, Federal Health Centers .", "Medicare Payments to Health Centers ", "Beginning October 1, 2014 (i.e., FY2015), Medicare FQHC payments increased as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs\u2014implemented a prospective payment (PPS) system. This change was required in the ACA because of concerns that Medicare payments did not reflect the FQHC's costs of providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. To develop the PPS, CMS used the Medicare cost report and claims data to ensure that the rate reflects the cost of providing a specific bundle of FQHC services. ", "Under the new PPS, FQHCs are paid the lesser of their actual charges or an encounter rate for professional services furnished to a beneficiary in a single day. Medicare pays 80% of this amount. The beneficiary pays the remainder as part of their required cost sharing for FQHC services. The encounter rate is intended to reflect 100% of the reasonable costs of providing a visit. It was calculated by estimating the reasonable costs that would have occurred for the year if the PPS was not implemented (with certain exceptions, e.g., flu and pneumococcal vaccines because they are paid at 100% of reasonable costs); this estimate was calculated without the application of copayments, per-payment limits, or productivity adjustments that limit Medicare payment to other provider types. ", "The new encounter rate is provided to each FQHC nationwide with a geographic adjustment. It is intended to reflect the type, intensity, and duration of services that FQHCs provide and is adjusted to account for the geographic location of the FQHC. Rates are also adjusted for the initial Medicare visit (i.e., the Welcome to Medicare exam) and for the annual wellness visit, which are determined to be more intensive than a standard visit. With some exceptions (e.g., mental health visit and when an injury occurs subsequent to the medical visit), the encounter rate is only paid to a facility once per day, because CMS determined that multiple visits per day were rare for Medicare beneficiaries. The new encounter rate applies to all services, with certain exceptions (e.g., influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and their administration, which are paid at 100% of reasonable costs). FY2015 was a period of transition to the PPS, which will be updated (in accordance with other Medicare payment updates) annually beginning January 1, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2017, the PPS base payment was updated by 1.8% using the FQHC market basket. ", "Medicare beneficiaries are subject to different deductible and cost sharing requirements for services provided at FQHCs than they would otherwise be if they received the same services in a different setting (e.g., a physician group practice). Specifically, the Medicare Part B deductible does not apply for FQHC services. Beneficiaries not in managed care plans\u2014with some exceptions \u2014must pay the 20% copayment for Medicare services. There are no copayments for preventive services, as required in the ACA. FQHC visits generally include a mix of preventive services (not subject to coinsurance) and services that are subject to coinsurance. To determine which charges will be subject to the coinsurance, CMS subtracts the dollar value of the FQHC's reported line-item charge for the preventive services provided from the full payment amount; Medicare then pays the FQHC 100% of the dollar value of the FQHC's reported line-item charge for the preventive services, up to the total payment amount. Medicare will also pay 80% of the remainder of the full payment amount. The beneficiary would then pay the remainder (the 20% coinsurance). Should the reported line-item charge for the preventive services equal or exceed the full payment amount, Medicare pays 100% of the full payment amount and the beneficiary would not be responsible for any coinsurance.", "The rule that implemented the Medicare PPS also removed the requirement that auxiliary persons\u2014certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers\u2014be employees of the facility in order for the FQHC to bill Medicare for services that are provided \"incident to\" the services of physicians. ", "Medicaid Payments", "Medicaid uses a PPS to reimburse FQHCs for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. The PPS establishes a predetermined per-visit payment rate for each FQHC (which differs from Medicare where there is a national rate) based on costs of services. The PPS was established based on cost report data in FY1999 and FY2000 and is updated annually for medical inflation. The state, in turn, receives the appropriate federal matching amount. States are also required to adjust PPS payment rates based on any changes in the scope of services provided at the FQHC. States are not required to use the PPS to reimburse FQHCs, but they may not reimburse an FQHC less than it would have received under the PPS. In 2015, according to NACHC, approximately 25 states and the District of Columbia used the PPS, 11 states used an alternative payment methodology (APM) to reimburse FQHCs under Medicaid, and 12 states used a combination of both methods. States using APMs generally use cost-based reimbursements and do so as a way of exploring payment reform options that include FQHCs. FQHCs are required to agree to receive the different rate. ", "States are also required to supplement FQHCs that subcontract (directly or indirectly) with Medicaid Managed Care Entities (MCEs). These supplemental payments are supposed to make up the difference, if any, between the payment received by the FQHC from the MCE and the Medicaid payment that the FQHC would be entitled to under the PPS or the APM.
