In previous years, Congress provided funds over and above limits on discretionary appropriations by designating additional appropriations as being for emergency needs. Budget authority provided in this manner did not count against funding limitations on discretionary spending in budget resolutions. ", "Although the BCA included legislation allowing for emergency appropriations, the new law included provisions that outlined separate treatment for disaster relief, as distinct from emergency funding. Funding designated as disaster relief in future spending bills could be \"paid for\" by adjusting upward the discretionary spending caps. This allowable adjustment for disaster relief is limited, however, to an amount based on the 10-year rolling average of what has been spent by the federal government on relief efforts for major disasters.", "This disaster relief allowable adjustment for FY2013 is $11.8 billion. Under the terms of the continuing resolution signed into law on September 28, 2012 ( P.L. 112-175 ), the amount of disaster relief that would be provided under the BCA if the CR extended for the year was $6.4 billion. The Administration proposed using the remainder of the allowable adjustment for disaster relief in its supplemental request, and using an emergency funding designation to ensure the remaining resources provided through the request do not count against the FY2013 budget caps.", "The Administration proposed designating all of the supplemental funding it sought as an emergency requirement, with the exception of a portion of the request for the DRF, which would be designated as being for disaster relief under the BCA. The Administration noted in the letter accompanying the request that it was unclear how much of the disaster relief allowable adjustment might be available pending the finalization of general FY2013 appropriations, and that therefore these numbers could require adjustment. Senate-passed H.R. 1 proposed that $5,379 million in DRF funding be designated as being for disaster relief under the BCA, with all but $3,461 million (for Army Corps of Engineers construction activities) of the remaining funding in the bill designated as emergency funding.", "P.L. 113-2 contains $41,669 million in emergency funding, $5,379 million for the DRF designated as disaster relief, and $3,461 million for Army Corps of Engineers construction activities that would count against the discretionary budget caps."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "P.L. 113-2 Appropriations by Subcommittee", "paragraphs": ["This section of the report is organized by alphabetically by subcommittee of jurisdiction.

Three of the four programs that received funding under the President's proposal and P.L. 113-2 are for emergency land assistance and typically only receive funding through supplemental appropriations bills, rather than annual appropriations bills. The fourth is a nutrition assistance program. While the President's request and P.L. 113-2 are similar, they are not identical. The difference between the two is that the President's proposal would have provided $150 million for watershed protection mitigation efforts, while P.L. 113-2 added this $150 million to watershed response and recovery. The Senate bill would have divided the $150 million for mitigation between all four programs proposed under response and recovery.", "The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) are administered by the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA). ECP assists landowners in restoring the productivity of agricultural land damaged by natural disaster. Participants are paid a percentage of the cost to restore the land to a productive state. EFRP assists private forestland owners with damage caused by a natural disaster on nonindustrial private forest land. Both the President's request and P.L. 113-2 provided $15 million for ECP and $23 million for EFRP; the Senate bill would have provided approximately $25 million and $59 million, respectively. Following Hurricane Sandy, USDA made $15.5 million in previously appropriated ECP funds available to producers in counties that received a major disaster declaration pursuant to the Stafford Act. According to press releases, producers in counties without a declaration were still encouraged to sign up in the event that future funds were made available (further discussed below). Similarly, USDA announced that no funding is available under EFRP; likewise, producers were encouraged to apply if future funding becomes available.", "The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program and the EWP floodplain easement program are administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The EWP program assists sponsors, landowners, and operators in implementing emergency recovery measures for runoff reduction and erosion prevention to relieve imminent hazards to life and property created by a natural disaster. The EWP floodplain easement program is a mitigation program that pays for permanent easements on private land in order to safeguard lives and property from future floods, drought, and the products of erosion. The President's proposal would have provided $30 million for EWP recovery and response and $150 million for EWP floodplain easements for mitigation. P.L. 113-2 did not include funding for EWP floodplain easements and instead added $150 million to the general EWP program. Similarly, Senate-passed H.R. 1 did not include funding for EWP floodplain easements, but rather would have provided the equivalent of the President's proposed $150 million to the other USDA programs proposed for funding response and recovery efforts, including $125 million for general EWP. Following Hurricane Sandy, USDA released $5.3 million in prior appropriated EWP funds to 11 states to respond to imminent hazards to life and property. The EWP floodplain easement program has not received funding since FY2009 and has no current funding available for mitigation.", "The emergency agricultural land assistance programs are funded through supplemental appropriations, rather than annual appropriations. As a result, funding for emergency agricultural land assistance varies greatly from year to year. These programs traditionally do not require a federal disaster designation from either the President or a state official. Recent changes in appropriations and budget law, however, have altered how disaster funding for the programs may be used. Funding appropriated in FY2012 was to be used for major disasters declared pursuant to the Stafford Act. This same Stafford Act requirement was present in P.L. 113-2 with the additional requirement that funding may only be used for expenses related to the consequences of Hurricane Sandy.

The Senate bill would have allocated more funding to repairs, replacement, and enhancement of equipment and facilities. P.L. 113-2 , like the Senate bill, allocates more funding to repairs, replacement, and enhancement of equipment and facilities. Specifically, the Administration requested $360.0 million under the ORF account to assess risks associated with storms and flooding, provide technical assistance to improve preparedness and resiliency in coastal communities, improve forecast and modeling capabilities to support mitigation efforts, and stabilize and restore ecosystems. The Administration requested $13.0 million under the ORF account to repair or replace damaged weather observation, weather radio, and ocean observing assets and facilities belonging to the National Ocean Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and National Weather Service.

The Senate bill and P.L. 113-2 as enacted both designated Corps funding as an \"emergency requirement,\" with the exception of the Corps Construction Account funding. Thus, while the bills' funding for the Corps Construction Account counted against discretionary budget caps, their funding for other Corps accounts did not count against the caps. ", "For the Investigations account, the President requested $30 million, while the Senate-passed H.R. 1 and P.L. 113-2 both provided $50 million.

The two bills differed in their direction regarding the use of the funding. P.L. 113-2 designated the overall funding allocation for rehabilitation, repair, and construction of Corps projects, while Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have provided the funding for these same efforts as they relate to the \"consequences of natural disasters.\" It would have also allowed for the transfer of up to $499 million in funds to other Corps accounts \"to address damages from previous natural disasters, following normal policies and cost sharing.\" P.L. 113-2 included no such provision.

The enacted bill provided that any project \"under study\" by the Corps in the North Atlantic Division for reducing flooding and storm damage in areas affected by Sandy that the Secretary determines is \"technically feasible, economically justified, and environmentally feasible,\" is eligible for funding, provided House and Senate appropriations committees approve such a recommendation. Eligibility for the construction funding in Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have been based on the study demonstrating \"that the project will cost-effectively reduce those risks and is environmentally acceptable and technically feasible.\" ", "The three proposals also differed in their approach to construction cost sharing. The construction costs of Corps projects for flood control and coastal storm damage reduction generally are shared 65% federal, 35% nonfederal (33 U.S.C. 2213), with the nonfederal entity receiving credit toward its share for the provision of lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and disposal areas (known collectively as LEERDs). Senate-passed H.R. 1 proposed to alter this practice, and instead required that nonfederal sponsors provide 10% of project costs, plus the LEERD costs. P.L. 113-2 included a waiver for ongoing construction activities to be undertaken at 100% federal expense. This waiver applied only to ongoing construction activities funded by the bill, not for other construction projects. Both bills allowed nonfederal costs to be repaid over a 30-year period. Both bills waived a requirement for congressional approval for projects that exceed 120% of their authorization of appropriations under \u00a7902 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2280).", "Other differences between the three proposals included differences in the Corps Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE) accounts. While the President had requested $899 million for the O&M account, both P.L. 113-2 and Senate-passed H.R. 1 provided $821 million. This account includes expenses for dredging of navigation channels and project repair. P.L. 113-2 limited availability for these funds to expenses related to the consequences of Hurricane Sandy, while O&M funding in Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have been available nationally.

Therefore, under Senate-passed H.R. 1 , remaining FCCE funds would have been available to support Corps emergency expenditures nationwide, including emergency operations preparations for future events. P.L. 113-2 also set aside $430 million to restore projects impacted by Hurricane Sandy to their \"design profiles,\" but made these funds contingent on completion of one of the major studies required pursuant to language in the Investigations Account. Both bills also waived FCCE project cost limits under \u00a7902 of WRDA 1986, similar to the proposed provisions for the Construction Account. ", "Finally, both P.L. 113-2 and Senate-passed H.R. 1 provided $10 million for the Corps and Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) expenses for oversight of emergency response and recovery activities.

However, P.L. 113-2 did not specify\u2014as Senate-passed H.R. 1 did\u2014how the funds should be disbursed between salaries and expenses and grants for cooperative agreements. With respect to grants for cooperative agreements and technical assistance, P.L. 113-2 retained the provision to waive matching requirements that was proposed in Senate-passed H.R. 1 . The designated recipients of the cooperative agreements and grants differed between the two bills. H.R. 1 would have explicitly directed the grants and cooperative agreements for only current recipients of grants and cooperative agreements. P.L. 113-2 , on the other hand, directed the grants and cooperative agreements for small businesses that are recovering from Hurricane Sandy. Both P.L. 113-2 and H.R. 1 contained provisions to expedite the delivery of assistance. H.R. 1 would have expedited the delivery of assistance by using a process that relied, to the maximum extent practicable, upon previously submitted documentation. P.L. 113-2 did not mention the use of previously submitted documents as a method for expediting assistance.

Similarly, all of the $810.0 million in Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have been allocated to CWSRF ($700.0 million) and DWSRF ($110.0 million) capitalization grants. The Administration had requested $600.0 million for clean water and drinking water SRF capitalization grants but did not specify an allocation between the two, and $10.0 million for wetlands restoration and other ecosystem enhancements. The Administration stated that legislative language would be needed to target the $600.0 million for the SRF capitalization grants to the affected states for mitigation projects. While no specific language accompanied the Administration's request, P.L. 113-2 contained several terms and conditions for the EPA STAG account.", "P.L. 113-2 included a requirement that the states use not less than 20% but not more than 30% of the SRF capitalization grant funds to provide additional subsidization to SRF loan recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants, or any combination of these. Senate-passed H.R. 1 had included a requirement that the states must use not less than 50% of the capitalization grant funds for this purpose.

Neither of these provisions was included in P.L. 113-2 . ", "Two other accounts that received funding in P.L. 113-2 also contained specific terms and conditions. One account is in the NPS, while the second is in the DOI, Office of the Secretary. First, both the law and H.R. 1 similarly conditioned appropriations for the NPS Historic Preservation Fund, which provides funds for restoring historic districts, sites, buildings, and objects significant in American history and culture. They limited funding to expenses related to the consequences of Hurricane Sandy, including costs to administer the program and costs to states to ensure compliance with Section 106 of the Historic Preservation Act. Section 106 requires federal agencies to consider the effects of projects they carry out, approve, or fund on historic properties. They also stated that grants could be provided only in areas that have a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act, and that grant recipients would not be required to provide a match for federal funding, which typically is required. ", "Second, the law and Senate-passed H.R. 1 contained differing provisions for the DOI Office of the Secretary, Departmental Operations, regarding the purposes for which the funds are to be used. The provision in H.R. 1 was broader. Under both the law and H.R. 1 , for instance, DOI bureaus and offices are to use funds for necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricane Sandy, but under H.R. 1 they also could have been used for other activities related to storms and natural disasters. Under both the law and H.R. 1 , funds also are to be used for increasing the capacity of coastal habitat and infrastructure to withstand storms, and for restoring and rebuilding parks, refuges, and other public assets. However, the law specified that these entities are to be national/federal. Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have provided for other uses of the funds, namely protecting natural and cultural values, and assisting state, tribal, and local governments. Other language in the law and H.R. 1 as passed the Senate was similar. In particular, both measures authorized the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the funds to any account in the Department, and required the Secretary to submit to the Appropriations Committees a detailed spending plan for the funds within 60 days of enactment. ", "Finally, provisions of the law prohibited the use of funds for two different purposes. First, one provision barred the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture from using funds in the bill to acquire land.

However, P.L. 113-2 used a different approach from the other two measures to appropriate these funds. The request and Senate-passed H.R. 1 called for the $800 million to be appropriated directly to the three separate HHS appropriations accounts. By contrast, P.L. 113-2 appropriated the full $800 million directly to one of the accounts (the PHSSEF), requiring the HHS Secretary to transfer portions of these funds to the other programs and activities in amounts largely consistent with the request: $500 million to the SSBG, $100 million to the Head Start program, at least $5 million to the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and the remaining $195 million to the HHS Secretary for other activities.

The PHSSEF is an account managed by the HHS Secretary and used by appropriations committees to fund certain emergency management activities, and to provide one-time funds through emergency supplemental appropriations. It is not authorized in law except through annual appropriations, and has no accompanying regulations or guidance. PHSSEF funds are intended for transfer to HHS institutes, agencies, and offices to carry out activities specified in appropriations laws. The President requested $200 million to the PHSSEF for transfer to support a number of health-related activities throughout HHS, including (1) National Institutes of Health (NIH) grantees for losses to their NIH-funded biomedical research programs; (2) substance abuse and mental health programs; (3) environmental and public health support; and (4) other activities the Secretary deems necessary for response and recovery from storm-related damage. Senate-passed H.R. 1 largely followed this approach. P.L. 113-2 provided $800 million (the entire HHS amount) to the PHSSEF, for transfer as noted above, specifying that of the $200 million for health-related activities, at least $5 million be transferred to the HHS OIG, and the remaining $195 million to other accounts within HHS as determined by the Secretary. The latter amount may be used, in unspecified amounts, for repair and rebuilding of non-federal biomedical research facilities (presumably NIH grantees). PHSSEF funds may not be used for costs that are reimbursable by FEMA or covered by insurance.", "The President's request and P.L. 113-2 both included $500 million for the SSBG at the HHS Administration for Children and Families. The SSBG is a flexible source of funding used by states to support a wide variety of social services, ranging from child care to special services for the disabled. The request called for the $500 million to be directly appropriated to the SSBG, while P.L. 113-2 called for these funds to be transferred to the SSBG from an $800 million appropriation to the PHSSEF. Both the request and P.L. 113-2 included special language targeting supplemental SSBG funds to states directly affected by Hurricane Sandy (i.e., waiving the statutory allocation formula) and allowing states to use these funds for the provision of health services (including mental health services), and costs of renovating, repairing, or rebuilding health care facilities, child care facilities, and other social services facilities. In addition, P.L. 113-2 included several other provisions applicable to the SSBG. For instance, the law gives states up to three years to expend these funds, one year longer than the SSBG's standard two-year expenditure period. In addition, as with other funds in the PHSSEF appropriation, P.L. 113-2 allows SSBG funds to be used for obligations incurred prior to the bill's enactment (provided these costs align with purposes specified in the bill) and prohibits these funds from being used for costs that are reimbursable by FEMA or covered by insurance. Senate-passed H.R. 1 included similar (though not always identical) provisions, along with several others not enacted in P.L. 113-2 .

The Head Start program provides comprehensive early childhood development services to low-income children. The request called for the $100 million to be directly appropriated to Head Start, while P.L. 113-2 called for these funds to be transferred to Head Start out of the $800 million appropriation to the PHSSEF. The request specified that funds would be made available to affected Head Start agencies for costs of renovating, repairing, or rebuilding damaged facilities, as well as for certain services for affected children and families, including costs of transporting children enrolled in now-closed centers to other Head Start programs. P.L. 113-2 did not include any language about damaged Head Start facilities or affected children. However, the overall PHSSEF appropriations language made it clear that these funds are for disaster response and recovery in affected states. To this end, P.L. 113-2 included language explicitly waiving the statutory Head Start allocation formula and clarifying that funds awarded from this supplemental appropriation would not be considered part of a Head Start program's \"base grant\" in subsequent fiscal years.

The new Federal Transit Administration Emergency Relief Program may provide grantees this flexibility, as both Congress and recent administrations have provided similar flexibility for the Federal Highway Administration Emergency Relief Program.

However, P.L. 113-2 included two exceptions related to environmental review requirements. Specifically, it allowed CDBG disaster fund grantees who use their funding to meet certain FEMA matching requirements to adopt, without public review, environmental reviews performed by other federal agencies. In cases where a grantee has already performed an environmental review or the activity or project is excluded from an environmental review, P.L. 113-2 explicitly allowed for the expedited release of funds. The law also allowed HUD to reduce, from 70% to 50%, the percentage of funds that must be targeted to activities benefiting low and moderate income (LMI) persons, and allows HUD to reduce the LMI-targeting requirement below 50% only if the grantee can demonstrate a compelling need.

In general, the impact of this full provision would have depended on how the relevant federal agencies interpreted and implemented the directive to inform their plans, and how recipient project sponsors interpreted and implemented the directive to consider these increased risks. It is possible, for example, that a requirement, or choice, to take into account the risks delineated in the provision could have resulted in the need for new flood hazard maps that reflect new flood insurance zones based on the future impact of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and coastal flooding; and also possibly new floodplain management standards requiring communities under the NFIP that reflect new land-use planning and construction standards in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA).

The Administration also requested that the mitigation portion include legislative provisions that would allow monies to be flexibly transferred between programs.

Mitigation capabilities include, but are not limited to, community-wide risk reduction projects; efforts to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure and key resource lifelines; risk reduction for specific vulnerabilities from natural hazards or acts of terrorism; and initiatives to reduce future risks after a disaster has occurred.", "If one relies on these definitions, the key difference between recovery funding and mitigation funding may be that the mitigation funding will be explicitly directed to \"initiatives to reduce future risk after a disaster has occurred.\" However, some of the activities outlined in the Administration's proposal as \"mitigation\" appeared to be orientated towards \"recovery and repair,\" and vice versa. For example, the Administration proposed $400 million in mitigation funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service's Resource Management account that would be used, among other purposes, for \"restoring and enhancing natural systems on State, local and private lands.\" Further, the Administration's proposal for mitigation funds did not include at least one noteworthy program most traditionally linked with hazard mitigation, that being FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund. ", "When Congress considered supplemental funding for Hurricane Sandy, it did not follow the Administration's format for providing a distinction between funding for \"mitigation\" and the funding for \"repair and recovery.\" In Senate-passed H.R. 1 there was no distinct chapter or title that separately funded accounts for mitigation. As H.R. 152 worked its way through the House on its way to enactment, $17.1 billion was identified by the House Appropriations Committee as being for \"immediate needs.\" An amendment provided $33 billion in additional funds, but the distinction between the \"immediate needs\" and other assistance was not clearly split between \"repair and recovery\" and \"mitigation. Provisions in H.R. 152 as it passed the House included \"mitigation\" as part of the purpose of the funds, without separating that purpose from recovery. In another circumstance, provisions in Senate-passed H.R. 1 specifically identified subset of funds from the total appropriation to an account that may be used exclusively for \"mitigation.\" In addition, Sections 1104 and 1105 of Senate-passed H.R. 1 , which were general provisions applying to all funds in the legislation, would have encouraged funds provided in the bill to be used in a manner that mitigates future risks.", "Requested funding levels are provided by appropriations account in Table A-1 , below.
