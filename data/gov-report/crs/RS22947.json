{"id": "RS22947", "title": "The Marines\u2019 Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV): Background and Issues for Congress", "released_date": "2011-03-14T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) is an armored amphibious vehicle program that originated two decades ago to replace the 1970s-era Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV). Like current AAVs, the EFV is designed to roll off a Navy amphibious assault ship, move under its own power to the beach, and cross the beach and operate inland. The EFV has experienced a variety of developmental difficulties, resulting in significant program delays and cost growth. The EFV is currently in its second systems design and development (SDD) phase attempting to improve the EFV's overall poor reliability and performance that it demonstrated during its 2006 operational assessment. On January 6, 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced, based on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy and Commandant of the Marine Corps, that he would recommend the cancellation of the EFV. Secretary Gates also reaffirmed the Marines' amphibious assault mission and pledged to fund future efforts to acquire a more affordable and sustainable replacement and also to upgrade existing amphibious assault vehicles.", "The Marines originally planned to procure 1,025 EFVs at a total cost of $8.5 billion, but increasing costs compelled the Marines to reduce their procurement to 573 EFVs. Each EFV was expected to cost about $24 million apiece, and there were concerns that the high cost of the EFV could consume up to 90% of the Marines' ground equipment budget. There has been congressional opposition to Secretary Gates's decision to cancel the EFV. Despite the Marines' agreement to cancel the program, some Members reportedly believe that the EFV is central to the Marines' ability to launch an amphibious assault far enough off shore to protect the fleet. Other Members have also suggested that the EFV cancellation would lead to eliminating hundreds of high-skilled manufacturing jobs, as well as hurting local economies in states and districts associated with the EFV program.", "The Marines, a little more than a month after Secretary Gates's EFV cancellation announcement, initiated a new competition to upgrade existing AAVs and develop a successor to the EFV (previously called the New Amphibious Assault Vehicle [NAV] but now called the Amphibious Combat Vehicle [ACV]). The Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James Amos, has committed the Marine Corps to fielding the ACV within four years. General Dynamics, the EFV's developer, suggests that it would be more affordable to \"finish what's already been started,\" and build 200 EFVs and save the amount of money that it will take to terminate the program.", "The Marines did not submit a budget request for FY2012 funding for the EFV. Instead, FY2011 and FY2010 funds will be used to cover termination costs as well as complete ongoing testing and developmental work, to include delivery of EFV-related software.", "Potential issues for Congress include the possible evaluation of General Dynamics' proposal to build only 200 EFVs, which it contends would save $6 billion. Another issue is a possible examination of EFV technologies that the Marines plan to incorporate into the ACV to help to ensure that there is \"value added\" by these technologies and that they meet \"cost-benefit\" criteria. Another possible issue is the Marines' plan to field the ACV in four years, which could be considered by some as overly ambitious. Navy and Pentagon officials stated that the soonest that the ACV would be ready was 2024, while the Commandant of the Marines Corps has committed the Marines to field the ACV in four years.

If the Marines need armored fighting vehicles in the early stages of an amphibious landing, these vehicles must either be transported by landing craft with limited protection against enemy fire, or the armored vehicle must come ashore under its own power. Like current AAVs, the EFV is designed to roll off a Navy amphibious assault ship, move under its own power to the beach, and cross the beach and operate inland. The EFV is designed to be launched 25 miles off shore (the AAV can be launched only 2 miles from shore) permitting the fleet to operate \"over the horizon,\" where it theoretically would be less vulnerable to enemy fire. There are concerns that the 25-mile over the horizon operating capability may no longer provide the protection to the fleet that it once did. One example of such lack of protection is the 2006 Hezbollah C-802 cruise missile attack against an Israeli ship where two missiles were fired, with one hitting the Israeli warship, which was about 10 miles from shore, and the second missile striking an Egyptian ship 36 miles from shore.

It is intended to have a 20-knot speed in the water and a 345-mile range ashore with a 45-kilometer-per-hour speed on hard-surfaced roads. The EFV is to be designed to have modular armor and expanded mine blast protection and mount a 30mm high-velocity cannon in a stabilized turret. The EFV is also supposed to be able to communicate in joint networks and operate as part of a joint land force. There are to be two EFV variants. The EFV-P1 would carry a Marine rifle squad and its equipment and provide direct fire support during combat operations.

In 1995, the program entered into the Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) phase, where it was considered by many to be a \"model defense acquisition program,\" winning two DOD awards for successful cost and technology management. In June 1996, a contract was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems to begin full-scale engineering development of their design. Based on the aforementioned early success of the program, the Marine Corps awarded a cost-plus contract to General Dynamics in July 2001 for the Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the program. General Dynamics and the Marines envisioned that the SDD phase would be completed by October 2003, a schedule that some say \"proved too ambitious.\" In 2003, the Marines renamed the program the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Problems During the SDD Phase", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that:", "The program did not allow enough time to demonstrate maturity of the EFV design during SDD. The original SDD schedule of about three years proved too short to conduct all necessary planning and to incorporate the results of tests into design changes. Specifically, the original schedule did not allow adequate time for testing, evaluating the results, fixing the problems, and retesting to make certain that problems are fixed before moving forward.", "Because of these and other difficulties, the EFV program was \"rebaselined\" in November 2002, adding an additional year to the program schedule, and then rebaselined again in March 2003, also adding another year to the program schedule. In December 2004, EFV prototypes experienced major failures of the hull electronics unit (HEU), the vehicle's main computer system. These failures caused the water-mode vehicle steering to freeze, making the vehicle non-responsive. The EFV also experienced significant problems in September and October 2004 with the bow flap\u2014a folding panel extended forward to generate additional hydrodynamic lift as the EFV moves through the water. The EFV experienced a myriad of hydraulics system failures, leaks, and pressure problems during testing that contributed to low reliability ratings. Because of reliability problems, the originally required 70-hour mean time between operational mission failure (MTBOMF) rate for the EFV was reduced by the Marines to 43.5 hours. Because of these demonstrated failures and related concerns about a lack of program management and oversight, the program was rebaselined for a third time in March 2005, this time adding an additional two years to the extra two years added during the previous rebaselinings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2006 Operational Assessment14", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, the EFV was subject to an Operational Assessment\u2014a series of tests to demonstrate that it could meet performance requirements\u2014that, if successfully completed, would permit the program to move into the production phase. During this assessment, the EFV experienced numerous critical failures and, because of repeated breakdowns, the EFV failed to meet reliability requirements and failed the assessment. For example, during the test, the vehicles were able to operate for only 4.5 hours between breakdowns and required about 3.4 hours of corrective maintenance for every 1 hour of operation\u2014a maintenance burden that evaluators said would \"wear out a unit under realistic combat operations.\" Poor reliability also resulted in 117 Operational Mission Failures and 645 Unscheduled Maintenance Actions during testing. The EFV's low reliability resulted in the EFV completing 2 out of 11 attempted amphibious tests, 1 out of 10 gunnery tests, and none of the 3 scheduled land mobility tests. The EFV prototypes tested were approximately 1,900 pounds too heavy to achieve the desired high water speed and, in some circumstances, could not accommodate equipment needed by Marines for special climatic conditions. Evaluators also noted significant problems in terms of limited visibility, excessive noise, and difficulty in reloading the EFV's main gun."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EFV Redesign", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of 2006 Operational Assessment, the Marines \"went back to the drawing board.\" In February 2007, the EFV program office issued a \"sources sought\" notice, requesting information from industry leaders on \"tracked combat vehicles that can provide an alternative design concept of the EFV\"\u2014a perceived vote of no confidence in General Dynamics by the Marines. Also that month, the Navy formally advised Congress that the EFV program would incur a cost breach, requiring program recertification under the Nunn-McCurdy Act (10 U.S.C. 2433). Finally, in late February 2007, the Navy announced that it would have to relax EFV performance and reliability requirements in order for the program to continue. In March 2007, the Marines modified the original SDD contract and awarded General Dynamics an additional $143.5 million to redesign the EFV. In what has been termed \"the largest program setback,\" the Marines decided in June 2007 to repeat the entire SDD phase, meaning that instead of the original completion date of 2003, the SDD phase\u2014if successful\u2014would now be completed in 2011, eight years behind the original schedule. In August 2008, the Marines and General Dynamics signed an SDD II contract, and work on seven new EFV prototypes was projected to begin in January 2009. These new prototypes were to include, inter alia, rewired electronics to better protect against sea water, a rebuilt and strengthened gun turret to improve ammunition feed to the main gun, and the addition of trim tabs to make the EFV more stable in the water.

Because the EFV's design has been stabilized, a number of critical manufacturing processes can be established. Because the EFV passed the CDR, the go-ahead was given for the production of the seven new prototypes. These new prototypes are expected to include almost 400 engineering design improvements to improve vehicle reliability. It is likely that many of these engineering design improvements will add weight to the EFV.

The Marines suggest that installing an add-on underbelly armor appliqu\u00e9 after the EFV comes ashore will provide necessary protection. Marine officials also suggest that IEDs would not be a big concern during the initial stages of an operation and the EFV's mobility would provide protection from IEDs. It might be argued, however, that the Marines are assuming away the EFV's vulnerabilities by suggesting that the enemy would not employ IEDs against Marine forces coming ashore and that the EFV could \"out run\" IEDs\u2014something that has eluded smaller and faster combat vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Questions the Need for the EFV", "paragraphs": ["During an April 17, 2009, address at the Naval War College, Secretary of Defense Gates noted that: ", "I have also directed the QDR [Quadrennial Defense Review] team to be realistic about the scenarios where direct U.S. military actions would be needed \u2013 so we can better gauge our requirements.
