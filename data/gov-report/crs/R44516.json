Congress appropriates funds for this program in Title VI (Other Department of Defense Programs) of the defense appropriations bill. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program supports activities to destroy the U.S. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and costs associated with storage. Funds for this program are requested through the Defensewide Procurement appropriations request. Congress appropriates funds for this program also in Title VI. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports the procurement, operation and maintenance, and research and development of the nation's naval reserve fleet and supports a U.S. flagged merchant fleet that can serve in time of need. The RDT&E funding for this effort is requested in the Navy's Procurement request and appropriated in Title V (Revolving and Management Funds) of the appropriation bill.", "The Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund (JIDF, formerly the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund) also contains RDT&E monies. However, the fund does not contain an RDT&E line item as do the programs mentioned above. The Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO), which administers the fund, tracks (but does not report) the amount of funding allocated to RDT&E. JIDF funding is not included in the table below.", "RDT&E funds also have been requested and appropriated as part of DOD's separate funding to support efforts in what the Bush Administration termed the Global War on Terror (GWOT), and what the Obama Administration refers to as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Typically, the RDT&E funds appropriated for GWOT/OCO activities go to specified Program Elements (PEs) in Title IV. However, they are requested and accounted for separately. The Bush Administration requested these funds in separate GWOT emergency supplemental requests. The Obama Administration, while continuing to identify these funds uniquely as OCO requests, has included these funds as part of the regular budget, not in emergency supplementals. However, the Obama Administration has asked for additional OCO funds in supplemental requests, if the initial OCO funding is not enough to get through the fiscal year. The OCO budget declined as operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were reduced. ", "In addition, GWOT/OCO-related requests/appropriations often include money for a number of transfer funds. These have included in the past the Iraqi Freedom Fund (IFF), the Iraqi Security Forces Fund, the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Congress typically makes a single appropriation into each of these funds and authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts, including RDT&E, at his discretion. These transfers are eventually reflected in Title IV prior year funding figures. ", "For FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $71.392 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E. This is $1.423 billion (2.2%) above the enacted FY2016 level. ", "In addition to the baseline Title IV RDT&E request, the Administration requested $823 million in RDT&E through the Defense Health Program and $389 million in RDT&E through the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program for FY2017. President Obama requested no RDT&E funding in FY2017 for the National Defense Sealift Fund. ", "RDT&E funding can be analyzed in different ways. Each of the military departments request and receive their own RDT&E funding. So, too, do various DOD agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), collectively aggregated within the Defensewide account. RDT&E funding also can be characterized by budget activity (i.e., the type of RDT&E supported). Those budget activities designated as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development, respectively) constitute what is called DOD's Science and Technology Program (S&T) and represent the more research-oriented part of the RDT&E program. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components (e.g., the Joint Strike Fighter or missile defense systems), for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including support for test and evaluation facilities. Budget activity 6.7 supports the development of system improvements in existing operational systems. ", "Many congressional policymakers are particularly interested in S&T funding since these funds support the development of new technologies and the underlying science. Some in the defense community see ensuring adequate support for S&T activities as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority into the future. The knowledge generated at this stage of development may also contribute to advances in commercial technologies.", "President Obama's FY2017 request for Title IV baseline S&T funding was $12.501 billion, $495 million below the FY2016 enacted baseline level ($535 million below the FY2016 level including OCO funding).", "Within the S&T program, basic research (6.1) receives special attention, particularly by the nation's universities. DOD is not a large supporter of basic research when compared to NIH or NSF. However, over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities, and it represents the major source of funds in some areas of science and technology (such as electrical engineering and materials science). The Administration is requesting $2.102 billion for DOD basic research for FY2017. This is $207 million (9.1%) less than what was enacted for FY2016. ", "On December 10, President Obama signed into law the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 114-254 ).

Division B, Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, includes additional funding for DOD RDT&E, designated by Congress as GWOT/OCO funding. This funding includes $78.7 million for Army RDT&E and $3.0 million for Defense-wide RDT&E, as well as $87.8 million for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund, a portion of which may be used to support RDT&E.", "On June 16, 2016, the House passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017 ( H.R. 5293 ).

Discretionary funding for R&D on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) was to increase by 42.6%, with increases requested for all major EERE programs. Within EERE, the largest requested increases were for Vehicle Technologies ($469 million, up from $310 million) and a new Crosscutting Innovation Initiatives program ($215 million). The latter was to support new regional and small business partnerships, business accelerators that leverage the capabilities of the national laboratories, and funding opportunities for \"off-roadmap\" R&D projects.

Although a mission to Europa was a high priority of the 2011 National Research Council (NRC) decadal survey of planetary science, the NRC expressed reservations about its anticipated cost. For several years, Congress has appropriated more for formulation of a Europa mission than NASA has requested. As directed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, NASA's FY2017 congressional budget justification included a five-year estimate of the funding required assuming a 2022 launch. The justification stated that \"the notional outyear profile in the Budget may support a launch as early as the late 2020s, assuming the mission concept and scope remain stable.... Acceleration of the launch to 2022 is not recommended, given potential impacts to the rest of the Science portfolio.\" The House report recommended at least $260 million for Europa orbiter and lander missions, with the orbiter launch no later than 2022 and the lander launch no later than 2024. The Senate report called for \"an expeditious launch and reduced travel time\" in order to maximize the scientific return of a Europa mission, but it did not specify a funding level or a launch date. It directed NASA to provide a report on options for the mission \"to assist the Committee in evaluating potential mission configurations.\" The final explanatory statement provided $275 million \"as outlined by the House\" and explicitly omitted the Senate language regarding an analysis of options.", "The FY2017 request for Aeronautics was $790 million, an increase of 24.7% from FY2016. The request included New Aviation Horizons (NAH), a new initiative of experimental aircraft and systems demonstrations. NAH projects on subsonic aircraft were to receive $100 million in mandatory funding from the proposed 21 st Century Clean Transportation Plan. An additional $56 million in mandatory funding was to fund a low-boom supersonic flight demonstrator. The House bill would have provided $78 million less than the request for Aeronautics, while the Senate bill would have provided $189 million less. The House committee's recommendation included $61 million (of discretionary funds) for a low-boom demonstrator. The House and Senate committee reports both directed NASA to work with the Federal Aviation Administration on research related to the integration of unmanned aerial systems in the National Airspace System.

Space Technology was first established as a separate account in FY2011. Each year since then, the Administration has proposed to increase Space Technology funding. Congress has provided increases each year except FY2014, but always less than the Administration's request. Proposed mandatory funding of $136 million accounted for almost all of the requested increase in FY2017. The bulk of the mandatory funding was to support technology demonstration missions, including the Restore-L satellite servicing mission for which Congress appropriated $133 million in FY2016. The House bill would have provided $88 million less than the request for Space Technology, or $48 million more than the FY2016 appropriation, while the Senate bill would have provided the FY2016 amount. The Senate committee report recommended $130 million (of discretionary funds) for Restore-L. The House and Senate committee reports both identified nuclear propulsion research and a small launch technology demonstration platform as funding priorities.

The account previously also funded development of a commercial crew transportation capability for U.S. astronaut access to the International Space Station (ISS), but Congress transferred this activity to Space Operations in FY2016. Within Exploration, the FY2017 request for Orion, the SLS, and related ground systems (known collectively as Exploration Systems Development) was $2.860 billion, a decrease of 21.5% from FY2016. The bulk of the proposed reduction was for SLS launch vehicle development, which was to receive $1.263 billion, down 34.3% from $1.922 billion in FY2016. At the time of the FY2017 budget release, NASA was targeting a first test flight of SLS carrying Orion but no crew (known as EM-1) in November 2018; that schedule has since slipped to 2019. The launch readiness date for the first flight of Orion and the SLS with a crew on board (known as EM-2) continues to be FY2023. The House and Senate bills would have provided $4.183 billion and $4.330 billion, respectively, for Exploration. These increases relative to the request would have funded the SLS at the FY2016 level (in the House bill) or higher (in the Senate bill).

Commercial Crew is now part of the Space Transportation budget item, which also includes the cost of U.S. commercial cargo flights to the ISS and payments to Russia for Soyuz flights carrying ISS crews. The House and Senate bills would have provided $186 million less and $125 million less, respectively, than the request for Space Operations. For the most part, the committee reports did not specify how the recommended funding should be allocated. However, the Senate report did note that its total included $1.185 billion for Commercial Crew, the same as the request.
