Electromagnetic waves include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma radiation. The allocation and assignment of radio frequency spectrum are managed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for commercial and other nonfederal uses and by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for federal government use. ", "Wireless broadband, with its rich array of services and content, requires new spectrum capacity to accommodate growth. Spectrum capacity is necessary to deliver high speed, high quality communications to consumers and businesses and also to support the communications needs of industries that use spectrum-dependent technologies.", "Although radio frequency spectrum is abundant, usable spectrum is currently limited by the constraints of applied technology. Spectrum policy therefore requires making decisions about how radio frequencies will be allocated and who will have access to them. Current spectrum policy is based on managing channels of radio frequencies to avoid interference. The FCC, over many years, has developed and refined a system of exclusive licenses for users of specific frequencies. Auctions are a market-driven solution to assigning licenses to use specific frequencies and are a recent innovation in spectrum management and policy. Previously, the FCC granted licenses using a process known as \"comparative hearings\" (also known as \"beauty contests\"), and has used lotteries to distribute spectrum licenses. The FCC also allocates spectrum for designated purposes, such as Wi-Fi, without assigning a license to a specific owner (unlicensed spectrum).", "For purposes of allocation and assignment, spectrum is segmented into bands of radio frequencies measured in cycles per second, or hertz. Standard abbreviations for measuring frequencies include kHz\u2014kilohertz or thousands of hertz; MHz\u2014megahertz, or millions of hertz; and GHz\u2014gigahertz, or billions of hertz. The designation can refer to an entire band, such as the 700 MHz band, or to specific frequencies within a band. Most licenses are issued on a geographic basis, serving a specific area (license coverage). More than one license, therefore, is likely to have the same frequency designation. ", "Technology for commercial mobile services generally is designed to operate most efficiently on frequencies below 3 GHz, although the ceiling has moved higher as technology has changed, so that frequencies through 5 GHz are now considered desirable for commercial network deployment. Similarly, the bandwidth of assigned frequencies is increasing.

The outcome of the forward auction for spectrum licenses depends on the results of the reverse auction in which the broadcasters agree to the price at which they will release spectrum. For the results of a forward auction to be valid, auction proceeds must at a minimum cover (1) payments to broadcasters that relinquished spectrum for auction, (2) the costs to the FCC of conducting the auctions, and (3) the estimated costs for relocation of other broadcasters, which are not to exceed $1,750 million, deposited in a TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund for relocation costs.

In particular, the NTIA was criticized during the hearing by some committee members for not separately evaluating the 1755-1780 MHz band, which might be auctioned separately with another spectrum band already available for commercial use. At the hearing, the GAO provided testimony regarding its preliminary findings on spectrum sharing and followed up with a report. Both the hearing and the report indicated that spectrum sharing technology and policies were largely undeveloped. Some of the options to encourage sharing spectrum, as identified by the GAO, include considering spectrum usage fees to provide economic incentive for more efficient use and sharing; identifying more spectrum that could be made available for unlicensed use; encouraging research and development of technologies that can better enable sharing; and improving and expediting regulatory processes related to sharing.

Links are connected to a high-speed landline either at a business location or through hotspots. Hotspots are typically located in homes or convenient public locations.", "New technologies are being developed by companies in various industry sectors to expand the usefulness of unlicensed spectrum without causing interference. For example, to use unassigned spectrum, known as white spaces, between broadcasting signals of digital television, geolocation database technology is being put in place to identify unencumbered airwaves. Similar technologies will be used to expand the availability of spectrum for unlicensed use at 5 GHz. Commercial providers, such as for wireless Internet, currently share parts of the spectrum at 5 GHz with federal users. With the objective of improving future WiFi capacity, the Spectrum Act required new studies and evaluations of frequencies at 5 GHz.

The FCC decided to set caps on the amount of spectrum any one company could control in any geographically designated market. The FCC's support of spectrum capping was based on the theory that each license has an economic value and a foreclosure value. The economic value is derived from the return on investment in spectrum licenses and network infrastructure. The foreclosure value is the value to a wireless company that already has substantial market share and wants to keep its dominant position by precluding competition. Spectrum caps were chosen as the method to prevent foreclosure bidding. The intent was to ensure multiple competitors in each market and to restrict bidding to only the licenses that could be used in the near term.", "Beginning in 2001, spectrum policy placed increased emphasis on promoting spectrum and market efficiency. The FCC ruled to end spectrum caps, citing greater spectral efficiency from larger networks as one benefit of the ruling. Spectrum caps were seen as barriers to mergers within the wireless industry, to the growth of existing wireless companies, and to the benefits of scale economies. The spectrum caps were eliminated on January 1, 2003. Auction rules requiring the timely build-out of networks became a key policy tool to deter hoarding.

How this approach might be implemented and how limitations might affect auction revenue have been the topic of spirited debate. Numerous position papers have argued effectively that any form of spectrum cap would depress auction revenues or, from a different perspective, that spectrum caps would have no impact on revenue and might even enhance it. The Department of Justice has filed comments regarding the important role of spectrum access for competition and innovation. It has urged the FCC to promulgate auction rules that would prevent bids based on the foreclosure value of spectrum and that would enhance bidding opportunities for smaller carriers. ", "A separate FCC Report and Order will establish new guidelines on the amount of spectrum that any one carrier may hold. The FCC plans to apply its new criteria to the incentive auction by placing restrictions on bidding activity intended to handicap the ability of Verizon and AT&T to acquire licenses in certain areas. The majority of the 700 MHz band commercial licenses were purchased at auction in 2008 (Auction 73) by Verizon and AT&T, which together also hold approximately 70% of commercial spectrum licenses below 1000 MHz. The other two national carriers, Sprint (majority-controlled by SoftBank, Corp., a Japanese telecommunications provider) and T-Mobile, Inc. (majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, AG), own 15% of commercial licenses below 1000 MHz. Although Sprint and T-Mobile are generally viewed as the primary beneficiaries of the bidding rules, the rules are also intended to provide opportunities for smaller carriers to bid successfully. Based on the amount of spectrum released by the broadcasters, a block of spectrum will be set aside in each market with bidding priority for Sprint, T-Mobile, and any entrant deemed not to have national network coverage. If, for example, 60 MHz of spectrum is made available by broadcasters, 20 MHz will be reserved; as described by the staff report, all registered bidders would be eligible to compete for licenses not acquired in priority bidding as well as in the remaining 40 MHz.

Presently, small businesses with average gross revenue of no more than $40 million in the preceding three years receive a credit of 15%. A very small business, with revenue of $15 million or less over three years, receives a credit of 25%. Rules governing eligibility for designated entity status include restrictions on the use of spectrum assets acquired through a successful bid at auction.

Among the rules reevaluated are those for AMR, which the FCC believes may be discriminating against entrepreneurs that have formed partnerships with larger companies.
