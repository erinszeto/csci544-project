Nevertheless, the rule of grand jury secrecy is subject to a number of exceptions, both codified and judicially crafted, that permit grand jury information to be disclosed in certain circumstances (usually only with prior judicial authorization). Perhaps the most significant of these for congressional purposes are (1) the exception that allows a court to authorize disclosure of grand jury matters \"preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,\" and (2) the exception, recognized by a few courts, that allows a court to authorize disclosure of grand jury matters in special or exceptional circumstances.

By the late 17th century, legal scholars had begun to recognize the need for secrecy in most matters pertaining to grand jury inquiries\u2014including the identities of subjects and witnesses, the evidence collected, and the plans and deliberations of the jury\u2014in order to realize the additional aims of preserving juror independence, sussing out witness bias and mendacity, and allowing evidence to be fully developed.", "When the right to grand jury indictment crossed the Atlantic Ocean from England to the American colonies, the rule of grand jury secrecy came with it. Prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the federal courts developed a fairly robust, though not unyielding, conception of grand jury secrecy at common law. Secrecy challenges most often arose in the context of criminal defendants' motions to dismiss their indictments on the grounds that the evidence considered by the grand jury could not justify the charges or that some type of misconduct had occurred. Recognizing that these motions called for inspecting records of the proceedings before the grand jury, courts typically acknowledged that they had the discretionary power to permit such inspection \"in the furtherance of justice\" but found that the power should be \"sparingly exercised\" in light of the traditional rule of secrecy. Thus, although a number of courts identified a theoretical imperative for \"removing the veil of secrecy whenever evidence of what has transpired before [the jury] becomes necessary to protect public or private rights,\" courts often declined to engage in such unveiling based merely on a defendant's \"general allegations\" or a potential \"fishing expedition.\"", "Nevertheless, when deemed \"essential\" to \"the purposes of justice,\" some courts would consider evidence of what occurred before a grand jury to determine whether an indictment against a criminal defendant should be dismissed. This unveiling apparently reflected an understanding that grand juries served not only an investigative function in furtherance of the governmental interest in law enforcement, but also as a \"protector of citizens against arbitrary and oppressive governmental action.\" Thus, as these decisions suggested, disclosure could be appropriate when continuing secrecy would be inconsistent with the citizen-protective function."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Overview", "paragraphs": ["\"[T]he federal courts' modern version\" of the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy is established by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), in effect since 1946 and amended numerous times over the following 60 years. The Supreme Court has recognized that Rule 6(e) simply \"codifie[d]\" the pre-existing common law requirement \"that grand jury activities generally be kept secret,\" an \"integral part of [the United States] criminal justice system.\" An Advisory Committee Note reflects this understanding, making clear that the Rule \"continues the traditional practice of secrecy . . . except when the court permits a disclosure.\"", "Courts have identified five principal justifications underlying Rule 6(e)'s secrecy requirement:", "1. to prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated; 2. to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent persons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors; 3. to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may testify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it; 4. to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have information with respect to the commission of crimes; 5. to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact that he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial where there was no probability of guilt.", "At the time of its adoption, Rule 6(e) ensured the secrecy of grand jury proceedings by authorizing \"[d]isclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury\" in only limited circumstances. First, such matters \"other than [the jury's] deliberations and the vote of any juror\" automatically could be disclosed to \"the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties.\" Beyond this, \"a juror, attorney, interpreter or stenographer\" could disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only with court authorization (1) \"preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,\" or (2) \"at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury.\"", "Amendments to Rule 6(e) from 1966 to 2014 have sought, among other things, to align the Rule's text with court-developed exceptions and clarifications that have sometimes extended beyond the literal terms of the version of the Rule in force at a given point in time. The current iteration of Rule 6(e) establishes a general rule of secrecy by setting out a list of persons, including grand jurors and attorneys for the government, who \"must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury\" unless the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \"provide otherwise.\" Rule 6(e) then \"provide[s] otherwise\" by listing complex exceptions to the prohibition. The exceptions generally fall into two categories: (1) disclosures permitted without judicial authorization, and (2)\u00a0disclosures permitted with judicial authorization.", "In the first category, persons prohibited by the Rule from disclosing matters occurring before the grand jury may nevertheless disclose such matters (other than grand jury deliberations or grand juror votes) to an attorney for the government \"for use in performing that attorney's duty\" and to non-attorney \"government personnel\" who are needed to help a government attorney enforce federal criminal law. Government attorneys may also disclose such matters (1) to another federal grand jury; (2) to federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration, national defense, or national security officials only with respect to matters involving foreign intelligence or counterintelligence; and (3) to \"any appropriate . . . government official\" only with respect to matters involving threats of attack or intelligence gathering by foreign powers or threats of sabotage or terrorism.", "In the second category of exceptions, the court under whose auspices the grand jury was empaneled may authorize disclosure of a grand jury matter (1) preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding; (2) to a defendant who shows grounds may exist to dismiss the indictment because of something that occurred before the grand jury; or (3) at the request of the government, to a foreign court or prosecutor or to an \"appropriate\" state, state-subdivision, Indian tribal, military, or foreign government official for the purpose of enforcing or investigating a violation of the respective jurisdiction's criminal law.", "Beyond the express terms of Rule 6(e), three circuits and a number of district courts have held that courts have inherent authority to disclose grand jury materials in situations where an enumerated Rule 6(e) exception is not otherwise applicable, though the authority may be exercised only in rare or special cases. Additional Rules and statutes also permit disclosure in particular circumstances.", "When a court-authorized disclosure is at issue, the person or entity seeking grand jury information must make a \"strong showing of particularized need\" that \"outweighs the public interest in secrecy.\" If that showing is made, the court may authorize disclosure \"at a time, in a manner, and subject to any other conditions that it directs.\"", "The following sections of this report provide more detail on the various provisions of Rule 6(e)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Persons Subject to Rule 6(e)", "paragraphs": ["Rule 6(e)(2)(B) lists eight categories of persons who \"must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury\" unless an exception applies:", "1. grand jurors; 2. interpreters; 3. court reporters; 4. operators of recording devices ; 5. persons who transcribe recorded testimony; 6. attorneys for the government; 7. government personnel needed to assist attorneys for the government; 8. persons authorized to receive grand jury materials under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3322.", "In other words, the Rule generally imposes an obligation of secrecy on each person permitted to be present while the grand jury is in session, as well as certain persons given access to grand jury information. Yet there is a notable exception to this general imperative: though a \"witness being questioned\" is authorized by Rule 6(d) to be present during grand jury proceedings (for obvious reasons), grand jury witnesses are not included on the list of persons precluded from disclosing grand jury matters. Viewed in conjunction with Rule 6(e)(2)(A)'s admonition that \"[n]o obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with Rule 6(e)(2)(B),\" the Rule by its plain terms does not obligate grand jury witnesses to maintain the secrecy of the proceedings or their testimony. An Advisory Committee note to the original adoption of Rule 6(e) supports this reading, stating that \"[t]he rule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on witnesses.\" According to the note, such an obligation would constitute \"an unnecessary hardship [that] may lead to injustice if a witness is not permitted to make a disclosure to counsel or to an associate.\" Court decisions generally have been in accord, although a handful of courts have taken the position that an order requiring a witness to refrain from discussing grand jury matters may be entered in rare circumstances when justified by a compelling need. Courts taking this position have relied on \"inherent judicial power\" to \"protect the integrity of the grand jury process,\" which the adoption of Rule 6(e) ostensibly did not undermine.", "Though a witness is ordinarily free to disclose grand jury information of which he is aware, witnesses cannot be compelled to disclose such information to investigation targets or in separate proceedings. Relatedly, courts have recognized that federal prosecutors may request (but not demand) that witnesses refrain from disclosing the existence of a subpoena or their testimony.", "Because Rule 6(e)'s language suggests that the list of persons prohibited from disclosing grand jury matters is exclusive, unlisted third parties who obtain grand jury information\u2014even from persons obligated to maintain grand jury secrecy\u2014are also generally not required to keep the information secret. That said, a court authorizing a disclosure under a Rule 6(e) exception may impose a condition that further disclosures not be made, subject to First Amendment limitations.", "At least one court has observed that courts themselves are not included on the list of those who must refrain from \"disclos[ing] a matter occurring before the grand jury\" under Rule 6(e)(2)(B), interpreting this omission to mean that courts have inherent authority to release grand jury materials regardless of whether a textual exception to grand jury secrecy in Rule 6(e) otherwise applies. This judicial \"inherent authority\" exception, which the Supreme Court has never endorsed, is discussed in more detail infra in the section addressing exceptions to grand jury secrecy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disclosure of Matters Occurring Before the Grand Jury", "paragraphs": ["Rule 6(e) prohibits only \"disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury.\" Accordingly, the Rule is not contravened unless something is \"disclos[ed],\" meaning that a person \"with information about the workings of the grand jury . . .

Clear examples include transcripts of proceedings and witness testimony, as well as written \"summaries\" or \"discussions\" of the proceedings or evidence presented. Information about the composition and focus of the grand jury\u2014including the identities of witnesses and jurors, the targets and subjects of the investigation, and even the dates and times a grand jury is in session \u2014are also covered by the Rule.", "Particular challenges arise in the context of documents such as business records that have been subpoenaed or considered by the grand jury but do not on their face relate to the grand jury itself. In general, \"[t]here is no per se rule against disclosure of any and all information which has reached the grand jury chambers,\" and thus \"[t]he mere fact that information [or documents have] been presented to the grand jury\" does not bar independent disclosure in other proceedings. For example, an agency or litigant may seek corporate records directly from a company, and the company has no basis to claim that the records are insulated from disclosure simply because a federal grand jury separately has subpoenaed them.", "However, utilizing various (and sometimes conflicting) tests, courts have acknowledged that independently generated documents presented to a grand jury may sometimes constitute \"matters occurring before the grand jury\" in a particular case if the context of a request would make production revelatory of the substance of the grand jury's investigation. For instance, a request for \"documents subpoenaed by the grand jury\" might impermissibly call for disclosure of grand jury matters, as production \"would reveal to the requester that [the documents] had been subpoenaed\" and potentially suggest the focus of the grand jury's investigation. By contrast, a request for documents presented to a grand jury, when coupled with broader requests for \"all evidence\" or documents related to a factual matter, would not necessarily call for disclosure of grand jury matters if production would leave the requester unable to \"determine which documents,\" if any, \"had been submitted to the grand jury.\" The framing of a particular request for documents, and the context in which the request is made, will thus impact whether documents presented to or obtained by a grand jury are considered \"matters occurring before\" it within the meaning of Rule 6(e).", "One court has addressed the difficulty inherent in parsing when and to what extent documents subpoenaed or reviewed by a grand jury constitute grand jury \"matters\" by applying a presumption that \"confidential documentary information not otherwise public obtained by the grand jury by coercive means\" is covered by the Rule. A party seeking disclosure may rebut the presumption, however, \"by showing that the information is public or was not obtained through coercive means or that disclosure would be otherwise available by civil discovery and would not reveal the nature, scope, or direction of the grand jury inquiry.\" In practice, then, the showing required to rebut the presumption may result in an inquiry similar to that employed by other courts.", "In addition to the substance of grand jury matters themselves (e.g., transcripts of testimony), Rule 6(e) protects against the indirect revelation of grand jury matters in ancillary proceedings and filings, such as hearings or orders addressing claims of privilege or efforts to quash a subpoena. The Rule provides that the court must \"close any hearing\" and keep \"[r]ecords, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand-jury proceedings\" under seal \"to the extent and as long as necessary\" to prevent unauthorized disclosure of a grand jury matter. Arguing that the public ordinarily has a First Amendment or common law right of access to criminal proceedings, members of the media have sometimes sought to obtain sealed records and orders notwithstanding these provisions, but multiple circuits have rejected such efforts.", "The prohibition on disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury is indefinite\u2014in other words, the veil of secrecy is not lifted merely because a grand jury has completed its investigation and either issued an indictment or declined to do so. That said, because some of the \"interests\" underlying the rule of secrecy are \"reduced\" once a grand jury's work is completed, the passage of time may be relevant to whether a court will authorize disclosure pursuant to a Rule 6(e) exception in a particular case."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Exceptions to Grand Jury Secrecy", "paragraphs": ["Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3) contains a series of \"[e]xceptions\" to the general rule of grand jury secrecy that permit disclosure of grand jury matters to specified persons or in certain situations.

One question that has arisen is the extent to which employees of private entities that are controlled by or connected to the government may be considered \"government personnel.\" The few cases addressing this question have tended to find that purely private entities and contractors are excluded from the Rule, though a \"quasi-governmental entity\" that has both public and private attributes may not be, \"depending on the facts of the situation.\"", "As the text of the Rule indicates, government personnel to whom disclosure of information is made may use that information only to assist government attorneys in enforcing federal criminal law.

In recognition of the potentially expansive application of the new exceptions, the Rule stipulates that any official to whom a disclosure is made \"may use the information only as necessary in the conduct of that person's official duties subject to any limitations on the unauthorized disclosure of such information.\" Additionally, with respect to state, local, Indian tribal, and foreign government officials, Rule 6(e) provides that they may \"use the information only in a manner consistent with any guidelines issued by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence.\" Finally, within a \"reasonable time after\" any disclosure is made under Rule 6(e)(3)(D), an attorney for the federal government must file a sealed notice with the court indicating that \"such information was disclosed\" and identifying \"the departments, agencies, or entities to which the disclosure was made.\"", "Despite the facial breadth of the recently added exceptions, it does not appear that they have yet been subject to substantial judicial scrutiny or interpretation. At least one commentator, however, has anticipated that a constitutional challenge is inevitable, given the degree to which the exceptions impact grand jury secrecy (and thus potentially undermine the Fifth Amendment's grand jury requirement)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Disclosures with Judicial Authorization", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disclosure Related to a Judicial Proceeding", "paragraphs": ["Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(E)(i) permits a court to authorize disclosure of a grand jury matter \"preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\" This exception, which has been part of the Rule since its inception in 1946, is one of the most frequently litigated.", "An oft-cited definition of the term \"judicial proceeding\" comes from an early U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit opinion: \"[A]ny proceeding determinable by a court, having for its object the compliance of any person, subject to judicial control, with standards imposed upon his conduct in the public interest, even though such compliance is enforced without the procedure applicable to the punishment of crime.\" Criminal and civil litigation qualify as judicial proceedings, but so too may quasi-judicial matters such as impeachment proceedings and certain disciplinary hearings. Purely administrative or nonjudicial investigations or hearings, on the other hand, typically do not qualify.", "One question that has arisen is whether the grand jury investigation itself is a \"judicial proceeding\" such that a court may permit materials generated by the investigation to be disclosed for use in connection with those proceedings. Answering this question in the affirmative would, for example, allow an expert witness to review grand jury material prior to testifying before the grand jury. Some courts have concluded either that a grand jury investigation is a judicial proceeding for these purposes or that it is \"preliminary\" to a judicial proceeding\u2014the criminal trial that would follow indictment. Consistent with this approach, said criminal trial generally has been viewed as a judicial proceeding permitting disclosure of materials from the underlying grand jury, though there is authority to the contrary. Conversely, courts have rejected the argument that a proceeding instituted primarily or solely to obtain grand jury materials can itself be considered the \"judicial proceeding\" needed to justify disclosure, recognizing that such a reading of the exception would be circular and \"rule-swallowing.\"", "With respect to the \"preliminarily to or in connection with\" requirement, the Supreme Court has said that the relevant inquiry is the use for which the grand jury information is being requested: \"the Rule contemplates only uses related fairly directly to some identifiable litigation, pending or anticipated.\" Thus, \"it is not enough to show that some litigation may emerge from the matter in which the material is to be used, or even that litigation is . . . likely to emerge . . . . If the primary purpose of disclosure is not to assist in preparation or conduct of a judicial proceeding, disclosure . . . is not permitted.\" What this limitation on the exception means is that a request for grand jury materials pursuant to a preliminary inquiry or investigation does not come within the scope of the exception where the prospect of a judicial proceeding stemming from the investigation is merely speculative. That said, an administrative or other investigative inquiry may be considered \"preliminar[y]\" to a judicial proceeding if \"a clear pathway exists\" between that process \"and the judicial process and the ultimate judicial role is a very substantial one.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disclosure to Defendant on Showing of Ground to Dismiss Indictment", "paragraphs": ["Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(ii) permits a court to order disclosure \"at the request of a defendant who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury.\" Along with the \"judicial proceeding\" exception, this exception is the only other mechanism for seeking court authorization to disclose grand jury materials that has been in the Rule since its inception in 1946.", "There is a strong \"presumption of regularity\" in grand jury proceedings, and thus a defendant requesting court authorization for disclosure under this exception carries a heavy burden in seeking to make the requisite showing.

For example, indictment dismissal may be warranted where the prosecutor secures the indictment by actively misleading the grand jury about key evidence, but mere failure to present evidence favorable to the defendant will not justify dismissal.", "Second, to make the requisite showing that one of the above-mentioned grounds exists, the defendant must do more than make \"conclusory or speculative allegations of misconduct.\" Rather, the defendant must identify a factual basis for inferring that misconduct warranting indictment dismissal has occurred. At least one court has described this as an \"exceedingly high burden.\" For this reason, courts rarely grant requests by defendants under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(ii), as \"a defendant often can make the necessary showing only with the aid of the [very] materials he seeks to discover.\" Defendants have, at times, pointed out this conundrum, but courts have not been particularly sympathetic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disclosure to a Foreign Court or Prosecutor", "paragraphs": ["Under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(iii), a court \"at the request of the government\" may authorize disclosure of a grand jury matter \"when sought by a foreign court or prosecutor for use in an official criminal investigation.\" This provision was added to the Rule as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and appears to have been intended to address uncertainty as to whether a foreign criminal investigation could be considered \"preliminar[y] to . . . a judicial proceeding\" within the meaning of that separate exception.

Thus, based solely on Rule 6(e)'s text and general principles of statutory construction, it would seem that courts can authorize disclosure of grand jury matters only if one of the express exceptions in Rule 6(e) applies. Some courts have appeared to agree with this proposition, at least in the abstract.", "Nevertheless, a number of federal courts have determined that the list of court-authorized exceptions in Rule 6(e) is not exclusive, and that courts have \"inherent authority\" to permit disclosure of grand jury information and materials in circumstances not expressly provided for in the Rule. Courts in this camp have pointed to various justifications for recognizing such extra-textual judicial authority to breach grand jury secrecy, including that", "courts have always had supervisory authority over the grand juries that they impanel, which historically included the discretion to determine when grand jury materials should be released; the advent of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure did not eliminate a court's supervisory authority as a general matter, meaning that courts may still take certain actions that are consistent with, though not explicitly authorized by, the Rules; Rule 6(e)(2)(B)'s list of persons who are prohibited from disclosing a matter occurring before the grand jury does not include the court itself; Rule 6(e)(3)(E)'s list of circumstances in which a court \"may\" authorize disclosure does not indicate that those circumstances are exclusive, and the presence of limiting language elsewhere in Rule 6 suggests its absence in (e)(3)(E) was intentional; and the history of the Rules and Advisory Committee notes indicates that Rule 6(e) was meant to be responsive to and reflective of common exceptions that courts developed of their own volition over time.", "Fearing that an exception to grand jury secrecy not textually constrained could undermine secrecy writ large, courts recognizing their \"inherent authority\" to release grand jury materials in situations not governed by Rule 6(e) have generally cabined the exercise of such authority to \"special\" or \"exceptional\" circumstances. Though a determination that such circumstances exist is \"highly discretionary and fact sensitive,\" factors that courts have considered include", "the identity of the party seeking disclosure; whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes the disclosure; why disclosure is being sought in the particular case; what specific information is being sought for disclosure; how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that of their families; the extent to which the desired material\u2014either permissibly or impermissibly\u2014has been previously made public; whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might be affected by disclosure are still alive; and the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.", "The circumstances in which courts have most often ordered disclosure of grand jury materials using their inherent authority have involved matters of significant public or historical interest related to grand jury proceedings that have long since concluded. For instance, one district court in the District of Columbia recently unsealed certain dockets associated with the 1998 investigation into the relationship between former President Clinton and a White House intern, citing the length of time that had elapsed and the substantial public interest in the information.", "Although the trend appears to be in favor of recognizing a court's extra-textual inherent authority to release grand jury materials, at least in exceptional circumstances, there is some reason to question whether the Supreme Court would agree that this authority exists if faced squarely with the question. Setting aside the text of Rule 6(e) and the general principles discussed above, the Supreme Court in recent years has expressed \"reluctan[ce] to invoke the judicial supervisory power as a basis for prescribing modes of grand jury procedure,\" as the grand jury's status as an independent constitutional fixture \"suggest[s] that any power federal courts may have to fashion\" such procedures \"is a very limited one[.]\" These statements have led one treatise to refer to the existence of judicial inherent authority to release grand jury materials beyond the terms of Rule 6(e) as \"exceedingly doubtful.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Showings Required for Court Authorization to Disclose Grand Jury Matters", "paragraphs": ["Although Rule 6(e) enumerates the contexts in which a court is authorized to order disclosure of grand jury matters, courts have had to grapple with determining what standard governs the exercise of a court's discretion to order disclosure in a particular case\u2014that is, the showing a requester must make in order for a court to agree that releasing grand jury material is warranted under one of the exceptions for court-authorized disclosure in Rule 6(e).", "The Supreme Court has said that \"disclosure is appropriate only in those cases where the need for it outweighs the public interest in secrecy,\" and \"the burden of demonstrating this balance\" rests on the party seeking disclosure. Put differently, the secrecy of grand jury proceedings \"must not be broken except where there is a compelling necessity,\" and the \"instances when that need will outweigh the countervailing policy\" of secrecy \"must be shown with particularity\" by the requester.", "From these general principles has emerged the standard that Rule 6(e) \"require[s] a strong showing of particularized need for grand jury materials before any disclosure will be permitted.\" The Supreme Court announced the contours of this so-called \"particularized need\" standard in the context of the \"judicial proceeding\" exception to Rule 6(e), explaining that \"[p]arties seeking grand jury transcripts under Rule 6(e) must show that the material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding, that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and that their request is structured to cover only material so needed.\"", "When the cases describing the \"particularized need\" standard were decided, the only Rule 6(e) exceptions permitting a court to authorize disclosure of grand jury matters were (1) the \"judicial proceeding\" exception, and (2) the exception for a defendant upon showing grounds to dismiss the indictment. As the number of Rule 6(e) exceptions permitting court-authorized disclosure has grown over time, however, one question that has arisen is whether and how the Supreme Court's \"particularized need\" standard applies outside of the \"judicial proceeding\" context in which it was announced. Courts have typically recognized that the general requirement imposed on a requester to show a need for the grand jury materials at issue extends to any exception authorizing court-ordered disclosure. This requirement, whether given the appellation \"particularized need\" or not, will obligate a person seeking court authorization for disclosure to show some factual exigency outweighing the interest in secrecy, which will vary depending on the precise exception being invoked. Thus, for example and as discussed above, a defendant seeking an order authorizing disclosure under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(ii) must be able to present a factual basis for inferring that misconduct that would warrant dismissal of the indictment has occurred, and a government attorney seeking authorization under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(iv) must show that the grand jury matter for which disclosure is sought may disclose a violation of State, Indian tribal, or foreign criminal law. Likewise, courts addressing whether to authorize release of grand jury materials pursuant to their inherent authority engage in \"a nuanced and fact-intensive assessment\" of whether the need for the materials is greater than the need to maintain secrecy.", "Courts considering whether a \"particularized need\" exists in a given case have emphasized that although the standard is \"highly flexible,\" a showing of \"mere relevance, economy, and efficiency will not suffice\" to meet it. Thus, the inquiry often focuses on the contemplated use of the materials at issue and whether alternative channels exist to obtain them. In the context of judicial proceedings, the need to impeach or refresh the recollection of a witness is a well-recognized and valid need, so long as the need is \"real\" and not merely a \"bald assertion[.]\" Other needs that courts have found valid include (1) to substantiate malicious prosecution allegations based on prosecutorial and witness misconduct; (2) to rehabilitate a witness at trial after he has been impeached on cross-examination; and (3) to avoid stymieing an investigation of official improprieties. On the other hand, the mere desire to discover what evidence the grand jury considered has been held to be insufficient. ", "Consistent with the flexible and fact-dependent nature of the \"particularized need\" inquiry, the Supreme Court has said that \"as the considerations justifying secrecy become less relevant, a party asserting a need for grand jury transcripts will have a lesser burden in showing justification.\" Thus, factors courts consider in weighing need against the interest in secrecy may include (1) the nature of the materials sought; (2) whether the requester is a government official or a private party; (3) the time that has elapsed between the grand jury proceedings and the request for disclosure; and (4) whether, in the case of witness testimony or documents, the witness objects to disclosure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Disclosures Authorized by Another Statute or Rule", "paragraphs": ["Despite the general presumption of grand jury secrecy established by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), other federal statutes and procedural rules sometimes permit (or even mandate) disclosure of grand jury information in particular circumstances.

The Rule provides that unless the court in which the petition is filed\u2014that is, the court in the district where the grand jury convened\u2014\"can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper,\" it must transfer the matter to the district where the separate judicial proceeding is pending for determination. This provision reflects \"a preference for having the disclosure issue decided by the grand jury court,\" while recognizing that that court may be unable to reach a decision because it \"will have no first-hand knowledge of the litigation in which the transcripts allegedly are needed, and no practical means by which such knowledge can be obtained.\"", "To facilitate resolution by the transferee court, the grand jury court must transmit to the transferee court \"the material sought to be disclosed, if feasible, and a written evaluation of the need for continued grand jury secrecy.\" The first requirement \"facilitate[s] timely disclosure if it is thereafter ordered\" and assists the transferee court \"in deciding how great the need for disclosure actually is.\" The Rule does not require transmittal of the grand jury material if it is impracticable to do so, as, for example if the material is \"exceedingly voluminous.\" The requirement of a written evaluation of the need for continuing secrecy recognizes that the grand jury court \"is in the best position to assess the interest in continued grand jury secrecy in the particular instance,\" and it is thus \"important that the court which will now have to balance that interest against the need for disclosure receive the benefit of the [grand jury] court's assessment.\"", "Upon transfer, the same persons specified in Rule 6(e)(3)(F) must be given a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard.

First, in In re Grand Jury Investigation of Ven-Fuel , the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House of Representatives' Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce petitioned a district court for an order authorizing disclosure of documents presented to a federal grand jury in Florida in the course of its investigation of possible criminal conduct by a company called Ven-Fuel, Inc. The court recognized that the subcommittee's request implicated \"the powers and operations of the coequal, but interdependent, branches of the federal government . . . over theoretical fault lines,\" but concluded there was no \"direct conflict\" because the subcommittee's legitimate legislative purpose in seeking the documents meant that it was \"entitled to disclosure\" regardless of grand jury secrecy rules.", "Ten years after the decision in Ven-Fuel , the issue of congressional access to grand jury materials came before a different court in connection with the potential impeachment of a federal judge. The judge had been indicted for conspiring to solicit a bribe to influence a judicial decision, causing the House of Representatives to introduce a resolution calling for his impeachment. The resolution was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, which subsequently requested that the district court deliver all records of the grand jury that had indicted the judge. The judge objected, but the district court concluded that the committee was entitled to the records for several reasons, one of which was that, in accordance with Ven-Fuel , a \"congressional investigation relating to the impeachment of a federal judge\" falls within the authorized legislative activities \"embraced\" by the Speech or Debate Clause.", "Criticizing the decision in Ven-Fuel , other courts have sharply disagreed with the conclusion that the Speech or Debate Clause provides a basis to ignore grand jury secrecy when Congress is the requester. In In re Grand Jury Investigation of Uranium Industry , for instance, the Senate Judiciary Committee petitioned a court for an order authorizing disclosure of documents in the possession of the Department of Justice related to its investigation of the uranium industry. The committee's interest in the documents apparently stemmed from the fact that an expansive grand jury investigation conducted by the department's Antitrust Division had yielded no indictments. In seeking court-ordered disclosure of the grand jury materials, the committee asserted, among other things, that it was not required to establish the applicability of a Rule 6(e) exception or make a showing of particularized need because the Speech or Debate Clause entitled it to the materials. The court, however, considered \"the suggestion that Rule 6(e) does not apply to disclosures to Congress\" to be \"[un]acceptable.\" The court noted that Rule 6(e) \"contains no reservations in favor of Congress\" and rejected the Ven-Fuel court's suggestion that the Speech or Debate Clause may be \"used as a sword to enable Congress to penetrate an otherwise secret function of one of the other branches.\" While, in the court's view, the Clause would protect Congress from collateral interference if it were attempting to \"acquire materials which it has a legal right to obtain,\" the Clause would not sanction expansion of Congress's legal rights \"to manufacture a new right to obtain grand jury materials\" that could be affirmatively employed.", "As the court in Uranium Industry recognized, the Ven-Fuel decision's reliance on the Speech or Debate Clause as a font of constitutional authority permitting congressional access to grand jury materials finds little support in the broader case law on the Clause. Though the Clause functions to protect congressional activity, including lawful use of the subpoena power, from judicial interference when such activity is challenged by a third party, courts have not viewed the Clause to constitute a sword that Congress may use to affirmatively seek judicial authorization for disclosure of information in the possession of a coordinate branch. That said, the extent to which the rule of grand jury secrecy applies more generally along the \"theoretical fault line[]\" that exists between executive branch activity and Congress's Article I investigative authority remains unsettled. It is worth noting in this regard that although Congress's power to obtain information for legitimate legislative purposes is broad, it is not limitless.", "Though no federal appellate courts have spoken directly to the issue, decisions addressing the now-lapsed independent counsel statute appear to lend some support to the position that Congress enjoys no special constitutional solicitude in obtaining otherwise-secret grand jury materials. That statute required a duly appointed independent counsel to file a pre-termination \"final report\" with the court \"setting forth fully and completely a description of the work of the independent counsel,\" and the statute permitted the court to release \"to the Congress, the public, or any appropriate person, such portions of [the] report . . . as the division of the court considers appropriate.\" In several decisions considering whether to authorize such release of independent counsel reports to Congress and the public, the D.C. Circuit has recognized that Rule 6(e) applies to an independent counsel, meaning that \"any release of grand jury material\" in the final report authorized by statute \"falls within the protective provisions\" of the Rule unless an exception applies. Nevertheless, the court has read a provision of the independent counsel statute permitting a court to authorize disclosure of the report as establishing a \"judicial proceeding\" such that release of the report may fall within that exception to Rule 6(e). Pursuant to the exception, the court has proceeded to consider multiple factors in deciding whether to authorize the report's release. In other words, rather than finding an independent constitutional entitlement to grand jury material when faced with the question of whether to authorize the release to Congress of a report containing such material, the D.C. Circuit has simply applied Rule 6(e). It could be argued, however, that because these cases did not involve a congressional subpoena, the court was not faced with a direct exercise of Congress's constitutional power of inquiry. ", "The Department of Justice, for its part, agrees that it may release grand jury material to Congress in response to a subpoena only to the extent that disclosure is permitted under Rule 6(e). It takes the opposite position from the Ven-Fuel court with respect to separation-of-powers implications when Congress requests grand jury material: in the department's view, recognizing a congressional \"independent right of access\" to grand jury material would amount to \"legislative encroachment into the Executive's exclusive authority to enforce the law.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requests for Materials Not Constituting Grand Jury Matters", "paragraphs": ["Assuming that Rule 6(e) does apply to congressional requests, it is clear that Congress may nevertheless obtain materials that do not constitute \"matters occurring before the grand jury\" within the meaning of the Rule.", "Rule 6(e) protects from disclosure only those materials that \"tend to reveal some secret aspect of the grand jury's investigation.\" Thus, where a congressional committee has an interest in the subject matter of an ongoing grand jury investigation, the committee may be able to obtain most, if not all, of the same evidence the grand jury is considering from other sources.", "For instance, although the court in Ven-Fuel viewed Congress as constitutionally entitled to disclosure of documents that had been presented to a grand jury, the court also determined that the documents were not necessarily cloaked in secrecy under Rule 6(e) in the first instance.

First, disclosure would be at the discretion of the attorney for the government, and would be limited to a situation in which the attorney believed that the Member or staff was needed to assist the attorney in enforcing federal criminal law. Second, the Member or staff to whom disclosure was made could use the grand jury information only for the same purpose, that is, to assist the attorney in prosecuting the federal crimes to which the information related.

Two courts have determined that a congressional committee's request for grand jury materials pursuant to its ordinary investigative and oversight functions does not qualify under this exception, as the possibility that \"the actions it is investigating may wind up in the courts if wrongdoing is uncovered\" is \"too remote to trigger the Rule 6(e) exception.\" By contrast, where a congressional committee has sought grand jury materials in connection with the contemplated impeachment of a specific public official, several courts have recognized that court-ordered disclosure may be available pursuant to the \"judicial proceeding\" exception. Under this view, though \"impeachment proceedings before Congress . . . are not by a 'court,'\" a \"contemplated trial\" in the Senate is still \"very much a judicial proceeding.\"", "A committee seeking court-authorized disclosure on the basis of this exception must establish a \"particularized need\" for the materials at issue, which requires a showing that the need outweighs the public interest in secrecy. In the context of impeachment, courts have concluded that a congressional committee's need is sufficient to warrant disclosure, at least where the grand jury's work has concluded.

The D.C. Circuit essentially affirmed that decision, expressing \"general agreement\" with the lower court decision.", "Another court has also relied on its inherent authority to order the release of the records of a grand jury that had indicted a federal judge to an investigating committee of the judiciary, relying on the \"exceptional circumstance[]\" that the \"question under investigation\"\u2014whether a federal judge should be recommended for impeachment or otherwise disciplined\u2014was \"of great societal importance.\" Recognizing that the investigating committee still was required to show a sufficient need for the grand jury materials, the court concluded such a showing had been made (and was not outweighed by the interest in secrecy) because (1) the investigating committee was composed of federal judges who were acting pursuant to express statutory authority; (2) the grand jury investigation and trial of the judge had already concluded; and (3) only by \"examining all of the record\" could the committee \"determine the true state of the evidence for or against the charge.\"", "Assuming a court adopts the inherent authority view of Rule 6(e) based on the above decisions, it is possible that a court would be willing to authorize the disclosure of grand jury materials to a congressional committee pursuant to the court's inherent authority.

It is less certain that an \"inherent authority\" disclosure order would be available to a congressional petitioner when not tied to a contemplated impeachment proceeding. In an appropriately \"exceptional\" situation, a court could be amenable to exercising its inherent authority to order the release of grand jury information in the face of a pressing congressional request.

Consequently, ambiguity remains regarding the relationship between grand jury secrecy and congressional access to grand jury materials. As the debate in the 99th Congress reflects, any change to the Rule could raise potentially difficult constitutional, interpretive, and policy questions.
