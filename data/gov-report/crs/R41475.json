Formulas are set in the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ).

See \" Historical Trends \" in a later section on funding.", "Although these programs have mandatory status, many of these accounts receive funding in the annual Agriculture appropriations act. For example, the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs.

It is the legal basis to incur obligations. Most of the amounts mentioned in this report are budget authority. 2. Obligations = How much money agencies commit to spend. Activities such as employing personnel, entering into contracts, and submitting purchase orders. 3. Outlays = How much money actually flows out of an agency's account. Outlays may differ from appropriations (budget authority) because, for example, payments on a contract may not flow out until a later year. For construction or delivery of services, budget authority may be committed (contracted) in one fiscal year and outlays may be spread across several fiscal years. 4. Program level = Sum of the activities supported or undertaken by an agency. A program level may be much higher than its budget authority for several reasons. User fees support some activities (e.g., food or border inspection). The agency makes loans; for example, a large loan authority (program level) is possible with a small budget authority (loan subsidy) because the loan is expected be repaid. The appropriated loan subsidy makes allowances for defaults and interest rate assistance. Transfers from other agencies, or funds are carried forward from prior years.

But the dynamic changed particularly in the late 1990s and the 2002 farm bill when authorizers began writing farm bills using mandatory funds for programs that typically were discretionary. Appropriators had not funded some of these programs as much as authorizers had desired, and agriculture authorizing committees wrote legislation with the mandatory funding at their discretion. Thus, tension arose over who should fund these typically discretionary activities: authorizers with mandatory funding sources at their disposal, or appropriators having standard appropriating authority.

Beginning in FY2009 appropriations acts, appropriations earmarks became more formal by being incorporated, at least by reference, in the text of the bill.", "For FY2011, the final, full-year CR contains no earmark disclosure lists. Moreover, the short-term CRs were the first to cancel the effect of the FY2010 earmarks. That is, the language of short-term CR P.L. 112-4 said that the FY2010 earmarks \"have no legal effect.\" This statement is true regardless of the FY2011 funding available to an agency or program that administered the earmarks. All of the agricultural programs with earmarks in FY2010 were reduced in the last short-term CR ( P.L. 112-6 ) by the amount of FY2010 earmarks (that is, many of the reductions listed in Table 4 correspond to the amount of FY2010 earmarks). As discussed and shown in Table 4 , however, some accounts were not held to that initial level of reduction.", "The \"no legal effect\" language in the CRs makes all of the earmarks nonbinding (nonstatutory) in FY2011; agencies are not legally required to continue to fund earmarks, regardless whether funding was reduced. Nonetheless, agencies retain discretion to allocate funding under regular program rules, and could decide to fund projects that received earmarks in FY2010\u2014not necessarily because of earmark instructions, but for other merit- or formula-based criteria."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected USDA Programs", "paragraphs": ["The following tables compare the effect of the FY2011 appropriation within three USDA program areas at a more detailed level than in Table 3 .
