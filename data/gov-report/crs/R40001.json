The United Nations launched formal international negotiations in 1990 to respond to growing scientific and public concern about human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), principally carbon dioxide. This report chronicles the main milestones and issues in the United Nations process to address climate change.", "The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): Governments agreed in 1992 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which continues to provide the principle\u2014but not sole\u2014framework for global cooperation on the issue. The treaty's objective is to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human-induced interference with the Earth's climate system. A 2010 political statement interpreted this as a vision of GHG cuts to prevent global average temperature from increasing more than 2\u00b0C (2.6\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels.", "The United States, as a Party to the UNFCCC, has qualitative obligations to report national GHG emissions; cooperate on science and technology development; enact programs to abate emissions; and provide agreed new and additional financial resources to assist low-income countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. When the UNFCCC was drafted, the then-industrialized countries emitted two-thirds of annual GHG emissions (excluding emissions from deforestation). These Annex I countries correspondingly accepted a lead role in abating GHG emissions, though all countries agreed to \"common but differentiated responsibilities.\"", "The 1997 Kyoto Protocol and its 2012 Doha Amendment: When UNFCCC entered into force in 1995, Parties agreed that enforceable obligations were necessary to prevent \"dangerous climate change.\" The 1995 Berlin Mandate called for a new protocol by 1997 with \"no new commitments for developing countries\" Under the resulting 1997 Kyoto Protocol, 37 of the then-highest income countries and the European Union (EU) committed to reduce their GHG emissions on average to 5% below 1990 levels during the \"first commitment period\" of 2008 to 2012. The United States signed but did not become a Party to the Kyoto Protocol. The 2012 Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol established a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for the period 2013-2020, with GHG abatement pledges from 37 countries plus the EU. Japan, New Zealand, and the Russian Federation declined to participate in the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.", "The 2010 Cancun Agreement: In 2010 for the first time under the UNFCCC, a negotiated agreement contained language for GHG pledges by all major emitting Parties. Many Parties, including China, pledged quantitatively to limit their GHG emissions. However, these pledges are not considered \"legally binding.\"", "Currently, the Durban Platform Negotiations: The current round of negotiations is the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. The Durban Platform's mandate is for a new agreement \"with legal force\" that would be \"applicable to all Parties\" and begin implementation after 2020. In concept, this mandate could eliminate the bifurcation in the UNFCCC between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, or between countries with and without binding GHG obligations.", "Issues for Congress: Many in Congress are concerned with the merits of a treaty, and with the goals and obligations it might embody. One concern is the compatibility of any international agreement with any U.S. domestic policies and laws, should consensus emerge on whether and how to address climate change. Additional issues include the costs and other impacts of obligations; the parity of actions among countries and effects on trade competitiveness; the adequacy of appropriations, fiscal measures, and programs to achieve any commitments under the agreement; and the desirable form of the agreement and related requirements.

While some Members are convinced that human-induced climate change is a high priority risk that must be addressed through federal actions and international cooperation, others are not convinced of significant risk. Some are wary, as well, of international processes that could impose costs on the United States, undermine national sovereignty, or lead to trade advantages for other countries. The United States government has participated for more than two decades in various multilateral negotiations and actions aimed at addressing climate change. This report surveys the United Nations negotiations, from a primarily U.S. perspective. A table at the end of the report summarizes the chronology ( Table 1 ).", "Formal international negotiations were launched in December 1990 to address growing scientific and political concern about human-induced climate change. The negotiations on the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) marked the progress of decades of scientific research. Scientific conclusions\u2014with uncertainties\u2014have remained stable over two decades: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human-related activities are very likely causing the major portion of climate change observed in recent decades. If changes continue, they could lead to adverse impacts on human societies and their environment, potentially including catastrophes. Predicting the timing, magnitude, and implications of change remains imprecise; many uncertainties may not be resolvable in a time frame consistent with making effective and efficient decisions to reduce the risks of climate change.", "The question of how to share any effort to address climate change has been a core challenge for international cooperation. Because emissions come from all countries, only concerted reductions by all major emitters can stabilize the rising GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. The United States historically has contributed the most\u2014almost one-fifth of the rise of GHG concentrations since the Industrial Revolution. In 2007, however, China surpassed the United States as the leading emitter of GHG annually. In the future, the greatest growth in GHG emissions is expected from industrializing countries, such as China, India, and Brazil. These countries historically have contributed less, and still emit much less per person, than the United States and most other high-income countries. Arguably, the least developed and still industrializing nations have lower economic and governance capacities to address the problem. The size of effort and how to allocate it is a key element of negotiations.", "The primary issues for negotiation in 1990 remain the same today:", "when and by how much to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in order to achieve the UNFCCC's objective of avoiding \" dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system \"; how to share \" common but differentiated responsibilities \" among countries taking into account \" historic contributions \" and \" respective capacities \" of different people\u2014in particular, the acceptable degree of participation of low-income countries; what mechanisms are best suited to assuring GHG reductions at the lowest cost, respecting national sovereignty and supporting \" sustainable economic development \" and \" the eradication of poverty \"; how cooperatively to understand the risks and facilitate adaptation to climate changes, especially by those people least able to cope on their own; and how to adapt international arrangements over time as science, social conditions, and capabilities evolve.", "At present, the United States is one of three of the 194 Parties to the UNFCCC that is not also Party also to the subsidiary Kyoto Protocol. (The other two are Canada and Andorra.) As a Party to the UNFCCC, the United States has general obligations to reduce its GHG emissions, report its emissions and be subject to international review, and assist lower-income countries, and other binding commitments. The industrialized Parties to the Kyoto Protocol ( Annex I Parties ), however, took on binding, quantitative commitments to reduce their GHG emissions to 5% below 1990 levels during 2008-2012 and agreed in 2012 to reduce these further during a second commitment period from 2013 to 2020.", "Most Parties have made voluntary pledges to GHG reduction targets or nationally appropriate mitigation actions under the 2009 Copenhagen Accord and the 2010 Cancun Agreements. Nonetheless, many non-Annex I Parties have opposed taking on legally binding commitments to abate GHG emissions. Many Annex I Parties have opposed taking on further legally binding commitments without participation by all Parties. The 2011 Durban Platform envisioned an end to two-track (developed versus developing) negotiations and provided a mandate to negotiate by 2015 a single outcome \"with legal force\" applicable to all Parties and that would take effect after 2020.", "How to pay for GHG reductions and adaptation measures is another key issue. The wealthiest Parties (including the United States) pledged \"fast start\" financing approaching $30 billion during 2010-2012, and a goal of mobilizing financing of $100 billion annually by 2020. Funding will come from public and private, bilateral and multilateral, and alternative sources. The most vulnerable developing countries had priority for the 2010-2012 funds. Reportedly, the fast-start financing goal was exceeded, but the pathway to meeting the 2020 pledge remains obscure.", "This report summarizes the process and principle issues and outcomes of the international climate change negotiations since 1990.

The Kyoto Protocol (KP) was not submitted to the Senate for ratification by President Clinton, nor by his successor, President George W. Bush.

The first track was a mandate among the Kyoto Protocol Parties (not including the United States) to pursue an amendment to the Protocol on further commitments of Annex I Parties for the period(s) beyond the year 2012. The first commitment period runs from 2008 through 2012.", "The second track was established in December 2007, when the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC agreed to a \"Bali Action Plan\" to negotiate new GHG mitigation targets for Annex I Parties, \"nationally appropriate mitigation actions\" for non-Annex I Parties, and other commitments for the post-2012 period. The mandates specified that the products of negotiation should be ready by the end of 2009, for decision at the 15 th meeting of the COP and the fifth Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP, or sometimes COP/MOP), in Copenhagen, Denmark.

There were practical outcomes of the Copenhagen negotiations nonetheless; these included evolving recognition of the political and economic barriers in some countries to setting aggressive international obligations that Parties are not sure to fulfill. Another was a greater focus on transparency through enhanced reporting and verification of actions in countries. The U.S. Deputy Envoy for Climate Change, Jonathan Pershing, called the Copenhagen Accord a \"paradigm shift\" in the long-term path of the UNFCCC negotiations, from a \"top-down\" assignment of GHG targets to Parties to a \"country-up\" offering of commitments.", "The Copenhagen negotiations revealed distance among many countries' \"bottom lines,\" without ground of consensus on major issues, such as the form and structure of agreements; obligations for GHG reductions and actions; the legal nature of future commitments; and acceptable provisions for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV). A \"Copenhagen Accord\" emerged that bridged some difficult differences and identified a common and differentiated path forward. While most UNFCCC Parties seemed willing to adopt the Copenhagen Accord, it was blocked by Bolivia, Cuba, Sudan, and Venezuela, arguing that the closed-door deal-making violated the procedures of the United Nations Charter. Tuvalu and some other nations rejected the agreement for not assuring, in their views, sufficiently deep GHG reductions. Consequently, the COP only \"took note\" of the text, but did not adopt it.

Parallel GHG mitigation by Annex I and non-Annex I Parties: Notes GHG mitigation targets for 2020 reported by Annex I Parties, and nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) to be implemented by Non-Annex I Parties and communicated to the Secretariat by them, compiled in public documents to be issued by the Secretariat. Further reporting and analysis will clarify the assumptions and implications for the reported targets and actions. A registry on NAMAs: To record and update information on actions for which countries are seeking support; support available for NAMAs; and support provided for NAMAs. Enhanced reporting by Annex I Parties and international assessment: Requires reporting of emissions and removals related to GHG commitments, and to financial, technology, and capacity-building support provided by them. Transparent reporting and international review of Non-Annex I Parties' mitigation while respecting national sovereignty: Non-Annex I Parties must submit National Communications every four years, with biennial updates to include national GHG inventories and mitigation actions, needs, and support received. Domestic actions will be subject to domestic monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) in accordance with future guidelines. A process for international consultations and analysis (ICA) of biennial reports will be non-intrusive, non-punitive, and respectful of national sovereignty. Mitigation actions (as well as technology, financing, and capacity-building) supported by international finance will be subject to international MRV. Reducing Emissions from Deforestation: Requests countries to reduce carbon losses from land uses, including REDD+, and to enable mobilization of supportive international financing. Requests the AWG-LCA to explore financing mechanisms for implementing \"results-based actions\" to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, conserve and enhance forest carbon stocks, and to manage forests sustainably. With provision of adequate and predictable support, developing countries would develop forest and carbon reference levels and transparent national forest plans and safeguards monitoring systems. \"Results-based actions\" should be \"fully measured, reported, and verified.\" Consideration of market-based mechanisms: Permits further consideration of emissions trading to assist developed country Parties to meet part of their GHG commitments, to supplement their domestic actions, to maintain and build on those under the Kyoto Protocol.

The Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol", "paragraphs": ["The Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol established the second commitment period, from 2013-2020 for the Kyoto Protocol, with GHG targets for 37 countries plus the EU averaging a reduction of 18% below 1990 levels. Japan, New Zealand, and the Russia Federal declined new GHG targets because all major emitters did not participate. Canada formally withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol. Because some Parties were disappointed with what they considered to be a low level of ambition for GHG reductions in the second commitment period, the Doha Amendment provided for a voluntary review in 2014 of Annex I Parties' Quantified Emission Limitations and Reduction Commitments (QELRCs) .", "The first commitment period of the KP, in 1997, covered more than 55% of the 1990 \"basket of six\" GHG emissions globally. The second commitment period covers approximately 15%, given the growth of emissions by a number of non-Annex I countries and without the participation in second commitment period GHG targets by the Russian Federation, Japan, and New Zealand, the United States, or Canada.", "The Doha Amendment modified several rules for the KP's second commitment period:", "Only Annex I Parties taking on GHG targets in the second commitment period may transfer and acquire emission reduction credits from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation, two of the three flexibility mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol. Parties that have not used all their Assigned Allowance Units ( AAUs) from the first commitment period may sell to other Parties. Nonetheless, the EU, Japan, and other countries vowed they would not acquire any, as they do not consider that the \"surplus\" AAUs represent real GHG emission reductions. Disagreement continued over whether AAUs unused in the first or second commitment periods should be cancelled from 2020.", "Some observers have noted vagaries in the text that may create uncertainties in the likely size of credit supplies and market demand under the market mechanisms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Interests in International Climate Issues", "paragraphs": ["Members of Congress may seek to monitor and provide input to the Doha Platform (ADP) negotiations, due to reach an agreement in 2015 to take effect in 2020, with a vision of avoiding a 2 o C (3.6 o F) increase of global average temperature above pre-industrial levels. The United States will be among the countries under most pressure also to provide financial and other assistance to low-income countries, to help them take on and adhere to commitments to GHG mitigation and adaptation.", "In preparation for the 2015 ADP negotiations, Congress may wish to provide advice regarding the United States' position at summit of world leaders, to be convened by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon in September 2014; he has challenged leaders to bring \"bold pledges.\"", "Members of Congress hold divergent views about the value of international cooperation to address climate change. While some Members are convinced that human-induced climate change is a high priority risk that must be addressed through federal actions and international cooperation, others are not convinced of significant risk. Some are wary, as well, of international processes that could impose costs on the United States, undermine national sovereignty, or lead to trade advantages for other countries.", "Regardless of current views, the United States is a Party to the UNFCCC and has certain obligations, however unenforceable, under that treaty. The United States' behaviors in that context are likely to continue to draw great attention on the world stage. Arguably, U.S. credibility is impaired to the degree that it has not followed through on earlier commitments, is unable to negotiate for unambiguous commitments due to lack of domestic consensus, and cannot assure others that any agreements made by an Administration would be accepted by Congress.", "The Executive Branch continues international negotiations and implementation of the UNFCCC obligations. Committees of Congress engage in oversight (from home and at the international meetings), providing input to the Administration formally and informally, and deciding program authorities and appropriations for these activities. Given the continuing public and legislative debate over whether and how to address climate change, the 113 th Congress may engage on the international aspects.", "International cooperation would be required to curtail human-induced climate change and to facilitate successful adaptation to its projected impacts. Many U.S. legislators seek assurance of comparable actions by all major emitters prior to committing the United States to actions. Additional issues that may be important to Congress include the compatibility of any international agreement with U.S. domestic policies and laws; the adequacy of appropriations and fiscal incentives to achieve any commitments under the agreement; the desirable form of any agreement; and any requirements for potential ratification and implementing legislation, should a formal treaty emerge from the negotiations.", "Many Members of Congress are especially attentive to questions of parity of GHG actions among major trading partners, and especially to the potential for adverse competitiveness effects if some countries do not mandate GHG reductions while others move ahead. Most other major countries (including China, Brazil, and others) are taking actions, and some are measurably altering their GHG emission trajectories. The United States has taken some actions, such as establishing GHG emission limits for motor vehicles and providing fiscal incentives for energy efficiency, renewable, and other energy technologies, etc. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed carbon dioxide emission standards for future electric generating units as well. With existing programs and regulations, and the addition of the expected EPA regulation of GHG, the Administration believes the United States will accomplish its pledge of reducing U.S. GHG emissions to at least 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. Still, the cumulative effects of measures taken may be unlikely to achieve the deep, absolute reductions of GHG emissions considered necessary by many to stabilize atmospheric concentrations or to substantially increase rates of carbon removals from the atmosphere and sequestration (e.g., by forests and agricultural activities).", "Many observers have noted other risks to the U.S. economy relating to GHG abatement: some major competitors are undertaking rapid development and deployment of advanced energy technologies, justified by their domestic commitments to abating GHG emissions, enhancing energy security, reducing environmental impacts of industrial systems, and achieving additional policy objectives. Some of the countries have, correspondingly, emerged as the leading inventors and/or manufacturers of new technologies that are gaining global market shares. While fossil fuel use is unlikely to decline in the next two decades, markets for alternative technologies are expanding.
