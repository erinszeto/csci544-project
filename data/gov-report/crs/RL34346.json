Rafah was divided under the terms of the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty, which placed the more densely populated Rafah City in the then Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and a much smaller town in Egyptian controlled territory. In 1982, as Israel was in the midst of its phased withdrawal from the Sinai under the terms of the peace treaty with Egypt, former Israeli Prime Minister and then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon reportedly requested that Egypt make alterations to its international border with Israel to keep Rafah whole and under Israel's control. Sharon asserted that, if divided, Rafah could become a focal point for terrorist infiltration and arms smuggling. Egypt refused.", "Palestinian families divided by the partition of Rafah in 1982 appear to have been the first to construct underground tunnels linking Gaza and Egypt to foster communication amongst extended family members. Over time, Rafah residents developed an economic rationale for tunneling, as smugglers could resell subsidized Egyptian gasoline at a high profit in Gaza. Other smuggled items included U.S. dollars for money changers, wedding dowries, mail, cartons of cigarettes, drugs (marijuana and heroin), gold, and spare car parts.", "Israel became aware of the security dimension of smuggling tunnels during the first Palestinian intifadah (uprising), which began in 1987. After a series of attacks by Palestinians along the Gaza-Egypt border in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Israeli officials began to consider that Palestinian militants were using the tunnels to both smuggle weapons and their own fighters out of Gaza to allude capture. With the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in 1994 under the terms of the Oslo peace process, Israeli concerns that PA police, who were responsible for uncovering arms smuggling, were either, at best, ineffective or, at worst, complicit with the tunneling activities of their co-nationalists, became more strident.", "During the second, more violent, Palestinian intifadah beginning in September 2000, the demand for weapons skyrocketed and tunneling activity increased. Israeli, Egyptian, and PA forces confiscated dozens of rocket-propelled grenade launchers, explosives, thousands of Kalashnikov rifles, and tons of ammunition. Israel also constructed a 25-foot concrete or iron wall along the border that extended 10 feet underground. It used sonar to detect tunnels, occasionally setting off charges in the ground to collapse the tunnels. Nevertheless, the economic and strategic incentives for smuggling grew substantially. According to one report:", "\"The profits are huge. A Kalashnikov sells for $200 on the Egyptian side, but fetches $2,000 on the Gaza black market.

The \"snakeheads\" then rent their tunnel openings to independent gunrunners or members of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatah-affiliated militias, who are then responsible for moving guns and goods from Egypt into Gaza. When a tunnel is completed, the primary investor and his/her relatives are entitled to a percentage on every shipment passing through it. Packages of arms and ammunition are pulled by cables and electric motors through the tunnels, which in some places reportedly reach depths of between 50 and 60 feet in order to avoid detection.

During Operation Rainbow in 2004, in which Israel used Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers to destroy homes suspected of concealing tunnels, dozens of Palestinian protestors were killed and several hundred homes were demolished. One aim of Operation Rainbow, which was launched after 11 Israeli soldiers were killed in several attacks, was to create a buffer zone adjacent to the Philadelphi Route to protect Israeli soldiers and prevent Palestinians from digging underground tunnels. In 2004, the Israeli army reportedly planned on digging a ditch or moat 49 to 82 feet deep to prevent digging. The moat plan was abandoned due to humanitarian reasons. A water-filled moat could have further contaminated the Gaza water table with seawater.", "When Israel unilaterally dismantled its settlements and withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip in August 2005, it negotiated a new security arrangement with Egypt to bolster efforts to secure the Egyptian side of Rafah. After extensive Israeli-Egyptian talks, Egypt deployed 750 border guards to secure the Philadelphi Route.

They received intelligence on this from us and didn't use it.\" After the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, Israel began claiming that Palestinian terrorist groups were smuggling advanced weaponry, such as Katyusha rockets, shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles, and anti-tank guided missiles, through the tunnels. Miri Eisin, the spokeswoman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, was quoted saying \"What's happened now is that they're trying to smuggle in more advanced weapons. We mean anti-tank weapons of the sort which were used against us in Lebanon, some of them Russian-made and some of them Iranian-made, and also anti-aircraft weapons, which we've been worried [about] in the past, but now it's much more concrete.\"", "One Israeli lawmaker, Yuval Steinitz, a member of the opposition Likud party and a former chairman of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, has accused Egypt of, among other things, allowing Hamas to obtain 20,000 rifles, 6,000 anti-tank missiles, 100 tons of explosives and several dozen Katyusha rockets and shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles. In November 2007, Steinitz wrote letters to Members of Congress asking them to support proposals to freeze U.S. military aid to Egypt. In his letters, Steinitz stated that \"It is almost ridiculous for the Egyptians to focus on finding the tunnels, since it would be much easier for them to intercept the smugglers before they get anywhere near the border.\" Also in November 2007, Israeli Public Security Minister Avi Dichter asserted that \"Egypt could deploy to stop the smuggling within an hour.... What we previously perceived as weakness or inability to act may be Egyptian policy.\"", "In December 2007, Israeli accusations against Egypt reached a crescendo.

The Egyptian Defense Ministry claims that, at any one time, up to a third of their 750-troop regiment is off-duty or is on leave, leaving fewer troops to protect the border and stop smuggling. Egypt also claims that while Israel has provided it with intelligence on known smugglers, the information is often imprecise and not actionable. Egypt reportedly has asked Israel to renegotiate either the 2005 MOU or the Camp David peace treaty itself to allow for the deployment of additional 1-2 regiments in Rafah. Israeli leaders have responded by insisting that rather than send more Egyptian troops to the border, Egypt should make better use of the soldiers already on patrol.

Israel agreed to allow the European Union to maintain a Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) to monitor the Rafah crossing.

On January 3, 2008, Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired a standard Russian-made 122-mm Grad-series 'Katyusha' into Israel. The rocket achieved a range of 10.8 miles. Qassam rockets, which are manufactured in Gazan metal shops, have a maximum range of 6 miles. According to Jane ' s Defence Weekly , Israeli intelligence had warned in 2005 that the PIJ had received a shipment of 20 Grad-series rockets, which were smuggled into the Gaza Strip from Egypt. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot quoted an unnamed Israeli security official who claimed that the rocket fired on January 3 was produced in Iran and had been smuggled into Gaza from Egypt by sea. Overall, while most experts agree that advanced weapons could easily find their way to Palestinian terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip, there is no real consensus concerning the scale of smuggled advanced weaponry. In addition, many analysts believe that Egypt has under-reported the amount of arms coming into Gaza, while Israel has exaggerated the threat these arms pose to its overall security. Some observers state that Hamas's arsenal is not as sophisticated as Hezbollah's in Lebanon. Nevertheless, Israeli military officials appear to have concluded that Hamas is gradually adopting Hezbollah's military doctrine.

While the smuggling issue has worsened in recent years, at no time has any one government, Israeli, Egyptian, or Palestinian (PA), been able to fully stop the movement of goods and arms under the border. While Egypt has uncovered numerous tunnel openings on its side of the border, it reportedly lacked the capacity or the will to destroy the tunnel shafts that remain open even when an entrance is sealed. Furthermore, as long as tunnels remain open on the Palestinian side, the Egyptians have not been able to fully destroy them. With the recent U.S. pledge to reallocate $23 million in FMF for new equipment and training, Egypt's record on destroying tunnels may improve.", "Moreover, the Border Guard Force's rules of engagement against Palestinians crossing the border are deliberately ambiguous.

Ironically, both of these positions pose challenges for Egypt, which wants to keep Hamas isolated, but not be held solely responsible for failing to do so by either Israel or the United States. Nevertheless, as violence between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip continues, these issues will continue to fester.
