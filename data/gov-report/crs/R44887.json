A different measure of graduation rates, the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR), which captures those graduating within four years of entering high school, suggests that in SY2014-2015 roughly 65% of students with disabilities graduated high school within that time frame, compared to approximately 82% of the total population of students. Data on post-high school experiences of a nationally representative sample of 13 to 16 year old students receiving special education services in 2000 (who were followed for eight years through the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2) found that 60% enrolled in postsecondary education within eight years of leaving high school; two-year postsecondary programs were the most common destination. More recent data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, examining a nationally representative sample of all students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in SY2011-2012, indicates that roughly 11% of all undergraduates and 5% of all post-baccalaureate students self-identify as having a disability, with higher percentages among older undergraduate students (16%) and veterans (21%); however, there are many known limitations associated with self-reported data of this nature."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The skills, knowledge, and credentials obtained through education are widely believed to be connected to positive occupational and economic outcomes.

States may receive grants under the condition that, among other requirements, they provide each qualifying student with (1) an individualized education program (IEP) outlining the student's goals, and the accommodations, special education, and related services that the school will provide to the student, and (2) a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE). This means specially designed instruction to meet students' needs, provided to the greatest extent possible with their general education peers and at no cost to their families.

The ESEA is the largest source of federal aid to K-12 education, supporting educational and related services for low-achieving and other students attending elementary and secondary schools with high concentrations of students from low-income families. The largest grant program in the ESEA is Title I-A. There are a number of educational accountability requirements that states, LEAs, and schools must meet to receive Title I-A funds. For example, amendments to the ESEA enacted under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001(NCLB; P.L. 107-110 ) included several educational accountability provisions that aimed to promote the educational progress of all students in schools served. These provisions have subsequently been amended through the ESSA.", "Over half of public elementary and secondary schools receive Title I-A funds. While students with disabilities benefit from this funding, they are not specifically targeted by it. However, many of the ESEA's educational accountability provisions do require that schools pay particular attention to students with disabilities and likely have an effect on them. For example, when the ESEA was amended through the NCLB in 2001, provisions were adopted requiring states to develop and implement a state accountability system to ensure that schools and LEAs made progress with respect to student achievement. Under the NCLB provisions, student progress was not only systematically measured and monitored for the broad population of K-12 students served under the ESEA but also for specific subgroups of students, of which \"students with disabilities\" was one. ", "Under NCLB provisions, student proficiency in relation to academic performance standards was regularly tracked in selected subject areas, as were high school graduation rates. The NCLB contained high-stakes accountability provisions featuring varied consequences for schools in which a sufficient percentage of students or subgroups of students, such as students with disabilities, failed to make sufficient academic progress in relation to the academic achievement and high school graduation standards. The accountability provisions of the NCLB, and those in place after the ESEA was amended through the ESSA, emphasize holding all students and all subgroups of students (including students with disabilities) to the same standards and levels of academic achievement, and closing gaps between subgroups of students.

Funding is still being provided for HEA programs through appropriations acts. The HEA authorizes student financial aid programs that help students and their families meet the costs of attending postsecondary institutions, a series of targeted grant programs that assist students transitioning into postsecondary education, and grants that support program and institutional development at some colleges and universities. While students with disabilities benefit from many of the HEA's student financial aid programs, the programs that specifically target support and assistance to students with disabilities are the TRIO Student Support Services (SSS) program and Comprehensive Transition and Postsecondary (CTP) programs for students with intellectual disabilities. ", "The TRIO SSS program served over 200,000 students through grants to over 1,000 projects in SY2015-2016. The program, originally enacted in 1992 through amendments to the HEA, provides support services to primarily low-income first generation college students with the aim of improving their retention, graduation rates, financial and economic literacy, and transfers from two-year to four-year schools. TRIO SSS programs are also intended to foster an institutional climate supportive of potentially disconnected students. These include students with disabilities, students who are limited English proficient, students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education, students who are homeless children and youths, and students who are in foster care or aging out of the foster care system. Under the TRIO SSS program, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) makes competitive grants to Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) and combinations of IHEs. Grantees must provide statutorily defined services to an approved number of participants. At least two-thirds of participants must be either students with disabilities or low-income, first-generation college students. The remaining one-third of participants must be low-income students, students with disabilities, or first-generation college students. Also, at least one-third of the participating students with disabilities must be low-income.

The programs, enacted through the HEOA, provide transition support for students with intellectual disabilities. Under provisions in the HEA, CTP programs for students with intellectual disabilities are not required to lead to a recognized credential (e.g., bachelor's or associate's degree, certificate) or adhere to the same durational requirements that regular postsecondary programs must meet (e.g., a certain number of credit-bearing clock hours).

The result was the first National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS), a five-year study beginning in SY1985-1986 that tracked a nationally representative sample of more than 8,000 students representing each of the federal disabilities categories.

", "In contrast to the original NLTS's finding that fewer than one in four 12 th graders reported postsecondary education as a goal, the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2), which began 15 years after the first NLTS, found that more than four out of five secondary school-aged students with disabilities who had transition plans named postsecondary education as a primary post-high school goal. In addition, the NLTS2 found that a majority of secondary school-aged students with disabilities (60%) continued on to postsecondary education within eight years of leaving high school, and most of them began postsecondary studies within a year of leaving high school. The NLTS2 also found the following for postsecondary students with disabilities:", "They enrolled most frequently in two-year programs or community colleges (44%). They also enrolled in vocational, business, or technical schools (32%), and four-year colleges or universities (19%). They usually enrolled in postsecondary education programs on a consistent (77%), full-time (71%) basis, where they were working toward a diploma or certificate (90%). They were likely to stop self-identifying as disabled once in postsecondary education. A majority (63%) of students who had been identified as having disabilities by their secondary schools no longer considered themselves to have a disability by the time they transitioned to postsecondary school. Only 28% of postsecondary students continued to identify as students with disabilities and disclosed their disabilities to their IHEs, as required to receive accommodations or supports at the postsecondary level, and fewer than one in five students (19%) received accommodations for their disability from an IHE. When postsecondary students did request assistance because of their disabilities, they received a range of accommodations and supports from their schools, the most common of which was additional time to complete tests (79%). ", "The NLTS2 findings generalize to students with disabilities nationally, but they are only representative of students in the early 2000s. The NLTS2 allows insight into the outcomes of students with disabilities transitioning from high school to postsecondary life that could not be arrived at through cross-sectional data such as high school graduation and college enrollment rates. However, because the study's sample is nationally representative of secondary students circa 2000, the NLTS2 results cannot be assumed to reflect the postsecondary outcomes of the current national population of young adults with disabilities.", "A new NLTS study began in 2012. Once it has collected additional waves of data, the NLTS 2012 will begin to provide some insight into the characteristics, experiences, and outcomes of a more recent nationally representative sample of students with disabilities transitioning from high school to postsecondary education and life.

In addition, the use of students self-identifying as disabled on a survey is fundamentally different and more likely to result in lower reported rates of disability than data tracked by schools or pulled from student records. For example, the increase in postsecondary students self-identifying as disabled as they grow older may reflect more about the reluctance of students who have recently exited high school special education programs to adopt the disability label in their new postsecondary institution than it does about actual increases in the number of disabilities among older undergraduate students."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Factors Contributing to High School Graduation and College Enrollment Trends among Transition-Aged Students with Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["High school graduation and college enrollment have increased considerably for all students in recent decades. The increased rates of students with disabilities graduating from high school with a regular diploma and continuing on to postsecondary education may be part of the trends seen in the general population of transition-aged students. The appeal of higher earnings or self-sufficiency may be a factor in the increasing educational attainment of students with and without disabilities. Relatedly, the increase in unemployment among 16 to 24 year olds in the years immediately after the 2007-2009 recession may have factored both in declining high school dropout rates and in increasing postsecondary enrollment rates during those years. In addition, changes in the postsecondary landscape, such as increased access to non-selective two-year and less than two-year programs, may have encouraged more students to pursue postsecondary education. ", "In addition to the potential factors impacting the overall population of transition-aged students, several congressional actions may have contributed specifically to the increasing percentages of students with disabilities graduating from high school with a regular diploma ( Figure 1 ) and enrolling in postsecondary education. ", "P.L. 101-476 (IDEA; 1990) introduced requirements that all students' IEPs contain a statement of needed transition services by the time those students turn 16 years old, and that the students be invited to attend and participate in all IEP meetings where their transition goals are discussed. P.L. 101-476 marked the first time that IEP teams were required to set goals for what students would do in their postsecondary lives and determine the services needed to help them attain those goals. P.L. 101-476 also included two new disability categories: autism and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Both categories have grown significantly in terms of raw numbers and the percentage of students with disabilities served, with the growth in the autism category being particularly pronounced. Autism is now the fourth largest category of children served under the IDEA, accounting for nearly 10% of all children with IEPs. According to ED data, more than two-thirds of students with autism (68%) and three-quarters of students with TBI (75%) graduated from high school with a regular diploma in SY2014-2015. P.L. 105-17 (IDEA; 1997) required children with IEPs to participate in statewide assessments and the general education curriculum. The bill required all students' IEPs to relate their IEP programming to their achievement in the general education curriculum. In addition, under this act states were required to establish performance goals and indicators for students with IEPs and include students with IEPs in statewide assessments and alternative assessments. P.L. 107-110 (NCLB; 2001) required states to implement accountability systems tracking the academic progress of different subgroups of students, including students with disabilities, toward meeting state developed educational standards. The NCLB contained high-stakes accountability provisions, which emphasized holding all students, including students with disabilities, to the same standards; closing gaps between different groups of students; and expecting all students to reach proficiency in reading and mathematics. The NCLB's accountability provisions required that specific attention be paid to academic progress and graduation rates of students with disabilities. P.L. 108-446 (IDEA; 2004) increased accountability requirements by revising state performance goals and requiring that students with disabilities be included in all state and district-wide assessments, including assessments required under the ESEA. In addition to the TRIO SSS program and CTP programs for students with intellectual disabilities, established in earlier amendments to the HEA, the HEOA established a new competitive CTP grant program, which operates on a limited scale, called Model Transition Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities into Higher Education (TPSID). TPSID grants fund IHEs in partnering with one or more LEAs and create model transition programs from secondary to postsecondary education for students with intellectual disabilities.
