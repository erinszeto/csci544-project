Ninety-five percent of the UNRWA budget is funded through voluntary contributions from governments and the European Union. U.S. contributions to UNRWA come from the regular Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account and also through the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) account. The U.S. contribution to UNRWA usually covers 22-25% of the UNRWA total budget. The current cycle of violence in the Middle East presents particular challenges to UNRWA, including security, funding, and the impact of deteriorating socio-economic conditions. Recent congressional attention has focused on the issues concerning the progress of refugee resettlement, use of UNRWA funds, and the content of educational materials. This report will be updated as developments warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Role of UNRWA", "paragraphs": ["UNRWA was established in 1949 to provide relief assistance and programs for Palestinian refugees. With the continuation of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, UNRWA's mandate has been renewed annually ever since it began operations in May 1950 and is currently extended to June 2005. In keeping with its mission, it provides relief and social services, including food, housing, clothing, and basic health and education to over 4.1 million registered Palestine refugees living mostly in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but also in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Currently, UNRWA operates approximately 900 facilities. It also manages a microfinance and microenterprise program and infrastructure projects to address the living conditions of refugees. Not all UNRWA-registered refugees receive all the benefits available. Only one third of registered Palestine refugees are living in camps. UNRWA typically provides services directly to its beneficiaries in coordination with public services provided by the host authorities. While it continues to conduct emergency and relief operations, over time it has also developed a broader human development program to address the continuing needs of Palestine refugees. UNRWA's role as provider to one group of refugees over 50 years is unique and continues to be seen as important in the evolving situation in the Middle East.", "UNRWA is a subsidiary organ of the United Nations; its chief officer, the Commissioner General, reports directly to the General Assembly. It is governed by a 10-member Advisory Commission of which the United States is a member. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is an observer on the Commission, which also includes other representatives of the Agency's major donors and host governments. Like the other members on the Commission, the United States participates in a semi-annual review of the UNRWA program and its budget. These meetings are typically held in May and September."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UNRWA: Budget and Fund Distribution", "paragraphs": ["Ninety-five percent of the UNRWA budget is funded through voluntary contributions from governments and the European Union. Most of these funds are in cash; approximately 7% is made up of in-kind donations. Another 4% comes largely from the U.N. regular budget and covers international staff costs. There are also voluntary cash contributions earmarked for specific projects. UNRWA funds are distributed among various programs including, education, health, relief and social services, and operational and common services. Refugees also make contributions where appropriate or possible in the form of co-payments, self help projects, or voluntary contributions.", "The UNRWA's regular budget for calendar year (CY) 2003 is $344 million. More than half of its budget is spent on educational and health programs. The project budget comprises mostly non-recurrent costs specifically earmarked by donors. UNRWA has recently made internal changes to improve its management and administration of resources, for example over the last several years, it has developed a new financial system, refined its budget presentations, and expanded its auditing procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Contribution to UNRWA", "paragraphs": ["The Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), deals with problems of refugees worldwide, conflict victims, and populations of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Key programs include refugee protection (asylum issues, identification, returns, tracing activities) and quick impact, small community projects.", "Refugee emergencies lasting more than a year are funded from the regular Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account through PRM. The MRA includes four major components: Overseas Refugee Assistance, Refugee Admissions, Humanitarian Migrants to Israel, and Administration. UNRWA receives funding under Overseas Refugee Assistance, where aid to refugees consists almost entirely of contributions to international organizations and to private voluntary organizations working under the direction of such organizations in caring for refugees outside the United States. A small amount, approximately 3%, is provided directly to private voluntary organizations or to governments of first asylum countries. The primary international agencies include UNHCR and UNRWA.", "U.S. contributions to UNRWA come from the regular MRA account and also through the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) account, which is made available for refugee emergencies.

Some in Congress have also questioned whether refugee rolls are inflated. While UNRWA periodically updates the rolls to try to eliminate duplication, its mandate covers relief and social services, but not resettlement. Although the refugee camps were meant to be temporary to provide some relief to the Palestinians, more than fifty years later, some are asking whether the UNHCR might be better placed to provide ongoing assistance. UNHCR would likely pursue a durable, long-term solution for the refugees. However, others have maintained that approach cannot work until there is a settlement between the Palestinians and Israelis. While the Palestinians argue that U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194 calls for a return to their homes or compensation, the Israelis say that because they did not cause the displacement, the international community is responsible for finding a solution. At present, UNRWA is still considered by many a unique organization that is better left in place until a way forward on the peace process can be found."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of UNRWA Funds", "paragraphs": ["For many years, Congress has raised concerns about how to ensure that UNRWA funds are used for the programs it supports and not for anything inappropriate, such as terrorist activities.

The FY2003 Foreign Operations appropriations requires that the GAO review efforts of UNRWA to ensure that its programs comply with Section 301(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and report to Congress no later than November 1, 2003.
