In 2006, elections for head of government were held in 12 countries in the region, including the close election in Mexico in July, the re-election of presidents in Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, and Venezuela, and the election of former heads of government in Costa Rica, Haiti, Nicaragua, Peru, and St. Lucia. Although the region overall experienced an economic setback in 2002-2003, it has rebounded since 2004. Nevertheless, several nations faced considerable challenges that threatened political stability, including persistent poverty, violent guerrilla conflicts, autocratic leaders, drug trafficking, increasing crime, and the rise of a new form of populism in several countries.", "Legislative and oversight attention to Latin America and the Caribbean in the 109th Congress focused on continued counternarcotics efforts; trade issues; challenges to democracy, especially in Venezuela; efforts to bring political stability and ameliorate poverty in Haiti; efforts to foster political change in Cuba; and cooperation on migration and border security, especially with Mexico. Since 2000, the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) has been the primary U.S. program supporting the Colombian government's efforts to combat drug trafficking and terrorist activity perpetrated by guerrilla and paramilitary groups. In the first session, the 109th Congress approved the Administration's request to continue ACI funding in FY2006 at approximately the same levels as in previous years; the second session considered, but did not complete action, on the FY2007ACI request of $721.5 million, so the 110th Congress will need to take action early in 2007.", "In the trade arena, Congress approved legislation in 2005 (P.L. 109-53) implementing the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) that had been completed in 2004. In 2006, free trade agreements (FTAs) with Peru and Colombia were signed in April and November, respectively, and on December 19, U.S.-Panamanian FTA negotiations were completed. Implementing legislation for all three countries could be introduced early in the 110th Congress. In late 2006, Congress also extended preferences for Andean imports and approved a special trade preferences measure for imports from Haiti as part of a trade and tax-extension bill (P.L. 109-432, Division D, Titles V and VII).", "With regard to democracy, Congress provided continued support to Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest nation, under the new government of Rene Preval. Venezuela remained a congressional concern because of fears that President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has been using his political power to push toward authoritarian rule. With regard to U.S. policy toward Cuba, Congress continued to debate whether loosening or tightening the U.S. embargo would encourage political change.", "This report provides an overview of U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on the role of Congress and congressional concerns in the 109th Congress.

In some countries, weaknesses remain in the state's ability to deliver public services, ensure accountability and transparency, and advance the rule of law.", "In 2006, 12 countries held successful elections for head of state: Chile, Costa Rica, Haiti, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Guyana, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and St. Lucia. In Mexico, the narrow official victory of conservative candidate Felipe Calder\u00f3n over leftist Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez Obrador elicited a dramatic response from L\u00f3pez Obrador who protested the electoral outcome.

Every country in the region, with the exception of Grenada and Haiti, experienced positive economic growth, and even per capita income for the region as a whole increased by more than 4% for the year. Countries that had suffered the deepest recessions in recent years\u2014Argentina, Uruguay, and Venezuela\u2014all experienced significant economic growth in 2004. Growth continued in 2005 at a rate of 4.5%, with Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela all registering growth rates over 8%. Only Guyana experienced an economic setback of 3% in 2005. For 2006, a growth rate of 5.3% is projected for the region, with Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela leading the way with projected growth rates over 8%.", "The Andean region still faces considerable challenges, including the rise of a form of populism in several countries. Colombia continues to be threatened by drug trafficking organizations and by two left-wing guerrilla groups and a rightist paramilitary group, all of which, combined, have been responsible for thousands of deaths each year. Bolivia has experienced political unrest over the last few years, including the resignation of presidents in 2003 and 2005. The election of indigenous leader Evo Morales as president in December 2005 complicated U.S. relations given Morales' efforts to decriminalize coca growing. In Ecuador, Rafael Correa, a left-leaning U.S.-trained economist won the November 2006 presidential elections and has vowed to reform Ecuador's political system, renegotiate Ecuador's foreign debt, and reassert state control over foreign oil companies operating in the country. Many analysts believe that Correa could have difficultly enacting his populist agenda because his political party lacks representation in the legislature. Venezuela under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has been plagued by several years of political polarization, although Ch\u00e1vez's rule was strengthened when he survived a recall referendum in August 2004, when his supporters swept legislative elections in December 2005, and when he won another six-year term decisively in early December 2006. Windfall oil profits\u00a0have bolstered economic growth and his government's revenue, allowing it to boost social\u00a0spending significantly. In Peru, the presidential electoral victory in early June 2006 of former President Alan Garcia over retired military officer Ollanta Humala, an admirer of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, eased U.S. concerns about the future of democracy in the country and the future of U.S.-Peruvian relations.", "In Central America, countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua emerged from the turbulent 1980s and 1990s with democratic institutions more firmly entrenched, yet violent crime is a major problem in all countries. Honduras and Nicaragua are among the poorest countries in the hemisphere. While Guatemala has made significant progress in improving the government's human rights policy, significant problems remain. In Nicaragua, former President and Sandinista party leader Daniel Ortega won the November 2006 presidential election. Observers are uncertain how his government will proceed since his campaign vacillated between anti-U.S. rhetoric and reassurances that his government would respect private property, free trade policies, and work toward a cooperative relationship with the United States.", "In the Caribbean, Haiti\u2014the hemisphere's poorest nation\u2014continues to be plagued by political challenges. In the aftermath of President Aristide's departure in February 2004, Haiti's interim government was supported by a U.N. Stabilization Mission with the goals of ensuring a secure and stable environment and restoring the rule of law. After several postponements, new elections were ultimately held February 7, 2006. Former president Rene Preval was declared the winner after several days of protests by his supporters when it appeared that a run-off election would be necessary. Preval took office on May 14, 2006, marking the beginning a new era in Haiti. His goals include building governmental institutions and establishing conditions for foreign investment in order to create jobs. Cuba remains a hardline communist state with a human rights situation that has deteriorated significantly since 2003. In late July 2006, Cuban leader Fidel Castro's announcement that he was temporarily ceding political power to his brother for several weeks in order to recover from surgery prompted widespread speculation about the island's political future and the future of U.S.-Cuban relations after Fidel departs the political scene. Several Caribbean nations, especially Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba, were hard hit by several\u00a0devastating storms in 2004 and 2005.

The ACI has also provided interdiction and development support to six of Colombia's neighbors: Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil, and Panama. The 109 th Congress approved the Administration's request to continue ACI funding in FY2006 at approximately the same levels as in previous years. In 2006, Congress considered the Administration's FY2007 request for $721.5 million in ACI funding with human rights and the environmental consequences of aerial fumigation remaining issues in the congressional debate.

The Bush Administration viewed the agreement as a way for the region to help create jobs, attract foreign investment, and advance good governance. As reflected in the narrow passage in the House, congressional consideration of the DR-CAFTA was controversial, with opposition from labor advocates and some industry groups. In 2006, free trade agreements (FTAs) with Peru and Colombia were signed in April and November, respectively, and on December 19, U.S.-Panamanian FTA negotiations were completed.

In Bolivia, the new government of President Evo Morales, a former leader of the coca growers union, has complicated U.S. relations not only because of his criticism of U.S. counternarcotics policy but also because of his leftist orientation and close relations with Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Cuba's Fidel Castro. With regard to U.S. policy toward Communist Cuba, Congress has continued to focus on the poor human rights situation and to debate whether loosening or tightening the U.S. embargo will encourage political change. Fidel Castro's announcement that he was ceding power to his brother temporarily could foster a re-examination of U.S. policy.", "Congress has maintained an active interest in neighboring Mexico, focusing especially on border security and migration issues. In May 2005, Congress approved legislation (as part of P.L. 109-13 , the FY2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act) that established identity card standards for the issuance of drivers' licenses, waived laws to facilitate the construction of a border fence, and required a pilot test of ground surveillance technologies at the border. In September 2006, Congress approved the Secure Fence Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-367 ), which authorized the construction of a fence and other barriers along 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. Both the House and Senate approved separate immigration reform measures in 2006 ( H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 ), but did not complete action on the measures. The House bill would have strengthened border and immigration controls and would have made unlawful presence in the United States a felony, while the Senate measure also included enforcement measures (but would not make unlawful presence a felony) as well as a guest worker program, and would have allowed most illegal immigrants to normalize their status in the United States.", "Congressional consideration of the annual foreign operations appropriations legislation that funds foreign aid remained an important way for Congress to influence U.S. policy toward the region. U.S. foreign aid is largely administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The agency supports such activities as education, poverty reduction, health care, conservation, natural disaster mitigation and reconstruction, counternarcotics and alternative development, and HIV/AIDS prevention and education. In addition, the United States provides food assistance, anti-terrorism assistance, and security assistance. In the aftermath of several devastating storms in 2004, the United States provided disaster and reconstruction assistance to several Caribbean nations. Overall U.S. foreign aid to the Latin America and Caribbean region amounted to about $1.82 billion in FY2005, and an estimated $1.68 billion in FY2006. The FY2007 request for the region was for $1.63 billion, but as noted above, action was not completed on the FY2007 foreign aid appropriations measure, so the 110 th Congress will face the task in early 2007. In addition, the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) also has increased U.S. aid to several Latin American nations.

Since 2000, U.S. assistance has focused on counternarcotics especially in the Andean region. Current aid levels to Latin America and the Caribbean comprise about 11.8% of the worldwide FY2006 bilateral aid budget. Appropriations for FY2007 have not been finalized, and will likely be determined in early 2007. Amounts requested for FY2007 would reduce this ratio to 10.6%, despite concerns expressed by Members of Congress about decreasing levels of aid to the region. Current aid levels could increase as more countries are deemed eligible for Millennium Challenge Account grants.", "The annual Foreign Operations Appropriations bills have been the vehicles by which Congress provides funding for, and sets conditions on foreign assistance programs. For FY2006, U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean amounted to an estimated $1.68 billion, the largest portion of which, $919 million, was allocated to the Andean region. Mexico and Central America received $292 million, while the Caribbean received $307 million. Brazil and the Southern Cone of South America received an estimated $36 million. The United States also maintains programs of a regional nature that totaled an estimated $133 million in FY2006.", "The FY2007 request of $1.6 billion represents the lowest levels of U.S. foreign assistance to the region in more than four decades, measured in constant dollars. The FY2007 request is 3% lower than FY2006. The largest decrease occurs in the Development Assistance Account, which sustains a 28% reduction. The largest increase is for Economic Support Funds (up 26%) and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (up 35%). The increase in Economic Support Funds includes trade assistance for DR-CAFTA countries.

Economic Support Funds (ESF) assist countries of strategic importance to the United States and fund programs relating to justice sector reforms, local governance, anti-corruption, and respect for human rights. P.L. 480 food assistance is provided to countries facing emergency situations, such as natural disasters. Counternarcotics programs seek to assist countries to reduce drug production, to interdict trafficking, and to promote alternative crop development.

However, the report accompanying the bill cautioned the Administration on providing levels of assistance to Latin America in FY2007 that would be below that provided in FY2006. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up its bill on June 29, 2006.

The American Service Members Protection Act (ASPA, Title II of P.L. 107-206 ) applies the aid cutoff to FMF and International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds. However, the conference report to the FY2007 Defense Authorization measure ( P.L. 109-364 , signed into law in October 2006) modified ASPA to end the ban on IMET aid to countries that are members of the ICC and that do not have Article 98 agreements in place. The FY2005 and FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations acts extended the prohibition to ESF assistance. Colombia, the major recipient of U.S. assistance in Latin America, has signed an agreement.

In Latin America, Bolivia, Honduras, and Nicaragua were deemed eligible to participate in the first round; El Salvador became eligible for FY2006. In 2005, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) approved five-year compacts with Honduras and Nicaragua, and in 2006 it approved a five-year compact with El Salvador. Both Guyana and Paraguay have received threshold assistance from the MCC to help assist the countries become eligible for an MCC compact. Other Latin American or Caribbean nations could be eligible to receive assistance in future years.

The ACI program is regional in nature because organizations in countries bordering Colombia also produce and traffic in narcotics and because it is affected by other cross-border issues. The ACI began in 2000, when Congress passed legislation providing $1.3 billion in interdiction and development assistance ( P.L. 106-246 ) for Colombia and six regional neighbors: Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil, and Panama. Funding for ACI from FY2000 through FY2006 totals approximately $5 billion.", "For FY2007, the Administration requested $721.5 million, of which $65.7 million was proposed for the Critical Flight Safety Program, to upgrade aging aircraft. Funding for the Air Bridge Denial program, an air interdiction program in operation over Colombia, was included in the request for Colombia. On June 9, 2006, the House passed H.R. 5522 , the FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, that makes significant changes to the way foreign aid to Colombia is provided but largely approves the Administration's request with regard to funding levels. The most significant change is to provide some funding for Colombia from traditional aid accounts rather than the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) and to create a new account, the Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund, to which some ACI funds would be transferred. The bill provides a total of $545.2 million for Colombia, an increase of $80.4 million over the FY2006 level. Instead of funding alternative development and institution building from the ACI account, the bill provides $135 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for alternative development, a $10 million increase from the request. In addition, the bill provides $26.2 million in International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funds for rule of law programs, equal to the request, that were previously provided from the ACI account. Funding for drug interdiction programs at $313.9 million, equal to the request, is maintained in the ACI account. The provision of some funds from non-ACI accounts is characterized as beginning the process of treating Colombia as a strategic partner. The bill also provides $70.2 million for the Critical Flight Safety Program, earmarked for operations in Colombia. This is $4.5 million above the request.", "The bill increases funding for Peru by $10.5 million over the request, providing $46 million for alternative development and $63 million for interdiction programs. These funds remain in the ACI account. The bill cuts ACI funding for Bolivia by $15 million from the request, all of it in interdiction programs. Funding for alternative development is set at $31 million, and $20 million for interdiction. The cut was made in response to reports that Bolivia's commitment to fighting drugs was lessening. ACI funding for Brazil ($4 million), Ecuador ($17.3 million), and Panama ($4 million) is equal to the request. The $1 million requested for Venezuela was not provided. The bill creates a new account, the Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund, and a new position at USAID to oversee and coordinate trade assistance programs. Although the total amount provided is $522 million, the bill transfers $62.5 million of ACI funds to the new account for use in ACI countries.

Assistance to Colombia's neighbors, according to supporters, is merited because of an increasing threat from the spillover of violence and drug production from Colombia. While some critics agree with this assessment, they argue that U.S. assistance overemphasizes military and counter-drug assistance and provides inadequate support for protecting human rights. Critics also assert that U.S. assistance is disproportionately targeted to eradication of crops and military training rather than to alternative development projects that could provide alternative livelihoods for growers who voluntarily give up illicit crops.", "For a broader discussion of Colombia beyond the ACI, see section on \" Colombia \" below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Free Trade Agreements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA)", "paragraphs": ["On August 5, 2004, the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic signed the DR-CAFTA.

However, the United Nations also reported an 8% increase in acreage devoted to coca cultivation; the first such increase since 2000. At 212,510 acres, the area of cultivation remains 47% less than in 2000 when 403,350 acres were under cultivation. It is believed that the Plan Colombia spraying goals are ahead of schedule. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) enlarged its area of survey in 2005, which showed 355,680 acres under cultivation. This figure represents a 26% increase over ONDCP data for 2004; however, when the survey area was limited to the same area as in 2004, the ONDCP found an 8% reduction in coca cultivation. Although the new survey area showed an increase in coca cultivation, ONDCP argues that this new data can be used to better target future eradication efforts the previous year because newly-planted crops are less productive. In 2005, the State Department reports that 343,000 acres of coca and 4,000 acres of opium poppy were sprayed. The spraying does not prevent, although it may discourage, the replanting of illicit crops. In November 2005, the ONDCP announced a slight increase in the street price of cocaine in 2004. The significance of this report was challenged by critics of U.S. policy because 2003 prices were the lowest since 1981. Critics also maintained that short-term fluctuations in price do not necessarily signal significant changes in supply.", "On July 15, 2003, the Uribe Administration announced an agreement with leaders of the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) that was to result in the demobilization of its members by the end of 2005.

An estimated 2,000 paramilitaries remain outside of the disarmament process. The demobilization process has posed a number of controversial issues relating to ensuring accountability of militants while providing a large enough incentive for fighters to lay down their arms. The outcome of such a process could have effects on how Colombian citizens feel about the effectiveness of the country's judicial system, the rule of law, and the ability of the state to provide for a general level of safety. There are also concerns that some fighters that operate outside of the AUC umbrella will not demobilize and will continue to carry out their operations in rural areas. Critics also note that paramilitaries demobilized under the controversial Justice and Peace Law will receive reduced sentences of five to eight years and may be protected from extradition to the United States. Critics also are concerned that the demobilization process does not address the criminal enterprises, such as narcotics trafficking, that financed the AUC's political operations and that the paramilitaries are re-organizing, not demobilizing. Further concern has focused on the ability of the government to re-incorporate ex-fighters into law-abiding civilian life and to provide some type of restitution to their victims.", "The issue of drug trafficking is exacerbated by humanitarian conditions resulting from more than 40 years of civil war between the Colombian government, the FARC, National Liberation Army (ELN), and right-wing paramilitaries.

The Sandinistas negotiated a change in the electoral law with then-President Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n's party eliminating the requirement that a candidate gain 45% of the vote to avoid a run-off election. The new law requires that a presidential candidate win either 40% of valid votes, or 35% of the vote plus at least 5% more votes than the second-place candidate in order to win in a first round. Ortega won only 37.9% of the vote, but was able to avoid a run-off vote because he was 9.6% ahead of the next closest candidate, Eduardo Montealegre of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) party. The opposition was divided among four candidates. In the 2001 presidential elections, Ortega received 40% of the vote, but faced a united opposition and lost. Observers are unsure what Ortega's government positions will be, as he vacillated during his campaign between anti-U.S. rhetoric and pragmatic reassurances that his second administration would respect private property, pursue free-trade policies, and seek a cooperative relationship with the United States.", "Montealegre, who gained 28.3% of the vote, is a Harvard-educated banker and former finance minister who split from the conservative Liberal party dominated by Aleman, and advocated continued political reform. He was regarded by many as the U.S.-favored candidate. He will have a seat in the legislature. In third place with 26.2% was the Constitutional Liberal party (PLC) candidate Jos\u00e9 Rizo, an ally of Alem\u00e1n and critic of President Bola\u00f1os. Edmundo Jarquin registered a distant fourth place at 6.4%. Jarquin, an economist who worked at the Inter-American Development Bank, left the FSLN in opposition to Ortega and in favor of political reform. He became the presidential candidate of the Sandinista Renewal Movement (MRS) when nominee Herty Lewites died suddenly in July 2006. Eden Pastora, a disaffected one-time Sandinista leader, won less than half a percent of the vote. The 90-member National Assembly was also elected; no party won an outright majority. The FSLN will have 38 seats, the PLC 25, the ALN 22, and the MRS 5. International and domestic observation groups pressed the government to address problems during the pre-election process such as a high rate of errors on voter registry lists, and\u00a0difficulty getting voter identification cards needed to vote, and considered the elections to\u00a0be fair.", "U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) elections support for Nicaragua was expected to reach at least $12 million for election support activities by November 5, 2006. Critics accused both U.S. officials and Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of trying to influence the election's outcome: the U.S. embassy for making critical remarks, such as alluding to Ortega and Rizo as \"two corrupt bosses;\" Ch\u00e1vez for supporting Ortega by providing fertilizer and oil under favorable terms through Sandinista-dominated groups. U.S. Ambassador Paul Trivelli, asserting his right to express his opinion, rejected calls to stop commenting on the elections.", "The elections followed more than a year of political tensions among current President Enrique Bola\u00f1os, the leftist Sandinista party, and allies of rightist former President Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n (1997-2002). During the height of tensions, President Bola\u00f1os invoked the OAS Inter-American Democratic Charter, and the OAS sent several high-level delegations to help negotiate a solution. Bola\u00f1os had been isolated by his anti-corruption efforts against Alem\u00e1n, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2003 for fraud and money-laundering. Aleman still controls the PLC, and has obtained a conditional release. Ortega announced he was breaking the power-sharing pact between his party and the PLC that had defined national politics since it was negotiated in 1998 and hampered Bola\u00f1os' ability to govern. The FSLN and PLC still controlled many state institutions, however, including the electoral authority. After Ortega's announcement, the legislature passed reforms such as the passage of the 2006 budget, the first-ever tax code, local government transfers, and financial administration. Ortega and Bola\u00f1os then agreed to postpone the implementation of constitutional amendments at the root of the tensions. These amendments will transfer significant executive powers to the legislature in February 2007, unless Ortega's newly elected government seeks to change them.", "The National Assembly approved DR-CAFTA in October 2005 and passed intellectual property and other reforms in March 2006. It went into effect on April 1, 2006. Nicaragua is the second poorest nation in the hemisphere, rating only above Haiti. Nicaragua's poverty is widespread and acute. More than two-thirds of the rural population live in poverty. Some social indicators have shown little or no improvement since 1993. DR-CAFTA supporters say the agreement will promote economic growth, create jobs, and increase exports to the United States. In 2005, the Administration signed a five-year, $175 million agreement with Nicaragua under the Millennium Challenge Account program to promote rural development.", "The Bush Administration suspended military assistance to Nicaragua in March 2005, resuming it in October when an agreement was worked out to destroy anti-aircraft missiles the Administration says constitute a possible terrorist threat. The National Assembly suddenly voted on a law authorizing the missiles' destruction on July 13. Sandinista legislators walked out in protest, but PLC and Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) legislators passed the bill 46 to 1. None of the missiles were destroyed, however, and with the election of Sandinista leader Ortega as President,\u00a0their destruction does not appear likely to happen soon. Nicaragua hosted a meeting of\u00a0hemispheric secretaries of defense in October 2006 at which regional security concerns were\u00a0addressed.", "Resolution of property claims by U.S. citizens and immigration are contentious areas in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations. Nicaragua passed a law, scheduled to go into effect in 2007, creating a new Property Institute that could lead to the dismissal of property claim lawsuits arising from expropriations carried out by the Sandinista government in the 1980s. A House-passed immigration bill ( H.R. 4437 ) would have made unlawful presence in the United States a criminal, rather than a civil offense. A Senate-passed bill ( S. 2611 ) would have combined enforcement with guest-worker provisions. Nicaragua joined the Mexican and other Central American governments in criticizing U.S. efforts to increase border enforcement and demanded guest-worker programs. In February 2006, the Department of Homeland Security extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for about 4,000 eligible Nicaraguans living in the United States until July 5, 2007.

Torrijos, the son of former populist leader General Omar Torrijos, won a decisive electoral victory with almost 48% of the vote in a four-man race. He succeeded President Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfist Party (PA), elected in 1999, whose administration was tainted by several high-profile corruption scandals. Torrijos' electoral alliance also won a majority of seats in the unicameral Legislative Assembly.", "The most significant challenges facing the Torrijos government have included dealing with the funding deficits of the country's social security fund; developing plans for the expansion of the Panama Canal; and combating unemployment and poverty. After protests and a protracted strike by construction workers, doctors, and teachers in 2005, the Torrijos government was forced to modify its plans for reforming the social security fund. In April 2006, the government unveiled its ambitious plans to build a third lane and new set of locks that will double the Canal's capacity.

Garcia's earlier presidency (1985-1990), characterized by many observers as disastrous, was marked by hyper-inflation and a violent guerrilla insurgency. He also sought to reassure poor citizens that he was addressing their needs by pledging austerity measures such as halving the Government Palace's annual spending and redirecting the funds to a rural irrigation project. His initially high level of public support has begun to drop, however, as reflected in the poor showing of Garcia's APRA party in municipal and regional elections held on November 19, 2006.", "The former President was elected again on June 4, 2006, defeating populist Ollanta Humala.

Chavez raised fears among middle- and upper-class Peruvians of expropriations reminiscent of those that occurred under a military dictator praised by both Ch\u00e1vez and Humala. Humala, a retired army officer who led an uprising against then-President Fujimori, espoused nationalist, anti-globalization policies. Many observers were concerned that Humala had authoritarian tendencies.
