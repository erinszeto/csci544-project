Formal negotiations began in July 2013. Through the negotiations, both sides are seeking to liberalize transatlantic trade and investment, set globally relevant rules and disciplines that could boost economic growth, support multilateral trade liberalization through the World Trade Organization (WTO), and address third-country trade policy challenges. Agricultural issues have been an active topic of debate in the negotiations, given the potential market access gains for both sides and the potential to address a series of regulatory and intellectual property rights issues.", "The United States is among the world's largest net exporters of agricultural products. The EU is an important export market for U.S. agricultural exports and ranks as the fifth largest market for U.S. food and farm exports. However, in recent years, growth in U.S. agricultural exports to the EU has not kept pace with growth in trade to other U.S. markets, and imports from Europe currently exceed U.S. exports to the EU. In 2015, U.S. exports of agricultural products to the EU totaled $12 billion, while EU exports of agricultural products to the United States totaled $20 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of nearly $8 billion for the United States and reversing the net trade surplus in U.S. agricultural exports to the EU during the 1990s.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that the EU's average agricultural tariff is 30%, well above the average U.S. agricultural tariff of 12%. Restrictive tariff rate quotas (TRQs) on agricultural products are also a concern for U.S. exporters. A USDA study reports that removing tariffs and TRQs could increase U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by an estimated $5.5 billion (compared to a 2011 base year). EU exports to the United States are estimated to rise by $0.8 billion. These totals cover all current 28 EU member states.", "High tariff barriers are further exacerbated by additional non-tariff barriers that may limit U.S. agricultural exports. Addressing non-tariff barriers is another major goal of the U.S. agricultural sectors in the negotiation, covering certain sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) concerns. These include delays in reviews of biotech products (limiting U.S. exports of grain and oilseed products), prohibitions on growth hormones in beef production and certain antimicrobial and pathogen reduction treatments (limiting U.S. meat and poultry exports), and burdensome and complex certification requirements (limiting U.S. exports of processed foods, animal products, and dairy products). As such, T-TIP negotiations on agricultural products are conditioned by a number of these long-standing, high-profile transatlantic trade disputes between the United States and EU. Other EU regulations of concern to U.S. exporters include lack of a science-based focus in establishing SPS measures, difficulty meeting food safety standards and obtaining product certification, lack of cohesive labeling requirements, and stringent testing requirements that are often applied inconsistently across EU member nations. USDA reports that removing select non-tariff barriers affecting meats, field crops, and fruits and vegetables could raise U.S. exports to the EU by an additional $4.1 billion over gains estimated from removing tariffs and TRQs (compared to a 2011 base year) across all current 28 EU member states.", "Other U.S. concerns involve the EU's use of geographical indications (GIs)\u2014certain protected product names that many U.S. food producers consider to be generic names.

By comparison, changes in both EU agricultural exports and imports are estimated to be lower. These results suggest that while agricultural trade between the United States and EU is expected to increase, the overall gains to U.S. agricultural exports could be greater than gains in EU exports, mostly attributable to expected lower overall prices for U.S. products following the removal of EU tariffs and TRQs.", "USDA further reports that removing selected non-tariff barriers, in addition to removing tariffs and TRQs in U.S.-EU trade, could increase U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by an additional estimated $4.1 billion annually (measured against a 2011 base year).

Including all products imported under an applied tariff and TRQ, USDA reports that the calculated average rate across all U.S. agricultural imports is roughly 12% overall, well below the EU's average of 30%. By commodity group, EU tariffs average more than 40% for imported meat products, grains, and grain products and average at or above 20% for most fruit and vegetable products. For some products EU tariffs are even greater, averaging more than 80% for imported dairy products, more that 50% for sugar cane and sweeteners, and nearly 350% for sugar beets. USDA further notes that other EU trading partners benefit from preferential tariff access to the EU, given that the EU has concluded FTAs with more than 30 countries and plans to negotiate agreements with a dozen more countries. This preferential access provides other U.S. export competitors an advantage over U.S. agricultural exporters.", "TRQs on agricultural products are also a concern for U.S. exporters. TRQs allow imports of fixed quantities of a product at a lower tariff. Once the quota is filled, a higher tariff is applied on additional imports. The EU allocates TRQs to importers using import licenses issued by the member states' national authorities. Only companies established in the EU may apply for import licenses. For exports under a U.S.-specific TRQ, a certificate of origin must be supplied. The EU has TRQs on exports of many beef and poultry products, sheep and goat meat, dairy products, cereals, rice, sugar, and fruit and vegetables. Some products are heavily protected by both TRQs and non-tariff SPS measures.

One major difference is the EU's application of the so-called precautionary principle , which remains central to the EU's risk management policy regarding food safety and animal and plant health and is often cited as the rationale behind the EU's practice of taking a generally more risk-averse approach to risk management. The Appendix provides a more detailed discussion of the EU's use of the precautionary principle.

Some in the EU have also expressed such concerns, suggesting that a less ambitious negotiated agreement (e.g., focused only on market access) would also be unacceptable to EU lawmakers.", "In the T-TIP negotiations, non-tariff barriers including SPS and TBT issues have been broadly grouped along with other issues related to regulatory coherence.

Previous EU tabled text on SPS issues proposed to \"build upon and extend the scope\" of the Veterinary Equivalency Agreement that the United States and EU signed in 1998 to include additional animal welfare protections. Such protections are generally opposed by some U.S. farm groups. Other types of regulatory coherence talking points involve notice-and-comment procedures, testing requirements, and other compliance issues, such as whether to allow for third-party labs (as in the United States) or self-certification (as in the EU).", "Various reports have further indicated that some U.S. and EU stakeholders seek to include a range of related policy issues that may or may not become part of the T-TIP negotiations. These include the use of certain pesticides and chemicals, the use of antibiotics in animal production, and the role of technology in agriculture, among other applications. Some issues have been raised as T-TIP proposals. For example, the EU has submitted a proposal to address anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in the SPS chapter of T-TIP \"aimed at strong cooperation within the framework of T-TIP on jointly reducing the use of antibiotics in animal production in order to combat the development of antibiotic resistance.\" The United States is still actively considering how it will address the use of antibiotics in U.S. animal production, but some in Congress are supporting restrictions similar to those in the EU. Some issues of interest to the Unites States, such as concerns regarding the EU's prohibition on the use of ractopamine and hormones in livestock production\u2014drugs and practices widely used in the United States\u2014may be more difficult to raise as part of the T-TIP negotiation since some issues are already established in EU law. ", "Other issues of potential concern to U.S. interests are also emerging. For example, in September 2015, the European Parliament voted to ban the cloning of all farm animals and the sale of cloned livestock, their offspring, and products derived from them. Cloning for research purposes would be permitted. The EU's position on cloning is at odds with that of the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has found no significant differences between healthy clones and non-cloned animals. FDA also regards the products from cloned animals to be as safe as that from non-clones. The United States and Brazil raised concerns about the EU's proposal at a WTO TBT Committee meeting in November 2015.

EFSA recently concluded that \"glyphosate is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e., damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans.\" EU's proposal to restrict use is opposed by some U.S. agrochemical groups. Also in June 2016 the EU released a draft proposal to establish criteria for endocrine (hormone) disrupting chemicals, which are opposed by some U.S. groups. The EU is also considering changes to laws and regulations affecting the use of nanotechnology. CropLife America estimates that the EU's rules affecting endocrine disrupting chemicals could block $4 billion in U.S. agricultural exports annually and expects that the T-TIP talks will help avoid such trade disruption. It is unclear whether these issues will be directly addressed in the negotiation.", "In some cases, the U.S. Administration has explicitly pursued certain trade issues by outside the T-TIP negotiations, such as perceived import restrictions on pasteurized milk products by EU dairy producers trying to obtain Grade A certification from the United States.

U.S. soybean, cotton, and corn farmers have rapidly adopted genetically engineered (GE) varieties of these crops since their commercialization starting in 1996. Over the past few decades, GE varieties in the United States have increased. In recent years, USDA reports that U.S. farmers planted roughly 170 million acres of GE crops annually. Worldwide, 28 countries planted GE crops on an estimated 444 million acres in 2015. GE varieties now dominate soybean, cotton, and corn production in the United States, and they continue to expand rapidly in other countries. A 2016 study published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found \"no substantiated evidence that foods from GE crops were less safe than foods from non-GE crops\" based on a review of the scientific literature. ", "In general, EU officials have been cautious in allowing GE crops\u2014commonly referred to in Europe as genetically modified organisms (GMOs)\u2014to enter the EU market, and all GE-derived food and feed must be labeled as such. The EU's regulatory framework regarding biotechnology is generally regarded as one of the most stringent systems worldwide. ", "This regulatory framework requires all GE food and feed to undergo an authorization (approval) process, be labeled and traceable, and \"co-exist\" with non-GE (conventional) food and feed. This approach stipulates that \"growing GM crops requires authorization based on a rigorous safety assessment (environmental and health impact); food and feed derived from GM crops must be labelled as such, to inform consumers; [and] technical and administrative measures must be taken to ensure GM crops can sustainably coexist with conventional or organic farming (e.g. limiting cross-fertilization of plants in neighboring fields).\" ", "GE crops play a limited role in the EU's agricultural production. Currently, Monsanto's Bt corn (MON 810) is the only GE plant authorized (approved) for cultivation in the EU and is grown only in Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic (Czechia), Slovakia, and Romania ( Table 4 ). The EU's Bt corn production peaked at 367,300 acres in 2015, accounting for about 1% of the EU's total corn acreage. Most production (94%) is in Spain, with another 5% in Portugal. Other GE products are authorized for food or feed use in the EU, including certain varieties of corn, cotton, soybean, canola (rapeseed), sugar beet, and microorganisms (bacterial and yeast biomass). A listing of genetically modified food and feed approved (authorized) in the EU is available through its register. As of July 2016, the EU had authorized or is considering renewal of 57 GE varieties. Another 22 registrations are still under review. An authorization permit applies to all EU countries. Soybean meal is the main GE product imported in the EU, mostly from Brazil.", "Even if a GE variety is approved, an EU member state is able to ban cultivation. Several EU countries have banned the cultivation of GE crops in their territories or have specific rules on the trade of GE seeds. ", "A series of regulations, directives, and recommendations govern the EU's handling of food and feed derived from genetic engineering. The text box summarizes key directives and regulations.", "Even though a GE variety has been approved, further authorization is required to allow for the cultivation or \"deliberate release into the environment\" of a GE variety. EFSA grants authorization by assessing the environmental and health risks according to the EU's deliberate release rules. EU regulations further establish a minimum threshold of \"adventitious presence\" or \"technically unavoidable traces\" of authorized GE material, below which these products need not be labeled (Article 21). In the EU, this minimum threshold is set at 0.9%. Although some major U.S. trading partner countries have established certain allowable tolerance levels for GE as part of their labeling laws, the United States does not specify such tolerance levels for GE in any of its laws, policies, or guidance. Moreover, USDA \"has not established an official tolerance level for the specific amount of unintended GE material that can be found in organically grown and other non-GE products.\" Some private processors, retailers, and buyers in countries without regulatory requirements may also set a minimum tolerance level. USDA reports that many U.S. organic and non-GE food manufacturers and retailers adhere to the 0.9% tolerance level, such as under the Non-GMO Project Verified protocol. Other EU regulations address labeling and traceability of GMOs in the EU market. ", "In January 2015, the European Parliament adopted new legislation to allow each EU member state to ban or approve GE crops in its respective country. Proposals to implement these new directives were released in March 2015. Many in the United States believe the EU's proposal lacks a scientific basis and question whether the measures might violate the SPS agreement. As of October 2015, a reported 19 member states have requested to restrict GE cultivation. Several EU countries have signed a \"joint declaration\" calling for the development of a GE-free agricultural model in Europe. Other proposed efforts seeking to ban or restrict the use or sale of EU-approved GE products in member territories have been rejected by the European Parliament. The new legislation allows member states to ban cultivation of a GE crop even if it has been approved for cultivation. To date, EU countries opting out of GE crop cultivation include Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, and Slovenia ( Figure 3 ). Belgium and Britain requested opt-out for only part of their countries' respective territories\u2014Wallonia in Belgium and Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland in the UK. Germany has requested a partial opt-out to allow research.", "Several EU countries have not opted out of GE crop cultivation. These include Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Ireland, part of the United Kingdom (England), parts of Belgium, the Czech Republic (Czechia), Slovakia, Romania, Portugal, and Spain. ", "Public opinion remains strongly opposed to GE food and the cultivation of GE crops in most EU member states, although national political leaders are generally considered to be more supportive. A 2010 survey by the EC suggests overall \"suspicion\" of GE foods among the European public: 70% agree that GE food is \"fundamentally unnatural,\" and 61% agree that GE food \"makes them feel uneasy.\" In addition, roughly 60% of Europeans disagree that the development of GE food should be encouraged.

Previously, in October 2014, Senator Chuck Grassley sent a letter to the EC to press for the completion of the review process for eight pending approvals covering soy, corn, canola, and cotton that had received positive reviews from EFSA. U.S. farm groups sent similar letters to USTR and the EC. In April 2015, the EC authorized imports of 17 GM products, which EuropaBio claims had been pending on average 6.5 years from the time of submission until the final authorization.

EU regulations released in 2013, providing the basis upon which companies submit applications for authorization and EFSA risk assessment, were intended to clarify the application for authorization procedures and improve the process. USDA, however, claims that these regulatory changes will \"unlikely ... speed up the process, and the flexibility of risk assessors to adapt the approach used on a case-by-case basis will be reduced by imposing mandatory studies.\" Moreover, U.S. producers continue to assert that continuing EU labeling and traceability regulations and lack of timelines and transparency in the EU process for admitting GMO products have caused U.S. exports of certain crops, such as soybeans, to decline over time. Some in Congress question whether they would approve T-TIP negotiating language that does not address the EU's biotechnology approval process.

Other recommendations regarding the EU guidance documentation include aligning risk assessment requirements and adhering to legislated timelines, adopting commercially viable low-level presence policy, and improving accountability with regard to avoiding and resolving disputes, among other regulatory coherence recommendations. Accordingly, U.S. negotiators are seeking more consistent and timely biotech approvals and want the EU to \"commit to doing what their law says\" to reduce the risk of trade disruption resulting from gaps between the respective approval processes in the United States and EU.

Several EU trade associations representing feed grain suppliers have also expressed similar concerns.", "Among the types of factors cited for the EU's hesitation in completing the approvals are opposition to GE crop approvals from a majority of EU member states and support to allow for national bans on GE crop cultivation.

EU officials argue that the number of product approval requests is increasing, but some agricultural industry stakeholders assert that the time for processing (close to 3.5 years in the EU, in contrast to an average of 1.5 years in the United States) and the backlog in approvals continue to disrupt trade. These stakeholders suggest that legally prescribed timelines, transparency, and risk assessment (among other things) could be established to address these issues.

Some groups that support the EU's more cautious approach to the use of biotechnology contend that U.S. laws do not provide for adequate regulation and testing of GE crops, and they further support the EU's labeling requirements for GE products.

In this manner, GIs can be commercially valuable. GIs may also be eligible for relief from acts of infringement or unfair competition. The use of GIs may also protect consumers from deceptive or misleading labels. Examples of GIs include Parmesan cheese and Parma ham from the Parma region of Italy, Tuscan olive oil, Roquefort cheese, Champagne from the region of the same name in France, Irish whiskey, Darjeeling tea, Ceylon tea, Florida oranges, Idaho potatoes, Vidalia onions, Washington State apples, and Napa Valley wines.", "GIs are an example of IPR, along with other types of intellectual property such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets.

This has become a concern for U.S. agricultural exporters following a series of recently concluded trade agreements between the EU and countries such as Canada, South Korea, South Africa, and other countries that are, in many cases, also major trading partners with the United States. Specifically, provisions in these agreements may provide full protection of GIs and not defer to a country's independent assessment of generic status for key product names. For example, separate recent agreements negotiated by the EU with Canada and South Africa could reportedly recognize up to 200 EU GIs for milk and dairy products. Similar types of GI protections are reportedly also in other trade agreements between the EU and other countries, affecting a range of food products and wine. In addition to facing trade restrictions for U.S. products in the EU market, these protections may limit the future sale of U.S. exported products bearing such names to these third countries, regardless of whether the United States may have been exporting such products carrying a generic name for years.

Others note that the GI debate in the T-TIP negotiation threatens U.S. commercial interests by blocking current and future U.S. exports of agricultural products (particularly cheese exports), discriminating against U.S. branded products that have greatly expanded the visibility and demand for certain GI products, and creating inconsistency in EU lists of generic terms (for example, through the inclusion of new and expanded protected names, such as feta).", "Many U.S. food producers are also members of the Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN), along with producers in other countries including Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Costa Rica.

The 2006 agreement addressed a range of issues regarding wine production, labeling, and import requirements and was intended to establish predictable conditions for bilateral wine trade.

However, since the Brexit vote, some in Congress have indicated the possibility of the United States negotiating a separate bilateral FTA with the UK. As the UK begins the process of exiting the EU, it will likely remain subject to the same tariffs and trade-related measures as countries outside of the network of U.S. FTAs.

The stated policy of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is also to support a \"science-based approach to risk management, where risk is assessed based on scientifically sound and technically rigorous standards\" and \"oppose the domestic and international adoption of the precautionary principle as a basis for regulatory decision making.\" Its strategy aims to \"educate consumers, businesses, and federal policymakers about the implications of the precautionary principle.\" ", "Several U.S. agricultural and manufacturing groups continue to oppose the EU's application of the precautionary principle and argue that it allows EU regulations to disregard scientific evidence demonstrating that certain food products and processes are safe, based on evidence from available scientific risk assessments, allowing the EU and other importing countries to engage in disguised protectionism. Some in the U.S. agriculture and food industry are urging that the T-TIP agriculture negotiations address the use and application of the principle, which is central to the EU's risk management policy. Some contend that the EU's use of the precautionary principle contributes to its practice of taking a generally \"more risk-averse approach to risk management\" and \"allows EU regulators to put in place restrictions on products or processes when they believe that scientific evidence on their potential impact on human health or the environment is inconclusive.\" Many in the United States claim that \"science-based decision making and not the precautionary principle must be the defining principle in setting up mechanisms and systems\" to address SPS concerns. Other T-TIP objectives for some U.S. agricultural and food groups include calls for changes to the EU's approach for approving and labeling biotechnology products. ", "However, some wish to further strengthen the EU's application of the precautionary principle and believe the SPS agreement too severely limits its use. Many in the EU continue to defend the application of the precautionary principle to a range of agricultural issues, and U.S. agriculture and food groups have expressed concern that \"a resolution regarding the T-TIP passed by the European Parliament on April 24 [2013] strongly expresses the intent of the EU to maintain the precautionary principle, which would undermine sound science and ultimately the agreement itself.\" ", "Some groups have expressed concern that the T-TIP negotiations might cause the EU to relax its food safety laws and standards, which some believe to be superior to laws and standards in the United States. The EU's proposals on regulatory cooperation, released in March 2016, restate the ability of each party to \"apply its fundamental principles governing regulatory measures in its jurisdiction, for example in the areas of risk assessment and risk management,\" which some broadly interpreted as covering the EU's continued application of the precautionary principle.", "Recent developments further illustrate this divide. Negotiating documents made public in May 2016 were said to suggest, based on the analysis by environmental advocates who released them, that the EU had made compromises in certain areas, including the \"precautionary principle.\" Related criticisms suggest that a U.S. proposal regarding the EU's biotechnology approval process would likely commit the EU to faster approvals of GE products and would change EU policies regarding traces of GE product found in otherwise approved GE or conventional shipments. Policymakers in both the United States and EU have discredited this interpretation of events. Press reports indicate that USTR has called these interpretations as \"misleading\" and \"wrong.\"", "The EU's trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, responded that the EU's proposal for regulatory coherence that was tabled during the February 2016 round and made public \"includes references to the precautionary principle, and points out our well-established public consultation procedures that are open to all stakeholders.\" Specifically, the introduction to the EU's proposal stated: \"We stress our commitment to enhance or maintain the levels of protection in public policy areas, to respect the right to regulate and the application of our fundamental principles such as the precautionary principle for the EU side.\" ", "The statement further says: \"No EU trade agreement will ever lower our level of protection of consumers, or food safety, or of the environment. Trade agreements will not change our laws on GMOs, or how to produce safe beef, or how to protect the environment.\" Also in response to press reports, the European Parliament's trade committee chairman, Bernd Lange, said: \"The S&D [Socialists and Democrats] Group demands that the EU be equally tough in upholding our own values, including safeguarding the EU's precautionary principle which guarantees high levels of protection for our citizens. We will not accept a T-TIP that includes any lowering of standards.\" The EU's chief negotiator, Ignacio Garcia Bercero, also dismissed media reports about negotiated changes to the EU's precautionary principle and added, \"We have made crystal clear that we would not agree on anything that implies changes of our regulatory regime on GMOs.\" More recently, another EU official, John Clarke, reiterated that EU \"laws are not on the table\" and that efforts to harmonize regulations between the United States and EU would not weaken EU food safety standards. Previously, in 2015, Garcia Bercero stated that the \"EU is not going to change its food safety legislation\" because of T-TIP. This position dates back even earlier."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
