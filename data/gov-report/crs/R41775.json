A key oversight role is played by the Offices of Inspector General in the DOC and the USDA, which are monitoring the projects for waste, fraud, and abuse, and are investigating specific complaints. Both NTIA and RUS have the authority to reclaim and recover awards (either for cause or in cases where awardees decide not to pursue the project) and return the deobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury. Meanwhile, all undisbursed federal funds for the ARRA broadband program will be returned to the Treasury on September 30, 2015.", "Congress plays an important oversight role.

While the ARRA statute does not explicitly address the issue of existing providers, the law does direct RUS and NTIA to favor projects proposing to serve areas that have limited or no broadband service. For example, the ARRA specified that at least 75% of the area to be served by a RUS BIP project shall be in a rural area \"without sufficient access to high-speed broadband service to facilitate economic development, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture,\" and that priority shall be given to \"projects that provide service to the highest proportion of rural residents that do not have access to broadband service.\"", "Regarding NTIA's BTOP program, the ARRA stated that the purpose of the program is to \"provide access to broadband service to consumers residing in unserved areas of the United States\" and to \"provide improved access to broadband service to consumers residing in underserved areas of the United States.\" At the same time, the ARRA directed NTIA to give higher consideration to projects that would increase affordability, subscribership, and broadband speeds to the greatest population of users in the area.", "Thus, RUS and NTIA had some degree of flexibility in how to implement the grant and loan programs and how to define project eligibility with respect to the level of existing broadband service in proposed project areas. In the first-round Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA), both NTIA and RUS used the same definition of unserved and underserved areas. Eligible \"unserved areas\" were defined as areas where at least 90% of households lacked access to terrestrial broadband service. Eligible \"underserved areas\" for last-mile projects were defined as areas in which at least one of the following factors was met: ", "no more than 50% of the households in the proposed funded service area have access to facilities-based, terrestrial broadband service at greater than the minimum broadband transmission speed; no broadband service provider advertises broadband transmission speeds of at least 3 megabits per second (Mbps) downstream; or the rate of broadband subscribership for the proposed funded service area is 40% of households or less. ", "Additionally, a proposed funded service area would qualify as underserved for middle-mile projects if one interconnection point terminated in a proposed funded service area that qualified as unserved or underserved for last-mile projects. For first-round BIP projects only, an additional project category called \"Remote Area\" was defined as an unserved, rural area 50 miles from the limits of a nonrural area.", "In the second-round NOFAs (separate NOFAs were issued by RUS and NTIA respectively), the characterization of eligible project areas was altered. BIP projects were required to cover an area that was at least 75% rural and that did not have high speed access broadband service at the rate of 5 Mbps (upstream and downstream combined) in at least 50% of its area. Regarding BTOP projects (which in the second round were exclusively oriented toward large middle-mile projects called Comprehensive Community Infrastructure or CCI), virtually all proposed service areas were considered eligible, with the understanding that during the application evaluation, factors such as unserved and underserved areas, remoteness, and delivered speed would be considered.", "In order to help assess the level of existing broadband service in proposed BIP and BTOP projects, RUS and NTIA established a process whereby existing providers were given 30 days to file a Public Notice Response (PNR) for each broadband infrastructure application received by the agencies. In the PNR, existing providers had the opportunity to indicate if they were already providing broadband service in each and any of the service areas within the proposed project area, and if they believed that the proposed project area did not meet the threshold of being unserved or underserved. In round one, based on their assessment of the public notice response from the existing service provider, the agencies could either reclassify the application from \"unserved\" to \"underserved,\" reject the application, or continue to consider the application as it was submitted. In round two, RUS stated that existing service providers were not required to provide a PNR, but they must do so in order for their existing services to be considered when determining the eligibility of the proposed funded service areas identified in the associated BIP application. ", "While the presence of a PNR likely indicates that an existing service provider is offering some level of broadband service somewhere within the proposed project area, it does not necessarily mean that the area is not unserved or underserved or that the existing service provider is providing adequate broadband service in terms of such factors as coverage, affordability, or speed. On the other hand, the lack of a public notice response does not necessarily indicate the absence of an existing service provider within the proposed service area; rather an existing service provider might simply have declined to file a public notice response within the 30-day period.", "Based on the PNR data provided in the BroadbandUSA Applications Database and the Round Two Application Directory , about two-thirds of awarded BIP projects already had some level of existing broadband service, and three-quarters of the awarded BIP money went to projects with at least one existing provider somewhere within the project area. Many of the awarded projects received more than one PNR.", "In Round One, BTOP and BIP used the same methodology for collecting PNRs. Of the 48 BTOP applications that received awards in Round One, 5 had zero PNRs submitted. Thus, 90% of awarded BTOP infrastructure projects received one or more PNRs in Round One. The high percentage is not surprising, given that most BTOP infrastructure projects are middle-mile projects (85% of total BTOP infrastructure projects), which cover a significantly larger project area than last-mile projects. ", "In Round Two, NTIA significantly changed the methodology for collecting PNRs. NTIA posted a list of 69,880 Census block groups or tracts that each Round Two Comprehensive Community Infrastructure (CCI) applicant proposed to serve through its project. The posting of this information initiated a window for existing broadband service providers to submit information about the broadband services they currently offer in their respective service territories by Census block group or tract. Census block group or tract numbers are not listed according to specific applications, and NTIA stated that they would connect challenges from service providers to the proposed service areas of relevant Round Two CCI applications. In total, 391 existing broadband providers filed PNRs in Round Two.", "The presence of an existing broadband provider in a project's proposed service area was one of many factors RUS and NTIA considered when deciding whether to fund an application. In the case of some \"unserved\" areas, it was possible that there could be at least one existing provider present, and in the case of \"underserved areas\" it was a certainty that one or more existing broadband providers would be present in the proposed service area. Thus, PNRs were one, but by no means the only, tool used by RUS and NTIA to assess the level of existing broadband service in proposed project areas. Agencies also used available broadband deployment data and analysis gathered by the FCC, the states, and others. Where feasible, RUS also relied on regional USDA rural development staff to assess the adequacy of broadband service in proposed project areas. Finally, other factors were considered when assessing the existing broadband service in a proposed project area\u2014factors such as affordability, quality of service, available download and upload speeds, and adoption rates.", "The issue of providing federal funding to areas and communities with existing providers is controversial and has been previously raised with respect to the RUS Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program. Broadband awards to areas with preexisting service\u2014that is, areas where existing companies already provide some level of broadband\u2014have sparked controversy because award recipients might compete to some extent with other companies already providing broadband service. On the one hand, one could argue that the federal government should not be subsidizing competitors for broadband service, particularly in sparsely populated rural markets which may be able only to support one provider. Furthermore, providing grants and loans for projects serving communities with preexisting broadband service may divert assistance from unserved areas that are most in need. ", "On the other hand, many suburban and urban areas currently receive the benefits of competition among broadband providers\u2014competition which can potentially drive down prices while improving service and performance. It is therefore appropriate, others have argued, that rural areas also receive the benefits of competition, which in some areas may not be possible without federal financial assistance. It is also argued that it may not be economically feasible for applicants to serve sparsely populated unserved communities unless they are permitted to also serve more lucrative areas that may already have existing providers. Additionally, it is argued that middle-mile broadband facilities, which are primarily being constructed under BTOP, can in some cases serve to assist existing providers to more economically serve unserved communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for Oversight and Program Administration", "paragraphs": ["In addition to issuing BTOP and BIP awards, both NTIA and RUS must oversee and administer those awarded projects as they progress toward completion. In FY2009 and FY2010, NTIA administration of the BTOP program was funded by the ARRA, which allocated not more than 3% of BTOP funding for administrative costs. With that funding expiring on September 30, 2010, NTIA sought additional administrative funding in the appropriations process. NTIA argued that additional appropriations were essential to enable oversight and management of the grants that had been awarded. Beginning with its FY2011 budget proposal, the Administration has requested and received additional appropriations (typically in the range of $20 to $30 million each fiscal year) necessary for NTIA administration and oversight of BTOP grants. ", "In contrast to NTIA, RUS has not requested additional appropriations to manage the BIP program. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), RUS used Recovery Act funds to fully fund a contract extension with ICF International to provide BIP program support through 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stimulus Awards and the National Broadband Plan", "paragraphs": ["As mandated by the ARRA, the National Broadband Plan (NBP) was released by the FCC on March 17, 2010. The NBP set a broadband availability goal that \"every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service, and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose,\" and cited a \"broadband availability gap\" of 14 million people in the United States living in 7 million housing units that do not have access to terrestrial broadband infrastructure capable of download speeds of at least 4 Mbps. The FCC estimated that $24 billion in additional funding would be necessary to fill what it refers to as the \"broadband availability gap.\"", "As provided for in the ARRA, BTOP and BIP are one-time-only programs, and are but one component in any strategy to reach ubiquitous nationwide broadband availability. According to the National Broadband Plan:", "BTOP and BIP alone will not be sufficient to close the broadband availability gap. Other government support is required to complete the task of connecting the nation to ensure that broadband reaches the highest-cost areas of the country. Closing the broadband availability gap and connecting the nation will require a substantial commitment by states and the federal government alike. This commitment must include initial support to cover the capital costs of building new networks in areas that are unserved today, as well as ongoing support for the operation of newly built networks in areas where revenues will be insufficient to cover ongoing costs.", "The other major federal vehicle for funding telecommunications development in rural areas is the Universal Service Fund (USF). Subsidies provided by USF's Schools and Libraries Program and Rural Health Care Program are used for a variety of telecommunications services, including broadband access. While the USF's High Cost Program does not explicitly fund broadband infrastructure, subsidies are used, in many cases, to upgrade existing telephone networks. ", "Another important component of reaching National Broadband Plan goals is encouraging the continuing and accelerating rollout of wireless broadband. In recent years wireless broadband has grown faster than any other broadband technology deployment\u2014according to the FCC, the number of mobile wireless broadband connections has almost tripled since 2008. In his 2011 State of the Union Address, President Obama set a goal of enabling entities to provide wireless broadband to at least 98% of all Americans within five years. Among the ways wireless broadband could be further deployed to unserved or underserved areas is through broadband funding programs (such as universal service) and by making additional spectrum available to providers. ", "Finally, there exist other federal programs that provide financial assistance for various aspects of telecommunications and broadband development. These include the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, the Community Connect Broadband Grants, and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program at the Rural Utilities Service. Those programs are ongoing (unlike the ARRA broadband programs) but operate on a smaller scale than the BIP program.
