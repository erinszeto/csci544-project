These grants, first established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 ), are comprised of two award types: Academic Competitiveness (AC) Grants for first- and second- year undergraduates who have completed a rigorous secondary school program; and SMART Grants for third- and fourth- year undergraduates majoring in certain fields of science, mathematics, or a critical foreign language.", "Effective July 1, 2009, the AC Grant and SMART Grant programs are amended to expand eligibility. For both programs, students will no longer be required to be United States citizens as a condition for eligibility. Also, students enrolled at least half-time will become eligible for both AC Grants and SMART Grants. (Prior to July 1, 2009, students must be enrolled full-time). For both programs, grants will be required to be awarded in the same manner as Pell Grants, and eligibility for awards will be based on a student's grade level as opposed to academic year.", "The ECASLA amendments authorize AC Grants to be awarded to students enrolled in certificate programs at two-year and four-year degree-granting institutions. They also clarify eligibility requirements for awarding first-year AC Grants to students who attended private secondary schools or were home-schooled, as well as those who obtained college credit while in high school. The amendments make students eligible to receive SMART Grants for the fifth year of enrollment in five-year undergraduate programs. Finally, the amendments extend eligibility for SMART Grants to students who attend institutions that offer a single liberal arts curriculum leading to a baccalaureate degree under which students are not permitted by the institution to declare a major in a particular subject area, if their coursework and grade point average meet certain criteria."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
