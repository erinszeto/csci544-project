They consider present day Tibet to include the area within the borders of the TAR, plus the area covered by 10 Tibetan autonomous prefectures and two Tibetan autonomous counties that China created in four other Chinese provinces, plus the remainder of Qinghai Province. Approximately 3 million ethnic Tibetans live in the Tibetan autonomous prefectures and counties outside the TAR.

The proposal called, among other things, for \"Bringing all the Tibetans currently living in designated Tibetan autonomous areas within a single autonomous administrative unit.... \" Beijing rejected the proposal. In its 2015 White Paper on Tibet, China's government declared the idea of such a \"Greater Tibet\" to be \"sheer fantasy.\" Among other objections, the White Paper noted such a Greater Tibet would constitute more than a quarter of China's total territory.", "Congressional appropriations legislation has repeatedly used the term, \"Tibetan communities in the Tibetan [sic] Autonomous Region and in other Tibetan communities in China,\" in order to indicate that the legislation is intended to apply to Tibetan areas beyond the borders of the TAR.

Tibet's temporal and spiritual leader, the then-teenaged 14 th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, did not personally sign the agreement, but did agree to cooperate with the new PRC government. In March 1959, after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, however, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet and settled with fellow Tibetan exiles in the Indian hill town of Dharamsala, where he has been based since. The Dalai Lama is believed by Tibetan Buddhists to be a manifestation of an enlightened being, the bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokitesvera, and heads the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism.", "Over 80,000 Tibetans followed the 14 th Dalai Lama into exile in 1959. In Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama established an exile government, now known formally as the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA). The government of India does not recognize the CTA as a government body, deeming it instead to be a non-governmental organization. Nonetheless, the CTA has a cabinet, known as the Kashag, and operates \"foreign missions\" in 11 cities around the world, including Washington, DC, and Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. The Tibetan exile community is also represented by a 44-member Dharamsala-based Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile. The U.S. State Department's position on the CTA is outlined in the department's annual report to Congress on Tibet negotiations: \"The U.S. government does not recognize Tibet as an independent state and therefore does not conduct official diplomatic relations with the Central Tibetan Administration, an organization based in Dharamsala, India.\"", "In March 2011, the 14 th Dalai Lama devolved political leadership of the Tibetan exile movement to the head of the Kashag. Dr. Lobsang Sangay, a Harvard University-educated legal scholar, was elected to this post in April 2011 with 55% of more than 49,000 votes cast by the Tibetan diaspora. He is now referred to as Sikyong, or \"political leader.\" Sangay's five-year term expires in 2016. A new Sikyong election process is scheduled to get underway in the fall of 2015 and extend through the spring of 2016.

The State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, which provides assistance to Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal, estimates that Tibetan refugees in India currently number 110,000, and that Tibetan refugees in Nepal currently number 15,000 to 20,000.

The PRC government has made clear that it intends to control the reincarnation process for the 15 th Dalai Lama.

The U.S. government has criticized Beijing's involvement in reincarnation matters. In June 2015 remarks, Under Secretary of State Sarah Sewall, who serves as the U.S. government's Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, stated that, \"The basic and universally recognized right of religious freedom demands that any decision on the next Dalai Lama must be reserved to the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders, and the Tibetan people.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The U.S. Congress and Tibet", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Brief History", "paragraphs": ["The 14 th Dalai Lama first visited the United States in 1979, the same year that the United States normalized diplomatic relations with China and the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act ( P.L. 96-8 ) governing unofficial U.S. relations with Taiwan.

Advocates with close ties to the Tibetan exile movement and other human rights advocates have also called on Congress to update the act. As it considers the future of the TPA, issues Congress may wish to consider include the following general questions:", "Relations with China. To what degree, if any, should Congress consider policy toward Tibet in the context of relations with China? Bilateral trade between the United States and China totaled $593 billion in 2014, and the United States seeks China's cooperation on multiple global challenges, even as the two countries' relationship is characterized by many areas of profound disagreement, including on the issue of human rights. Tibet's political status: \"occupied country\" or part of China? Does Congress see a need to clarify its position on Tibet's status? As noted above (see \" The U.S. Congress and the Question of Tibet's Political Status \"), while the executive branch considers Tibet to be a part of China, in the early 1990s, Congress passed legislation declaring Tibet to be \"an occupied country\" and stating that, \"Tibet's true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile as recognized by the Tibetan people.\" A number of subsequent legislative measures, however, have implied Congress's acceptance of a status for Tibet as part of China. Tibet's geographic scope. The TPA refers throughout to \"Tibet,\" without defining the geographic scope of the term. (See \" The Geographic Scope of \"Tibet\" \" above.) China usually considers \"Tibet\" to refer only to the area within the borders of the PRC-established Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), which is home to just under half of China's ethnic Tibetan population and comprises less than half of the area that Tibetan exile organizations consider to constitute \"Tibet.\" The India-based Central Tibetan Administration's position is that \"Tibet\" includes the TAR, Tibetan autonomous prefectures and counties in China's Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan Provinces, and all of China's Qinghai Province. Congressional appropriations legislation has repeatedly used the term, \"Tibetan communities in the Tibetan [sic] Autonomous Region and in other Tibetan communities in China,\" in order to indicate that the legislation is intended to apply to Tibetan areas beyond the borders of the TAR. Tibetans in Tibet vs. Tibetans in exile . What should be the balance between U.S. programs, activities, and policies focused on the 6 million Tibetans living under Chinese Communist Party rule and those focused on the approximately 130,000 Tibetans living in exile in South Asia? Changes in the political arrangements of the Tibetan exile movement. As noted above (see \" Tibetans in Exile \"), the Dalai Lama in 2011 gave up political leadership of the Tibetan exile movement and raised the possibility that that the institution of the Dalai Lama might end with him. Lobsang Sangay is now serving a five-year term as the elected political head, or Sikyong, of the Central Tibetan Administration. To what degree, if any, should the TPA reflect these changes? Tibetan-language reports . In congressional testimony in 2011, a State Department official said the department was working to translate into Tibetan its International Religious Freedom Report and its Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China. The 2013 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China is available on the State Department website in Chinese translation, but not Tibetan. The 2013 International Religious Freedom Report does not appear to be available in either Chinese or Tibetan. Does Congress see a need to address the issue of the languages of the reports?", "Congress may also wish to consider the following questions about specific provisions of the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002:", "Section 621(c): Dialogue between the PRC and the Dalai Lama's representatives. With the dialogue process stalled since January 2010, should Section 621(c) of the TPA continue to define the \"central objective\" of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to be \"to promote substantive dialogue between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives\"? Section 621(c) and (d): Alignment in the TPA between the Special Coordinator's \"central objective\" and \"duties and responsibilities.\" In the TPA, the Special Coordinator's \"central objective\" and the official's \"duties and responsibilities\" are not aligned. Should they be? Section 621(d)(1): The Special Coordinator's coordination of U.S. government programs and projects concerning Tibet. The TPA requires the Special Coordinator to coordinate U.S. government programs and projects related to Tibet, but it does not reference most ongoing programs and projects related to Tibet. Should it do so? For a list of such programs and projects, see \" Congressionally Mandated Programs and Earmarked Appropriations for Tibet and Tibetans \" above. None of these programs is mentioned in the TPA. In addition, should the TPA provide a mechanism for the Special Coordinator formally to \"task\" non-State Department entities in order to coordinate policy? Or is such a provision unnecessary? Section 621(d)(3): Regular travel by the Special Coordinator to Tibetan refugee settlements in India and Nepal. The TPA does not mention travel to the 12 Tibetan refugee settlements in Bhutan. Should it do so? Section 621(d)(5): The Special Coordinator's contacts with foreign governments related to Tibet. The TPA requires the Special Coordinator to \"make efforts to establish contacts in the foreign ministries of other countries to pursue a negotiated solution for Tibet.\" Should this language be amended to reflect the actual scope of the Special Coordinator's international coordination efforts? Should it refer to \"foreign governments\" rather than only \"foreign ministries,\" for example? Should the purpose of contacts with other countries be broader than pursuing a \"negotiated solution\" for Tibet? Should multilateral settings be addressed? Or is the current language sufficient? Section 621(d)(6): Ensuring \"adequate sources, staff, and bureaucratic support\" for the Special Coordinator. Should this be the responsibility of the Special Coordinator, as indicated in the TPA, or of the President or the Secretary of State? Section 614: Reporting on Tibet. What should be the scope of the annual report required in Section 613(b) of the TPA? Should it remain confined to the President and the Secretary of State's efforts to encourage dialogue between the PRC and representatives of the Dalai Lama and the status of such dialogue? Should it be expanded to cover implementation of the entire Tibetan Policy Act of 2002; all activities of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues; or the full range of activities related to Tibet undertaken by the U.S. government, including activities not specifically mandated by the act? Or should the report be eliminated, as proposed in H.R. 4194 , the Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014, as introduced? If the report is retained, should the legislation require that it be made public? Section 616(d): Economic principles . Fear of violating the \"Tibet project principles\" outlined in Section 616(d) of the TPA appears to have dissuaded some international financial institutions and such U.S. institutions as the Trade Development Administration from pursuing projects in Tibet. Does Congress see a need to reevaluate the principles? Or does it believe they have served their purpose? Section 615(3) and Section 621(d)(2): Elements of Tibet's \"distinct identity.\" Section 621(d)(2) requires the Special Coordinator to promote the policy of seeking to protect \"the distinct religious, cultural, linguistic, and national identity of Tibet\" (CRS emphasis). Section 615(3) directs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China to include in its annual report a description of \"measures taken to safeguard Tibet's distinct historical , religious, cultural, and linguistic identity\" (CRS emphasis), adding \"historical\" and dropping \"national.\" Should these provisions be consistent? The Obama Administration's 2013 Report on Tibet Negotiations refers to respect for \"the distinct religious, linguistic, and cultural identity of the Tibetan people.\" Sections 613, 617, 6 20 , and 621: Specific U.S. officials tasked with implementing p rovisions of the TPA. These four provisions of the TPA require specific individuals to carry out mandates, as summarized below. Does Congress see any need to review which individuals are required to carry out specific provisions of the TPA? Should the tasks be required of a broader set of individuals? Or should the individuals tasked in each provision remain unchanged? In Section 613(a) and (b)(1), the President and the Secretary of State alone are required to encourage the Chinese government \"to enter into a dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives leading to a negotiated agreement on Tibet.\" The annual reported mandated by the TPA requires reporting exclusively on the President's and the Secretary's steps to encourage dialogue. In Section 617, the President and the Secretary of State alone are required to request the release of political and religious prisoners in Tibet, seek access for international humanitarian organizations to prisoners in Tibet, and seek medical parole for Tibetan prisoners known to be in ill health. In Section 620, the U.S. Ambassador to China alone is required to ascertain information about the well-being of the 11 th Panchen Lama and to request his release from Chinese government custody. In Section 621, the Special Coordinator alone is required to \"vigorously promote the policy of seeking to protect the distinct religious, cultural, linguistic, and national identity of Tibet, and pressing [sic] for improved respect for human rights.\""], "subsections": []}]}}
