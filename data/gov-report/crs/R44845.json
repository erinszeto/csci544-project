Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program, authorized under Title IV, Part D of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), is the primary federal student loan program. It makes available loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the parents of dependent undergraduate students to help them finance postsecondary education expenses. As of the end of FY2016, there was approximately $949.1 billion in outstanding Direct Loan program loans. Direct Loan program administrative expenses totaled approximately $771 million in FY2016.", "Under the Direct Loan program, the federal government essentially serves as the banker by providing loans to students and their families using federal capital and assuming the risk of loss against borrower default. In addition, the federal government, via the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), manages the outstanding loan portfolio and is responsible for the program's administration. FSA is primarily responsible for developing the administrative functions and processes and performing oversight activities for the Direct Loan program to enable its day-to-day operation. Additional parties, including institutions of higher education (IHEs), contracted loan servicers, and contracted private collection agencies (PCAs), perform many of the routine administrative tasks for the program.", "The first step in administering a Direct Loan is processing a student's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). After a student has completed his or her FAFSA, FSA's automated systems process the application and make an initial determination regarding a student's eligibility for federal student aid. IHEs then receive the processed information and take a variety of steps to award financial aid, including Direct Loans, to the student. Steps taken by the IHE at this point include packaging available aid for the student, originating and disbursing any Direct Loans the student is eligible for and has accepted, and managing Direct Loan program funds available to the institution.", "After a borrower's Direct Loan is disbursed, the loan is then assigned to one of multiple loan servicers with which FSA has contracted. Functions performed by loan servicers vary depending on the loan's status (e.g., repayment, grace period) and individual borrower circumstances; however, there are several tasks loan servicers typically perform. These include providing information to borrowers on loan terms and conditions, collecting and applying loan payments to outstanding balances, processing requests for loan deferment or forbearance, processing applications to consolidate federal student loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan, and providing delinquency and default prevention activities.", "If a borrower defaults after entering repayment on a Direct Loan, then a variety of actions may be taken to attempt to reinstate the loan into good standing and recover payment on it. Loan servicers provide initial outreach to defaulted borrowers and attempt to enter into repayment or rehabilitation agreements with them. If the loan servicer is unsuccessful, a borrower's defaulted loan is transferred to FSA and then may also be transferred to one of multiple PCAs with which FSA has contracted. FSA and PCAs will attempt to enter into voluntary repayment agreements with borrowers; however, a variety of other debt collection tools may also be used if these attempts are unsuccessful. For instance, a borrower may be determined eligible for administrative wage garnishment or income tax offset. If a borrower successfully brings his or her loan into good standing, the account is transferred back to a loan servicer, which will continue to service it."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The William D.

It makes available loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the parents of dependent undergraduate students to help them finance postsecondary education expenses. Four types of loans are offered: Direct Subsidized Loans; Direct Unsubsidized Loans; Direct PLUS Loans; and Direct Consolidation Loans, through which borrowers may combine multiple loans into a single loan. The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), within the U.S. Department of Education (ED), administers the Direct Loan program. In total, ED manages an outstanding loan portfolio of approximately $1.3 trillion, making it one of the largest financial institutions in the nation. Direct Loan program loans make up approximately $963.5 billion (74%) of ED's loan portfolio. ", "Prior to the establishment of the Direct Loan program, the primary federal student loan program was the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. Under the FFEL program, loan capital was provided to borrowers from private lenders and the federal government guaranteed lenders against loss through borrower default. FFEL program loans were originated by private lenders, and state and nonprofit guaranty agencies received federal funds to play the lead role in administering many aspects of the program, such as providing assistance in preventing delinquent borrowers from going into default.", "Authorization for the Direct Loan program was enacted under the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ). The program was established with the goal of streamlining the student loan delivery system. At that time, the FFEL program involved numerous parties from both the private and public sectors and concerns had arisen about the program structure being difficult to monitor and cumbersome to borrowers and schools. When enacted, the Direct Loan program was originally intended to gradually expand and replace the FFEL program; however, provisions calling for a full transition from the FFEL program to the Direct Loan program were repealed under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 ( P.L. 105-244 ). For nearly two decades, both the FFEL and Direct Loan programs operated simultaneously and institutions of higher education (IHEs) were able to participate in the program of their choice. In 2010, the SAFRA Act, part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-152 ), terminated the authority to make new FFEL program loans.", "Under the Direct Loan program, the federal government essentially serves as the banker by providing loans to students and their families using federal capital (i.e., funds from the U.S. Treasury).

In 2009, with the increase in volume of federally held student loans, FSA awarded contracts to four new loan servicers, known as Title IV Additional Servicers (TIVAS). In addition, in 2010 the SAFRA Act ( P.L. 111-152 , Title II-A) required ED to contract with eligible not-for-profit (NFP) servicers, many of which were affiliated with or part of not-for-profit state lending operations in the FFEL program.

Under performance-based contracts, FSA specifies desired results, and the loan servicer has discretion to decide how best to achieve them.

During this time, the performance requirements for NFPs were similar to, but not the same as, the performance metrics for TIVAS under their performance-based contracts. For the first several years of acting as federal student loan servicers, NFPs did not receive borrower accounts for newly disbursed Direct Loans. Then, in the fall of 2014, FSA implemented a single set of performance metrics and pricing to be used for both TIVAS and NFPs. For the first time, in January 2015, NFPs began to receive newly originated loans; however, from that time until March 1, 2016, TIVAS and NFPs competed for new allocations in separate pools while using the common performance metrics established by FSA in 2014. Finally, in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), Congress directed that new student loan borrower accounts be allocated to all loan servicers based on each servicer's performance as compared against all federal student loan servicers.

These scores will represent each PCA's performance with respect to the above-described metrics as compared against all other PCAs and will be considered by FSA, along with other relevant information (e.g., compliance with federal and state laws governing collection activity, security risks, and violations) when reporting each PCA's past performance to contractor past performance databases. In addition, FSA issues guidance to PCAs to assist them in day-to-day operations and conducts monitoring activities, such as reviewing borrower complaints against PCAs and evaluating PCAs' interactions with borrowers via phone-call monitoring. ", "Over the past several years, concerns have been raised that FSA may not be adequately monitoring and effectively responding to PCA performance. For instance, GAO found that although FSA monitors PCA phone calls with borrowers, it has not consistently completed the review of such calls. Moreover, for those calls reviewed, GAO found a range of issues raising concerns about PCAs' treatment of borrowers for which FSA failed to ensure corrective action on the part of the PCAs, including providing inaccurate or misleading information about loan rehabilitation requirements and other options to borrowers. GAO concluded that by failing to effectively monitor and respond to PCA performance issues, FSA may miss opportunities to target oversight and improve program performance. Final implementation of the 2016 PCA contracts may help to address some of these issues."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
