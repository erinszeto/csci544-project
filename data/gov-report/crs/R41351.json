{"id": "R41351", "title": "Housing Counseling: Background and Federal Role", "released_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00", "summary": ["The term \"housing counseling\" refers to a wide variety of educational activities geared toward homebuyers, homeowners, renters, senior citizens, or other populations with particular housing goals. Some potential topics of housing counseling include pre-purchase counseling for potential homebuyers; post-purchase counseling on subjects such as budgeting or home maintenance; foreclosure prevention counseling; counseling on helping renters find or maintain rental housing; and counseling on fair housing, predatory lending, or other topics, among other things. The federal government does not provide housing counseling directly, nor does it require housing counseling for most housing-related decisions. Rather, the federal government provides some support for private housing counseling programs, primarily through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD certifies housing counseling organizations that meet certain criteria, and Congress appropriates funding to HUD each year to provide competitive grants to housing counseling agencies that have been certified by the department. Not all housing counseling agencies that are approved by HUD will receive federal housing counseling grants. Even for organizations that do receive grants from HUD, federal funding generally makes up a relatively small part of their total funding.", "Housing counseling agencies that are approved by HUD can be one of two basic types. The first type consists of local housing counseling agencies or multi-state organizations, which generally provide counseling directly through only one or a few branch offices located in a limited geographic area. Local housing counseling agencies and multi-state organizations generally apply for HUD housing counseling grants on their own behalf. Alternatively, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies can be national or regional intermediaries, which provide funding and technical support for housing counseling to a network of affiliates and branch offices that operates in a much larger geographic area. National and regional intermediaries apply for HUD housing counseling grants on behalf of their affiliates and branches, and pass through funding they receive to their network of organizations.", "Congressional appropriations for HUD's housing counseling program had increased significantly in recent fiscal years, until Congress opted not to fund HUD's housing counseling program in FY2011. Congress did provide funding for this program in FY2012. Since FY2008, Congress has also appropriated additional housing counseling funds specifically for counseling to help households avoid foreclosure. Rather than appropriating this foreclosure mitigation funding to HUD, Congress has appropriated it to NeighborWorks America, a government-chartered nonprofit agency that is also a HUD-certified national intermediary. NeighborWorks administers this funding through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP).", "Issues currently facing the housing counseling industry include efforts to standardize housing counseling curricula and counselor training, the amount of housing counseling funding, and questions regarding counseling's effectiveness. While some studies have suggested that some types of housing counseling produce positive outcomes in certain circumstances, existing research into housing counseling tends to be limited, and the overall effectiveness of housing counseling is unclear.", "This report describes housing counseling in general, with a focus on HUD's processes for certifying housing counseling agencies and distributing housing counseling funding.

In general, the federal government does not provide housing counseling services directly. Rather, the federal government provides some financial support for private housing counseling agencies, primarily through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).", "HUD supports housing counseling activities in two main ways. First, it certifies housing counseling agencies that meet certain criteria and lists the contact information for these HUD-approved agencies on the HUD website. Second, since the late 1970s Congress has usually appropriated funding for housing counseling to HUD during the annual appropriations process, and HUD has used this funding to provide competitive grants to housing counseling agencies. Only agencies that are certified by HUD are eligible to apply for these grants. However, not all agencies that are certified by HUD are guaranteed to receive a grant. Furthermore, HUD's housing counseling grants do not cover housing counseling agencies' full costs; even agencies that receive grants through HUD generally get most of their funding from other sources. The amount of funding appropriated for HUD's housing counseling program fluctuates from year to year. Over the last decade, appropriations for housing counseling generally increased, sometimes sharply. However, Congress opted not to provide any funding for HUD's housing counseling program in FY2011. It again provided funding for the program in FY2012.", "Separate from HUD's housing counseling program, Congress has appropriated additional housing counseling funding specifically for foreclosure mitigation counseling since FY2008. Congress has appropriated this funding to NeighborWorks America, a federally chartered nonprofit agency with a nationwide network of affiliated organizations. NeighborWorks administers this funding through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program.", "Housing counseling can also be considered part of the broader category of financial education. In addition to HUD's housing counseling program and NeighborWorks, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Defense all provide some support for housing counseling, or for broader financial counseling programs that may include housing counseling, that is aimed at specific groups. ", "While housing counseling is generally a voluntary activity, the federal government and some state, local, and private entities do require housing counseling as a condition for participating in certain programs. These requirements are another way in which the federal government supports housing counseling, because such requirements both increase the demand for housing counseling and make the provision of counseling a more mainstream activity. However, the federal government does not always provide additional funds to housing counseling agencies to go along with requirements for counseling, so such conditions could have the effect of requiring agencies to counsel more people while spending less time and money on each individual. ", "This report provides a broad overview of what housing counseling is, with a specific focus on how the federal government supports housing counseling activities. It describes how housing counseling organizations become eligible for federal housing counseling funds, particularly through HUD, and how those funds are distributed. It also analyzes which counseling organizations are receiving federal funds and how those funds are used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["This section broadly describes housing counseling.

Housing counseling can be provided as part of, or in tandem with, financial counseling, and there is some overlap between the two types of counseling (e.g., learning to budget in order to save for a downpayment on a home is a concept that could be considered part of either financial literacy or housing counseling). Financial literacy counseling can include information on housing, and particularly homeownership. However, housing counseling generally refers to a more specific type of counseling that focuses on housing-related decisions, and information on financial concepts or financial literacy is generally provided in the context of informing these housing-related decisions. Some organizations might provide both housing counseling and financial literacy counseling more broadly, while others might focus on one or the other.", "Housing counseling is itself a broad term that can refer to a wide variety of activities. It can include counseling for a range of populations with distinct housing goals, such as people looking to buy a home, current homeowners, renters, the homeless, senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages, or other groups. Much housing counseling focuses on homebuyers either before or after they buy a home, and this type of counseling often targets first-time homebuyers. ", "Traditionally, housing counseling for current or prospective homeowners has been divided into the broad categories of pre-purchase and post-purchase counseling. Even within these specific categories, housing counseling can refer to a wide range of specific topics. For example, pre-purchase counseling can refer to financial literacy or money management counseling; the responsibilities of homeownership; information on specific housing programs; or assistance in reviewing individual loan documents, among other issues. Post-purchase counseling can include counseling on maintenance and repairs; budgeting; or resolving mortgage delinquency, among other issues. Housing counseling curricula are not standardized across the industry. The specific issues covered by housing counseling will depend on the person receiving counseling and the organization providing the counseling. ", "Although much housing counseling focuses on either current or prospective homeowners, it is not limited to these groups. Housing counseling for renters can help tenants learn about HUD housing programs, navigate housing issues, or learn about fair housing laws. Mobility counseling can assist Section 8 voucher holders in their search for suitable housing, and in particular, housing in communities with low concentrations of poverty. Housing counseling for the homeless can help people search for housing or access needed services. Housing counseling for senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages can help seniors understand the terms of reverse mortgages and provide information on possible alternatives to reverse mortgages. ", "In addition to the variety of topics that housing counseling can cover, there is a wide range of ways in which housing counseling can be provided. Some ways in which the provision of counseling can vary include the following:", "Setting: Counseling can take place individually or in group sessions. In general, group sessions that cover broad topics are referred to as \"education,\" while individual sessions that are more tailored to an individual's circumstances are referred to as \"counseling.\" Method: Counseling can happen in person or over the telephone, or it can consist of self-study on a computer or through the completion of a workbook. Length of time: Counseling can vary widely in its intensity, and can include anywhere from one session to several sessions spread out over a number of weeks or months. ", "While housing counseling can take many forms, HUD generally holds that individual, face-to-face counseling is the preferable form of counseling in most situations. HUD-approved agencies are expected to provide counseling in this manner if their clients prefer it. However, HUD recognizes that in some situations face-to-face counseling may not be the most feasible option, and therefore it allows other forms of counseling as well. Situations in which face-to-face counseling may not be feasible include counseling people living in geographic areas not served by a HUD-approved agency, counseling seniors or persons with disabilities who may prefer to receive counseling over the phone, and counseling people facing foreclosure who may not have time to travel to in-person counseling sessions. HUD does allow group education classes, but topics covered in these classes must be offered in individual counseling sessions as well. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What is the Goal of Housing Counseling?", "paragraphs": ["Supporters of housing counseling programs believe that counseling can help households achieve a range of positive housing outcomes. These outcomes can range from helping households make more sound decisions regarding their choices of homes and mortgage products, helping some households choose to delay the decision to purchase a home until their circumstances are more favorable for homeownership, helping households to avoid default or foreclosure, and helping renters to find suitable housing units. ", "Housing counseling for homebuyers (both pre-purchase and post-purchase) is thought by many to provide certain benefits to both the homebuyer and the mortgage lender. Supporters of housing counseling believe that pre-purchase counseling can better prepare homebuyers to understand their mortgage terms and the responsibility of owning a home, and to better deal with unexpected circumstances that could lead to mortgage default. These supporters also argue that housing counseling helps lenders, both by reducing mortgage default rates and by screening out borrowers who are not ready for homeownership before they seek a mortgage. Post-purchase counseling is thought by many to help reduce mortgage delinquencies by helping households manage circumstances that could lead to default or, in the case of foreclosure mitigation counseling, helping homeowners work with their lenders to cure a mortgage delinquency. ", "While there are many potential benefits of housing counseling, critics point out that the research on housing counseling outcomes is limited, and that it is not clear that housing counseling is effective in realizing these potential benefits. (See \" Brief Overview of the Literature on Housing Counseling Effectiveness \" for a fuller discussion of the research on housing counseling.) There is little consensus on which types of housing counseling may lead to the best outcomes, or even what a successful outcome is. Furthermore, pre-purchase counseling often happens after, not before, a borrower has already decided on a specific home and mortgage. This could limit the potential benefits that pre-purchase counseling may offer in the form of helping borrowers navigate the homebuying process or choose an appropriate mortgage, or in screening out borrowers who are unprepared for homeownership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Receives Housing Counseling?", "paragraphs": ["As described in the previous sections, a variety of populations may seek housing counseling. In general, housing counseling is a voluntary activity. However, there are some housing programs, federal and otherwise, that require housing counseling as a condition of participation. Some examples of such programs include the following, although this list is not exhaustive:", "Section 255 of the National Housing Act requires senior citizens to receive housing counseling in order to be eligible for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). HECMs are reverse mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires housing counseling for first-time homebuyers under its Section 502 direct loan program. By law, housing counseling is required as a condition for participating in HUD's Homeownership Voucher Program, an extension of the Housing Choice Voucher Program (commonly known as Section 8). If the local Public Housing Authority (PHA) allows it, the Homeownership Voucher Program allows some first-time homebuyers who meet certain income and employment requirements to use their Housing Choice vouchers to assist with monthly payments on a purchased home rather than to assist with monthly rent payments. Housing counseling is required for certain participants in the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), a temporary federal program intended to prevent foreclosures by providing incentives to mortgage servicers and investors to modify loans in a way that lowers eligible borrowers' monthly mortgage payments. Homeowners who have their mortgages modified under HAMP are required to state in writing that they will receive housing counseling if their total debt-to-income ratio is 55% or higher after the modification. Counseling is encouraged, but not required, for other participants in HAMP. HUD requires homebuyers who purchase homes that have used funds provided through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) to participate in housing counseling through a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ) established NSP, which provides certain communities with funding to purchase and redevelop abandoned and foreclosed residential properties. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) are required to set aside 10% of their net income each year for their Affordable Housing Program (AHP), which consists of both a competitive grant program that is mandatory for the FHLBs and a homeownership set-aside program that is voluntary. The FHLBs must require housing counseling for first-time homebuyers who receive assistance through the homeownership set-aside portion of the AHP. At their discretion, the FHLBs may choose to require housing counseling for some or all homebuyers assisted through the competitive grant portion of the AHP as well. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have historically required housing counseling for some borrowers who use certain affordable mortgage products that they offer. This means that lenders who originate these types of mortgage products must ensure that these borrowers receive counseling if the lender ultimately intends to sell the loan to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. For example, Fannie Mae currently requires housing counseling as a condition for first-time homebuyers, or homebuyers relying on non-traditional credit, who use its MyCommunity Mortgage product. Freddie Mac requires counseling for first-time homebuyers using its Home Possible Mortgages. Many state housing finance agencies (SHFAs) offer low-cost mortgage programs for certain populations of low- or moderate-income households. Many SHFAs encourage housing counseling for participants in their programs, and some of these programs may require housing counseling as a condition of the mortgage, at least for certain subsets of homebuyers (such as those who receive downpayment assistance, those who put down small downpayments, or first-time homebuyers). While FHA generally does not require counseling (except for HECMs), FHA is allowed to charge lower upfront insurance premiums to borrowers of FHA-insured mortgages who receive housing counseling that meets certain standards. FHA does not currently use this authority, and it charges the same premiums to homebuyers regardless of whether they receive counseling. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 111-203 ) amended the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to include a requirement that borrowers who receive high-cost mortgages, as defined by TILA, receive pre-purchase housing counseling from a HUD-approved housing counseling agency before receiving such a mortgage. High-cost mortgages are mortgages where the annual percentage rate (APR) or points and fees paid at closing exceed certain thresholds or mortgages that include certain types of prepayment penalties.", "Since housing counseling is not usually required by the federal government for most housing decisions, but may be required for certain types of mortgage products, most people who seek housing counseling usually do so voluntarily and/or so they can be eligible for a certain program. Some lenders may also encourage homebuyers to seek housing counseling. Most HUD-approved housing counseling agencies primarily serve prospective homebuyers or current homeowners, including seniors seeking HECMs. While HUD provides funding for counseling renters and the homeless, these groups make up a relatively small portion of the total number of people counseled by HUD-approved agencies. For example, in FY2011 less than a fifth of the total number of counseling activities carried out by HUD-approved counseling agencies were for rental or homelessness counseling. Rental counseling made up about 15% of the total amount of counseling activities, while counseling for the homeless made up about 2% of counseling activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Provides Housing Counseling?", "paragraphs": ["Housing counseling is provided by many different types of organizations. Housing counseling can be provided by for-profit organizations, such as banks, or by nonprofit organizations, such as advocacy groups. However, only nonprofit organizations can be certified by HUD and therefore be eligible for HUD grants. Housing counseling agencies also vary in size, from small community-based organizations to large organizations with a national reach. Some agencies specialize in housing counseling, while for others providing housing counseling is only part of an agency's mission (for example, the National Council of La Raza, Catholic Charities USA, and the National Association of Real Estate Brokers are all HUD-approved housing counseling intermediaries that have broader missions than housing counseling alone). Furthermore, some agencies specialize in one particular type of housing counseling (such as HECM counseling or foreclosure mitigation counseling), while other agencies provide counseling on a range of housing issues (called \"comprehensive counseling\" by HUD). As mentioned above, some organizations that provide financial literacy counseling more broadly may offer housing counseling as well.", "Housing counseling agencies that are approved by HUD may differ from other housing counseling agencies in important ways. For example, HUD-approved agencies are required to be nonprofit private or public organizations. However, a non-trivial portion of housing counseling is done by for-profit organizations, such as banks, mortgage insurers, and other financial institutions, according to a 2008 Abt Associates study prepared for HUD. Furthermore, the distribution of the types of housing counseling services that HUD-approved agencies provide may differ from the types of counseling provided by agencies that are not approved by HUD. Finally, HUD strongly encourages face-to-face counseling, and therefore HUD-approved agencies may be more likely to provide individualized in-person counseling than other agencies. Housing counseling organizations that are not approved by HUD may be more likely to provide more telephone counseling, group education classes, or self-study through computer programs or workbooks.", "While HUD has certain requirements regarding the provision of housing counseling, there are no agreed-upon curricula that all housing counselors are required to follow, and there are no standard training requirements for housing counselors, either among HUD-approved agencies or the industry as a whole. Some organizations have attempted to standardize housing counseling training and curricula in the past. Currently, NeighborWorks America is one organization that encourages standardized requirements through its NeighborWorks Center for Homeownership Education and Counseling. (For more information on the movement to standardize the provision of housing counseling and the training of housing counselors, see \" Standardizing Training and Services \" later in this report.)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Brief Overview of the Literature on Housing Counseling Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["While some studies have been done on whether housing counseling affects housing outcomes, most of these studies have been limited in scope. This section provides a brief review of the existing literature on the effectiveness of housing counseling; it is not intended to be exhaustive.", "A number of studies on the effectiveness of different types of housing counseling programs, and homeownership counseling in particular, were done in the 1970s and early 1980s; many of these studies were funded by HUD. Some of these early studies found some evidence that both pre-purchase and post-purchase counseling could have some positive outcomes, such as reduced default or foreclosure rates. However, most of the studies done in this time period had a limited focus that made it hard to generalize the results, and the studies defined success in many different ways. Furthermore, a number of these studies had significant methodological problems. A 2001 review of the literature describes the overall results of these early studies as \"highly ambiguous.\"", "After the early 1980s, there were very few empirical studies on housing counseling effectiveness until the mid- to late 1990s. Since then, a new wave of studies has been done to examine whether housing counseling achieves the desirable outcomes its advocates expect it to produce. One often-cited study was published in 2001, when Abdighani Hirad and Peter M. Zorn looked at whether housing counseling reduced default rates among homeowners using Freddie Mac's Affordable Gold mortgage product. They found some evidence that pre-purchase housing counseling reduced the likelihood that a borrower would ever become 60 days delinquent on his or her mortgage, and that the method through which the counseling was delivered made a difference in its effectiveness. In particular, borrowers who underwent face-to-face counseling, either individually or in a classroom setting, experienced delinquency at lower rates than borrowers who were counseled over the phone or through self-study.", "A 2011 paper from the Research Institute for Housing America, which is affiliated with the Mortgage Bankers Association, reviews several studies of pre-purchase or post-purchase education and counseling conducted over the last 15 years. This review notes that some of these studies (including the Hirad and Zorn study discussed above) indicate that positive effects may be associated with both pre- and post-purchase counseling. However, this paper also stresses that studies of housing counseling are generally not able to be conducted as randomized experiments, making it difficult to definitively attribute any observed positive effects to counseling itself rather than to other factors. Research efforts have also been hampered by a number of additional problems associated with evaluating the effectiveness of housing counseling. For example, some have pointed out that there is a lack of data, and a lack of capacity for collecting data, that track who receives housing counseling and what kind of outcomes they experience. Others have described ongoing issues with designing studies to evaluate housing counseling, such as difficulties in defining exactly what housing counseling is or identifying the kinds of outcomes that would indicate that counseling is effective. The lack of a standard curriculum or method for offering housing counseling also presents challenges for generalizing the effectiveness of any particular housing counseling program to other forms of counseling (see the section on \" Standardizing Training and Services \" later in this report). ", "Overall, although housing counseling has not been definitively linked to positive outcomes, there is some evidence that housing counseling can be effective in achieving desirable outcomes for both borrowers and lenders. However, that evidence is largely limited to certain programs or groups of homebuyers, or based on limited outcomes. Most advocates and critics of housing counseling agree that more empirical work is needed on housing counseling's effects on housing outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program", "paragraphs": ["The federal government primarily supports housing counseling through HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program.

Like the technical assistance for nonprofits, this counseling could be provided either directly by HUD or indirectly through contracts with other organizations. Specifically, P.L. 91-609 allowed for counseling of low- and moderate-income families that were assisted through federal housing programs created by the National Housing Act of 1934 and the United States Housing Act of 1937 (namely, FHA mortgage insurance programs and the public housing program). The counseling was to help such families \"in improving their living conditions and housing opportunities, and in meeting the responsibilities of homeownership.\" P.L. 91-609 also authorized appropriations to HUD to carry out these activities.", "In 1974, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-383 ) explicitly authorized HUD to provide for housing counseling for renters as well as homeowners, and it no longer limited counseling to households assisted by certain housing programs. The law also explicitly authorized HUD to make monetary grants to housing counseling agencies for the first time; instead of merely allowing HUD to \"contract with public or private organizations to provide\" housing counseling, HUD could now choose to \"enter into contracts with, make grants to, and provide other types of assistance to private or public organizations\" with the capacity to carry out housing counseling activities. The law still allowed HUD to provide counseling services directly as well.", "Although HUD is authorized to either provide counseling services directly or to contract with other organizations to provide counseling, from the beginning of the program HUD has chosen to support outside organizations that provide housing counseling services rather than to provide counseling directly. HUD originally supported housing counseling solely by certifying housing counseling agencies that met certain requirements, and it has continued to certify housing counseling agencies through the present day. While P.L. 91-609 in 1970 authorized appropriations to HUD that could be used for counseling, and P.L. 93-383 in 1974 authorized HUD to make grants to organizations that provide counseling, Congress did not begin appropriating funding regularly to HUD for housing counseling until FY1977.

(Congress also appropriated funding for HUD to fund a demonstration counseling program in FY1972.) Appropriations fluctuate from year to year, but as Figure 1 shows, funding for housing counseling generally stayed flat during the 1980s, trended upward in the 1990s, and rose sharply in FY2003. After remaining generally flat for the next few years, housing counseling appropriations began rising again in FY2008, and rose each year until FY2011, when Congress did not provide any funding for HUD's housing counseling program. Congress again provided funding to HUD for housing counseling in FY2012, although in a lower amount than in the years immediately preceding FY2011. See Table A-1 in the Appendix for the congressional appropriation for HUD's housing counseling program in each fiscal year since FY1977.", "Policymakers' interest in housing counseling has fluctuated over the years in response to specific housing program results, housing policy goals, or housing market conditions. This is often reflected in the amount of appropriations for housing counseling. For example, interest in housing counseling increased in the 1990s, when national housing policy goals began to focus on increasing homeownership rates, particularly among low-income and minority groups. New requirements that encouraged mortgage lending to underserved populations led to greater interest in lending to borrowers who traditionally found it more difficult to get a mortgage. These new requirements included those imposed by amendments to the Community Reinvestment Act, and by Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's Affordable Housing Goals, which HUD (and now the Federal Housing Finance Agency) was required to set by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. As a result of this increased interest in lending to underserved populations, lenders and other mortgage market participants that offered or insured loan products for low-income and minority borrowers became interested in counseling as a way to identify borrowers who were likely to sustain homeownership and to help homeowners who encountered problems to avoid foreclosure. Perhaps in response to these trends, congressional appropriations for housing counseling rose throughout the mid- to late 1990s (see Figure 1 ). Appropriations increased significantly again in FY2003, when HUD's budget justifications cited a variety of reasons for the need for increased funding, including the high demand for housing counseling and housing counseling funding, the need to provide more funds for housing counseling training, and the need to provide counseling in support of new or proposed homeownership initiatives. ", "Congressional appropriations for housing counseling rose dramatically in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010. It is likely that the increase in appropriations for housing counseling in these years was largely a response to the increase in foreclosures that began in 2006. Policymakers might respond to increased foreclosures by appropriating more funding for housing counseling for two distinct reasons. First, policymakers might choose to appropriate more funding for delinquency and default counseling in an attempt to help more homeowners avoid foreclosure now. Second, policymakers may view increased funding for pre-purchase counseling as a way to assist new borrowers in avoiding problems that could lead to foreclosure, thereby preventing similarly large numbers of foreclosures in the future.", "In FY2011, Congress did not provide funding for HUD's housing counseling program. This partly reflected the fiscal environment for discretionary spending when the final FY2011 appropriations law passed. Some policymakers have also expressed concern over the length of time that HUD takes to distribute housing counseling funds. Often, a given fiscal year's appropriation for housing counseling is not distributed to housing counseling agencies until the following fiscal year. For example, HUD announced its FY2010 housing counseling awards in December 2010, after FY2011 had already begun. Critics of HUD's housing counseling program also argued that the funding was duplicative of funding that has recently been provided to NeighborWorks America for foreclosure mitigation counseling (see the \" National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program \" section, below.) However, proponents of HUD's housing counseling program point out that the HUD funding can be used for a wider variety of types of counseling than the NeighborWorks funding, which is limited to foreclosure mitigation counseling.", "The FY2012 HUD appropriations law ( P.L. 112-55 ) provided $45 million for HUD's housing counseling program in FY2012. Other than FY2011, when no funding was provided, this is the lowest level of funding provided for HUD's housing counseling program since FY2007, when the program received about $42 million. P.L. 112-55 required HUD to award these funds to counseling agencies within 120 days of November 18, 2011, the date the law was enacted. HUD announced the funding awards on March 16, 2012.

HUD-approved housing counseling agencies are invited to apply for housing counseling grants for specific categories of counseling.

Such agencies may apply for HUD housing counseling grants directly, or they may be part of a HUD intermediary's application for funds, but they may not \"double dip\" by applying for housing counseling funds both ways in the same year. A local housing counseling agency may wish to receive funding as a branch or affiliate of an intermediary, rather than applying for funding itself, for a number of reasons. For example, it may believe that it can receive more funding as a branch or affiliate of an intermediary, or it may find the application process less cumbersome than applying to HUD directly. ", "Agencies that apply for HUD housing counseling funds are evaluated on the basis of criteria outlined in HUD's NOFA. These criteria generally include the agency's capacity and ability to engage in counseling; the need for counseling in the geographic area where the agency operates; the \"quality and effectiveness\" of the agency's housing counseling program; the agency's ability to leverage other public and private resources for its housing counseling program; and program results. Agencies receive points for each of these criteria, and only those agencies that are awarded a minimum number of points are eligible for HUD funding. Agencies then receive a grant that is based on the number of points they were awarded.

The SAFE Act also directs HUD to implement a licensing and registration system for mortgage originators in any state that does not meet the minimum requirements of the law. On July 21, 2011, responsibility for the SAFE Act transferred from HUD and the federal banking regulators to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 111-203 ).", "HUD issued a Proposed Rule on the SAFE Act on December 15, 2009, and a Final Rule on June 30, 2011, implementing the minimum standards for licensing and registration of mortgage originators in the law and the procedures HUD would use in the event that a state is not compliant with the requirements. Some housing counseling agencies submitted comments in response to the Proposed Rule expressing concern that the rule could be interpreted to cover housing counselors that are involved in pre-purchase or foreclosure mitigation counseling under the requirements of the SAFE Act, thereby requiring them to comply with licensing and registration requirements. The housing counseling agencies argued that the costs and burden of complying with the requirements of the SAFE Act could result in fewer people receiving housing counseling services or in some housing counseling agencies having to close.", "Addressing these comments in the preamble to its Final Rule, HUD emphasized that the rule applies to anyone who engages in the business of a loan originator, and that it had no authority to exempt individuals who engaged in the functions of a loan originator, regardless of his or her job title. However, HUD also noted that traditional housing counseling activities would not seem to fall under the definition of originating a loan, although it is possible that certain types of activities that counselors might engage in\u2014such as acting as an intermediary between a borrower and a source of financing, or presenting loan terms to borrowers\u2014could be considered loan origination and require the individuals engaged in such functions to comply with the SAFE Act. The Final Rule did exempt employees of state housing finance agencies and government agencies that engage in the business of a loan originator, and employees of bona fide nonprofit organizations who engage in the business of a residential mortgage originator for public or charitable purposes. It also left it up to the CFPB to decide whether loan modification activities constituted engaging in the business of a loan originator. ", "In December 2011, the CFPB published an interim final rule with request for public comment implementing the provisions of the SAFE Act. The interim final rule is substantially similar to the rules that had been promulgated by HUD and the federal banking regulators prior to the authority to implement the SAFE Act transferring to the CFPB. The rule became effective on December 30, 2011, and the comment period closed on February 17, 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Housing Counseling in Foreclosure Prevention", "paragraphs": ["Ever since mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates began to rise around the middle of 2006, some policymakers and other observers have focused on housing counseling as a potential way to reduce delinquencies and foreclosures. Several housing counseling agencies have undertaken specific initiatives to address delinquency and foreclosure issues. One example is NeighborWorks, which in addition to administering the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program has created a Center for Foreclosure Solutions in response to increasing foreclosure rates. The Center for Foreclosure Solutions provides counselor training, certification, and research on foreclosure solutions. Another example of a housing counseling agency specifically addressing foreclosure issues is the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, a HUD-approved intermediary, which has set up a hotline to assist homeowners facing foreclosure (the hotline number is 888-995-HOPE). This hotline was originally associated with the Hope Now Alliance, an organization of mortgage industry participants that formed to address the increase in default and foreclosure rates. The hotline is now also used to connect homeowners with counselors that can assist them in applying for the Administration's flagship foreclosure prevention program, the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). ", "Housing counseling also plays a role in HAMP. HAMP guidelines require that homeowners who receive mortgage modifications through the program and who have total debt-to-income ratios that exceed 55% receive counseling as a condition of the program. Counseling is encouraged, but not required, for other participants in HAMP. Given the requirements for certain borrowers to receive counseling, the interest in the program generally, and the increase in the number of people experiencing mortgage trouble who might want to talk to a housing counselor, counseling agencies may be facing increased demand for their services. ", "The primary source of funding specifically for foreclosure mitigation housing counseling has been the funding provided to NeighborWorks America for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program, described earlier in the \" National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program \" section of this report. No additional funding was appropriated for counseling borrowers participating in HAMP, but NeighborWorks allows grantees to use a portion of NFMCP funds to counsel HAMP participants. (HAMP participants can also meet the requirement for counseling by receiving counseling from a HUD-approved housing counseling agency.) According to NeighborWorks, between 240,000 and 320,000 HAMP participants with high debt-to-income ratios were expected to be referred to counseling, but fewer referrals than expected have been occurring. NeighborWorks reports that over 7,000 borrowers in HAMP trial modifications had received counseling through the NFMCP through June 30, 2011. The lower-than-expected number of HAMP borrowers receiving counseling through the NFMCP may reflect servicers not consistently referring borrowers to counseling, or borrowers not pursuing counseling despite the requirement, rather than because fewer borrowers than anticipated have high debt-to-income ratios. The average total debt-to-income ratio of participants in the program through February 2012 was over 59% even after a mortgage modification. ", "In general, securing funding can be an issue among housing counseling agencies. While Congress has often provided increased funding for housing counseling in recent years, both through increased appropriations to HUD's housing counseling program and funding for NeighborWorks's NFMCP, it is unclear whether the increase in funding has kept up with increased demand on housing counseling agencies to provide counseling to borrowers facing default or foreclosure. The lack of funding for HUD's housing counseling program in FY2011 may further increase the burden on housing counseling agencies that are providing such counseling, although Congress again provided funding for the program in FY2012.

", "The Dodd-Frank Act establishes an Office of Housing Counseling within HUD, and establishes the position of Director of Housing Counseling to head the office and have primary responsibility within HUD for all homeownership and rental housing counseling activities. According to HUD's FY2013 budget justifications, the Office of Housing Counseling is expected to become operational during FY2012.", "The Secretary of HUD or the Director of Housing Counseling are directed to undertake a variety of activities to expand housing counseling, set counseling standards, or provide outreach to the public. Specifically, the Secretary is directed to establish standards for materials and forms to be used in connection with homeownership counseling, and to the extent that funds are made available in advance in appropriations acts, to certify software programs that consumers can use to evaluate mortgage products based on their own circumstances. Furthermore, the Secretary is directed to provide advice and technical assistance, including assistance in developing content and materials, to states, localities, and nonprofits to help establish and operate programs to educate consumers on specific types or aspects of mortgages, with a focus on reaching the most vulnerable consumers. The Secretary is also directed to make financial assistance available to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and SHFAs, and to establish standards and procedures for determining the eligibility of agencies to receive funding. The legislation also directs the Secretary to take any necessary action to inform consumers about the importance and availability of home inspection counseling, and to develop or publish certain materials related to home inspection counseling.", "The Director of the Office of Housing Counseling is assigned specific functions, and in particular is directed to establish rules related to a number of provisions in current law, as well rules related to collaborating with community-based organizations with expertise in housing counseling and rules related to building capacity for providing housing counseling in underdeveloped areas. The Director of the Office of Housing Counseling is also directed to undertake a public awareness campaign targeted to certain populations that may benefit from housing counseling.", "The Dodd-Frank legislation also requires that only HUD-approved housing counseling agencies provide housing counseling associated with HUD programs. ", "Finally, as was noted earlier in this report, another section of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA), which places certain requirements on mortgages that are deemed to be high-cost due to exceeding certain interest rate and points and fees thresholds. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act amends HOEPA to prohibit a lender from making a high-cost mortgage available to a borrower until the lender has received certification that the borrower has been counseled by a HUD-approved housing counselor on the advisability of the mortgage.
