In general, the offices are responsible for formulating and implementing policy initiatives and managing Treasury's operations, while the bureaus perform specific duties assigned to Treasury, mainly through statutory mandates. In the past decade or so, the bureaus have accounted for over 95% of the agency's funding and work force.", "With one possible exception, the bureaus can be divided into those engaged in financial management and regulation and those engaged in law enforcement. In recent decades, the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Financial Management Service (FMS), Bureau of the Public Debt, Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI), and Office of Thrift Supervision have undertaken tasks related to the management of the federal government's finances or the supervision and regulation of the U.S. financial system. By contrast, law enforcement has been the central focus of the tasks handled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; U.S. Secret Service; Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; U.S. Customs Service; Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. Since the advent of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, Treasury's direct involvement in law enforcement has shrunk considerably.

In evaluating the Administration's budget proposal, one consideration might be the extent to which the proposed budget would likely support or promote these objectives, and whether other approaches might be more desirable.", "The Administration maintained that the budget proposal would promote the first objective, in part, by channeling more resources into Treasury's contribution to international economic policy coordination and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and by eliminating funding for the Bank Enterprise Awards program, which is administered through the CDFI.", "The Administration claimed the proposal would support the second objective largely by increasing funding for TFI and FinCEN. TFI collects and analyzes financial intelligence, formulates and implements measures to combat money laundering, enforces economic sanctions against foreign entities, and conducts criminal investigations of alleged financial crimes. The Administration asked Congress to boost appropriated funds for TFI from $43 million in FY2007 to $56 million in FY2008. Most of the additional money would be used to expand Treasury's capacity to \"identify potential national security threats and to enforce U.S. policies to counter those threats,\" improve the \"information technology and physical infrastructure of TFI and its component bureaus and offices,\" and deepen the involvement of TFI in the \"broader Intelligence Community.\" FinCEN is responsible for protecting the U.S. financial system from a wide range of financial crimes, including money laundering and terrorist financing. Foremost among its main tasks is administering the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The Administration asked Congress to increase funding for FinCEN from $73 million in FY2007 to $86 million in FY2008. A portion of the added funds would be used to upgrade an electronic filing system for BSA forms and FinCEN's \"critical information technology system,\" and to enhance its project management capabilities.", "In the Administration's view, the budget proposal supported the third objective by boosting IRS's budget for enforcement, taxpayer service, and business systems modernization, and by implementing several new initiatives intended to improve taxpayer compliance.

During the floor debate on the bill in the House, Representative Jose Serrano, the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services, agreed to drop the provision in the face of opposition from some Republicans. Representative Jim McCreary raised a budget point of order against the provision on the grounds that any measure capping funding for the private tax debt collection program should fall under the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee, and thus should not be considered as part of an appropriations bill.

One was the tax gap. The gap is the difference between federal taxes owed and federal taxes paid in a timely manner.

In the committee's view, the IRS \"must and can reduce the tax gap if the IRS is given additional resources and is able to improve its operational capabilities (most notably the Business Systems Modernization program).\" Yet it could find no strategy in the Administration's budget request for the IRS in FY2008 that would have enabled the agency to achieve the stated goal of raising the voluntary compliance rate for all taxpayers from its estimated level of 83.7% in 2007 to 85% by 2009. So the committee added a provision to H.R. 2829 requiring the IRS to develop such a plan, without specifying a deadline.", "Of the $2.149 billion recommended for taxpayer services in the bill, \"not less than\" $3 million would have been set aside for the tax counseling program for the elderly, \"not less than\" $9 million for low-income taxpayer clinic grants, and \"not less than\" $10 million to establish and administer a matching grant program for tax return preparation assistance involving volunteers from local communities. On other matters dealing with appropriations for taxpayer service, the committee directed the IRS, after consulting with the IRS Oversight Board and the National Taxpayer Advocate, to submit to Congress an annual update of its current five-year strategic plan for taxpayer services known as the \"Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint.\" It also expressed disappointment with the slow progress made by the IRS in increasing the number of tax returns that are filed electronically and directed the agency to develop a strategic plan to meet the 80% electronic filing goal it was supposed to reach by 2007.

The IRS uses data collected through the NRP to generate estimates of the underreporting of taxable income by individual taxpayers, a major component of the federal tax gap. But the IRS, Government Accountability Office, and TIGTA, among others, have expressed concern about the quality of the data from the NRP and gaps in its coverage. The committee also expressed concern about the loss of tax revenue arising from the misclassification of workers as independent contractors and directed the IRS to channel more enforcement resources into \"industries where misclassification is widespread.\"", "A controversial provision of the bill would have reduced funding to administer the PDC program to $1 million. At such a low level of funding, the IRS could have been forced to suspend the program. One noteworthy aspect of the provision is its wording. The version of H.R. 2829 reported by the House Appropriations Committee contained a similar provision, but it was removed during the House floor debate after facing the threat of a budget point of order tied to a ruling by the Joint Committee on Taxation that cutting funding for the private tax debt collection program would result in a loss of revenue.

DOD employees who are eligible to be represented by a labor organization, but are not so represented, will receive the pay adjustment unless pay for their positions is adjusted under 5 U.S.C. \u00a79902. Since the inception of locality pay in 1994, pay areas with the largest pay gaps receive the largest locality pay increases. Applying that principle, and under Executive Order 13454 issued by President Bush on January 4, 2008, federal white-collar employees received net (annual and locality) pay adjustments of 4.49% in the Washington, DC pay area and 2.99% in the \"Rest of the United States\" pay area in January 2008.", "A new provision, included as Section 743 of the bill as passed by the House, and as Section 744 of P.L. 110-161 (but not included in the bill as reported in the Senate), requires the Office of Management and Budget to submit a report on budget information relating to activities to restore the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem.

Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for conducting competitions involving government employees and contractors. For many years, OMB continued to be the exclusive source of guidance on public-private competitions. The late 1990s witnessed a notable change, with the advent of competitive sourcing legislation, and, in particular, the passage of bills containing competitive sourcing provisions.", "Section 739(a) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, ( P.L. 110-161 ) prohibits the use of funds for converting an agency activity involving 11 or more federal employees to contractor performance unless certain conditions are met. Public-private competitions that meet this size criterion will have to include a staffing plan known as a most efficient organization (MEO); show that the cost of contractor performance would result in a savings of at least $10 million or 10% of the MEO's personnel costs, whichever amount is lesser; and not provide a contractor with an advantage by permitting the company to provide health and retirement benefits to the employees performing the government activity that are less than what federal employees receive. The first two conditions appear designed to address two distinctions between standard competitions and streamlined competitions. Under Circular A-76, agencies are required to develop an MEO and apply the conversion differential (that is, $10 million or 10% of the MEO's personnel costs) for standard competitions. (An agency is required to use a standard competition when a public-private competition involves more than 65 full-time equivalents (FTEs). ) In streamlined competitions, an agency may develop an MEO but is not required to do so, and the conversion differential is not calculated. (An agency may use a streamlined or a standard competition when a public-private competition involves 65 or fewer FTEs.) The third condition may be seen as an effort to ensure that a contractor does not gain a cost advantage in competitions by paying less for benefits than the government does, thus lowering the cost of his or her proposal. Alternatively, others may see this condition as a restriction on the ability of a contractor to prepare a competitive proposal. Certain organizations and procurement activities, such as the Department of Defense and depot maintenance contracts, are exempt from Section 739(a).", "Although Circular A-76 does not appear to prohibit conducting a public-private competition for work that is being performed by a contractor, some of the language in the circular seems to emphasize holding competitions for work being performed by federal employees. For example, the circular's policy statement says, in part: \"The longstanding policy of the federal government has been to rely on the private sector for needed commercial services.... Identify all activities performed by government personnel as either commercial or inherently governmental.... Perform inherently governmental activities with government personnel.... Use a streamlined or standard competition to determine if government personnel should perform a commercial activity.\" Section 739(b) notes that the circular does not prevent holding competitions for working being performed by contractors, and it also requires that Circular A-76 include procedures and policies for these types of competitions.", "Section 739(c) allows a protest to be filed for any competition (that is, streamlined as well as standard) conducted under Circular A-76, and for any decision made without benefit of an A-76 competition to convert an agency function from employee performance to contractor performance. This section also permits an individual selected by a majority of the affected employees to represent the employees in a protest involving an A-76 competition or a decision to outsource work without a competition. The ATO retains the authority to file a protest on behalf of the employees. Section 739(c) permits the ATO or the individual selected by the employees to represent them to intervene in a civil action brought before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims or a U.S. district court by an interested party from the private sector. Additionally, this section permits protests and civil actions that challenge the selection of a provider (that is, government employees or a contractor) at the conclusion of a competition.", "Currently, an ATO is not required to file a protest: he or she \"shall file a protest in connection with ... [a] public-private competition unless the [agency tender] official determines that there is no reasonable basis for the protest.\" Some have been concerned that agency employees' interests may not be adequately represented since an ATO determines unilaterally whether there is a basis for a protest. Hence, supporters of this view might argue that another individual, such as a union representative, would be a better choice for representing the affected employees. In response, the private sector might argue that allowing the ATO to file a protest is sufficient protection for agency employees. Additionally, contractors might note that their employees cannot band together and select someone to represent them in a protest.", "The final substantive provision in this section prohibits the use of funds made available by this act for certain purposes. That is, none of the funds appropriated by this act can be used by OMB for directing or requiring an agency to take any action related to a public-private competition, or a direct conversion of a government activity from one sector to another. Similarly, none of the funds can be used by another agency to take an action that was directed or required by OMB.

Restrictions on travel have been a key and often contentious component of U.S. efforts to isolate the Cuban government. The regulations do not ban travel itself, but place restrictions on any financial transactions related to travel to Cuba. Pursuant to the CACR, certain categories of travelers may travel to Cuba under a general license, which means that there is no need to obtain special permission from OFAC. In addition, a variety of travelers may be eligible to apply for specific licenses, which are reviewed and granted by OFAC on a case by case basis. This includes travelers engaging in family visits; educational, religious or humanitarian activities; or activities related to the marketing, sale, delivery or servicing of authorized exports to Cuba.", "Some U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba have been allowed since 2001 under the terms of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 or TSRA, but with numerous restrictions and licensing requirements. Exporters are denied access to U.S. private commercial financing or credit, and all transactions must be conducted in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. U.S. exports to Cuba since 2001 have been valued at over $1.9 billion, the overwhelming majority in agricultural products. U.S. exports to Cuba rose from $146 million in 2002 to a high of $404 million in 2004, and then declined to $369 million in 2005 and $340 million in 2006. In the first 11 months of 2007, U.S. exports amounted to $377 million, the majority in agricultural products.", "In February 2005, the Administration tightened sanctions against Cuba by further restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid for their sales. OFAC amended the CACR to clarify that the term \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the shipment of the goods. This differs from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods, a practice that had been utilized by most U.S. agricultural exporters to Cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001. U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress strongly objected on the grounds that the action constituted a new sanction that violated the intent of TSRA, and could jeopardize millions of dollars in U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. OFAC Director Robert Werner maintained that the clarification \"conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade.\"", "Since 2000, either one or both houses have approved provisions in the annual Treasury Department appropriations bill that would ease U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba (especially on travel and on U.S. agricultural exports) but none of these provisions have ever been enacted. The Administration regularly threatened to veto legislation if it included provision weakening sanctions on Cuba.", "In 2007, both the House-passed and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported versions of the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill, H.R. 2829 , contained a provision that would have prevented Treasury Department funds from being used to implement the February 2005 regulation that requires the payment of cash in advance prior to the shipment of U.S. agricultural goods to Cuba. The House adopted the provision, contained in Section 903 of the bill, during June 28, 2007 floor consideration when it approved H.Amdt. 467 (Moran, Kansas) by voice vote. In the Senate version, the provision was included in Section 619 of the bill. The Senate version also contained a provision, in Section 620, that would have authorized travel to Cuba under a general license for the marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods. The Administration's statement of policy on the bill maintained that the President would veto the measure if it contained a provision weakening current restrictions against Cuba.", "Ultimately, Congress dropped these provisions easing Cuba sanctions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 ( P.L. 110-161 )."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
