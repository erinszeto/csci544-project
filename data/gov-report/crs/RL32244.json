Part 4100) on August 11, 2006, after a three year review. Some portions of the regulations have been enjoined. The previous major revision of grazing rules, which took effect in 1995, was highly controversial. The 2006 changes addressed many of the same issues, and received mixed reviews. BLM asserted that the 2006 changes were needed to increase flexibility for grazing managers and permittees, to improve rangeland management and grazing permit administration, to promote conservation, and to comply with court decisions. Critics contend that a need for change was not justified and that changes adopted removed important environmental protections and opportunities for public comment.", "Under the 2006 changes, the BLM and a permittee could share title to structural range improvements, such as a fence. Permittees could acquire water rights for grazing, consistent with state law. The occasions on which BLM would be required to get input from the public on grazing decisions were reduced. The administrative appeals process on grazing decisions was modified and the extent to which grazing could continue in the face of an appeal or stay of a decision was delineated. The definition of grazing preference was broadened to include a quantitative meaning\u2014forage on public land. Changes were made to the timeframe and procedures for changing grazing management after a determination that grazing is a significant factor in failing to achieve rangeland health standards. The three-year limit on temporary nonuse of a permit was removed, and permittees are able to apply for nonuse of a permit for up to one year at a time. Conservation use grazing permits were eliminated. Changes that have been enjoined relate primarily to public participation, sharing title to range improvements, and fundamentals of rangeland health. BLM also considered, but did not propose, certain changes due to adverse public reaction or other considerations.", "On June 17, 2005, BLM had issued a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) analyzing the potential impact of proposed changes in the regulations, an alternative, and the status quo. On March 31, 2006, BLM published an addendum to the FEIS addressing public comment received after the closing date of March 2, 2004, primarily from the Fish and Wildlife Service. Final regulatory changes took effect August 11, 2006.", "BLM also considered, but did not make, changes to its grazing policies, which the agency had believed could be carried out under existing rules. Potential changes that were examined included the establishment of reserve common allotments to serve as backup forage when permittees' regular allotments are unavailable; conservation partnerships between the BLM and permittees whereby permittees work to improve environmental health in return for certain benefits; voluntary allotment restructuring to allow multiple permittees to merge allotments; conservation easement acquisition to preserve open space; and landscape habitat improvement to promote species conservation and facilitate consultations under the Endangered Species Act."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History", "paragraphs": ["On August 11, 2006, revised grazing regulations of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) took effect (43 C.F.R.

The previous revision of grazing regulations culminated in comprehensive changes effective August 21, 1995. The 1995 changes were the result of a several-year process of evaluating ideas and shaping alternatives, and occurred in the midst of a decades-long dispute over the ownership, management, and use of federal rangelands.", "The 1995 changes were highly controversial, with criticism from many ranching interests that those new rules weakened grazing privileges and would reduce livestock grazing on federal lands, and from environmental organizations that the changes did not go far enough in protecting public lands. Supporters saw the changes as improving resource and range management and broadening participation in public land decisionmaking. Congress considered many of the 1995 changes as part of legislative proposals or committee oversight. Congress also has examined the development of the 2006 regulatory changes and related policy options through committee oversight.", "Among the changes made in 1995, many of which were reexamined by BLM during the development of the 2006 regulatory changes, are those that:", "separated grazing preference from permitted use , so that a permittee's preference for receiving a grazing permit was not tied to a specific amount of grazing based on historic levels (described as Animal Unit Months , or AUMs ) ; allowed permittees up to three years of nonuse of their permits; authorized suspending or canceling a permit if a permittee is convicted of violating certain state or federal environmental laws; eliminated the express requirement that a permittee be engaged in the livestock business; replaced the term affected interest with interested public ; allowed conservation use for the term of a grazing permit, thereby excluding livestock grazing from all or a portion of an allotment; required title of permanent structural improvements to be held in the name of the United States; required that water rights for livestock grazing be held in the name of the United States, to the extent allowed by state law; imposed a surcharge on a permittee who allows livestock not owned by the permittee or the permittee's children to graze on public land; eliminated Grazing Advisory Boards and replaced them with the broader interest Resource Advisory Councils; and adopted rangeland management standards called Fundamentals of Rangeland Health .", "In issuing these changes, the Secretary of the Interior dropped the most contentious proposal\u2014to increase the grazing fee\u2014due to the rancor this issue generated. However, dissatisfaction with the 1995 changes among ranching interests led to a lawsuit ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The regulations, challenged on their face, were upheld by the courts as not exceeding the authority of the Secretary, with one exception. The court struck down the rule pertaining to conservation use for the term of a permit on the grounds that a grazing permit was for grazing and the Secretary could more appropriately accomplish conservation use through the land use planning process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Efforts to Change Grazing Rules and Policies", "paragraphs": ["BLM took a two-pronged approach to the 2003-2006 iteration of grazing reform on public lands, by issuing changes to grazing regulations and considering changes to grazing policies. Under this Sustaining Working Landscapes initiative, first announced in March 2003, BLM sought to create working landscapes that are both economically productive and environmentally healthy. Changes to grazing regulations and/or policies could affect more than 18,000 grazing permits on 162 million acres of BLM land. The specific regulatory changes that were adopted and the policy alternatives that were considered are discussed under separate headings below.", "Conflict over livestock grazing on public lands has become common. Critics of the latest reform effort asserted that the 1995 regulations were not in effect long enough to assess their effectiveness and that the policy issues were too vague to assess their potential effects. They also contended that BLM had not justified a need for regulatory and policy changes and that the changes adopted remove important environmental protections and opportunities for public comment. One concern voiced by environmentalists was that the changes would require more monitoring than would be feasible, thus possibly preventing changes in grazing practices. Another was that BLM and the Forest Service did not develop joint rules, advocated because many BLM and Forest Service lands are similar and adjoining and permittees often have permits for livestock grazing on both agencies' lands. There was also some disappointment among environmentalists that the reform effort did not encompass certain important issues such as altering grazing fees, controlling noxious weeds, retiring grazing permits, and establishing processes for identifying lands suitable for grazing.", "Regulatory changes have been supported by some livestock organizations and range professionals as helping both ranchers and the range. BLM asserted that regulatory changes were needed to increase flexibility for grazing managers and permittees, to improve BLM's relationship with ranchers, to improve rangeland management and permit administration, to promote conservation, and to comply with court decisions. According to the agency, the changes are based on lessons learned in implementing the 1995 regulations and thus improve upon those earlier regulations. Further, the final rule recognizes the benefits of grazing, including the economic and social benefits to rural communities and the preservation of open space, according to BLM."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of Regulatory Process", "paragraphs": ["BLM proposed changes to its grazing regulations on December 8, 2003 (68 Fed. Reg. 68451), and on January 2, 2004, issued a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) analyzing the potential impact of the proposed changes. The DEIS also assessed the impacts of a slightly different alternative and of keeping the existing grazing rules. Prior to proposing the changes, BLM reviewed more than 8,000 public comments on regulatory issues that were submitted in response to a March 3, 2003 advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.", "In late January and early February of 2004, BLM held public meetings in the West and in Washington, DC, to gather public comments on the regulatory proposal and DEIS. The proposal and DEIS were open for public comment through March 2, 2004, during which time the agency received more than 18,000 comments. The BLM considered these comments, and on June 17, 2005, issued a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on proposed changes and alternatives.", "The proposed revisions in the FEIS met with mixed reaction, like those in the earlier DEIS. A number of the key proposals, which were adopted, are discussed under \" Changes to Grazing Regulations \" below. With regard to the environmental effects of the preferred alternative, the FEIS stated (p. ES-5) that \"most of the proposed regulatory changes have little or no adverse effects on the human environment. Some short-term adverse effects may not be avoided because of increases in timeframes associated with several components of this proposed rulemaking.\" This statement fueled concerns among environmentalists that the proposed changes could eliminate public land protections and lead to unsustainable grazing practices. The FEIS stated that to minimize the potential for adverse affects in the short-term, the BLM could \"curtail grazing if resources on the public lands require immediate protection or if continued grazing use poses an imminent likelihood of significant resource damage.\" Further, the BLM asserted that the long-term outcome of the proposed changes would be better and more sustainable grazing decisions, and that the changes \"would be beneficial to rangeland health.\"", "A particular controversy surfaced over assertions by two members of the draft EIS team, a BLM hydrologist and a BLM biologist (both now retired), that their scientific conclusions were reversed by BLM because they did not support the new rules. Those conclusions apparently had asserted that the proposed new rules could harm water quality and wildlife, including endangered species. A BLM official is reported to have called the changes to the views of the two scientists a part of the standard editing and review process. Further, a statement by the BLM contended that the EIS team found their work to be \"seriously lacking in the quality expected from each contributor to the environmental impact analysis.\" The statement alleged that the conclusions of the two team members were \"based on personal opinion and unsubstantiated assertions rather than sound environmental analysis. As a result, the work submitted by the two former BLM employees was rewritten.\"", "BLM initially intended to publish a final grazing rule in the Federal Register in July 2005, with an effective date in August 2005. However, on August 9, 2005, BLM announced its intent to prepare a supplement to the FEIS. The delay was intended to allow the agency to address public comment received after the comment period ended on March 2, 2004, primarily the views of the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). On March 31, 2006, BLM issued an addendum to the FEIS that addressed the FWS and other public comment and made relatively minor changes to its proposed rules.", "In its comment to the BLM, the FWS asserted that the proposed changes would \"fundamentally change the way BLM lands are managed temporally, spatially, and philosophically. These changes could have profound impacts on wildlife resources.\" The FWS expressed overall concern that the proposed revisions would make grazing a priority over other land uses, which could be detrimental to fish and wildlife habitats and populations, for instance, management of sage-grouse habitat. The agency further contended that the proposed changes could \"constrain biologists and range conservationists from recommending and implementing management changes based on their best professional judgment in response to conditions that may compromise the long-term health and sustainability of rangeland resources.\"", "In its addendum, BLM disagreed with the FWS assertion that the proposed rule would fundamentally change BLM management of rangelands and that there could be profound impacts on wildlife. BLM contended that the changes are primarily administrative and do not secure the dominance of grazing over other land uses. BLM also rejected the assertion that its proposals would constrain specialists from recommending changes, noting that changes can be made through varied means, including modification of the terms and conditions of grazing permits.", "While supporting some of the proposed grazing changes, the FWS identified a number of areas of particular concern. They included potential effects of administrative inconsistencies between BLM and the Forest Service on their management of fish and wildlife resources across boundaries; diminished requirements for public consultation on site-specific actions, which have the greatest potential for impacts to fish and wildlife; a phase-in of decreases (or increases) in livestock use that are greater than 10%, which may not be immediate enough to prevent irreversible harm to vegetation and wildlife; including a quantity of forage in the definition of grazing preference, which may not account for other range attributes; allowing shared title to range improvements, which could make it more difficult to reallocate land use, such as to provide quality habitat for wildlife; sharing of water rights, as water is the most important resource for fish and wildlife; and requiring monitoring of rangeland standards, which has not been achievable due to BLM funding and staffing limitations.", "In response, BLM stated in its addendum that while it will coordinate with the Forest Service, consistency of grazing regulations is not necessary and inconsistencies stem from the agencies' different statutory requirements. With regard to diminished public consultation, BLM responded that most if not all of the site-specific actions on grazing allotments that would affect fish and wildlife are included in allotment management planning and the planning of range improvements. Such planning requires public consultation. While the phase-in of reduced livestock use may affect special status species outside those federally listed, any adverse effects are expected to be limited to few grazing allotments, according to BLM. Changes can be made in a shorter time period or even immediately; for instance, to protect sensitive species or other resources. Further, a permittee's preference does not necessarily have the highest priority in evaluating possible uses of available vegetation, and shared title to range improvements does not diminish BLM's ability to redirect or reallocate land uses. With regard to sharing of water rights, BLM stated that water will benefit multiple uses and that rights for wildlife (and other uses) will usually be held in the name of the United States. The BLM does not anticipate that monitoring will overwhelm its capacity, in part because only about 15% of allotments evaluated were not meeting land health standards, due in significant part to livestock grazing.", "Final grazing regulations were published on July 12, 2006, and took effect on August 11, 2006.

There continues to be disagreement as to the extent of the environmental impact of the final changes and whether that impact would be primarily beneficial or damaging in both the short- and long-terms.", "Some of the key changes in the new regulations involve ownership of range improvements and water rights, and opportunities for public input and appeals.

Title would be shared in proportion to each party's contribution to the cost of the improvement. The regulations also continue to require documentation of a permittee's contributions to improvements and compensation if a permit is cancelled or passes to another. However, some advocated that ranchers should receive more direct compensation for improvements, would be encouraged to undertake and maintain improvements if they get title, and should be able to include improvements as assets to secure loans for grazing. Opponents charged that shared title would create private rights on public land and could hinder action to correct grazing abuses. They contended that the government should hold title to improvements as they typically are important for other uses, such as recreation and wildlife habitat. Still others believed that improvements for grazing do not necessarily benefit other land uses, and thus permittees should not be rewarded with title."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acquire Private Water Rights", "paragraphs": ["The new regulations allow permittees to acquire water rights, consistent with state law. Previous rules required the federal government to follow state procedural and substantive law regarding livestock watering rights, but directed that title to the rights be held by the United States to the extent state law permitted. Before 1995, practices as to water rights for livestock grazing varied and in some states could be acquired in the name of the permittee. Language allowing private individuals to hold water rights was supported by some as providing an incentive for private water development on public land, and protecting permittees from being denied water. It was opposed by others who believed water rights should be in federal ownership to facilitate multiple uses and to preclude private claims for compensation for water rights, and because states typically do not allow grazing permittees on state lands to obtain water rights.

The agency also modified the definition of \"interested public\" so that only individuals, groups, and organizations who participate in the decisionmaking process on management of a specific allotment are maintained on the list of interested publics. Supporters maintained that the changes would prevent delays and facilitate timely decisions. Also, the agency viewed additional consultation as redundant, because the public already has opportunities to participate during the planning processes and reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The changes were criticized as restricting public input which could lead to ill-considered decisions. They were further opposed on the grounds that decisions at the planning level are too general and broad to allow specific evaluation and comment.

The changes were sought to provide permittees with continuity of operations when a decision affecting their operations is appealed.

The revised definition, which is similar to pre-1995 rule language, was intended to link forage allocations to base property, give ranchers certainty as to the size of operations, and eliminate confusion as to the meaning of preference . Further, preference includes both active use, defined as use currently available for livestock grazing based on livestock carrying capacity and resource conditions, and suspended use , which is use that has been allocated for livestock grazing in the past but is currently unavailable.

One change allows a maximum of 24 months, rather than the current 12-month limit, for developing remedial changes in grazing practices. However, BLM could extend the deadline if responsibilities of another agency prevent completion within 24 months. Further, a change would phase in grazing increases or decreases of more than 10% over a five-year period, unless the changes must be made sooner under law (e.g., the Endangered Species Act ) or the permittee agrees to a shorter period. BLM maintained that these changes would provide a sound basis for agency determinations and give the agency more time and flexibility in working with permittees who are not meeting the standards.

The BLM also considered the issue of forage reserves as part of its consideration of policy changes.

Policy changes considered included conservation partnerships, voluntary allotment restructuring, conservation easement acquisition, endangered species mitigation/landscape habitat improvement, and reserve common allotments (RCAs). RCAs would serve as livestock forage for permittees while their normal allotments undergo rest or improvements, and might be used for unplanned needs. BLM also examined the establishment of RCAs as a regulatory change, but did not propose rule language in this area.

In response, BLM announced that it had extended the timeframe for developing policy changes, but did not issue a schedule for completing actions. The agency also developed and published on its website more detailed information on RCAs, conservation partnerships, and voluntary allotment restructuring. It noted that conservation easements were no longer being pursued as a major policy tool, and that the concept of endangered species mitigation had evolved to the broader notion of landscape habitat improvement .

The agency postponed developing a final grazing rule to consider public comment received after the closing date, particularly from the Fish and Wildlife Service. The BLM addressed this comment in an addendum issued March 31, 2006. Final grazing regulations were published on July 12, 2006, and took effect a month later. Some of the new regulations are not being implemented as a result of lawsuits, primarily changes regarding public participation, sharing title to range improvements, and fundamentals of rangeland health.", "BLM had expected to focus on final policy changes after the completion of the rulemaking process, but it appears that policy changes are no longer under consideration. Public feedback on possible policy changes had shaped the proposals that were examined and extended the timeframe for considering changes. Key policy issues that were considered related to RCAs, conservation partnerships, voluntary allotment restructuring, conservation easement acquisition, and landscape habitat improvement."], "subsections": []}]}}
