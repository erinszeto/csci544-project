In 2008, in response to concerns regarding generic drug application review times and a backlog of applications, Congress passed legislation that reauthorized ADUFA and created a new user fee program for generic animal drugs.

FDA is tasked by law with specific responsibilities in the reauthorization process.", "As required for the upcoming reauthorization, in May 2016 FDA held two public meetings, one each for ADUFA and AGDUFA, to begin the process. For the next several months through early 2017, FDA held separate negotiations with the brand-name and generic animal drug industries, and met with other stakeholder groups (scientific and academic experts, veterinary professionals, patient and consumer advocacy groups). On October 25, 2017, FDA published in the Federal Register the \"ADUFA IV\" and \"ADGUFA III\" reauthorization proposals, including commitments negotiated with industry. On November 2, 2017, the agency held two public meetings, one each for ADUFA and AGDUFA, to discuss the proposed recommendations and commitments.

A sunset, in contrast, bars the agency from continuing such work beyond the sunset date, unless or until Congress reauthorizes the provision or otherwise lifts the sunset. ", "The key consequence for FDA and drug sponsors of a lapse in user fee authority is that continued payment of FDA review personnel is prohibited, and the agency may have to lay off animal drug review staff. These personnel are highly specialized and not easily replaced. As a result, user fee reauthorizations are often considered \"must pass,\" and Congress has consistently reauthorized ADUFA and AGDUFA before their sunset dates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review of Animal Drugs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Brand-Name (Pioneer) Animal Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Authorities governing FDA's review of animal drugs are found in FFDCA Section 512, which cross-references additional sections of the Act. Regulations are at 21 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter E, which also cross-references other regulations. FDA does not oversee veterinary biologics (e.g., vaccines), which are regulated by the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The FDA's Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (ONADE) determines whether or not a new animal drug application (NADA) should be approved for marketing. According to ONADE, in order to approve and sustain a new animal drug for commercial use, five standards must be met.", "1. The drug must be safe for the animal, for humans consuming food derived from a treated food-producing animal, and for the person administering the drug. 2. The drug must be effective for its intended uses, i.e., the uses prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling of the product. 3. The drug must be a quality manufactured product, being the result of a validated manufacturing process conducted in accordance with current Good Manu facturing Practice (GMP) regulations. 4. The drug must be properly labeled to inform the user of the product not only how to use the product but also safety considerations, procedures for use in food-producing animals, and procedures for storage and handling. 5. Under the National Environmental Policy Act, FDA must consider, during the review process, the environmental impact of an animal drug's postmarket use (e.g., medicated feed waste and potential runoff). ", "In 2004 Congress addressed concerns about the availability of some animal drugs that are not commercially attractive, and enacted the Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act (MUMS, P.L. 108-282 ), modeled after the authority for \"orphan\" human drugs. A minor use is a use in a major species (horses, dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, turkeys, and chickens) for a disease that occurs infrequently, involving only a small number of animals annually. Minor species are all other nonhuman animal species (except for the above listed major species )\u2014such as zoo animals, fish, and pet birds and rodents\u2014including some species of food-producing animals\u2014such as sheep, goats, catfish, game birds, and honey bees, among others. MUMS allows conditional approval (marketing before all effectiveness data are available) and a period of marketing exclusivity, during which FDA may not approve an application for the generic copy of the approved brand-name drug. FDA may waive user fee requirements under ADUFA and AGDUFA for MUMS drugs.", "As with human medical products, it is the responsibility of the drug sponsor to conduct the necessary tests to demonstrate a product's safety and effectiveness for review purposes. Once the drug is on the market, FDA continues to monitor the animal drug's safety and effectiveness, manufacturing processes, labeling, and marketing communications.

Chapter I, Subchapter E. The Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-670 ) created an expedited pathway for the review of generic animal drugs. This pathway allows a sponsor to submit an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA) to FDA for premarket review rather than the full NADA required for a brand-name animal drug. The process is called \"abbreviated\" because instead of conducting new safety and effectiveness testing, the ANADA sponsor establishes that the generic animal drug is the same as the reference-listed new animal drug product (RLNAD, which is the brand drug), thereby relying on FDA's determination that the brand drug is safe and effective. In the ANADA, the generic drug sponsor must show: that the generic copy has the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, dosing regimen, and route of administration as the RLNAD; that it is bioequivalent (or that the bioequivalence requirement has been waived); and that it is the same in identity, strength, purity, and quality. The labeling for the generic animal drug also must be the same as the brand, with some exceptions (e.g., company name and address). An ANADA also must contain an environmental assessment (EA) or a request for categorical exclusion from the EA, among other information. ", "For basic types of applications, other submissions, and product references in the review of a generic animal drug, as well as commonly used acronyms, see text box, above."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Drug Use in Food-Producing Animals", "paragraphs": ["As noted, FDA must consider public health and environmental impacts in its safety assessment of a proposed new animal drug. This is most evident in FDA's regulation of drugs used in food-producing animals, where use of drugs can affect the safety of meat and milk products consumed by humans or other animals. FDA applies the following approaches, among others, to the review, approval, and use of these drugs.", "Tolerances and Withdrawal /Withholding/Discard Periods . Drug sponsors are required to study the persistence of a drug (called a \"residue\") in the tissues of food-producing animals and demonstrate a safe management approach, such as the minimum number of days after drug treatment ends that an animal must be held untreated before it can go to slaughter (called a \"withdrawal period\"), or that a cow's milk must be discarded rather than marketed. Limitations on \" Extra-Label \" Prescribing . Veterinarians are generally permitted to prescribe and/or dispense medications for indications not stated on the label (referred to as \"off-label\" in human medicine) and for species not stated on the label. This provides the basis of authority for veterinarians to prescribe or dispense human medications for use in animals. However, this practice is limited in a number of ways for uses in food-producing animals, in order to keep the food supply free of potentially harmful drug residues. Judicious Use of Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs . According to FDA, \"Antimicrobial use in animals can contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria that may be transferred to humans, thereby reducing the effectiveness of antimicrobial drugs for treating human disease.\" The agency has focused attention in particular on food-producing animals, which can transmit foodborne infections in their meat or milk, and on what it calls \"production uses\" of antimicrobial drugs, intended to promote weight gain or growth efficiency rather than as treatment for specific diseases. In 2010, FDA published draft guidance (which it finalized in 2012) stating principles for limiting medically important antimicrobial drugs to uses in food-producing animals that are considered necessary for assuring animal health, and limiting such drugs to uses in food-producing animals that include veterinary oversight or consultation. This effectively limited new approvals to drugs for which there was evidence of effectiveness against a specific disease or condition, and eliminated new approvals for over-the-counter antimicrobial uses. In 2013, FDA asked sponsors of already approved antimicrobial drugs used in food-producing animals to either demonstrate evidence of effectiveness for a disease treatment or prevention indication, or to voluntarily withdraw the drug. In January 2017, FDA announced the completion of this process, which resulted in 84 voluntary product withdrawals and enhanced controls over the ongoing use of remaining products in food-producing animals. Regulation of Feed Mills . Food-producing animals are often fed blended feed mixtures containing vitamins and minerals, to which drugs are also sometimes added. These blends are produced commercially by feed mills, which came under increased scrutiny pursuant to the Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-250 ). In 2015, through rulemaking, FDA expanded the role of veterinarians in the use of antimicrobial drugs in blended feeds (called the \"Veterinary Feed Directive\" or VFD) in order to assure the safe use of these drugs in food-producing animals. Reporting of Antimicrobial Animal Drug Sales and Distribution . Section 105 of ADUFA II requires that drug sponsors annually report to FDA the amount of antimicrobial drugs they sell or distribute for use in food-producing animals, and requires FDA to issue annual summary reports of the sales and distribution data. Sponsors have said that they are not in a position to know how products are actually used once distributed (e.g., the species or condition being treated), although such usage information is potentially valuable in monitoring and addressing concerns about antimicrobial resistance. In 2016, through rulemaking, FDA began requiring sponsors to provide FDA with estimates of sales broken out by major food-producing species (cattle, swine, chickens, and turkeys).", "Authorities that address FDA's regulation of animal drugs used in food-producing animals are generally permanent. They are not part of the statutory language in FFDCA Title VII that authorizes user fees and is subject to sunset.

FDA financial reports, required by statute, provide the total amount spent on the ADUFA and AGDUFA programs, including the dollar amount and percentage derived from user fees and nonuser fee appropriations. While most of ADUFA and AGDUFA revenue supports activities managed by CVM, revenue from both user fee programs also contributes to other FDA organizational components that support the ADUFA and AGDUFA programs, including the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) and FDA headquarters.
