Current proposals to help delinquent homeowners share many features in common with all of these actions.", "The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) purchased delinquent mortgages at a discount and worked with homeowners to restructure the mortgages into more manageable terms. HOLC accepted slightly more than one million applications from homeowners to refinance their homes between June 1933 and June 1935. It rejected 488,000 applications, most for \"inadequate security\" and \"lack of distress.\" HOLC foreclosed on 194,000 of those it was attempting to assist. At the time, many had serious concern that HOLC could be a costly undertaking, but when it disbanded in the early 1950s, HOLC returned a small profit to the government. HOLC successfully conceived and implemented new ways to contact delinquent homeowners and, in some cases, help homeowners find new jobs.", "In 1984, Continental Illinois National Bank suffered a run after loans that it had not properly underwritten failed. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation led intervention efforts. There were concerns that allowing the bank to fail could have serious repercussions throughout the financial system. This led to the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991.", "In the 1980s, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation approached insolvency because of the failure of member savings and loan institutions, also known as thrifts. Working together, Congress and the George H. W. Bush administration established the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), which was funded by the Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP). The thrift industry is still paying off the intervention operation, which is estimated to have cost $152.9 billion.", "In 1989, Brady bonds helped less developed countries, mostly in Latin America, restructure their debt by renegotiating terms and writing down some of the loans. The plan, proposed by then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, overcame coordination problems in previous restructuring efforts. In addition to writing down some loans, the plan included some interest rate reductions, and having debtor nations post U.S. Treasury bonds as collateral with the Federal Reserve. Approximately $91.8 billion was refinanced under the plan. Repayment continues today.", "H.R. 1106 is among the bills before the 111th Congress that would intervene in economic (housing) markets."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Increasing delinquency and default rates on subprime mortgages in 2007 and 2008, along with liquidity problems in other financial sectors, have led some to call on the federal government to intervene in the mortgage market. The Administration and the mortgage industry have developed an approach called HOPE NOW that works with borrowers with subprime mortgages facing interest rate increases and increasing payments who could be helped with a combination of counseling and either an interest rate freeze or a new mortgage. Critics of the plan believe that HOPE NOW is doing too little, too slowly to help those in need today and those who will face interest rate increases over the next few years.", "Foreclosure is costly for the lender, the borrower, and owners of neighboring property. Efforts to reduce foreclosures could very well be in the interest of all three affected parties. In foreclosure the lender is unlikely to recover the outstanding balance on the mortgage and the cost of foreclosure. The borrower is likely to lose any equity in the home, incur additional costs, and suffer credit impairment. A large number of vacant homes in a neighborhood can reduce the value of occupied homes. This spillover from the borrower and mortgage holder of the vacant homes to the neighbors is an example of what economists term an externality and provides a possible economic rationale for government intervention.", "Some analysts and journalists have drawn a parallel between the delinquency and default problems facing homeowners with subprime mortgages and distressed homeowners during the Great Depression. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created in 1933 to refinance homeowners' mortgages.

When there is a limited amount of aid, how should it be divided? At the one extreme, if assistance goes to only a few, those who obtain it may receive more assistance than is necessary or some in identical situations could be excluded. At the other extreme, if the assistance goes to a large number, there is a risk of spreading the help too thinly to be of assistance, or those who do not need help may receive it.", "In short, who \"deserves\" to be helped? For example, should owners of rental property be assisted or only present owners? Should vacation and other second homes be included? Should persons with two homes who are trying to sell one be aided? Should owners of any type of housing be helped or just owners of single-family housing?", "If only one group, such as owners with subprime mortgages, is to be helped, should this group be further divided? For example, should those current on their mortgages be assisted? Should those who are behind on their payments be aided? What about those whose mortgage interest rates will reset in the future?", "Should borrowers with certain types of mortgages be excluded? For example, should those with no- or low-documentation loans be excluded? Should an owner who made false or fraudulent statements to obtain the mortgage be aided?", "Does it matter if the mortgage was obtained to purchase a home as opposed to refinancing the home? If refinancings are to be included, should there be a limit to the amount of cash equity that the borrower extracted from the house?", "Finally, should there be a cutoff date? If there should, should it be a \"date certain\" or when a certain objective measure is reached?", "One response is the HOPE NOW, which is available to homeowners through free telephone consultations with a HUD-approved credit counselor. Its financial assistance is offered only to owner-occupied housing financed by subprime mortgages where the owners are current in their payments, but are not likely to be able to make payments after the mortgage resets. Some of the homeowners accepted by the program will have their mortgage interest rates frozen. Others will be helped to refinance with the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Homeowners who are delinquent on their mortgage payments may be eligible to refinance in the FHASecure program.", "Economists and others worry that any government intervention in market outcomes could lead to the expectation of future intervention. This expectation, called moral hazard, could lead to riskier decisions in the future as home buyers (both those helped and those who did not require aid in the current case) take more risk than they might otherwise do in the expectation that the government will assist them in the future. In turn, this could lead to resources being used in a riskier way than would have occurred without the intervention. Insurance policies usually include deductibles and co-pays to limit moral hazard and to discourage excessive use. The rationale for such standard practices is that because the policy holder would bear part of the financial loss, he or she will exert greater prudence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Brief Overview of Subprime Delinquency and Default", "paragraphs": ["In mortgage finance, delinquency occurs when a payment on a loan is overdue. Default occurs when a borrower has failed to meet any of the terms of a mortgage contract, including timely payment. Foreclosure occurs when the lender files to seize the house (collateral) because the borrower is in default. Foreclosure procedures vary from state to state.", "Foreclosure is a costly process: one widely cited study estimates that the total cost to a lender of foreclosure, including lost interest, legal fees, and the cost of disposing of the house, is $58,759, and takes an average of 18 months. A more recent report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) estimated the direct loss of property value at $53,493, and the loss of neighborhood property value at an additional $24,163. The JEC estimated that each foreclosure would reduce property tax collections by $692. The JEC estimate did not include legal costs and interest foregone during foreclosure.

If a borrower could not make the mortgage payments, house price appreciation made certain that the lender was paid and the borrower might also make a profit. One reaction to this was the popularity of no-documentation or low-documentation mortgages in which borrowers supplied little or no information about their financial situations. Another response was the extension of subprime mortgages to borrowers with impaired credit histories. All of these mortgages depended heavily upon home price appreciation to provide repayment in case of foreclosure. Where home prices stop appreciating rapidly, the collateral represented by the home can be insufficient to liquidate the debt without a loss to the lender."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Previous Government Interventions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has intervened in the past to modify market outcomes.

HOLC is included because it has been widely mentioned as a possible model for government action. Continental Illinois, in 1984, is included because the bank failed to properly underwrite loans, and because the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation led assistance efforts. The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s is included because the problems were closely connected to the financing of homes.

HOLC exchanged its bonds for mortgages that were in default and mortgages held by financial institutions that were in distress. In HOLC's first year, the federal guarantee increased from interest only to interest and principal. Mortgages were limited to one- to four-unit structures, with an HOLC-appraised value of $20,000 or less ($321,791 in 2008 dollars), could be for no more than the lesser of $14,000 ($225,254 in 2008 dollars) or 80% of HOLC appraised value, carried a maximum interest rate of 5%, and required monthly amortizing payments for not more than 15 years. The $14,000 maximum mortgage meant that a house worth the maximum value of $20,000 could not have a mortgage for the maximum 80% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.", "HOLC was authorized to issue up to $4.75 billion ($76 billion in 2008 dollars) in bonds that could either be exchanged for defaulted mortgages or for cash. The cash could be used to purchase mortgages from lenders who did not want to take the HOLC bonds. The bonds carried a maximum interest rate of 4% for a maximum of 18 years and were exempt from all state, local, and federal taxes. HOLC lent homeowners money to pay taxes and insurance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contemporary Issues", "paragraphs": ["At the time that HOLC was created, some were concerned that lenders would not accept the HOLC bonds.

Although some forecast that HOLC would lose money, it ended up making a relatively small profit when it was liquidated in 1951, in part because declining interest rates and the government guarantee allowed it to borrow inexpensively. HOLC developed its own mortgage processing and servicing system. It supervised and trained appraisers.", "HOLC negotiated flexible repayment terms, but it sought eventual full repayment of the mortgages. It developed new methods of working with borrowers who became delinquent, including personal contact with the borrowers. HOLC would try to find jobs for unemployed homeowners and suggested renting out spare bedrooms. Beginning in 1937, it rewrote loans to make them more affordable. Of the one million loans HOLC issued, it acquired 200,000 homes from borrowers who were unable to pay their mortgages; the national foreclosure rate was 19.4%, but there was wide variation in different states. New York and Massachusetts had foreclosure rates of more than 40%, but foreclosure rates in Michigan, West Virginia, Florida, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, Nevada, and Oregon were less than 10%. HOLC set the price on the foreclosed homes, included financing, and worked with local real estate agents. At its peak, HOLC had 20,000 employees in 458 offices where applications were accepted.", "Although there were provisions to purchase mortgages held at troubled banks, HOLC was designed to work with homeowners. Based on the appraised value, the amount of the new mortgage could be less than the original mortgage, and the lender could take a loss on the mortgage.

Not every distressed borrower was willing or able to meet the terms of the assistance effort. It is probably unrealistic to expect that any plan could keep all subprime borrowers in their homes. For example, some borrowers will become unemployed and not have the income to make even reduced mortgage payments. Even a moratorium on foreclosures would prevent loss of homes only while the moratorium lasts.", "The HOLC experience was that some of those who could be helped would not contact the HOLC. It was necessary for HOLC to reach out to borrowers who became delinquent and to develop personalized plans to modify the mortgage so that it could be repaid eventually.

HOPE NOW, also, is dividing callers into three categories trying to work quickly with the easiest situations first so that those who require more extensive help can get the resources needed.", "Economists use the phrase \"moral hazard\" to represent the change in behavior due to insuring risks. Purchasing insurance probably makes some individuals more likely to take risks than would be prudent without the financial safety net. Economists who worry about moral hazard are concerned that a government intervention in a market outcome also encourages individuals and companies to pay less attention to risk in the future in the expectation that the government will intervene again. They worry that in the case of a government intervention to help homeowners, the possibility of a repeat of the intervention could encourage some lenders to lend more than they would, absent the history of government action.
