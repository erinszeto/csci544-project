In particular, factor (2) seems to be driving the results, and the various measures of factor (1) have a negligible effect, a finding that the authors tend to neglect. Since the Federal Reserve cannot directly finance the U.S. government, factor (2) is not an issue for Congress. However, the results obtained with an index embodying (3) are of relevance to the conduct of monetary policy in the United States. These results may be used to support efforts to redefine the objective of monetary policy to focus it exclusively on price stability.", "Critics of these studies point to three major methodological problems and one empirical problem. First, causation may be opposite to that posited. The desire for economic stability, for example, may lead to independent central banks. Thus, causation should run the other way around (or it may run in both directions). Second, central bank independence may arise because an important and influential constituency in a democratic society favors low inflation. Thus, the ultimate reason why inflation is low in some countries is the strength of important constituencies who favor low inflation. And these studies fail to measure this pressure. In a sense, they have captured only the proximate reason for low inflation, not the ultimate reason. Third, questions have been raised about the way that the authors transform non-numeric characteristics of independence into quantitative results. Finally, the data on which some of these empirical estimates are based are tainted in the sense that the samples commingle observations from the fixed and flexible exchange rate periods.

Monetary policy and the institutional arrangements for carrying it out have long been regarded as important to achieving this goal. Such has been the importance accorded money in this respect, that numerous monetary arrangements and policies have been proposed which, if adopted, their proponents argue, would make such a goal attainable. These arrangements include the gold standard, the real bills doctrine, a compensated dollar, 100% reserve requirement banking, a fixed growth rate rule for the money supply, a bimetallic standard, a currency board, free floating exchange rates and inflation targeting, to name but a few in what Professor Stanley Fischer has called \"the unending search for monetary salvation.\" The current policy prescription in fashion among economists that promises to promote such a goal is termed central bank independence (hereafter CBI) which, although it has several possible definitions, has come increasingly to focus on institutional arrangements, as well as the central bank's \"mandate and ability to focus single mindedly on the attainment of price stability.\"", "The high inflation in the western world in general during the 1970s, and the difference in the inflation experience of individual industrial countries which were, on the whole, subjected to similar external economic shocks, motivated some economists to investigate the possible linkage between the rate of inflation and the institutional and political arrangements governing the establishment and functioning of central banks. A major conclusion of these studies is that CBI is an important part of the explanation for why some countries have had much lower inflation rates on average than others. The more \"independent\" the central bank, these studies conclude, the lower tend to be the average rate of inflation and volatility of inflation experienced by that country. The reason for these results is that independence supposedly enhances the credibility of the central bank and increased credibility gives rise to reinforcing behavior via the expectations of economic agents, be they consumers, suppliers of labor and capital, or firms supplying output. Thus, shifts in central bank policy are transmitted more rapidly into changes in wages, interest rates, and prices and, thus, output and employment, than would be the case in the absence of strong credibility. A minority of the studies even claims that the better governance, lower inflation, and greater macroeconomic stability provided by CBI have a positive effect on economic growth.", "Some newer studies question the methodology underlying these results, and claim that the relationship between inflation and CBI is weaker than the early studies found. The evidence is mixed on whether central bank independence has a cost in terms of lower output growth or greater output variability.", "These empirical studies have not gone unnoticed by policy makers. In some ways, the Federal Reserve is more independent than many of its peers. In other ways, it is less. For example, some studies have defined a price stability goal as enhancing independence, and there has been periodic congressional interest in giving the Fed such a goal .

An inflationary bias on the part of CBs was attributed either to a requirement that they provide government with revenue (via the inflation tax) or to a desire on the part of the government to reduce unemployment through a monetary surprise or unanticipated shock. Since the United States government derives very little revenue from the inflation tax, any inflation bias on the part of the Federal Reserve must be attributed to a desire by the government to reduce unemployment.", "It is widely believed that a short run tradeoff exists between inflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips curve. The ability of monetary policy to reduce unemployment in the short run is a well known fact amply demonstrated in the United States and elsewhere. It is generally attributed by economists to the shift in policy being a surprise or unexpected event, since anticipated monetary changes would have been incorporated into wage and price expectations. Since it is also widely believed by economists that the employment effects of such monetary surprises are only temporary, their longer run consequence is a higher inflation rate. Hence, central banks that try to exploit the tradeoff described by the Phillips curve, for whatever reason, will impart an inflationary bias to their national economies. From an economic point of view, cycles produced by monetary surprises are suboptimal and this serves to underpin policy designed to create and fortify bank central independence devoted to stability.

By imposing a strict and measurable goal on the central bank, the government restricts the CB's latitude to shape monetary policy as it sees fit.

The rest of the literature (with the exception of DF) argues that a price stability goal enhances independence by giving the CBs an institutional buffer against political interference in pursuit of \"monetary surprises.\" Nevertheless, the definition of a price stability goal as an aspect of political independence is well-established and consistently used in the CBI literature and will be adhered to in this report.", "Because of their disagreement with GMT, DF create their own CBI index consisting of three parts.

They describe instrument independence as meaning that the CB can achieve its ultimate goal or goals in any way it chooses, whether the government or the CB has assigned those goals. Thus, for example, it could exercise discretion in how rapidly the money supply was permitted to grow or it could fix interest rates at whatever level it thought was necessary. It would not be obliged to finance the government (a common constraint on many central banks), follow a fixed rule for increasing the money supply, keep interest rates low, or maintain a fixed exchange rate. They use GMT's economic independence index, excluding factors related to the CB regulatory duties, as their measure of instrument independence. Curiously, this measure of instrument independence relates to only two of the factors they mention: the CB's freedom to set interest rates and the absence of a requirement that the CB finance the government's budget deficit.", "While goal and instrument independence (as well as political and economic independence) are conceptually distinct, there are circumstances in which if one is mandated the other is mandated as well. One could not, for example, impose a goal of price stability on a CB while simultaneously imposing on it a requirement to finance a government budget deficit.

It is interesting in this respect that the GMT results show that neither economic nor political independence is statistically significant in explaining the inflation performance of the 16 countries in their sample during the decades 1950-1959 and 1960-1969. This is what one might reasonably expect during the fixed exchange rate era.", "Contrary to the conclusion of the authors, the results for 1970-1979 and 1980-1989 suggest that the inflation performance of these countries is not so much related to the policy goal and methods of choosing CB governors and their terms of office (their measure of political independence) as it is to the requirement that the CB not be used to finance the government's budget deficit, their measure of economic independence. The political independence variable is not statistically significant for the 1980-1989 period and is only weakly significant for the 1970-1979 period. Thus, regardless of the CB's degree of political independence, countries that maintain reasonable budget balance or have good prospects of financing their budget deficits from private saving, may remove the pressures from their CBs, making it possible for the CBs to concentrate monetary policy on achieving low inflation.", "One aspect of the GMT inflation-CB independence results is of interest.

If the degree of central bank independence is the ultimate cause of inflation, these regressions are able to explain a great deal. The evidence adduced by some other investigators reported below is not this strong.", "A final aspect of their work that has attracted attention is that central bank independence has no adverse effects on the crucial performance parameters of the economy.

In the bivariate regression, the R 2 is only .016, meaning that over 98% of the variation in the data cannot be explained by CBI. Using the AS countries and definitions, Fuhrer replicates AS's findings that in a bivariate regression the CBI-inflation relationship is statistically significant, albeit with an R 2 of only .084. However, Fuhrer demonstrates that when controlling for other macroeconomic factors, the CBI-inflation relationship becomes statistically insignificant and the R 2 becomes very high. In some regressions, the sign on the CBI variable is positive, suggesting that great CBI increases inflation.

Credibility is presumed to have beneficial effects on a country's macroeconomic performance. Specifically, it is often assumed that greater credibility will make disinflationary episodes (periods when the central needs to tighten policy to lower the inflation rate) have less of a negative effect on the economy. But Posen argues that central bank independence has two countervailing effects on the costs of disinflation. First, there is the usual effect chronicled above: greater central bank credibility leads to individuals adjusting their inflationary expectations more quickly to a change in monetary policy. When prices adjust more quickly, disinflation becomes less costly: tighter money supply leads to a smaller decline in output. But Posen argues that there is a second effect working against the first: if individuals believe that CBI makes variable inflation less likely, they would be more willing to use nominal contracts to set wages and prices. As the use of contracts becomes more prevalent, prices and wages are less able to adjust. In essence, people worry less about inflation when it is low, and so expectations adjust more slowly. This would make a disinflation more costly because output must fall more to make prices adjust. Because of these countervailing effects, he argues, it is not evident whether greater credibility improves macroeconomic performance.", "Posen uses a series of regressions to explore these questions. He defines CBI by the Cukierman-Webb-Neyapti index and his observations are based on 17 OECD countries from 1950 to 1989, with one observation for each decade. First, he tests the hypothesis that CBI makes disinflations less costly. He attempts to separate the two countervailing effects by adding a separate variable for nominal wage rigidity. The CBI variable is highly statistically significant, but it has the wrong sign: increasing CBI makes disinflation much more costly in terms of higher unemployment. However, few other variables are controlled for and the adjusted R 2 tend to be moderate, ranging from 0.249 to 0.517.", "Posen then tests the hypothesis that CBI makes nominal wages more rigid. The results tend not to be statistically significant and have low and even negative adjusted R 2 s. Moreover, the sign of the CBI variable is not consistent across different specifications: in some cases, CBI increases wage rigidity, in other cases it decreases rigidity. A major problem with these tests, as Posen concedes, is that there is no consensus around a straightforward method for measuring nominal wage rigidity, and competing measures are not closely correlated to each other. But the inconclusive evidence that CBI increases nominal wage rigidity actually strengthens the case for CBI, since it suggests that the fear that greater CBI would make disinflation more costly is not a strong enough factor to be measurable.", "Posen also empirically tests whether greater CBI makes disinflations faster because expectations adjust more quickly when central banks are more credible.

Thus, for example, a fear of inflation can lead countries to establish and maintain very independent central banks and forbid them to directly or indirectly lend to government. To be more specific, as Walsh points out, \"high inflation, if viewed as an indication of failed central bank policy, might lead to the replacement of the central banker\u2014in this case high CEO turnover is not necessarily a reflection of low CB independence causing inflation.\"", "Alternatively, a desire for economic stability can also cause political institutions to emerge and evolve in ways that ensure such an outcome. In this case, CB independence can be thought of as being correlated with an omitted variable, \"responsible governance,\" that is the true cause of low inflation. If this is the case, governments who lack \"responsibility\" could make their central banks statutorily independent and still not achieve low inflation. For example, Posen theorizes that what matters most in achieving low inflation is effective support by an important constituency, such as the financial sector. One of the policy changes such a constituency might demand to achieve low inflation is central bank independence, attributing spurious causation to CBI.", "Thus, a general methodological criticism directed against all of these studies is that they have not demonstrated convincingly that causation runs in the direction they have hypothesized.

The studies all define independence by ranking the central banks on the basis of a number of legal characteristics. CBs that possess more of these characteristics are ranked as more independent. He argues that the studies arbitrarily look for legal characteristics of central banks that all low inflation countries happen to share. There is no a priori attempt to define which characteristics are necessary for independence and which characteristics are more important than others. He argues that the studies have tended to arbitrarily assume that characteristics uncorrelated to inflation are not important for independence, and vice versa, making the studies self-fulfilling prophecies of the hypothesis that independence reduces inflation. For example, it is not clear that a price stability goal should be defined as independence since it limits the CB's discretion, but since it is correlated with low inflation, it bolsters the findings that independence matters. He points out that\u2014besides Germany and Switzerland\u2014there is no consensus among the different studies as to which countries have an independent central bank. If different studies cannot agree on what makes a CB independent, how can the studies prove that independence leads to low inflation?", "The strong relationship between independence and low inflation in Germany and Switzerland, and the absence of a strong relationship elsewhere, raises the question of whether there is some other factor that caused low inflation in those two countries. In fact, both countries had a long series of nearly balanced budgets during the period 1950s-1980s, removing a source of upward pressure on interest rates. Bernanke et al. offer another explanation: both countries targeted the growth rate of the money supply well before other countries had adopted restrictive mandates such as a sole goal of price stability. Either of these factors, rather than independence, could be the true cause of their low inflation.", "Nor is there any attempt in many of the studies to evaluate whether the statutory independence granted to the banks is maintained in reality. For example, two different countries could grant their banks the same statutory autonomy from the elected government, but in practice one government could pressure the CB from behind the scenes to influence policy while the other respected its independence. In these studies, the two central banks would be ranked equally independent. Cukierman and Webb try to get around this problem by looking at the turnover rate of the CB CEO and survey evidence, but the results from this study are inconclusive. Survey evidence about specialists' perceptions of a central bank's independence have almost no correlation to CWN's legal definition of independence. This indicates that legal measures of statutory independence may be misleading."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Econometric Shortcomings", "paragraphs": ["Finally, the studies could be questioned on econometric grounds. The studies assign numerical values to non-numerical legal characteristics. For example, for the question of how the chairman of the CB is appointed, CWN assign a value of 1 if appointed by the board of the central bank, 0.75 if appointed by the board, legislature, and executive, 0.5 if appointed by the legislature, 0.25 if appointed by the executive collectively, and 0 if appointed by one or two members of the executive. The studies then use the ordinary least squares method to regress those numerical values on inflation to test for correlation. The econometric problem with this method is that the numerical values may not be proportionately related. For example, for a regression to be econometrically valid, a central bank that receives a grade of 2 should be twice as independent as a bank that receives a grade of 1, and have twice the estimated effect on inflation. But since the values are based on non-numeric characteristics, there is no way of knowing whether it is reasonable to assume that a a CB with a grade of 2 would have twice the effect on inflation as a CB with a grade of 1. The weighting of the various characteristics will also be important in the regression results. It may be that only a couple of characteristics really define independence. If those factors are equally weighed with all characteristics, the index will not reflect true independence and the regression results will be biased.", "Furthermore, there are econometric problems with the sample itself. If limited to advanced economies, then the sample will be small and homogeneous, and thus may not offer enough variation in terms of CBI and economic outcomes to yield meaningful regression results.

Much of the evidence is tainted because it is obtained from an analysis that commingles data from fixed and flexible exchange rate periods.

The fixed exchange rate regime was in existence from 1950 through the early 1970s, whilst subsequent years would have been in the flexible rate period. Under a fixed rate regime, central bank independence, as measured by BP and others, doesn't really mean much. Regardless of whether the central bank is directed to maintain a low inflation rate or a constant price level, it must, above all else, maintain a fixed exchange rate. So long as this goal has primacy, it is of little importance how its price level directive is framed. Under a flexible rate regime, an inflation goal can be pursued without the constraint of the exchange rate requirement. For the same reason, evidence obtained from European countries that fixed their exchange rate to the Deutschmark in recent decades should be discounted.
