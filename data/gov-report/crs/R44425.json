Standard P lan refers to the second-lowest-cost silver plan (see text box in \" Eligibility \" section of this report) in the person's (or family's) local area. Required Premium Contribution refers to the amount that a premium credit-eligible individual (or family) may pay toward the exchange premium. The required premium contribution is capped according to household income, with such income measured relative to FPL (see Table 1 ). The cap requires lower-income individuals to contribute a smaller share of income toward the monthly premium, compared with the requirement for higher-income individuals (see Figure 1 ). ", "The Premium Tax Credit is the difference between the premium and the required contribution. Given that the premium and required contribution vary from person to person, the premium credit amount likewise varies greatly. An extreme example is when the premium for the standard plan is very low, the tax credit may cover the entire premium and the individual may pay nothing toward the premium. The opposite extreme scenario, for some higher-income individuals, is when the required contribution exceeds the premium amount, leading to a credit of zero dollars, meaning the individual (or family) would pay the entire premium amount.", "To illustrate the premium credit calculation for 2018, consider a premium credit recipient living in Lebanon, KS\u2014the geographic center of the continental United States\u2014with household income of $18,090 (150% FPL, according to premium credit regulations). Such an individual would be required to contribute 4.03% of that income toward the premium for the standard plan in his or her local area (see Figure 1 ). In other words, the maximum amount that this person would pay for the year toward the standard plan is approximately $729 (that is, $18,090 \u00d7 4.03%), or around $61 per month.

For instance, consider a couple and one child residing in Lebanon, KS, who are eligible for premium tax credits with household income of $30,630 in 2018. For a family of this size, this income is equivalent to 150% FPL for premium credit purposes. Just as in the example above of the individual with income at 150% FPL, this family would be required to contribute 4.03% of its annual income toward the premium for the standard plan in its local area.

Therefore, the amount of the monthly premium credit this individual would receive would be the difference between that premium and his or her required premium contribution, or $421 - $61 = $360. In other words, a 21-year-old resident of Lebanon, KS, with annual household income at 150% FPL who is enrolled in the standard plan that costs $421 per month would contribute $61 toward the monthly premium and receive a monthly credit of $360.

The difference between these two hypothetical calculations is the amount of the credit. In the case of the 60-year-old individual, the amount of the monthly premium credit would be $1,082 (the arithmetic difference between the premium and the required premium contribution).

After holding that the House has standing to sue the Obama Administration, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia concluded that the payment of the cost-sharing subsidies was unconstitutional for lack of a valid appropriation enacted by Congress.

For 2018, the annual cost-sharing limit for self-only coverage is $7,350; the corresponding limit for family coverage is $14,700.

In general, this cost-sharing assistance targets individuals and families that use a great deal of health care in a year and, therefore, have high cost-sharing expenses. Enrollees who use very little health care may not generate enough cost-sharing expenses to reach the annual limit. ", "For example, consider the hypothetical individual who resides in Lebanon, KS, and has household income at 150% FPL (as discussed in the \" Premium Tax Credit Examples \" section of this report). A person eligible to receive cost-sharing subsidies would face an annual cost-sharing limit of $2,450. The practical effect of this reduction would occur when this individual spent up to that amount. For additional covered services received by the individual, the insurance company would pay the entire cost. Therefore, by reducing the annual cost-sharing limit, eligible individuals are required to spend less before benefitting from this financial assistance.

For eligible individuals, the cost-sharing requirements (for the plans in which they have enrolled) are reduced to ensure that the plans cover a certain percentage of allowed health care expenses, on average. The practical effect of this cost-sharing subsidy is to increase the actuarial value (AV) of the exchange plan in which the person is enrolled ( Table 6 ), so enrollees face lower cost-sharing requirements than they would have without this assistance. Given that this type of cost-sharing subsidy directly affects cost-sharing requirements (e.g., lowers a deductible), both enrollees who use minimal health care and those who use a great deal of services may benefit from this assistance. ", "To be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies, an individual must be enrolled in a silver plan, which already has an AV of 70% (see text box above, \"Actuarial Value and Metal Plans\"). For an individual who receives the subsidy referred to in Table 6 , the health plan will impose different cost-sharing requirements so that the silver plan will meet the applicable increased AV. The ACA does not specify how a plan should reduce cost-sharing requirements to increase the AV from 70% to one of the higher AVs. Through regulations, HHS requires each insurance company that offers a plan subject to these cost-sharing subsidies to develop variations of its silver plan; these silver plan variations must comply with the higher levels of actuarial value (73%, 87%, and 94%). When an individual is determined by an exchange to be eligible for a cost-sharing subsidy, the person is enrolled in the silver plan variation that corresponds with his or her income. ", "Consider the same hypothetical individual discussed in the previous section. Since this person's income is at 150% FPL, if he or she receives this type of subsidy, the silver plan in which he or she is enrolled will have an AV of 94% (as indicated in Table 6 ), instead of the usual 70% AV for silver plans. This marked change in AV entails notable reductions in cost-sharing requirements. For example, the annual medical deductible of the standard plan in the local area for this hypothetical individual is $3,000 in 2018. However, the plan variation with a 94% AV has a deductible of $250. The practical effect for this hypothetical person is that he or she would have to spend $250, instead of $3,000, before the insurer would begin to pay for medical claims associated with that person's use of covered services.
