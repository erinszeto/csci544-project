Under current law, certain lower-skilled foreign workers, sometimes referred to as guest workers, may be admitted to the United States to perform temporary service or labor under two temporary worker visas: the H-2A visa for agricultural workers and the H-2B visa for nonagricultural workers. Both programs are administered by the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS/USCIS) and the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (DOL/ETA).", "The H-2A and H-2B programs\u2014and guest worker programs broadly\u2014strive both to be responsive to legitimate employer needs for labor and to provide adequate protections for U.S. and foreign temporary workers. There is much debate, however, about how to strike the appropriate balance between these twin goals. Under the George W. Bush Administration, both DHS and DOL issued regulations to streamline the H-2A and H-2B programs. The Obama Administration retained the DHS rules, but rewrote the DOL rules. Arguing that the latter provided inadequate protections for workers, it issued a new DOL final rule on H-2A employment, which became effective in March 2010. The Obama Administration also issued a new DOL final rule on H-2B employment in 2012 and a DOL final rule on H-2B wage rates in 2011, but neither of these rules is currently in effect.", "Bringing workers into the United States under either the H-2A program or H-2B program is a multi-agency process involving DOL, DHS, and the Department of State. As an initial step in the process, employers must apply for DOL labor certification to ensure that U.S. workers are not available for the jobs in question and that the hiring of foreign workers will not adversely affect U.S. workers. The labor certification process has long been criticized as ineffective, with employers complaining that it is burdensome and unresponsive to their labor needs and labor advocates arguing that it provides too few protections for workers.", "The H-2A program and foreign agricultural workers in general have been a focus of congressional attention in recent Congresses. Proposals have been introduced as recently as in the 112th Congress that would have amended current law on the H-2A visa, while others would have established new temporary agricultural worker programs as alternatives to the H-2A program. Still other proposals would have coupled a legalization program for agricultural workers with either H-2A or other agricultural labor-related reform. DOL's recent rules on H-2B employment and wages also have been subjects of congressional interest.", "Guest worker proposals may contain provisions on a range of component policy issues. Key policy considerations include the labor market test to determine whether U.S. workers are available for the positions, wages, and enforcement. The issue of adjustment of status, which means the change to legal permanent resident (LPR) status in the United States, may also arise in connection with guest worker programs.", "While the discussion of current guest worker programs in this report focuses on the H-2A and H-2B visas, it also covers the Summer Work Travel (SWT) program, the largest of several programs under the J-1 visa for participants in work- and study-based exchange visitor programs.

A threshold question about importing temporary lower-skilled workers, sometimes referred to as guest workers, is whether U.S. employers need foreign workers for lower-skilled positions, or whether there is a sufficient number of available U.S. workers who could fill these jobs. This question gains salience in times of high U.S. unemployment. The issue of whether U.S. employers need foreign workers is often stated in terms of whether there are domestic labor shortages in particular industries and occupations. Questions about the existence of labor shortages are difficult to answer definitively because of various factors. ", "The issue of labor shortages in seasonal agriculture, in particular, has been a longstanding concern and is receiving renewed attention. The farm labor shortage issue, however, is surrounded by many unanswered questions, including the following: Would more U.S. workers be willing to become farm workers if wages were raised and the terms of work were changed? If so, would such wage and other changes make the U.S. agricultural industry uncompetitive in the world marketplace? Alternatively, would there be an adequate supply of authorized U.S. farm workers if new technologies were developed and implemented?", "In the past, guest workers have been imported to address U.S. worker shortages during times of war. During World War I, for example, tens of thousands of Mexican workers performed mainly agricultural labor as part of a temporary worker program. The controversial Bracero program, which began during World War II and lasted until 1964, brought several million Mexican agricultural workers into the United States. At its peak in the late 1950s, the Bracero program employed more than 400,000 Mexican workers annually. Today, the United States imports guest workers in much smaller numbers to perform temporary agricultural and nonagricultural labor. In current guest worker programs, issues of need for foreign workers are addressed on an individual basis through a process of labor certification. ", "Guest worker programs remain controversial. Some view them as a necessary source of legal workers and call for their reform and expansion. Others view them, in their current form, as \"inherently abusive\" and argue that if they are to be allowed to continue operating, they must be thoroughly overhauled.", "This report discusses existing visa programs for temporary lower-skilled workers, including regulatory changes since 2008.

After receiving labor certification, a prospective H-2A or H-2B employer can submit an application, known as a petition, to DHS to bring in foreign workers. If the application is approved, foreign workers who are abroad can then go to a U.S. embassy or consulate to apply for an H-2A or H-2B nonimmigrant visa from the Department of State (DOS). If the visa application is approved, the worker is issued a visa that he or she can use to apply for admission to the United States at a port of entry.", "In both the H-2A and H-2B programs, there is a tension between providing protections to U.S. and foreign workers on the one hand and making the programs responsive to legitimate employer needs on the other.

The fifty-percent rule requires an H-2A employer to hire any qualified U.S. worker who applies for a position until 50% of the period of the work contract under which the H-2A workers are employed has elapsed. The 2008 rule took initial steps to phase out this requirement.", "H-2B Regulations: DHS", "DHS's 2008 rule on the H-2B visa revised prior regulations in various ways. It changed the definition of temporary employment for H-2B purposes to require the prospective H-2B employer to establish that his or her need for the worker would end in the \"near, definable future.\" While the 2008 rule stated, as did the prior regulation, that the employer's need will generally be for a period of one year or less, it also provided that in the case of a one-time occurrence, the employer's need could last up to three years. The DOL final rule discussed above further clarified that except in the case of a one-time occurrence, an H-2B labor certification application based on an employer's need lasting more than 10 months would be denied, absent unusual circumstances.", "DHS's 2008 H-2B rule further amended prior regulations to require that an employer have an approved labor certification before the employer could submit a petition for H-2B workers. Previously, an employer whose H-2B labor certification application was denied by DOL could submit an H-2B petition to DHS containing countervailing evidence. In response to this new requirement for an approved certification, DOL established an appeals process in cases of H-2B labor certification denials. ", "Other changes to DHS's H-2B regulations mirrored changes to its H-2A regulations. The H-2B rule, like the H-2A rule, reduced from six months to three months the amount of time that a worker who had spent three years in the United States had to remain outside the country before he or she could again be granted H-2B status. The DHS H-2B rule instituted a prohibition on payments by prospective H-2B workers to employers, recruiters, or other employment service providers where the payments are a condition of obtaining H-2B employment. DHS's H-2B rule also limited participation in the H-2B program to nationals of countries to be designated annually by DHS, with the concurrence of DOS. ", "H-2B Regulations: DOL", "The 2012 rule discussed here is not in effect, as described above. The H-2B program is currently operating under the 2008 DOL final rule issued by the Bush Administration.", "The 2012 DOL rule reversed changes made to the H-2B labor certification process under the 2008 rule and reinstituted a certification-based model. It also bifurcated the labor certification application process into distinct registration and application phases and revised application timetables. ", "Under the 2012 final rule, DOL must assess an employer's temporary need for H-2B workers in the registration phase. A prospective H-2B employer is required to submit an H-2B registration 120 days to 150 days before the initial date of need for workers and must receive registration approval before filing a labor certification application. A registration approval could be valid for up to three years. ", "The labor market test is administered by DOL in the subsequent application phase to determine whether U.S. workers are available to fill the job opportunities. Under the 2008 rule, DOL made simultaneous determinations on temporary need and the labor market test. Under the 2012 rule, the employer must file the labor certification application and the job order 75 to 90 days before the date of need. The SWA is required to keep the job order open and continue referring U.S. workers for the job opportunity until 21 days before the date of the employer's need. Under the 2008 rule, the SWA had to keep the job order open for at least 10 days. ", "Under the 2012 DOL H-2B rule, the electronic job registry that was created for posting H-2A job orders was expanded to include H-2B job orders. Under the rule, once DOL accepts the labor certification application, the job order is posted on the online registry.", "The 2012 final rule made a variety of other changes to the H-2B labor certification process. The 2008 regulations provided that, except in cases of a one-time occurrence, labor certification applications with a period of employer need of more than 10 months would generally be denied. In the 2012 final rule, DOL shortened this maximum period to nine months, maintaining that this new maximum \"definitively establishes the temporariness of the position, as there is an entire season in which there is simply no need for the worker(s).\" Along similar lines, the 2012 rule limited the participation of job contractors in the H-2B program to cases in which they can demonstrate their own temporary need for workers, not that of their employer-clients.", "In addition, the 2012 rule required employers to provide workers engaged in corresponding employment with at least the same protections, wages, and benefits as those provided to H-2B workers. Corresponding employment, as defined under the rule, included, with some exceptions, employment of non-H-2B workers performing substantially the same work included in the job order or substantially the same work performed by H-2B workers. Under the 2008 regulations, this \"equal treatment\" requirement was limited to workers hired in connection with an H-2B labor certification application during the prescribed recruitment period. Furthermore, the 2012 final rule required employers to pay or reimburse workers for transportation and visa costs, and to offer a three-fourths guarantee similar to that under the H-2A program, in which H-2B employers must guarantee payment of wages for at least three-fourths of the contract period.", "Appendix E. H-2B Wage Requirements", "DOL H-2B Wage Rule Chronology ", "On October 5, 2010, DOL issued proposed regulations to change the methodology for determining the prevailing wage for H-2B workers. DOL issued a final rule on January 19, 2011. The effective date of the final rule was January 1, 2012. ", "A court ruling invalidated the January 1, 2012, effective date. Therefore, on June 28, 2011, DOL issued a proposed rule to change the effective date of the new wage methodology. On August 1, 2011, DOL issued a final rule setting September 30, 2011, as the effective date for the new wage methodology. ", "In response to two lawsuits that sought to prevent the implementation of the new wage methodology, DOL announced on September 28, 2011, that it was postponing the effective date of the new wage rule for 60 days, until November 30, 2011. ", "On November 18, 2011, the President signed H.R. 2112 , the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-55 ). The bill stated that DOL could not use funds appropriated by the act to \"implement, administer, or enforce\" the new wage methodology before January 1, 2012. The bill did not prevent the new wage methodology from going into effect as planned on November 30. DOL determined, however, that if the new wage methodology went into effect, it would not be able to issue wage determinations. Accordingly, the department delayed the effective date of the new methodology until January 1, 2012. ", "On December 23, 2011, the President signed H.R. 2055 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ). The act prevented DOL from using funds provided by the act \"to implement\" the new wage methodology for the remainder of FY2012. In response, DOL announced that it was postponing the effective date of the new wage methodology until October 1, 2012.", "On September 28, 2012, the President signed H.J.Res. 117 , the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 ( P.L. 112-175 ). The act prohibits DOL from using funds to implement the new wage methodology until March 27, 2013. In response, DOL announced that it was postponing the effective date of the new wage methodology until March 27, 2013.", "Comparison of Wage Methodology Under Current and New DOL\u00a0Regulations", " Table E -1 compares the wage methodology under the current and new regulations for determining the prevailing wage for H-2B workers. The last column of the table identifies some of the changes that may affect the wages of H-2B workers. ", "Wage Rates Under Current Methodology ", "Under current regulations, DOL uses data from its Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey to provide four wage rates based on the level of education, experience, and supervision that the employer requires for the job. These four skill levels are labeled Level I, II, III, and IV. The Level I and IV wage levels (hourly and annual) are estimated by DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) directly from OES wage data. The Level I wage is the average wage for the bottom third of the earnings distribution. The Level IV wage is the average of the top two-thirds of the earnings distribution. The Level II and Level III wages are calculated from the Level I and IV wages.", "To illustrate the four wage levels, assume that the Level I and Level IV hourly wages estimated from OES wage data are $10.00 and $22.00, respectively. The difference between the Level IV and Level I wage is $12.00. Dividing this difference by three and adding the result to the Level I wage yields a Level II wage of $14.00 (i.e., $12.00 \u00f7 3 = $4.00. $10.00 + $4.00 = $14.00). Subtracting the result from the Level IV wage yields a Level III wage of $18.00 (i.e., $22.00 - $4.00 = $18.00). "], "subsections": []}]}}
