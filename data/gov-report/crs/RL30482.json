The Department of Education (ED) administers SDFSCA through the SDFSC program, which is the federal government's major initiative to prevent drug abuse and violence in and around schools. State grants are awarded by formula to outlying areas, state educational agencies, and local educational agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Also, funds go to state Governors for creating programs to deter youth from using drugs and committing violent acts in schools.

Also, in 2004, 12- to-18-year-old students were victims of about 1.4 million nonfatal crimes at school.

There was little change in MDMA (ecstasy) use among 8th and 10th graders, but a very small increase in annual use among 12th graders. Marijuana use continued to decline among 10th and 12th graders, but stopped declining among 8th graders. After decreasing slightly in recent years among all grades, crack cocaine use showed a further decline among 10th graders. OxyContin use increased among 8th and 10th graders, but declined among 12th graders. Vicodin use slightly increased among all three grades. Alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and smokeless tobacco use declined only among 12th graders who had used the product 30 days prior to the survey.

In response to the growing concern about crack cocaine and drug abuse in general, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. In 1994, this legislation was expanded (as discussed below) to include violence occurring in and around schools. GAO stated that in 1994, about 3 million violent crimes and thefts occurred annually in or near schools, which equaled almost 16,000 incidents per school day. The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) indicated that in the 1993-1994 school year, violence in public schools was on the rise and schools appeared less safe than in the 1987-1988 school year. From the 1987-1988 school year to the 1993-1994 school year, an increasing percentage of public elementary and secondary school teachers reported that physical conflict and weapon possession among students were moderate to serious problems in schools. Similarly, between 1992 and 1995, drug use rates among school-aged youth increased for over 10 different drugs, particularly marijuana, after declining in the 1980s.", "To address those concerns, on October 20, 1994, President Clinton signed into law the Improving America's School Act ( P.L. 103-382 ), which reauthorized ESEA, and created SDFSCA as Title IV. The 1994 legislation extended, amended, and renamed the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-297 , DFSCA). Violence prevention was added to DFSCA's original drug abuse-prevention purpose by incorporating the Safe Schools Act. Consequently, SDFSCA was intended to help deter violence and promote school safety as well as discourage drug use in and around the nation's schools. Funding was authorized for federal, state, and local programs to assist schools in providing a disciplined learning environment free of violence and drug use, including alcohol and tobacco.", "This report provides background information about the school safety and drug abuse issues, presents a detailed overview of the various aspects of the SDFSC program as it exists under current law, and discusses an evaluation of the SDFSC program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "School Safety", "paragraphs": ["Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2006 ( Indicators Study ), a joint publication by ED and DOJ, provides the most recent federal data on school crime and student safety.

Also, the report found that in 2005, as in both 1999 and 2001, students were more likely to be afraid of being harmed at school than while away from school. In 2005, as grade levels increased, it was found that the percentage of students who reported fearing an attack at school or on the way to or from school declined.", "The study revealed that feelings regarding safety at school depended on the racial and/or ethnic group, grade level, and school location of the students. In 2005, larger percentages of black and Hispanic students feared attack or harm at school, or on the way to and from school, than white students, regardless of location. Furthermore, students in lower grades generally were more fearful of harm at school, en route to or from school, or away from school, than students in higher grades. Students in urban schools were more likely than those in suburban or rural schools to fear attack both at school or on the way to and from school. Similarly, students in public schools were more fearful of harm than those in private schools.", "In 2005, 11% of 12- to 18-year-old students revealed that someone at school used hate-related words against them (that is, a derogatory word having to do with race, religion, ethnicity, disability, gender, or sexual orientation). Also, 38% of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school (that is, such words or symbols written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on the outside of the school building). In 2005, females were more likely to report gender-related hate words than males, while males were more likely than female students to report hate words related to both race and ethnicity. Blacks, Hispanics, and students of other races were more likely to report race-related hate words than white students.

Also, in 2003-04, teachers were less likely to report being physically attacked than in 1993-94. Between 1993-94 and 2003-04, teachers in central city schools were more likely to be threatened with injury or physically attacked than those who worked in urban fringe areas or in rural schools. Furthermore, in 2003-04, a larger percentage of male teachers than female teachers reported being threatened with injury, while female teachers were more likely to have been physically attacked than their male counterparts.

For that seven-year period, 209 school-related violent deaths occurred involving either a homicide or a suicide of a student. An average of 0.14 school-related homicide incidents occurred each school day, which translated to one homicide every seven school days. Homicide rates usually were highest near the beginning of the fall and spring semesters and then declined over the subsequent months. An average of 0.03 suicide incidents occurred each school day, which was one suicide every 31 school days. The overall suicide rates were higher during the spring semester than in the fall semester, but did not vary significantly within semesters.", "The CDC researchers believe that these findings could be useful for school personnel in planning and implementing school violence prevention programs. They point out possible explanations for why high school-related homicide rates were highest at the beginning of each semester. One suggested explanation is that conflicts that began either before or during the semester or holiday break might have escalated into deadly violence when students returned to school for the start of a new semester. Another suggestion was that the beginning of a new semester represented a time of considerable change and stress for students when they have to adapt to new schedules, teachers, and classmates. Such stressors might contribute to violent behavior. For these reasons, they propose that schools should consider policies and programs that might ease student adjustment during the transitional periods.", "The researchers warn that the results of the study should be interpreted with caution because incidents were identified from news media reports. Therefore, any such event that was not reported in the news media would not have been included in the study.

CCSVC investigated both lethal school violence, which were incidents involving more than one victim (their core operational definition for most of their work), and \"school rampages,\" which included \"cases in which more than one person was injured, and there was a significant potential for lethal violence as well as those in which people were actually killed.\" The committee observed that the numbers of lethal school violence and school rampage incidents were very small, and that the increase in such incidents in the 1990s might be explained in part by media reporting. CCSVC believed that although such school rampages would have been newsworthy during the earlier period, the media might have been more sensitized to the school shootings issue in the late 1990s and began covering them more diligently than previously. CCSVC concluded that if this was the case, then the increase might partly be explained as the result of more news accounts of such incidents rather than an increase in the basic rate of those events. CCSVC collected data from an assemblage of newspaper accounts (of school-associated violent deaths and injuries) produced and gathered by the National School Safety Center between 1992 and 2001.

The definition the Committee used for listing such occurrences included not only multiple fatalities, but also multiple non-fatal serious injuries.", "NSSSS data and news accounts indicate that since the 2001-2002 school year, there appear to have been about 38 multiple-victim school-related violent incidents. Such incidents included 40\u00a0fatalities and 110 non-fatal violent acts (including shootings and stabbings), for a total of 150\u00a0multiple victims. Table 3 , below, lists NSSSS data and information from news accounts about\u00a0such incidents from the 2001-2002 school year to the 2006-2007 school year (as of December 22, 2006).", "Interestingly, in the multiple-victim school violence episodes in Colorado and Pennsylvania, a total of 16 female students were traumatized, and six were killed before each of the assailants (who were atypically adult males) committed suicide. Some experts believe that the Pennsylvania incident might have been a case of copycat violence fostered by media attention. James Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, stated that he believes the news media bear some responsibility for the copycat phenomena. He remarked that \"This is especially the case when attackers' personalities and grudges are exposed to high-profile public analysis\u2014as when two teenage attackers in the Columbine attack were featured on the cover of a news magazine.... While most sympathize with the victims, others empathize with the shooters. It's the publicity they get that turns the shooter into a celebrity that spawns more of them.\"", "Another similarity between the Colorado and Pennsylvania shootings is that in both incidents, girls were the targeted victims. Katherine S. Newman, a Harvard urban studies professor and co-author of the book, Rampage: The Social Roots , who has researched school shootings since the 1970s, observed that \"The predominant pattern in school shootings of the past three decades is that girls are the victims.... Though it is impossible to know whether girls were randomly victimized in those cases ..., 'in every case in the U.S. since the early 1970s we do note this pattern' of girls being the majority of victims.\"", "Both the Colorado and Pennsylvania multiple-victim shootings occurred in rural settings. Newman reports that it is uncommon for such incidents to occur in urban areas. Revenge, she observed, can be particularly fertile in rural settings. Cheryl Meyer, a Wright State University psychology professor in Dayton, Ohio, has conducted research on school shooting similarities in rural and small towns. She noted that \"It's so often about revenge. Even if something happened 20 years ago, it doesn't mean it is gone. People talk about it and everybody remembers.

[T]here are some things communities can do to improve school safety such as: ensuring that every school has a comprehensive crisis plan, that every school involves students, parents, law enforcement and community groups in the development of its crisis plan and prevention programs and trains educators in how to use the crisis plan, and that schools ensure that every student is connected to a responsible adult in the school or community. ... [Y]ou as a student can help ensure that schools remain safe. You can do that by reporting threats and criminal incidents, speaking out against those who bully or harass others, and serving as a peer mentor to someone who needs a helping hand.

At each grade level, responses of students surveyed were used to represent all students nationwide in public and private secondary schools. For the 2006 MTF study, 48,460 students in 410 secondary schools were surveyed about their use of illicit drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco within three prevalence periods, that is, lifetime, annual (or 12 months), past month (or 30-day), and daily use.", "Overall, for 2006, illicit drug use and alcohol consumption continued a decade-long decline. Decreases since 2005, however, were relatively small and, while statistically significant for all grades combined, were not for any one individual grade. Lloyd Johnston, MTF's principal investigator, noted that the \"youngest students that we survey\u2014the 8 th graders\u2014have shown the largest proportional drop in their use of nearly all of the illicit drugs since the recent peak rates of the mid to late 1990s..., but their improvements now seem near an end. The older teens, on the other hand, are showing a continuation of their decreases, as they catch up with the progress of the younger age groups. We believe that this reflects what social scientists call a 'cohort effect'....\" A cohort effect refers to teens who were previously in lower grades who have entered the upper grades.", "In 2006, as in 2005, researchers reported that survey results revealed high rates of prescription painkillers use, such as Vicodin and OxyContin, and in abuse of sedatives/barbiturates, especially among 12 th graders. OxyContin use increased among 8 th and 10 th graders, but slightly declined among 12 th graders. Although relatively few youth are using OxyContin, Johnston observed, given the addictive potential of this narcotic drug, there still should be concern about its rates of use among teens. Vicodin use slightly increased among all three grades in 2006, but since 2002, when rates were first measured, its use has remained relatively stable. The use of sedatives, including barbituates, showed a steady increase over a period of years among 12 th graders, whose yearly use of such drugs increased from 1993 to 2005. In 2006, however, such use declined, marking what researchers called \"the end of a long rise, but ... still near its recent peak in teen-age use.\" Furthermore, Johnston noted that \"Because most of the illegal drugs like LSD, ecstasy, cocaine, and heroin have shown considerable declines in recent years, while the misuse of prescription-type drugs has been growing, the latter have become a more important part of the country's drug problem.\" Also, he observed that marijuana is still the most widely used among all illicit drugs and recently, its use has gradually decreased. Among the class of prescribed psychotherapeutic drugs used for purposes other than a medical regimen, researchers found that amphetamines constituted the only drug in this class that had not shown a recent increase in use among teens. ", "A new question was added to the study in 2006 regarding the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications for the sole purpose of getting high. The street names for those drugs include \"DXM,\" \"Dex,\" and \"skittles.\" The proportion of 8 th , 10 th , and 12 th grade students who reported using such drugs to get high translated to one in every 25 students in 8 th grade and one in 14 high school seniors. Because these types of drugs are sold over-the-counter, researchers noted, most students might not fully understand the dangers in using them. Johnston observed, \"If the dangers of using these drugs receive more attention in the media I would expect that their popularity to fade somewhat\" (sic).", "In general, MTF researchers noted that alcohol use has been in decline among teens for many years and continued in all three grades in 2005. In 2006, however, 12 th graders constituted the only group that showed a further decline in 30-day use of alcohol. Teen cigarette smoking rates continued to show a decline in all grade levels in 30-day use with the greatest decrease among 12 th graders.

This modest decline in use continued in the upper grades in 2006.", "Researchers noted that the 30-day prevalence of any illicit drug use, including marijuana, among such students dropped by statistically significant amounts between 2003 and 2004. It was reported that over those two years, there had been significant increases in the proportion of students who perceived marijuana use as dangerous. Researchers believed that this change in perception was a possible explanation for the decline in use. In 2005, however, this increase in perceived risk in marijuana use continued among 12 th graders only. In 2006, for the fifth consecutive year, marijuana use continued to decrease among 10 th and 12 th graders. It appeared, however, that declines in such use among 8 th graders had ended.

In 2003, the trend continued with an even sharper decline in ecstasy use as the perceived dangers in using the drug continued to climb. Consequently, since 2002, Johnston observed, \"the annual prevalence of ecstasy use fell by more than half among both 10 th and 12 th graders.\" The declines, however, were much smaller in 2004, and did not reach statistical significance, although such decreases in ecstasy use occurred in all three grades. In 2005, only 12 th graders showed any further decline in ecstasy use. In 2006, 12 th graders showed a slight but insignificant increase in the annual prevalence of ecstasy use.

Since 2000, there has been an increased disapproval of ecstasy use among teens that continued among 10 th and 12 th grade students in 2004. Also, fewer students in 2004 believed that the drug was readily available. In 2006, however, Johnston noted that over the past one to three years, there had been a reduction in the proportion of students who believed that using ecstasy was dangerous, or who stated that they disapproved of using the drug.

There was little change in LSD use in 2004 or in 2005, which kept its use at historic low levels. Perceived LSD availability dropped considerably since 2001.

Cocaine powder use slightly increased in 2005 among 8 th graders, declined among 10 th graders, and remained steady among 12 th graders. As previously mentioned, researchers found no or very little decline at any grade level in cocaine powder use in 2006. The belief that there is a great risk\u00a0in trying crack cocaine once or twice or occasionally among 8 th graders declined in 2006.

In 2005, the decline in cigarette smoking ended among 8 th graders, whom researchers observed had been the leaders in smoking trends among teens.

And, of course, the other fact they should know is that once the smoking habit is established, most people find it terribly difficult to quit. Even though many teenage smokers say they expect to quit, most fail to do so....", "MTF researchers reported that after 10 years of substantial improvement in daily smoking among students in their early to mid-teens, the decline has ended. In 2006, there were no further declines in daily smoking among 8 th and 10 th graders. A further decline, however, did occur among 12 th graders, particularly in their half-pack-a-day cigarette use. The 12 th graders have been showing the greatest declines. These results occurred, researchers observed, \"as the class cohorts of 8 th and 10 th graders who have previously shown large declines in their use move into 12 th grade.\" For 30-day prevalence in smoking, all grades showed a small, continuing decline. Most notably, data for monthly smoking among teens were down substantially from the mid-1990s, when such smoking reached a peak.", "Johnston noted that much fewer students in 2006 had ever tried smoking cigarettes than in 1996, when the peak in lifetime usage was attained. He observed that the decline was expected to continue among 12 th graders as the younger, less tobacco-experienced students move into the 12 th grade. Researchers noted, however, that there appeared to be a leveling off in the decline in cigarette smoking among teens in recent years. They attributed this change to a reduction in anti-tobacco advertising campaigns that were widespread in the mid-1990s after the Tobacco Settlement occurred between major tobacco companies and state attorneys general, focusing on the hazards of smoking and questionable practices of the tobacco industry. The researchers believed these campaigns probably contributed to less favorable attitudes toward smoking. They contend, however, that since the Tobacco Settlement is now over and there are fewer heated public debates regarding the problems with smoking or with the tobacco industry, national anti-smoking ad campaigns have declined and the reduction in teen smoking has diminished.", "Over the past two years, the proportion of students who believed that smoking was dangerous, Johnston observed, leveled off among 10 th graders and has begun to drop among 8 th graders. He stated, \"Generally we have found perceived risk to be an important indicator of changes in future use of a drug, so this is not a favorable development. The good news is that disapproval of cigarette smoking is still rising and is at very high levels among teens.\" The analysts found, however, that the perceived risk of cigarette smoking among 8 th and 10 th graders is declining (that is, fewer of them believe that smoking is dangerous), and the reductions in the percentages of such youth who smoke cigarettes have ended.", "In 2000, because of concern about a possible increase in use among teens of small flavored cigarettes imported from India called \"bidis,\" the MTF study introduced a new question regarding their use. Likewise in 2001, because of the same concern, a new question was introduced regarding teen use of clove-flavored cigarettes imported from Indonesia called \"kreteks.\" Relatively small prevalence rates were observed among teens in the use of both types of cigarettes during the initial years of measurement. Since that time, use of the specialty cigarettes dropped substantially and steadily in all grades. By 2006, the decline in the annual use of the specialty cigarettes had continued to steadily drop, which produced a statistically significant decrease. The researchers concluded that both types of specialty cigarettes constituted short-term fads that did not catch on with the nation's mainstream youth, diminishing the likelihood of these types of cigarettes becoming health hazards, as some people had feared.

Similar to cigarette usage, declines in smokeless tobacco use ended among 8 th and 10 th graders, and such use leveled off in 2006. Only 12 th graders showed evidence of a further decrease in such use probably, researchers believed, because of the cohort effect of teens previously in lower grades entering the upper grades. Johnston observed that the data appeared to be a little deceptive because boys accounted for nearly all smokeless tobacco use, of which one in 9 males in 12 th grade had used the product in 2006.", "Analysts believed that one important reason for the considerable declines in smokeless tobacco use by teens between 1995 and 2004 was that a growing portion of such youth believed that using the product could be dangerous. That belief showed a slight turnaround in 2005. Johnston noted that in 1995, teens began to get the message that using smokeless tobacco could cause mouth and throat cancer, and were probably deterred from using such products. He believed that a new group of teens would also have to hear the same message if the rates in such use were to remain low. MTF 2004 survey data indicated that using smokeless tobacco was perceived as a great risk among 8 th and 12 th graders (such a perception declined among 10 th graders), but that 8 th and 10 th graders disapproved of its use. The 12 th graders were not asked the question regarding whether they disapproved of the product. Johnston noted that \"A rise in disapproval often starts a year after an increase in perceived risk is observed for a drug, which is what we saw here as well. I think a reasonable interpretation of the dynamic is that young people eventually become more disapproving of using a drug after they have come to see its use as dangerous.\"", "In 2006, the MTF survey data indicated that fewer 8 th and 10 th graders (compared with the percentage of such students in 2005) believed that using smokeless tobacco regularly could be harmful to one's health, while 12 th graders believed that such use would be a great risk to health. Furthermore, the percentage of such teens who disapproved of using the product declined for 8 th graders, but remained steady for 10 th graders in 2006. Twelfth graders were not asked the question about their attitude toward using the product.", "MTF researchers reported throughout the survey years (that is, from 1975 through 2005) that smokeless tobacco was primarily used by boys, especially in rural areas.
