As the fifth supplemental of the Bush Administration to focus on the \"global war on terrorism\" and homeland security, these supplemental funds for FY2005 would be in addition to the $25.7 billion received in August 2004 as part of the FY2005 DOD Appropriations Act to cover war-related costs for the initial months of the fiscal year (P.L. 108-287).", "The Administration's request included $74.96 billion for the Department of Defense, $5.6 billion for reconstruction and other foreign aid, $950 million for Tsunami relief, and $770 million for other activities. If enacted as an emergency appropriation, as requested, the funds would not be subject to limits in annual budget resolutions but would add to the size of the U.S. budget deficit. Taking into account the funds already provided, DOD's request would bring its FY2005 total appropriation to about $100 billion, which is over 45% higher than the amount provided in the FY2004 supplemental (P.L. 108-106).", "While OMB Director Joshua Bolten argued that the request was an emergency for \"known and urgent requirements,\" that could not be met with existing funds, some Members questioned whether this characterization fit some elements in the request. Some questioned whether the $5 billion requested by the Defense Department for the Army's initiative to re-organize Army units was an unanticipated emergency since it was announced in the fall of 2003; others argued that the initiative was a war-related expense because it was expected to relieve war-induced stress on Army forces. For foreign aid and Iraq diplomatic facilities, the issue was whether the requests represented true emergencies or could wait for later consideration. If not dealt with in the FY2005 supplemental under an \"emergency\" designation, however, these foreign policy items could be added to the pending FY2006 international affairs appropriation bills and would place additional pressure on the Administration to defend an already sizable foreign policy increase proposed for next year.", "Another controversial issue was the Administration's proposal to place policy authority and control of funding with the Defense Department rather than the State Department to train and equip Afghan and Iraqi security forces. The Administration also requested $400 million for contingency funds related to the war on terror and $200 million in aid to the Palestinian Authority, both of which raised concerns.", "The conference agreement on H.R. 1268 passed the House on May 5 (368-58) and the Senate on May 10, providing $82 billion in supplemental funding, the same overall amount requested, but with many changes in program allocations and the additional of immigration legislation.

Policy direction and funding allocations fall under the responsibility of the State Department, while DOD executes the program on the ground. Broadly, PKO activities support non-U.N. voluntary operations, but in the case of Afghanistan, Peacekeeping appropriations have been used to pay Afghan National Army (ANA) salaries. Thus far, Congress has appropriated over $1.1 billion in FMF and PKO support for Afghanistan, FY2002-2005. Similar to Iraq security assistance, FMF funds have focused on ANA training and equipping. Unlike the Iraqi program, Afghan police training and support has been funded separately out of the State Department's International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account, and would remain under the State Department's jurisdiction under the supplemental proposal. The supplemental, however, seeks to shift the source of ANA training and equipping from FMF/PKO accounts to DOD resources, and to place authority of the program under the Secretary of Defense rather than the Secretary of State.", "During early review of the supplemental proposal, a number of concerns were raised about this shift from the State Department to DOD for funding and management of Iraqi and Afghanistan security forces assistance. Some noted that this diverges from long-standing, historical practice of State Department and country ambassador control of a key foreign policy tool in U.S. relations with allies and other partner nations. While defense personnel may implement the programs, some argued that it was important to maintain civilian authority over the program, especially over foreign police assistance.", "In response to these concerns, Secretary of State Rice defended the proposal by noting that Iraq, in particular, is a unique, war zone situation where the United States needs to maintain a coherent strategy for training and equipping Iraqi security, police, and border forces. She said that often these personnel operate along side American military forces and that it made sense to have the Defense Department in charge of training. She also remarked that the situation in Afghanistan was different, and that police training would remain under the jurisdiction of the State Department. But, she added, Afghanistan also remains a war zone and it is important for Afghan security forces to be fully integrated in their operational efforts.

Funding for modularity and additional military personnel was approved, however, by the conferees and both houses.

Subsequently, during debate on March 15, the House adopted by voice vote an amendment by Representative Jackson adding the same $100 million for Darfur that had been rejected in Committee.", "H.R. 1268 , as passed in the Senate, provided $242.4 million directly for humanitarian aid for the Darfur region and eastern Chad, the same as the request. In addition, two floor amendments could have pushed this figure higher. As noted above, an amendment by Senator Kohl added $320 million in food assistance for Darfur and to meet other emergency and non-emergency food aid needs around the world. A second amendment by Senator Corzine made available $90.5 million out of the Contributions to International Peacekeeping account specifically for Darfur. Of this total, $50 million could be transferred to support African Union peacekeeping activities in the region, while $40.5 million could be transferred for additional humanitarian relief needs in Darfur."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Global War on Terrorism-Related Programs", "paragraphs": ["The Administration proposed $750 million in direct aid for Jordan, Pakistan, and other coalition partners in the war on terrorism, some of which has been challenged for representing an open-ended contingency resource that lacks sufficient controls and congressional oversight.", "Jordan economic and military aid\u2014$200 million. These funds, which would be evenly split between economic and military aid, are justified as necessary to help Jordan offset the costs of hosting Iraq training initiatives, address increasing threats from Iraqi insurgents and problems on the Syrian and Saudi borders, and high oil prices. The supplemental package would come on top of $452 million already appropriated for Jordan in the regular FY2005 appropriation and $456 million requested for FY2006. Pakistan military aid\u2014$150 million. As part of a multi-year, $3 billion Presidential aid pledge to Pakistan, the Administration requested in the regular FY2005 appropriation $700 million for Pakistan, $300 million of which would support military activities. Congress directly appropriated $148.8 million (post rescission) of the military aid request and authorized the President to draw an additional $150 million from prior-year unobligated appropriations. The Administration thus far has not acted on the transfer authority, arguing that it does not want to adversely affect other key aid programs. Instead, the President sought an additional direct appropriation of $150 million that he did not receive in the FY2005 enacted spending measure. The Administration's Pakistan aid request for FY2006 again totals $700 million, with $300 million proposed for military aid. Solidarity Fund\u2014$200 million. The supplemental proposed $200 million in military and security assistance for countries that have deployed troops in Afghanistan and Iraq to meet \"extraordinary\" defense costs of such operations. According to State Department officials, the funds would not be used to directly reimburse these countries for costs sustained in Iraq and Afghanistan. Such reimbursements are provided through DOD's Coalition Support Fund. Rather, the Solidarity Fund would help partners address general budget problems related to their presence in both countries by repairing or replacing defense articles and supporting a number of countries currently or about to deploy forces. Global War on Terrorism Partners Fund\u2014$200 million. This new account would provide economic aid to countries supporting the U.S. in the Global War on Terror. It would be constructed as a contingency Fund, exempt from restrictions and conditions in any other provision of law, from which the Secretary of State could transfer resources to any Federal agency in support of the objectives of the Fund. Secretary of State Rice told the Senate Appropriations Committee on February 17, 2005, that the need for such a Fund became clear after the regular FY2005 appropriation had been submitted. She noted that a number of countries, although not deploying troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, had taken steps, such as securing their borders from terrorist infiltration, to take pressure off U.S. forces.", "These proposals to support coalition partners have raised a number of concerns among Members of Congress. Some question whether circumstances have changed to justify additional aid to Jordan and Pakistan, especially given the large aid packages approved for both countries in the regular FY2005 appropriation and congressional approval of a transfer authority to accommodate $150 million in military aid for Pakistan. Others also ask why financial support for countries with troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan was not part of the FY2005 regular request or proposed for FY2006. Another concern relates to possible redundancy between the proposals outlined above and the roughly $2.2 billion in the DOD portion of the supplemental for similar support to coalition partners.", "The request for creation of the Global War on Terrorism Partners Fund drew particular challenges from several Members due to its broad flexibility and lack of specificity for how the funds would be directed. This request followed recent efforts by the Administration to gain congressional approval of a flexible contingency Fund that could be drawn on to respond to complex foreign emergencies. Congress has rejected these types of requests four times in the past three years.

Existing law includes several restrictions and conditions on aiding the PA related to concerns over accountability, transparency, and corruption. Secretary of State Rice defended the proposal, including the need for direct PA funding, arguing that the U.S. needs to move quickly to help the Palestinians prepare for governing Gaza following Israeli withdrawal. Regular U.S. assistance for the West Bank and Gaza has averaged about $75 million annually and generally channels aid through non-governmental organizations.
