On June28, 2005, the United States and India signed a ten-year defense framework agreement that calls forexpanding bilateral cooperation in a number of security-related areas. U.S.-India bilateralagreements in 2005 represent a new set of landmarks in rapidly warming ties between the world'stwo most populous democracies. A policy of assisting India's rise as a major power has significantimplications for U.S. interests in Asia and beyond. The status of U.S. relations with China andPakistan, especially, is likely to be affected by increased U.S.-India strategic cooperation.

Two of these hearings focused specifically on the most controversial aspect of the July 2005Joint Statement: proposed civilian nuclear cooperation. Congressional approval of increasinglywarm U.S.-India relations appears to be widespread. However, some Members also have expressedconcerns about the potential damage to international nonproliferation regimes that could result fromchanges in U.S. export laws and international guidelines. Senior Members also have voicedconcerns about India's relations with Iran and the possibility that New Delhi's policies towardTehran's controversial nuclear program may not be congruent with those of Washington. Morebroadly, congressional oversight of U.S. foreign relations in Asia likely will include considerationof the potential implications of increased U.S. cooperation with India in functional areas such asarms sales and high-technology trade.

On March 2, the President and Prime Minister Singh issued a statementexpressing their mutual satisfaction with the \"great progress\" made in advancing the U.S.-India\"strategic partnership.\" The statement, which reviewed bilateral efforts to expand ties in a numberof key areas and called for further such efforts, notably announced \"successful completion of India's[nuclear facility] separation plan,\" a reference to ongoing and complex negotiations related toPresident Bush's July 2005 vow to achieve \"full civilian nuclear energy cooperation with India.\" OnMarch 9, the Administration informally submitted to key congressional committee chairman aproposal for adjusting U.S. laws relevant to nuclear commerce.

Similar panels testified before the SenateForeign Relations Committee on November 2. This Senate hearing, along with the October Househearing, was focused specifically on what has become the most controversial aspect of the July 2005Joint Statement issued by President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh: an intention toachieve full bilateral civilian nuclear energy cooperation.", "In mid-October 2005, the chairs and ranking members of the Senate Foreign Relations andHouse International Relations Committees sent a letter to Secretary of State Rice requesting that theAdministration begin \"substantive discussion\" with their committees on possible legislativeproposals related to envisaged civil nuclear cooperation with India. During the October 26 HIRChearing, Committee Chairman Henry Hyde called \"strange and unusual\" the Administration'sminimal consultation with Congress on the details of such plans and said he was \"troubled\" by publicstatements from the Administration suggesting that congressional support for such cooperation wasbroad and virtually guaranteed. (2) In a November letter which echoed much of the analysis ofnongovernmental hearing witnesses, a group of 18 experts, scholars, and former U.S. governmentofficials urged Members of the Congress to \"critically examine\" the proposed nuclear cooperationagreement, saying it \"poses far-reaching and potentially adverse implications for U.S. nuclearnonproliferation objectives\" and is unlikely to bring India \"into closer alignment with other U.S.strategic objectives.\" (3) ", "In late January, U.S. Ambassador to India Mulford caused a diplomatic stir when heexplicitly linked progress on the proposed nuclear deal with India's upcoming International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA) vote on Iran, saying if India chose not to vote with the United States, hebelieved the U.S.-India initiative \"will die in the Congress.\" A State Department spokesman calledthe Ambassador's comments a \"personal opinion\" and denied that the issues were linked. India'sExternal Affairs Ministry responded that India \"categorically rejects\" any attempts to link the twoissues, and opposition and leftist Indian political figures criticized the remarks as \"a serious affrontto India and its sovereignty.\" (4) On February 4, India voted with the majority (and the UnitedStates) on an IAEA resolution to refer Iran to the U.N.

In September 2005, India and France issued a joint statement promisingthat the two countries would work toward \"conclusion of a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement,\"and France committed itself to working with other countries and the NSG to accomplish this. However, after four months of uncertainty over the issue of separating India's civilian and militarynuclear facilities, Paris indicated that New Delhi would have to make \"some compromises\" in thisarea, with the French Ambassador to India identifying a common French-U.S. interest in reachinga consensus among NSG members, which he said \"is not easy.\" Also in September, Canada reversedits previous policy and announced that it would supply nuclear-related \"dual-use items\" to India'scivil nuclear program. Following the March 2 U.S.-India Joint Statement, Australia, which is hometo nearly half of the world's unmined uranium, indicated that it might alter its policy of not sellingthis resource to non-signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, meaning India may becomeeligible.

The Indian plan, whichrequires India to move 14 of its 22 reactors into permanent international oversight by the year 2014and place all future civilian reactors under permanent control, exempts India's fast breeder reactorsand also would guarantee an uninterrupted supply of nuclear fuel for India's civilian facilities. UnderSecretary of State Burns, the lead U.S. negotiator, insists that the plan is a boost for U.S.nonproliferation efforts, claiming that the percentage of Indian nuclear facilities under safeguardswill grow as most future facilities are likely to be designated civilian. Numerous nonproliferationexperts remain critical of of the proposed deal. On March 8, the White House issued a press releaseresponding to critics.

After decades of estrangementduring the Cold War, U.S.-India relations were freed from the constraints of global U.S.-Sovietbipolarity in 1991, the same year that New Delhi began efforts to transform its once quasi-socialisteconomy through fiscal reform and market opening. However, relations with India continued to beviewed primarily through the lens of U.S. nonproliferation interests. The marked improvement ofrelations that began in the latter months of the Clinton Administration -- President Clinton spent sixdays in India in March 2000 -- was accelerated after a November 2001 meeting between PresidentBush and then-Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, when the two leaders agreed to greatlyexpand U.S.-India cooperation on a wide range of issues. India's swift post-9/11 offer of full supportfor U.S.-led counterterrorism operations was widely viewed as reflective of the positive newtrajectory in bilateral relations.

(13) In March 2005, the BushAdministration unveiled a \"new strategy for South Asia\" based in part on a judgment that the NSSPwas insufficiently broad and that sets as a goal \"to help India become a major world power in the 21stcentury.\" (14) ", "Nongovernmental proponents of closer U.S.-India security cooperation often refer to the riseof China and its potential disturbance of Asian stability as a key reason to \"hedge\" by bolstering U.S.links with India.

However, there is concern among elements ofIndia's security establishment and influential leftist political parties that the United States is seekingto turn India into a regional \"client state.\" In accord with India's traditional nonalignment sentiments,leftist figures have called the July 18 Joint Statement overly concessional to U.S. interests and afurther violation of the ruling coalition's commitment to independence in foreign affairs. Suchcriticism may have elicited assurances by India's defense ministry that decisions about any futurejoint Indian-U.S. military operations would be strictly guided by India's national interest and theprinciples of its foreign and defense policies. In 2003, the Indian external affairs minister denied thatIndia's relations with the United States could be used as a \"counterforce\" against China, saying, \"Wecategorically reject such notions based on outmoded concepts like balance of power.

(19) Therewere later references to a \"quartet\" when the issue of missile defense was included. Prior to theformal launching of the NSSP initiative in January 2004, the United States had sought to balanceIndian interests in cooperation on and trade in sensitive technologies with concerns aboutproliferation and security. According to Secretary of State Powell in October 2003, ", "We have been trying to be as forthcoming as we canbecause it's in our interest to be forthcoming, but we also have to protect certain red lines that wehave with respect to proliferation, because it's sometimes hard to separate within space launchactivities and industries and nuclear programs, that which could go to weapons, and that which couldbe used solely for peaceful purposes.

(21) However, others callattention to recent U.S. sanctions on four Indian individuals and entities said to have been involvedin WMD-related transfers to Iran. The \"strategic partnership\" forwarded by the NSSP involvedprogress through a series of reciprocal steps in which both countries took action designed to expandengagement on nuclear regulatory and safety issues, enhanced cooperation in missile defense,peaceful uses of space technology, and creation of an appropriate environment for increasedhigh-technology commerce. (22) Despite the \"nuts-and-bolts\" nature of NSSP efforts, someanalysts characterized the initiative's overarching goal -- increasing rather than denying New Delhi'saccess to advanced technologies -- as a revolutionary shift in the U.S. strategic orientation towardIndia.

InOctober 2001, President Bush waived nuclear-related sanctions on aid to India, and the number ofIndian companies on the Entity List was reduced from 159 to 2 primary and 14 subordinate. InSeptember 2004, as part of NSSP implementation, the United States modified some export licensingpolicies and removed the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) headquarters from the EntityList. Further adjustments came in August 2005 when six more subordinate entities were removed. Indian companies remaining on the Entity List are four subordinates of the ISRO, four subordinatesof the Defense Research and Development Organization, one Department of Atomic Energy entity,and Bharat Dynamics Limited, a missile production agency.

(26) Many such analystsbelieve that past U.S. moves have not been substantive, opining that changes in licensingrequirements for high-technology trade have been of little consequence for prospective Indian buyersand progress on space and nuclear energy cooperation has been marginal.

The Administration insists that U.S. interests are bestserved with India \"joining the mainstream of international thinking and international practices onthe nonproliferation regime.\" (29) The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) has welcomed the agreement as \"out of the box thinking\" that could contribute to theenhancement of nuclear safety and security. (30) Many favorable analysts view the decision in the context of aperceived need to \"counterbalance\" a rising China, calling nuclear cooperation with India a meansof both demonstrating U.S. resolve to assist India in increasing its power and stature, and bringingNew Delhi into the global nonproliferation regime rather than leaving it on the outside. For theseobservers, engaging a de facto nuclear India as such is a necessary and realistic policy.

Prime Minister Singh asserts that a major expansion of India'scapacity in this sector is \"imperative,\" and India sets as its goal generation of at least 20,000megawatts of nuclear power by the year 2020 (present capacity is less than 3,000 MWe). GeneralElectric, which built India's Tarapur nuclear power plant in 1969, is an American company thatmight see financial gains from resumed sales of nuclear fuel to India. (32) ", "In April 2005, Secretary of State Rice noted that current U.S. law precludes the sale ofnuclear technology to India, and she conceded that U.S. nuclear cooperation with India would have\"quite serious\" implications for the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). (33) Critics of such cooperationinsist that a policy of \"exceptionalism\" toward India may permanently undermine the coercive powerof the NPT. They say such a move would seriously risk turning the existing nonproliferation regimefrom \"imperfect but useful mechanisms to increasingly ineffectual ones,\" and they fault the BushAdministration for \"lowering the bar too much\" with a selective and self-serving policy. (34) Many opponents worrythat the Joint Statement exacerbates a global perception that the United States cannot be countedupon to honor its own nonproliferation obligations, including those made in the 1995 and 2000 NPTReview Conferences. This may encourage other supplier countries, such as France, Russia, andChina, to relax their own rules and provide increased aid to potential security risks, such as Iran,Pakistan, and Syria. (35) A further concern is that NPT member countries with advanced scientific establishments that haveforesworn nuclear weapons may become tempted to develop their own such capabilities, especiallyif negotiations over the status of Iran and North Korea break down. (36) Some also see overt U.S.strengthening of India as disruptive to existing balances of power involving both Pakistan andChina.

However, many also expressed concerns aboutthe potential damage to international nonproliferation regimes that could result from changes in U.S.law that would allow for civil nuclear cooperation with India. Some voiced negative appraisals ofthe Bush Administration's lack of prior consultation with Congress leading up to the July 18 JointStatement. Administration officials appearing before the panel insisted that the United States wasnot condoning India's nuclear weapons program and that bringing India into the mainstream ofnonproliferation norms would represent a \"net gain\" for international nonproliferation efforts.

For example, former Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee of theBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticized the July 18 Joint Statement as causing \"consternation\" amongIndian nuclear scientists and defense analysts. His primary objections were that separating India'scivilian and military nuclear facilities could erode India's ability to determine the future size of itsnuclear deterrent and that the costs of such separation would be \"prohibitive.\" India's mainopposition BJP asserts that India stands to lose from the July 18 deal while the United States riskslittle, a claim echoed by some nongovernmental analysts. (40) Prime Minister Singh has dismissed such criticisms asmisguided, insisting that the stipulations will not lead to any limitations on or outside interferencein India's nuclear weapons program, and that substantive Indian action is conditional upon reciprocalU.S. behavior.
