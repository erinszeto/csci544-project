Adoption of digital technologies has improved the efficiency and speed of operations and processes, and allowed for an almost instantaneous exchange of information between connected devices.

While the benefits of internet-connected digital technologies are many, so too are the risks of a cybersecurity breach from exposure to a globally internet-connected environment.

Together, these pieces of mechanical and automated equipment constitute the grid's industrial control system (ICS) network, managing power plant controls, transformer yard and power bus functions, transmission, and distribution substations. The grid's ICS networks essentially operate in a \"control loop\" in which sensors continually check key components, with variable responses against control variables to ensure that the system is functioning as designed. ICS networks control industrial processes in a number of energy and manufacturing operations. One particular type of ICS network common in the electric power industry is a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system which gathers information from remote stations across a utility system to control geographically dispersed assets. ", "In 2015, a cyber attack on distribution utility substations in Ukraine shut off power to over 225,000 utility customers for several hours, and was the first time that a cyber attack was publicly acknowledged to have caused a grid power outage.

For example, a cascading outage would be aggravated if operators did not get the information to learn that it had started, or if protective devices were disabled.", "Similar conclusions were reached in a 2015 report from the University of Cambridge and Lloyds of London, which stated that a targeted cyber attack could leave 15 states and 93 million people from New York City to Washington, D.C., without power.

After someone broke into a nearby underground vault to cut telephone cables, snipers opened fire on the substation, knocking out 17 large power transformers sending power to Silicon Valley. A blackout was averted by rerouting power around the substation, and local power plants were called upon to produce more electricity. It took the local utility 27 days to restore the substation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) chairman at the time reportedly said that \"if [the attack] were widely replicated across the country, it could take down the U.S. electric grid and black out much of the country.\" Largely as a result of the grid vulnerabilities highlighted by this incident, FERC directed NERC to develop a physical security standard (which culminated in CIP-014).

The 2015 Ukraine cyber attack and blackouts demonstrated that an electric grid could be infiltrated, controlled, and rendered inoperable through Internet-connected systems by an outside, unauthorized entity. ", "Recovery from a well-planned cyber and physical attack on the grid could be complicated by the cost and vulnerability of critical components. While a physical attack on transmission towers to bring down power lines could cause blackouts, the strategic destruction of a number of critical high-voltage transformers could potentially cause long-lasting power outages. These transformers are large, and difficult to move. A large-scale attack may use up the limited inventory of spare units, and it may take months or years to build new units (due mainly to the size and often unique specifications of high-voltage transformers). The availability of other large components, such as high-voltage circuit breakers could also hamper recovery efforts.
