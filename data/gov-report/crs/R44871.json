HABs have been recorded in every state and have become a concern nationwide.", "Many types of algae can cause HABs in freshwater systems. The most frequent and severe blooms involve the proliferation of cyanobacteria. Some cyanobacteria species can produce toxins\u2014cyanotoxins\u2014that can cause mild to severe health effects in humans and kill aquatic life and other animals.", "HABs can also contribute to deteriorating water quality and ecosystem health. As masses of cyanobacteria or other algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen, sometimes forming \"dead zones\" where life cannot survive. These areas can kill fish and organisms, such as crabs and clams, and have detrimental economic effects.", "Scientists widely consider nutrient enrichment to be a key cause of HAB formation. While nutrients are essential to plants and natural parts of aquatic ecosystems, excessive amounts can overstimulate algal growth. Sources include point sources (e.g., municipal wastewater discharges) and nonpoint sources (e.g., fertilizer runoff from agricultural and urban areas).", "Congress, federal agencies, and states have taken steps to address HABs and nutrients that contribute to their occurrence.

Also, states have listed waters as impaired, or not meeting water quality standards, for algal blooms or algal toxins. Some of these states have begun to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)\u2014essentially pollution budgets\u2014to address them. Most states have identified nutrient-related pollution as a priority to be addressed by their TMDLs and/or alternative restoration plans. States rely heavily on financial assistance from EPA in implementing these plans and, more broadly, in addressing nonpoint source pollution that leads to degraded water quality and HAB formation. Congress has long provided financial assistance through EPA for regional, state, and local programs through CWA Sections 106 and 319 planning grants, geographic programs (such as the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes), and other sources.

In the summer of 2016, a massive HAB in Lake Okeechobee\u2014Florida's largest freshwater lake\u2014resulted in beach closures, losses to the tourism industry, and negative impacts on marine life.

However, under certain environmental conditions, such as increased temperatures and nutrient concentrations (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), colonies of algae can grow excessively, or \"bloom,\" and produce toxins that pose a threat to human and aquatic ecosystem health and potentially cause economic damage. These HABs sometimes produce discolorations in the water that can appear as scums, paint-like slicks, clotted mats, or foam that may vary in color (i.e., light to dark green, yellow, red, or brown). Even when visible signs of a bloom are absent, however, algal toxins may still cause harmful effects. Figure 1 shows an aerial view of a HAB that produced visible green scums in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, in July 2016."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HAB Types and Impacts", "paragraphs": ["While many types of algae can cause HABs in bodies of freshwater, cyanobacteria (sometimes referred to as blue-green algae) typically cause the most frequent and severe blooms. Cyanobacterial HABs pose a threat to human and aquatic ecosystem health and can kill pets, livestock, and wildlife. Some species of cyanobacteria produce toxins, called cyanotoxins, which can cause hepatic (liver-related), neurologic, respiratory, dermatologic, and other symptoms. These may be acute or chronic, mild or severe, and in some cases may be fatal. Humans may be exposed to cyanotoxins by consuming tainted drinking water, fish, or shellfish; swimming or recreating in waters with certain concentrations of cyanotoxins present; or inhaling aerosolized toxins. The cyanotoxins associated with these HABs can contaminate fish, interfere with a variety of recreational activities, and cause other economic and environmental damages.", "There are many types of cyanotoxins, which may have multiple variants with a wide range of toxicities. The most commonly occurring and most studied cyanotoxin is microcystin.", "Although cyanobacterial HABs are considered to be the most prevalent and toxic types of HABs, blooms of \"golden algae\" ( Prymnesium parvum ) are an emerging problem and likely the most problematic of non-cyanobacterial freshwater HAB taxa (i.e., group of related organisms classified as a unit). Golden algal HABs have caused large fish kills worldwide, including millions of fish in Texas. Most of the major fish kills have occurred since 2000. Golden algae thrive in brackish water, such as the rivers and reservoirs found in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. The toxins produced by golden algae target gill-breathing organisms, such as fish, clams, and mussels. According to information from two states that experience golden algal blooms, there is currently no evidence that golden algal toxins pose a direct threat to humans, other mammals, or birds. Effects of cyanobacterial HABs and golden algae HABs are detailed in Table 1 .", "In addition to the effects of algal toxins on human and animal health, HABs can also contribute to deteriorating water quality and ecosystem health. An overabundance of cyanobacteria or other algae can block out sunlight and clog fish gills. In addition, as the algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen, leaving waterways in a hypoxic (or low oxygen) state, sometimes forming \"dead zones\"\u2014areas where life cannot survive due to lack of oxygen. Low oxygen areas can suffocate and kill fish and bottom-dwelling organisms such as crabs and clams. According to EPA, over 166 dead zones have been documented nationwide, including in waterbodies such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Significant economic losses have occurred as a result of hypoxia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Contributing to HAB Formation", "paragraphs": ["Many factors may influence the occurrence and prevalence of HABs in freshwater, including nutrient concentrations, water temperature, availability of light, pH, and water circulation. Nutrient enrichment is widely recognized as one of the key causes of HAB formation. Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are essential to plant growth and natural parts of aquatic ecosystems. However, when high levels of nutrients enter a body of water, they stimulate plant and algal growth, which can lead to depletion of dissolved oxygen (as explained above), reduced transparency (i.e., turbidity), changes to the biological community (e.g., loss of sportfish, such as bass), and degradation of the aesthetic appeal of the water (i.e., from odor and scums). This process is called eutrophication. ", "While some sources of nutrients in water bodies are natural, many anthropogenic activities contribute nutrients to waterbodies from a number of point and nonpoint sources. Point sources include municipal and industrial wastewater discharges and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Nonpoint sources include urban stormwater runoff, failing septic systems, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen from fossil fuel emissions, runoff from fertilized cropland, and manure runoff from cropland, pastures, and animal feeding operations. See Table 2 for more information on these sources.", "Studies also indicate that increased temperatures and changes in frequency and intensity of rainfall associated with climate change may also favor HAB formation. HABs generally proliferate in warmer waters. In addition, some studies have found that swings between flooding and drought may enhance HAB formation. For example, if intense rainfall is followed by a drought, the nutrients washed into receiving water bodies may remain in them longer, increasing the potential for HABs. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Incidence and Trends", "paragraphs": ["Scientists largely agree that the frequency and distribution of HABs, the economic losses from them, the types of resources affected, and the number of toxins and toxic species have all increased in recent years. Some scientists note that factors such as better detection methods and increased reporting have contributed to the upward trend. HABs, including cyanobacterial HABs, have been recorded in the waters of all 50 states, with some HABs crossing state lines. Figure 2 shows the generalized distribution of selected freshwater HAB events (cyanobacterial HABs and golden algal HABs) that took place between 2006 and 2015 across the United States. ", "The findings of EPA's most recent national assessment of lakes are consistent with other reports of the rising trend in HABs. In EPA's 2012 National Lake Assessment, EPA concluded that there was little change from its 2007 survey of lakes, with two exceptions\u2014trends in algal toxin and nutrient measures. In 2012, EPA and its partners detected microcystin in 39% of lakes, a 9.5% increase from 2007. EPA noted, however, that for both studies, the concentrations of microcystin remained low and rarely exceeded the levels of concern established by the World Health Organization for recreational uses (see \" Regulatory Efforts and Guidelines \"). EPA also found an 8.3% increase in the percentage of lakes in the \"most disturbed condition\" category when analyzing the density of cyanobacterial cells (i.e., an indicator of risk for exposure to algal toxins because the cells may produce toxins). Finally, EPA found an overall increase in the median concentration of phosphorus across all lakes and a \"dramatic\" decline (18.2%) in the percentage of lakes with low nutrients and high oxygen levels. These findings are important because in many lakes, phosphorus is considered the limiting nutrient, meaning that the available quantity of this nutrient controls the pace of algal production. It also means that even small increases in phosphorus can lead to very rapid increases in algal growth. More broadly, the study found that nutrient pollution is a widespread problem across the country. Approximately 35% of lakes have excessive levels of total nitrogen, and 40% of lakes have excessive levels of total phosphorus.

It required the task force to prepare reports assessing HABs and hypoxia with a focus on coastal waters and authorized funding for HAB and hypoxia-related research, education, and monitoring activities. The Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) chaired the task force. In 2004, Congress reauthorized HABHRCA and expanded it to include assessments of HABs in freshwater. In 2014, Congress again reauthorized HABHRCA and established a national HAB/Hypoxia Program to be maintained by NOAA through the task force. It identified NOAA and EPA as the lead federal agencies for marine and freshwater aspects of the program, respectively, and required additional reports and a comprehensive research plan and action strategy. ", "In 2015, in response to public safety concerns arising from the Toledo, Ohio, HAB event, Congress passed legislation addressing algal toxins in drinking water. The Drinking Water Protection Act amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to require EPA to develop a strategic plan to assess and manage the risks associated with algal toxins in public drinking water supplies. ", "The following year, Congress included a provision in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act that required EPA to designate a Harmful Algal Bloom Coordinator to coordinate projects and activities under the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative involving HABs in the Great Lakes. Table 3 provides a list and description of the HAB-specific legislation enacted since 1998.", "In addition to HAB-specific legislation, the Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes EPA to address water quality concerns associated with HABs. The act establishes a system, under Section 303, for states to adopt ambient water quality standards consisting of the designated use or uses of a water body (e.g., recreational, public water supply, or aquatic life) and the water quality criteria that are necessary to protect the use or uses. States then use their water quality standards to determine which waters must be cleaned up, how much effluent may be discharged, and what is needed for protection. ", "Section 304(a) requires the EPA Administrator to publish and, from time to time, revise water quality criteria that accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on human health and the environment that might be expected from the presence of pollutants. These criteria constitute guidance that states use in adopting their water quality standards. As recognized by Section 510 of the CWA, states may develop water quality standards that are more stringent than required by EPA regulations. EPA's water quality standards regulations require that in developing water quality standards, states must adopt water quality criteria that protect the designated use. States are to establish numerical criteria \u2014based on (1) EPA's recommended criteria, (2) EPA's criteria modified to reflect site-specific conditions, or (3) other scientifically defensible methods\u2014and establish narrative criteria or criteria based on biomonitoring methods where numerical criteria cannot be established or to supplement numerical criteria.", "Section 303(d) of the CWA requires states to identify waters that are impaired by pollution, even after application of pollution controls. For those waters, states must establish a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) of pollutants to ensure that water quality standards can be attained. A TMDL is a quantitative assessment of pollution sources and pollutant reductions needed to restore and protect U.S. waters; it is also a planning process for attaining water quality standards. TMDLs may address all pollution sources, including point sources, such as municipal sewage treatment or industrial plant discharges, and nonpoint sources such as urban runoff and agricultural runoff.", "Also, Section 118 of the CWA provides that the United States should seek to attain the goals embodied in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978, as amended by the Water Quality Agreement of 1987 and any other agreements and amendments.

In the Drinking Water Protection Act ( P.L. 114-45 ), enacted August 7, 2015, Congress directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to inventory funds expended by federal agencies to examine toxin-producing cyanobacteria and algae or address public health concerns related to harmful algal blooms. GAO was to recommend ways to improve interagency coordination and reduce duplication of efforts. According to the 2016 GAO report that responded to the mandate, 17 agencies conducted research, monitoring, response, or other HAB-related activities between FY2013 and FY2015.

One key concern raised was that these criteria, if used for water quality standards, would improperly regulate response organisms rather than a discharged pollutant. Some argued that algal toxins are not a pollutant that CWA permittees discharge. Rather, the discharge of other pollutants, such as excess nutrients, may lead to HAB formation. In its draft criteria document, EPA explained that it does not anticipate states using the criteria alone for permitting purposes, recognizing that cyanobacteria and their toxins are not typically present in permitted discharges. EPA goes on to say the following:", "Permits are more likely to be written to address point source discharges of the causal pollutants, such as nutrients, on a waterbody-specific or watershed basis, where the permit writer has determined there is a reasonable potential for the causal pollutants in the discharge to cause or contribute to an exceedance of the cyanotoxin standards.", "In this regard, some commenters expressed concern that it is not known precisely what level of nutrients will result in a bloom, nor is it understood what factors will trigger the release of toxins. Several commenters suggested that EPA explore these issues further before moving forward with water quality criteria for purposes other than guiding advisory levels for swimming.", "Many commenters also expressed implementation concerns regarding monitoring and sampling. According to the Association of Clean Water Administrators many states do not currently have mechanisms in place to adequately sample for the levels of the toxins specified by EPA or lack adequate lab capacity to process increased samples. Some states, publicly owned treatment works, and agricultural groups also commented that the variability of HABs within a body of water and over even short spans of time can make sampling and analysis complicated, particularly when using the data to determine if a water body is impaired.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislation in the 115th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Congressional interest in HABs has largely focused on funding further research and coordinating the efforts of federal agencies and their partners to study and address HABs. In the 115 th Congress, the Senate passed S. 1057 , which would, among other things, reauthorize HABHRCA for FY2019-FY2023, add the Army Corps of Engineers to the interagency task force, and allow the administrators of NOAA (marine) or EPA (freshwater) to declare a HAB or hypoxia event as an event of \"national significance.\" Such a determination would prompt authority for the administrators to provide funding to the affected state or local government. A related bill, H.R. 4417 , has been introduced in the House.", "The Senate also passed S. 129 , which would reauthorize the National Sea Grant Program and make funds available for HAB research through that program. The bill would authorize grants for university research on several targeted topics, including \"the biology, prevention, and forecasting of harmful algal blooms.\" A related bill, H.R. 4306 , has been introduced in the House. ", "The Great Lakes and Fresh Water Algal Bloom Information Act ( H.R. 1893 ) in the 115 th Congress would require NOAA to create an electronic database of research and information on the causes of, and corrective actions being taken with regard to, algal blooms in the Great Lakes, their tributaries, and other surface fresh waters and for other purposes. ", "H.R. 3661 would establish a program to award prizes for the development of innovative, environmentally safe solutions for reducing, mitigating, and controlling harmful algal blooms and for other purposes.", "Three bills have been introduced that would seek to address issues specific to Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Everglades:", "H.R. 2137 seeks to address concerns arising from the HAB outbreak that occurred in Lake Okeechobee, FL, during the summer of 2016. Record rainfalls and an impending hurricane season prompted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to release water from the lake into rivers and estuaries in an attempt to keep the lake from overflowing. The releases occurred at a time when a lake-wide HAB was forming, allowing nutrients and algae to move downstream, eventually reaching area beaches and requiring beach closures and cleanups that had substantial impacts on the local and state economy. Florida's governor requested a federal state of emergency declaration, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied because it determined that supplemental federal assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act was not considered appropriate for the event. H.R. 2137 would direct the President to treat a harmful algal bloom \"caused by certain activities of the Federal Government\" as an emergency for the purposes of the Stafford Act. H.R. 3665 would require the IWG-HABHRCA to prepare an assessment and a plan for reducing, mitigating, and controlling HABs and hypoxia in the Greater Everglades region, similar to what the working group has completed at a national level and for the Great Lakes region. H.R. 6645 would\u2014similar to S. 1057 and H.R. 4417 \u2014reauthorize HABHRCA but would also, like H.R. 3665 , require an assessment and action plan for the Everglades region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Recent HAB events highlight the public health, economic, and environmental consequences that communities in the United States may continue to experience, perhaps on a more frequent basis. EPA, NOAA, and other federal agencies are working together to conduct important HAB-related research in an effort to close the gaps in the scientific and management community's understanding of how best to prevent, predict, minimize, and suppress HABs. EPA, states, and their partners are working to identify and restore waterbodies that are affected by HABs and the excess nutrients that contribute to their formation. Congress has passed legislation to help drive and fund research efforts and improve collaboration among the many federal agencies involved in HAB-related activities. Moving forward, Congress may be interested in oversight of the Administration's efforts to implement HABHRCA and other HAB-related authorities. While Congress, federal agencies, and states are taking steps to address HABs, many observers assert that further action is needed to make progress that outpaces the growing consequences of nutrient pollution. ", "Most observers agree that further research is needed to understand the most appropriate way to predict, minimize, and suppress HAB outbreaks, including whether and how to regulate algal toxins. These advocates assert that Congress should ensure that adequate funding is available for such research. To control HABs, some advocate for regulation of nonpoint source pollution, arguing that point sources are disproportionately regulated and that nonpoint sources are the larger contributors to nutrient pollution. Instead of regulation, some argue that EPA and other federal agencies should continue to focus on collaborative, voluntary watershed-level efforts to address nonpoint source pollution that contributes to HAB formation and that Congress should ensure that financial assistance for these efforts continues. ", "Controlling nonpoint sources of excess nutrients that contribute to HAB formation is challenging. They are diffuse and pervasive and often attributable to many sources and activities rather than a single cause. Yet, scientists generally agree that the current trends in overenriched waters and HAB events cannot be corrected without addressing nonpoint source nutrient pollution in a significant way and that controlling point sources alone is not enough. Given the consequences of HABs and the difficulty in controlling nonpoint sources of the nutrients that contribute to their formation, challenges and issues associated with HABs are likely to remain of interest to Congress."], "subsections": []}]}}
