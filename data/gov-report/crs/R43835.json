While it is the President's authority to designate, and remove from designation, terrorist states, Congress has some legislative authority to weigh in as the reviews proceed. In recent years, other foreign policy and national security decisions have butted up against the designation: to delist Cuba in the course of normalizing other aspects of the bilateral relationship; to enter into a multilateral agreement involving Iran's nuclear weapons pursuits that required the United States to lift some sanctions; and to redesignate the government of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism in the midst, or as part, of seeking countermeasures to that state's nuclear and missile ambitions.", "This brief report provides information on legislation that authorizes the designation of a foreign government as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism.

Current designees are the governments of Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.", "Iran. In July 2015, the United States, China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, European Union, and Iran agreed to a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the agreement, Iran ensured that its nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful, and in return, the negotiating parties and the United Nations lifted economic sanctions related to Iran's nuclear pursuits. In May 2018, President Donald Trump ceased U.S. participation in the JCPOA and set a course for reestablishing restrictions on trade, transactions, and investment in most of Iran's economy. Throughout, however, U.S. sanctions have remained in place to address Iran's support for international terrorism, missile proliferation, human rights violations, and disrupting regional stability.", "Cuba. In December 2014, President Barack Obama announced he would proceed over the coming months to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba and ease those diplomatic and economic restrictions he could, while anticipating Congress could engage in a review of sanctions codified in permanent law. At the same time, the President announced that the State Department had begun a review of Cuba's designation on the state sponsors of terrorism list. On April 14, 2015, the President sent a message to Congress to certify that \"the Government of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period; and ... has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future.\" This met the requirements of the statutes that form the terrorist lists; Cuba's designation was removed on the 45 th calendar day following the announcement (May 29, 2015), as the laws provide.", "North Korea. In November 2017, President Trump designated the government of North Korea as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism. Reportedly affecting the decision was the assassination of Kim Jung-un's half-brother by nerve agent at an international airport in Malaysia in February 2017, as well as North Korea's pursuit of attaining nuclear weapons capabilities. In late 2014, the possibility of redesignating North Korea had resurfaced when the Obama Administration attributed a cyberattack of Sony Pictures to North Korea. It was a debate that Congress had sustained since 2008, when President George W. Bush removed the terrorism designation as part of multinational negotiations to disable and dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Congress had gone so far as to require the Secretary of State to report to the Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and the House Committees on Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Ways and Means by October 31, 2017, on \"whether North Korea meets the criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.\" The deadline was missed, but the November 21 designation answered the question.", "Sudan. Under President William Clinton, in 1993 the Secretary of State designated the government of Sudan as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism. This was the first of several steps that escalated in 1997 when the President declared that Sudan's \"continued support of international terrorism; ongoing efforts to destabilize neighboring governments; and the prevalence of human rights violations, including slavery and the denial of religious freedom\" constituted a national emergency to the foreign policy, national security, and economy of the United States. For more than a decade, however, the State Department has described Sudan as generally cooperative on counterterrorism efforts. In January 2017, President Obama issued an order to signal a pending substantial outlook for U.S.-Sudan relations based on Sudan's \"marked reduction in offensive military activity, culminating in a pledge to maintain a cessation of hostilities in conflict areas in Sudan, and steps toward the improvement of humanitarian access throughout Sudan, as well as cooperation with the United States on addressing regional conflicts and the threat of terrorism.\" This launched an extended forecast toward ending the national emergency and lifting most\u2014if not all\u2014of the economic sanctions. In November 2018, the State Department announced that the Administration would consider rescinding Sudan's designation if certain conditions, including with respect to respect for human rights and religious freedom, were met.", "This brief report provides information on legislation that authorizes the designation of any foreign government as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism.
