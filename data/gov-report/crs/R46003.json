Understanding these different segments is relevant to the application of state and federal health insurance requirements. ", "The individual health insurance market segment is where individuals and families buying insurance on their own (i.e., not through a plan sponsor) may purchase health plans. In the group health insurance market, a plan sponsor, typically an employer, offers coverage to a group (e.g., the employer's employees). The group market is divided into small- and large-group market segments. It is also categorized according to how the plan is insured. Group plans that are purchased by employers and other plan sponsors from state-licensed health insurance issuers and are offered to employees or other groups are referred to as fully insured plans. Employers or other plan sponsors that offer self - insur e d plans set aside funds to pay for health benefits directly, and they bear the risk of covering medical expenses generated by the individuals covered under the self-insured plan. ", "States are the primary regulators of the business of health insurance, as codified by the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act, and each state requires health insurance issuers to be licensed to sell plans in the state. Each state has a unique set of requirements that apply to state-licensed issuers and the plans they offer; these requirements are broad in scope and address a variety of issues, and often the requirements apply differently to the various market segments. In general, state oversight of health plans applies only to plans offered by state-licensed issuers. Because self-insured plans are financed directly by a plan sponsor, as opposed to a state-licensed insurer, such plans generally are not subject to state law. ", "The federal government also regulates state-licensed issuers and the plans they offer, as well as self-insured plans and their sponsors .

For example, the requirement that plans cover preexisting health conditions applies uniformly; health plans offered in the individual, small-group, and large-group markets and self-insured plans must comply with the prohibition on excluding benefits based on health conditions for any individual. The requirement to cover a core package of 10 \"essential health benefits\" does not apply uniformly; it applies only to health plans offered in the individual and small-group markets.", "Federal health insurance requirements are codified in three statutes\u00e2\u0080\u0094Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), Part 7 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and Chapter 100 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

", "The check marks in the table indicate that the grandfathered or transitional plan must comply with the requirement. The term N.A. indicates that the requirement does not apply to the specified market segment, regardless of whether the plan is a grandfathered or transitional plan. The use of Exempt in the table indicates that the grandfathered or transitional plan is exempt from complying with the requirement. For example, the ACA's rate review requirement applies only to fully insured small-group plans and individual market plans. Grandfathered plans do not have to comply with the requirement, which is why the table indicates that grandfathered fully insured small-group plans and grandfathered individual plans are \"Exempt\" from the requirement. Transitional plans do have to comply with the requirement, which is why the table has check marks for these plans. The rate review requirement does not apply to fully insured large-group plans or self-insured plans; as such, the table indicates that the requirement is not applicable (N.A.) to grandfathered versions of these plans."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
