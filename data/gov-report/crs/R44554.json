Incentive compensation takes the form of variable contingent compensation, particularly cash bonuses, that are based on the attainment of certain firm or employee performance metrics. Such pay has been a significant component of compensation for executives and other key personnel at many firms in the financial sector. Many argue that such compensation contributed to the 2007-2009 financial crisis by incentivizing pivotal financial firm personnel to take excessive, and in retrospect, dangerous risks that were financially problematic for their firms. They argue that such compensation could still potentially pose problems and encourage firm personnel to take excessive risks. As an example, in September 2016, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was fined $185 million for illegal sales practices, which might have been motivated by incentive-based compensation arrangements. In addition to the fine, at issue is whether the Wells Fargo incident highlights the potential usefulness of the Dodd-Frank incentive-based compensation clawback provision.", "In July 2010, in response to the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. 111-203). Section 956 of the law directed financial regulators to adopt new rules that jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines aimed at prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that might encourage inappropriate risks at financial institutions. These regulators, the Agencies, are the National Credit Union Association, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "In April 2016, after releasing an ultimately unimplemented proposal in 2011, the Agencies proposed new rules to implement Section 956. The proposal has a three-tiered protocol in which the stringency of incentive compensation limits grow as an entity's consolidated asset total increases: Level 1, $250 billion and up; Level 2, $50 billion to $250 billion; and Level 3, $1 billion to $50 billion. Public comment period for the proposal was through July 22, 2016. The proposal will then require the approval of each agency in order to be finalized and adopted.", "Level 1 and Level 2 institutions must comply with enhanced requirements as to the structure of their incentive compensation for senior executive officers (i.e., various top corporate leaders, including the president, the chief executive officer, and the chief operating officer) and significant risk-takers (i.e., top paid non-senior employees). For example, a Level 1 institution would be required to defer at least 60% of a senior executive officer's qualifying incentive-based compensation and 50% of a significant risk-taker's qualifying incentive-based compensation for up to four years. Senior executive officers' and significant risk-takers' incentive-based compensation awarded under the long-term incentive plan would be deferred by 60% and 50%, respectively, for at least two years. A Level 2 institution would be required to defer at least 50% of a senior executive officer's qualifying incentive-based compensation and 40% of a significant risk-taker's qualifying incentive-based compensation for at least three years.", "Senior executives and significant risk-takers at Level 1 and 2 institutions would also be subject to reductions in previously earned incentive compensation (i.e., forfeiture and downward adjustment) in the event of certain behaviors, including when (1) deviation from risk parameters causes a firm's poor financial performance, or (2) inappropriate risk-taking occurs regardless of the impact on the firm's financial performance. Those employees could also have their vested incentive compensation clawed back by their employer under conditions determined by the employer, including (1) the existence of significant financial or reputational harm caused by the employee's actions; (2) fraudulent conduct by the employee; or (3) intentional misrepresentations on the part of the employee."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Section 956 of Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) requires financial regulators to adopt new rules placing certain limitations on the use of incentive or incentive-based compensation at financial firms.

Some have found little evidence that the compensation structures directly affected financial firms' performance during the crisis.", "For example, Martin Conyon, a senior fellow at the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, observed, ", "There's been plenty of consultant research and academic research that has looked at the structure of incentives, in banking in particular, and whether there was a cause or link between those incentives and the subsequent financial crisis. And it's not clear\u2014it hasn't been demonstrated in ways that pass muster.", "If structured properly, incentive compensation arrangements, often in the form of bonuses, stocks, or stock options, can serve as an employee recruitment, retention, and performance motivational tool while also helping to align a company's goals with those of its executives, employees, and shareholders. Moreover, after surveying research on the role of financial-sector compensation structures on the financial crisis, the SEC staff observed,", "[T]here are also studies that argue that compensation structures were not responsible for the differential risk-taking and performance of financial institutions during crises. In particular, a study argues that the differential risk culture across banks determines the differential performance of these institutions. For example, banks that performed poorly during the 1998 crisis were also found to perform poorly, and had higher failure rates, during the recent financial crisis. Another recent study argues that, prior to 2008, risk-taking was inherently different across financial institutions and the fact that high-risk financial institutions paid high amounts of compensation to their executives was not an indicator of excessive compensation practices but represented compensation for the additional risk to which executives' wealth was exposed.", "The presence of a number of mitigating factors may explain why evidence is inconclusive on the effects of incentive-based compensation on inappropriate risk-taking. One such factor is corporate governance and, more specifically, the board of directors oversight over executive compensation.", "Others, however, have found a causal connection and concluded that the prevalence of poorly structured incentive-based compensation arrangements at various financial institutions encouraged excessively risky behavior that contributed to financial firms' problems, which ultimately helped lead to the crisis. ", "For example, during the crisis, Sheila Bair, then chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, observed,", "The crisis has shown that most financial-institution compensation systems were not properly linked to risk management. Formula-driven compensation allows high short-term profits to be translated into generous bonus payments, without regard to any longer-term risks\u2026. A similar dynamic was at work in the mortgage markets. Mortgage brokers and bankers went into the subprime and other risky markets because these markets generated high returns not just for investors but also for the originators themselves. The standard compensation practice of mortgage brokers and bankers was based on the volume of loans originated rather than the performance and quality of the loans made\u2026.\"", "The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was a congressionally created panel charged with examining the causes of the financial crisis. Among other things, the majority view on the panel's 2011 study concluded that \"compensation structures were skewed all along the mortgage securitization chain, from people who originated mortgages to people on Wall Street who packaged them into securities.\"", "Others have made similar observations:", "Non-executive [pay] incentives .\u2026 significantly affected bank risk-taking prior to the 2007 financial crisis; and the structure, as well as the level of those incentives, was determined largely by the market's demand for talent\u2026. Among banks, however, combining performance-based pay with competition, where employees can move from one employer to the next, has had perverse results. Greater risk-taking can increase short-term bank profits and, in turn, the amount a non-executive is paid, potentially at the expense of long-term bank value. ", "In greater detail, various financial regulators collectively spoke of a nexus between incentive compensation and potential financial loss:", "Some compensation arrangements rewarded employees\u2014including non-executive personnel like traders with large position limits, underwriters, and loan officers\u2014for increasing an institution's revenue or short-term profit without sufficient recognition of the risks the employees' activities posed to the institutions, and therefore potentially to the broader financial system. Traders with large position limits, underwriters, and loan officers are three examples of non-executive personnel who had the ability to expose an institution to material amounts of risk. Significant losses caused by actions of individual traders or trading groups occurred at some of the largest financial institutions during and after the financial crisis.", "An attendant observation spoke of the corrosive long-term corporate impact that poorly designed bonus-based incentive compensation schemes were believed to have had on various financial institutions, another observer noted, \"[T]he revenues that [often] served as the basis for calculating bonuses were generated immediately, while the risk outcomes might not have been realized for months or years after the transactions were completed.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Dodd-Frank Act Incentive Compensation Mandate: Section 956", "paragraphs": ["Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act represents an attempt to reduce the presence of problematically risky financial-sector incentive-based compensation arrangements.

Financial institutions with $1 billion or more in consolidated assets would have been required to have policies and procedures necessary for ensuring compliance with the proposal. They also would have been prohibited from providing incentive compensation that encouraged inappropriate risk-taking, which could lead to material financial losses to applicable employees, including executive officers and non-executives employees whose activities could expose the firms to material financial loss. In addition, the financial firms would have been required to adopt incentive compensation practices that (1) provided an appropriate balance between risk and financial rewards; (2) were compatible with effective risk management and controls; and (3) were bolstered by a robust corporate governance mechanism.", "Also under the proposal, large financial institutions , generally defined as firms with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, but also including credit unions and all Federal Home Loan banks with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more, would have been required to adopt policies that ensured that executive officers and other key employees deferred at least half of their annual incentive compensation awards for at least three years.", "In addition, the proposal would have required the large financial institutions to have policies implemented and overseen by a firm's board of directors that identified non-executive employees with the ability to expose the institution to potentially substantial losses relative to its size, including securities traders with relatively large position limits. The large financial institution boards would have also been required to review and approve such non-executive employees' incentive-based compensation. ", "The 2011 proposal elicited some 10,000 responses, most in the form of a few types of largely identical form letters. According to the Agencies, the respondents included an array of community organizations groups, labor unions, and pension funds that generally advised the Agencies to strengthen the proposal, including increasing the duration of or the amount of incentive pay subject to the mandatory deferral provision. ", "By contrast, several financial institutions and financial industry trade groups reportedly recommended that the Agencies issue guidelines instead of rules for implementing Section 956. Many financial industry-based commenters also reportedly expressed opposition to the proposal's mandatory deferral provision with several arguing that it would potentially undermine a firm's ability to both attract and retain vital employees.

Firms have raised base salaries for some employees, and now pay a smaller share of bonuses in the current year while a larger share is deferred to future years (usually for a period of three to five years) in the form of cash, stock options or other types of compensation. Clawback provisions [which authorize firms to confiscate earlier incentive compensation payments] are also more frequently being adopted, and a larger share of bonuses is now being paid outside the traditional bonus period, making it harder to distinguish bonuses from base salaries. Despite these actions, bonuses remain an important part of total compensation packages paid to securities industry employees. In March 2015, OSC estimated that the bonus pool paid to the City's securities industry employees for work performed in 2014, including bonus payments deferred from prior years, reached $28.5 billion \u2026. This was the third-highest level ever and the highest level since the financial crisis. ", "In April 2016, the Agencies issued a new incentive compensation proposal (or re-proposal) to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Various reports have indicated that at least part of the regulators' challenge for the Agencies in formulating incentive compensation standards for the 2016 proposal involved the marked differences in compensation arrangements between banks and some of the entities overseen by the SEC, including hedge funds and private equity funds: Bank compensation tends to entail a fixed salary, equity in the company, and bonuses awarded at year's end. Although asset managers at SEC-regulated entities earn salaries, they are also typically paid through fees based on a fund's asset size and its investment performance.", "The re-proposal expands the more restrictive incentive compensation requirements in the 2011 proposal for senior employees, including the chief executive officer, to a larger group of financial institutions and to a new group of non-senior executive employees defined as significant risk-takers , who are non-senior employees in a position to subject their employer to significant risk or who are among the higher paid firm employees.", "The six regulators who comprise the Agencies will receive public comments on the proposal through July 22, 2016. To be finalized and adopted, the proposal will require the approval of each of them. Martin J.

Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley combined, the top earning 5% of employees under that protocol would collectively amount to a little less than 52,000 workers. However, the actual number of subject employees if the proposal is enacted could be less than that because it is unclear what proportion of those workers would meet the other requirement of having at least a third of their total compensation in incentive-based pay.", "In addition to the applicable banking institutions, certain SEC-regulated broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, are also likely to be under the proposal's regulatory ambit if enacted. The agency estimated that 131 registered broker-dealers and about 669 investment advisers would likely be CFIs under the implemented proposal. It then projected that 49 of those 131 broker-dealers would likely be Level 1 or Level 2 CFIs and 82 would be Level 3. Of the agency's estimated 669 CFI investment advisers under the proposal, 18 were projected to be in Level 1, 21 were projected to be in Level 2, and 630 were projected to be in Level 3. Many of those 18 projected Level 1 investment advisers are reportedly bank-owned entities.", "In this context, there are indications that a number of investment advisers to private equity funds or hedge funds who manage asset levels that exceed the Level 1 CFI asset threshold ($250 billion) in the proposal could avoid that more rigorous classification level. This is because under the proposal, advisers would be able to exclude \"non-proprietary\" assets on their balance sheets, including assets that they hold on their clients' behalf. For example, the large private equity, the Blackstone Group, reportedly manages about $350 billion in assets, but only has about $20 billion in proprietary assets. Reports say that this would mean that Blackstone would likely face a considerably less rigorous incentive compensation regulatory regime under an adopted proposal than would likely Level 1 bank-based CFIs such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.", "Accordingly, some observers say that this regulatory disparity could result in venture capital funds, hedge funds, or private equity firms such as BlackRock, that largely handle other people's money, facing less restrictive limits on their pay practices than large banks. As such, they caution that this could lead to a scenario in which large banks have a competitive disadvantage in the recruitment and retention of senior executives and other key personnel vis-\u00e0-vis less affected financial entities like hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds. ", "Peter Wallison, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, has raised concerns over the proposal's potentially negative impact on the overall volume of bank loans. He has argued that if the proposal were adopted, various bank officers would have personal incentives not to take on the risk of approving the loan, noting that \"it isn't just the bank's financial health but also the bank officer's\u2014the contemplated new house, the kids' college tuition\u2014on the line.\" Under such a regulatory regime, Mr. Wallison noted that the bank officer could decide to place his own \"financial well-being\" over that of his business customers. Ultimately, Mr. Wallison warned that similar behavior by a multitude of loan officers across the nation would translate into a reduction in financial risk-taking and as a result, a large contraction in available credit.", "Others, however, question the plausibility of the aforementioned scenarios in which an adopted proposal would result in significant changes at large banks regarding their attractiveness to certain key personnel and the volume of loans that they might make. Instead, they argue that the proposal would probably not have a significant impact because bank compensation practices have been moving steadily in the direction of the proposal's provisions since the end of the financial crisis more than a half decade ago.
