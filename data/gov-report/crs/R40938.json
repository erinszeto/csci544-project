Human rights organizations have expressed concerns about the deterioration of democratic institutions and threats to freedom of expression under the Ch\u00e1vez government. President Ch\u00e1vez won reelection to another six-year term on October 7, 2012, by a margin of 11%, capturing about 55% of the vote compared to 44% for opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. On December 11, 2012, however, Ch\u00e1vez faced a fourth difficult operation in Cuba for an undisclosed form of cancer that has raised questions about Venezuela's political future. Because of significant health complications, Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced on January 8, 2013, that President Ch\u00e1vez would not be sworn into office on January 10 as planned, but that he would be sworn into office at a later date, a decision supported by Venezuela's Supreme Court. Looking ahead, if President Ch\u00e1vez does not recover, the Constitution calls for a new election to be held within 30 days if the president dies or is incapacitated during the first four years of his term.", "U.S. Policy", "The United States traditionally has had close relations with Venezuela, a major supplier of foreign oil, but there has been friction in relations under the Ch\u00e1vez government. Over the years, U.S. officials have expressed concerns about human rights, Venezuela's military arms purchases, its relations with Iran, and its efforts to export its brand of populism to other Latin American countries. Declining cooperation on anti-drug and anti-terrorism efforts has been a major concern. The United States has imposed sanctions: on several Venezuelan government and military officials for allegedly helping the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) with drug and weapons trafficking; on three Venezuelan companies for providing support to Iran; and on several Venezuelan individuals for providing support to Hezbollah. Despite tensions in relations, the Obama Administration remains committed to seeking constructive engagement with Venezuela, focusing on such areas as anti-drug and counter-terrorism efforts. In the aftermath of President Ch\u00e1vez's reelection, the White House, while acknowledging differences with President Ch\u00e1vez, congratulated the Venezuelan people on the high level of participation and the relatively peaceful election process.", "Legislative Initiatives", "As in past years, there were concerns in the 112th Congress regarding the state of Venezuela's democracy and human rights situation and its deepening relations with Iran, and these concerns will likely continue in the 113th Congress. The 112th Congress approved H.R. 3783 (P.L. 112-220), which requires the Administration to conduct an assessment and present \"a strategy to address Iran's growing hostile presence and activity in the Western Hemisphere.\" Other initiatives that were not approved include: H.R. 2542, which would have withheld some assistance to the Organization of American States unless that body took action to invoke the Inter-American Democratic Charter regarding the status of democracy in Venezuela; H.R. 2583, which included a provision prohibiting aid to the government of Venezuela; and H.Res. 247, which would have called on the Secretary of State to designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism.", "In action on FY2013 foreign aid appropriations, the report to the House Appropriations Committee bill, H.R. 5857 (H.Rept. 112-494, reported May 25, 2012), directs that $5 million in Economic Support Funds be provided for democracy programs in Venezuela, the same amount appropriated in FY2012, and $2 million more than requested by the Administration. In contrast, the report to the Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 3241 (S.Rept. 112-172, reported May 24, 2012), recommends $3 million for democracy programs in Venezuela to be administered by the National Endowment for Democracy. Ultimately, the 112th Congress did not complete action on a FY2013 full-year foreign operations appropriations measure, but it did approve a Continuing Appropriations Resolution, FY2013 (P.L. 112-175) in September 2012, which funds regular foreign aid accounts at the same level as in FY2012, plus 0.612% through March 27, 2013. Specific country accounts, however, are left to the discretion of responsible agencies. The 113th Congress will need to address foreign aid appropriations for the balance of FY2013.", "Note: This report provides background on political and economic changes in Venezuela, U.S. policy, and U.S. legislative action and initiatives from 2009-2012 covering the 111th and 112th Congress.

A day later, on January 9, 2013, Venezuela's Supreme Court upheld this interpretation of the Constitution, maintaining that Ch\u00e1vez could take the oath of office before the Supreme Court at a later date when his health improves. Some opposition leaders and some Venezuelan legal scholars had argued that the January 10 inauguration date was fixed by Article 231, and that since Ch\u00e1vez could not be sworn in on that date, then the President of the National Assembly should have been sworn in as interim or caretaker President until either a new election was held or Ch\u00e1vez recovered. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles appeared to accept the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution, but maintained that it did not end the uncertainties facing the country.

The watershed election, in which former coup leader Ch\u00e1vez received 56% of the vote (16% more than his closest rival), illustrated Venezuelans' rejection of the country's two traditional parties, Democratic Action (AD) and the Social Christian party (COPEI), which had dominated Venezuelan politics for much of the past 40 years. Elected to a five-year term, Ch\u00e1vez was the candidate of the Patriotic Pole, a left-leaning coalition of 15 parties, with Ch\u00e1vez's own Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) the main party in the coalition.", "Most observers attribute Ch\u00e1vez's rise to power to Venezuelans' disillusionment with politicians whom they judge to have squandered the country's oil wealth through poor management and endemic corruption. A central theme of his campaign was constitutional reform; Ch\u00e1vez asserted that the system in place allowed a small elite class to dominate Congress and that revenues from the state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA), had been wasted.", "Although Venezuela had one of the most stable political systems in Latin America from 1958 until 1989, after that period numerous economic and political challenges plagued the country and the power of the two traditional parties began to erode. Former President Carlos Andres Perez, inaugurated to a five-year term in February 1989, initiated an austerity program that fueled riots and street violence in which several hundred people were killed. In 1992, two attempted military coups threatened the Perez presidency, one led by Ch\u00e1vez himself, who at the time was a lieutenant colonel railing against corruption and poverty. Ultimately the legislature dismissed President Perez from office in May 1993 on charges of misusing public funds, although some observers assert that the president's unpopular economic reform program was the real reason for his ouster. The election of elder statesman and former President Rafael Caldera as president in December 1993 brought a measure of political stability to the country, but the Caldera government soon faced a severe banking crisis that cost the government more than $10 billion. While the macro-economy began to improve in 1997, a rapid decline in the price of oil brought about a deep recession beginning in 1998.", "In the first several years of President Ch\u00e1vez's rule, Venezuela underwent enormous political changes and even received a new name for the country, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, named after the 19 th century South American liberator Simon Bolivar, whom Ch\u00e1vez often invokes. In 1999, Venezuelans went to the polls on three occasions\u2014to establish a constituent assembly that would draft a new constitution, to elect the membership of the 165-member constituent assembly, and to approve the new constitution\u2014and each time delivered victory to President Ch\u00e1vez. The new document revamped political institutions, including the elimination of the Senate and establishment of a unicameral National Assembly, and expanded the presidential term of office from five to six years, with the possibility of immediate reelection for a second term. Under the new constitution, voters once again went to the polls in July 2000 for a so-called mega-election, in which the president, national legislators, and state and municipal officials were selected. President Ch\u00e1vez easily won election to a new six-year term, capturing about 60% of the vote while his opponent, fellow former coup leader Francisco Arias, received 38%. Ch\u00e1vez's Patriotic Pole coalition also captured 14 of 23 governorships and a majority of seats in the National Assembly.", "Although President Ch\u00e1vez remained widely popular until mid-2001, his standing eroded after that, amid concerns that he was imposing a leftist agenda on the country and that his government was ineffective in improving living conditions in Venezuela. In April 2002, massive opposition protests and pressure by the military led to the ouster of Ch\u00e1vez from power for less than three days. He ultimately was restored to power by the military, however, after an interim president alienated the military and public by taking hardline measures, including the suspension of the constitution. In the aftermath of Ch\u00e1vez's brief ouster from power, the political opposition continued to press for his removal from office, first through a general strike that resulted in an economic downturn in 2002 and 2003, and then through a recall referendum that ultimately was held in August 2004 and which Ch\u00e1vez won by a substantial margin. In 2004, the Ch\u00e1vez government moved to purge and pack the Supreme Court with its own supporters in a move that dealt a blow to judicial independence. The political opposition boycotted legislative elections in December 2005, which led to domination of the National Assembly by Ch\u00e1vez supporters.", "The rise in world oil prices beginning in 2004 fueled the rebound of the economy and helped support an array of social programs and services known as \"missions\" that helped reduce poverty by some 20% by 2007. In large part because of the economic rebound and attention to social programs, Ch\u00e1vez was reelected to another six-year term in December 2006 in a landslide, with almost 63% of the vote compared to almost 37% for opposition candidate Manuel Rosales.", "After he was reelected, however, even many Ch\u00e1vez supporters became concerned that the government was becoming too radicalized. Ch\u00e1vez's May 2007 closure of a popular Venezuelan television station that was critical of the government, Radio Caracas Television (RCTV), sparked significant protests and worldwide condemnation. Ch\u00e1vez also proposed a far-reaching constitutional amendment package that would have moved Venezuela toward a new model of development known as \"socialism in the 21 st century,\" but this was defeated by a close margin in a December 2007 national referendum. University students took the lead in demonstrations against the closure of RCTV, and also played a major role in defeating the constitutional reform.", "In 2008, President Ch\u00e1vez moved to unite his supporters into a single party\u2014the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV)\u2014although several parties that had supported Ch\u00e1vez in the past declined to join. The Venezuelan government also continued to move forward with nationalizations in key industries, including food companies, cement companies, and the country's largest steel maker; these followed the previous nationalization of electricity companies and the country's largest telecommunications company and the conversion of operating agreements and strategic associations with foreign companies in the oil sector to majority Venezuelan government control.", "State and local elections held in November 2008 revealed a mixed picture of support for the government and the opposition. Pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates won 17 of the 22 governors' races, while the opposition won governorships in three of the country's most populous states, Zulia, Miranda, and Carabobo, as well as the states of Nueva Esparta and T\u00e1chira (see Figure 1 for a map of Venezuela). At the municipal level, pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates won over 80% of the more than 300 mayoral races, while the opposition won the balance. Among the opposition's mayoral successes were races for the metropolitan mayor of Caracas, four out of the five smaller municipalities that make up Caracas (including the poor municipality of Sucre), and the country's second-largest city, Maracaibo.", "Leading up to the November elections, President Ch\u00e1vez's PSUV held primary elections around the country on June 1, 2008, to select candidates, although the process was criticized for a lack of transparency. The opposition initially had difficulty in agreeing on a single slate of candidates so as not to split the opposition vote, but by the end of September 2008 had agreed on a unified candidate for most governor races. The opposition includes newer parties such as Primero Justicia (PJ, Justice First), Proyecto Venezuela (Project Venezuela), and Un Nuevo Tempo (UNT, A New Era); leftist parties that defected from the Chavista coalition such as the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS, Movement toward Socialism) and Por la Democracia, Social ( Podemos , For Social Democracy); and the traditional political parties from the past such as AD and COPEI.", "One of the major problems for the opposition was that the Venezuelan government's comptroller general disqualified 272 individuals (down from almost 400 originally disqualified) from running for office, purportedly for cases involving the misuse of government funds. There were several challenges to Venezuela's Supreme Court that the comptroller general's action violated the Constitution, but on August 5, 2008, Venezuela's Supreme Court upheld the disqualifications. The Venezuelan government maintained that the majority of those disqualified were from the ranks of its own supporters, while the opposition maintained that a large percentage were from the opposition, including several high-profile opposition candidates. Among those excluded was Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the popular mayor of Chacao, who was seeking to run for mayor of Caracas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Political Developments: 2009-2013", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "February 15, 2009, Term Limits Referendum", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of the state and municipal elections in November 2008, President Ch\u00e1vez announced that he would move ahead with plans to seek changes to the constitution that would lift the two-term limit for the office of the presidency. This would allow him to run for reelection in 2012 and beyond. The National Assembly voted on January 14, 2009, to hold a referendum on the constitutional amendment, expanding it further so that the abolition of term limits would apply to all elected government officials. As a result, the proposed amendment pertained to the president, all state and municipal officials, and deputies to the National Assembly. The referendum was scheduled for February 15, 2009, and various polls indicated that the vote would be close. Ultimately, with a participation rate of 70%, Venezuelans approved the constitutional reform with almost 55% voting for it and 45% voting against it. President Ch\u00e1vez proclaimed that the vote was a victory for the Bolivarian Revolution, and virtually promised that he would run for reelection in 2012.", "The amendment was controversial given the defeat of the government's constitutional reform package in December 2007, which had included an amendment that would have removed the presidential two-term limit. Venezuela's opposition maintained that President Ch\u00e1vez's effort to amend the constitution in 2009 was illegal because the constitution (Article 345) prohibits a constitutional reform that was rejected from being presented again to the National Assembly in the same constitutional period. According to this view, since the next National Assembly would not be elected until late 2010 and take office until early 2011, such an amendment should not have been considered until then. ", "Similar to the campaign against the government's December 2007 constitutional reform package, student groups played a leading role in the opposition to the abolishment of term limits in 2009. During the referendum campaign, Venezuelan security forces used tear gas, plastic bullets, and water cannons to disperse several student protests nationwide, although a massive student demonstration was allowed to take place in Caracas. Opposition parties again united against the referendum, including the democratic socialist Podemos party that had once supported President Ch\u00e1vez. ", "During the campaign, President Ch\u00e1vez argued that the constitutional change would only allow him to run again, but would not mean that he would be reelected or remain in power indefinitely. He maintained that he does not want to be \"president for life,\" but would like to remain in power until 2019 in order to ensure that his revolutionary project continues. Ch\u00e1vez campaigned vigorously for the amendment, and spent hours on state-run television in support of it. The president's support among many poor Venezuelans, who have benefited from increased social spending and programs, was an important factor in the vote. ", "One likely reason that President Ch\u00e1vez moved quickly with the referendum was the economic problems facing Venezuela due to the global financial crisis and the fall in the price of oil. With declining government revenue, his government faced the possibility of losing support if the economic situation deteriorated further, especially if the government was forced to cut back on domestic spending. Such a scenario could have made it more difficult for an amendment on term limits to be approved. Moreover, the National Assembly at the time almost completely dominated by Ch\u00e1vez supporters because the opposition boycotted the 2005 legislative elections. Assuming that the opposition would participate in the next legislative elections in 2010, the next National Assembly would likely include an invigorated opposition that could have made it more difficult for the government to advance a constitutional amendment to abolish term limits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "September 2010 Legislative Elections", "paragraphs": ["In Venezuela's September 26, 2010, elections for the 165-member National Assembly, pro-Ch\u00e1vez supporters won 98 seats while opposition parties won 67 seats. For the government, President Ch\u00e1vez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) won 94 seats, while other government supporters included one seat for the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) and three indigenous representatives. For the opposition, 10 parties of the opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unity Platform (MUD) won 65 seats, while the leftist Homeland for All (PPT) won 2 seats. Nationwide participation in the elections was high, with 66.45% participation (compared to almost 75% participation in the 2006 presidential race). ", "Even though the ruling party won a majority of seats, the result was viewed as a significant defeat for President Ch\u00e1vez because it denied his government the three-fifths majority (99 seats) needed to enact enabling laws that grant the president decree powers. It also denied the government the two-thirds majority (110 seats) needed for a variety of actions to ensure the enactment of the government's agenda, such as introducing or amending organic laws, approving constitutional reforms, and making certain government appointments. The combined opposition (MUD and PPT) also narrowly won the popular vote, capturing 51% of the vote compared to 49% for the ruling PSUV and its ally, the PCV. Nevertheless, the government was able to maintain a majority of seats because rural districts (where the government has strong support) elect a disproportionate number of legislators.", "In the lead-up to the elections, many observers had expected that the President Ch\u00e1vez's PSUV would retain a majority, but that the opposition coalition would gain substantial representation. The ruling party benefitted from the government's decision last year to redraw electoral districts. The PSUV also benefitted from significant resources, a nation-wide organization and electoral machine, and effective use of social network websites. The PSUV's campaign was dubbed Operation Demolition in light of President Ch\u00e1vez's call \"to demolish the opposition.\" Despite the PSUV's advantages, the legislative elections were held at a difficult time for the Ch\u00e1vez government and the opposition benefited from this. President Ch\u00e1vez's popularity had declined to less than 40% and there were considerable public concerns about the difficult economic situation and high rate of violent crime facing the country. ", "The Venezuelan government did not allow observers from the Organization of American States (OAS), the Carter Center, or other international groups with election monitoring experience, although it did permit each electoral coalition to invite 30 witnesses from abroad for the elections.

In February 2011, then-Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela described the Assembly's action as \"undermining the authority of the new assembly and thereby circumscribing popular will.\" The Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) also maintained that the law \"constitutes an illegitimate infringement on the new National Assembly's authority, subverting the will of the electorate.\" Until its expiration in June 2012, the enabling law was used by President Ch\u00e1vez more than 50 times, including decrees to change labor laws and the criminal code, along with a nationalization of the gold industry.

Venezuela's 2006 presidential election was characterized as free and fair by international observers with some irregularities, while 2010 national legislative elections were also characterized as free and fair by domestic observers with scattered irregularities, although there was criticism of the electoral law and the government's partisan use of state resources. ", "Venezuela's opposition held a unified primary on February 12, 2012, under the banner of the Mesa de la Unidad Democr\u00e1tica (MUD, Democratic Unity Roundtable) and chose Henrique Capriles Radonski in a landslide with about 62% of the vote in a five-candidate race (the next closest candidate, Pablo P\u00e9rez, governor of Zulia, captured about 30% of the vote). A member of the Primero Justicia (PJ, Justice First) party, Capriles is the governor of Miranda, Venezuela's second-most populous state, which includes several municipalities of metropolitan Caracas. Just over 2.9 million Venezuelans voted in the primary\u2014while this only represented about 16% of the 18 million Venezuelans registered to vote, primary organizers had expected far less. During the primary election, Capriles had a message of reconciliation and national unity. He pledged not to dismantle Ch\u00e1vez's social programs, but rather to improve them. Capriles\u2014who turned 40 in July 2012 \u2013 also represents a new generation of Venezuelan politicians not belonging to the older traditional parties that have been largely discredited.", "It was thought that the wide margin of the primary victory for Capriles would give him a boost in the general election race, but for much of the campaign he remained the underdog. President Ch\u00e1vez continued to retain high favorability ratings, and led opinion polls for much of the race, with a lead between 5% and 30%. Just weeks before the election, however, while Ch\u00e1vez still was favored by most polls, ranging from a 2% lead to a 20% lead, at least one poll showed Capriles winning by about 3%. Many observers contended that while Ch\u00e1vez remained favored to win by most polls, Capriles potentially might have pulled off an upset victory. Observers focused on two key factors in the race\u2014how undecided or independent voters would vote and to what extent each side would be able to mobilize their supporters. Capriles ran an energetic campaign traveling throughout the country with multiple campaign rallies each day, while the Ch\u00e1vez campaign reportedly was somewhat disorganized and limited in terms of campaign rallies because of Ch\u00e1vez's health.", "Nevertheless, Ch\u00e1vez had several distinct advantages in the presidential race. The Venezuelan economy has been growing strongly in 2012, with a forecast of 5% growth for the year, fueled by government spending made possible by high oil prices. Numerous social programs or \"missions\" of the government helped forged an emotional loyalty among Ch\u00e1vez supporters. This includes a well-publicized public housing program. Critics maintain the program had the purpose of boosting the popularity of the Ch\u00e1vez government for the upcoming election, and will do little to resolve the country's housing shortage. ", "Another significant advantage for Ch\u00e1vez is that his electoral campaign used state resources and state-controlled media for campaign purposes. This included the use of broadcast networks, which are required to air the president's frequent and lengthy political speeches. Observers maintain that the government's predominance in television media is overwhelming.", "There were several areas of vulnerability for President Ch\u00e1vez, however, that posed challenges to his support. These included Venezuelans' concerns about high rates of crime (including murder and kidnapping) and an economic situation characterized by high inflation and economic mismanagement that has led to periodic shortages of some food and consumer products and electricity outages.", "Earlier in 2012, a wildcard in the presidential race was Ch\u00e1vez's health status, but in July 2012 Ch\u00e1vez claimed to have bounced back from his second bout of an undisclosed form of cancer since mid2011; his campaign appearances, however, were far more limited than those of Capriles. If Ch\u00e1vez had been unable to run because of his health, many observers maintain that Capriles would have had a good chance at defeating another PSUV presidential candidate. ", "In the lead up to the election, some observers had concerns about the potential reaction of the Venezuelan military in the likelihood of an opposition victory. Before General Henry Rangel became defense minister, he maintained in a November 2010 press interview that military was \"wedded to [Venezuela's] socialist political project,\" and that neither the military nor the public would support an opposition government that would try to overturn the project. The comments raised doubts about whether the military would accept an opposition victory, although after becoming defense minister, then General Rangel said that the military would respect the result of the election whatever the result. ", "Some observers also had expressed concern about potential violence in the case of a close race, with fears centered on potential actions by radical elements on either side of the political divide who might pursue violence if their candidate did not win. Concerns about violence were heightened after two supporters of presidential candidate Henrique Capriles were shot and killed during a campaign event in the western state of Barinas on September 29, 2012. Capriles maintained that the killings reflected rising violence by Ch\u00e1vez supporters while the government maintains that the killings were an isolated event.

Soon after, on October 10, 2012, Capriles announced that he would run for reelection as governor of Miranda state in the December 16, 2012 regional elections running against former Vice President Eli\u00e1s Jaua who stepped down from his position the same day in order to run (see \" December 2012 State Elections \" below.)", "For the opposition, the election showed a significant strengthening of support \u2013 it received about 2.2 million more votes than in the last presidential election in 2006, and its share of the vote grew from almost 37% in 2006 to 44% in 2012.

Without legislative support, he would have faced difficulty in making significant policy changes. For the United States, however, an opposition victory would likely have reduced tensions in bilateral relations and allowed potential progress in the key areas of anti-drug and counterterrorism cooperation.", "For President Ch\u00e1vez, the election was his fourth presidential victory. It affirmed his longstanding popular support as well as support for his government's array of social programs that have helped raise living standards for many Venezuelans. In his victory speech, President Ch\u00e1vez congratulated the opposition for their participation and civic spirit and pledged to work with them.

", "President Ch\u00e1vez's health threats date back to June 2011, when the President underwent emergency surgery for a \"pelvic abscess.\" The initial operation took place on June 11, followed by another operation (date unknown) to remove a cancerous tumor. Rumors were abounding about Ch\u00e1vez's health until June 30, when Ch\u00e1vez, from Cuba, announced on Venezuelan television that he had cancer, although the president did not disclose the type of cancer he was battling. Several days later, Ch\u00e1vez returned to Caracas on July 4, 2011, in order to be in the country the next day for its bicentennial celebrating Venezuelan independence from Spain. Ch\u00e1vez traveled to Cuba several times for chemotherapy beginning in mid-July 2011, and by mid-October declared that he had beaten cancer. Ch\u00e1vez appeared to be frail in the summer and fall, and gave up most public appearances including his weekly Sunday television program, Alo Presidente .

He hosted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in early January 2012 and also returned to his weekly television program. In an apparent attempt to send a message that his health had returned, on January 13, 2012, Ch\u00e1vez gave a marathon address to Venezuela's National Assembly that lasted more than nine hours. ", "Just several weeks later, however, on February 21, 2012, Ch\u00e1vez announced that his doctors had found a new lesion in the same area of his pelvic region requiring surgery. He returned to Cuba for the surgery on February 28 and confirmed on March 4 that the lesion was malignant. Ch\u00e1vez headed home to Venezuela on March 16, but returned again to Cuba multiple times over the next three months for radiation treatment. The president has never disclosed the type of cancer that he is battling, but doctors reportedly have speculated that it is prostate, colon, or bladder cancer. In early July 2012, however, Ch\u00e1vez once again maintained that he was \"cancer free,\" and ready to take on a tough reelection campaign.", "After winning reelection to another six-year term, Ch\u00e1vez returned to Cuba in late November 2012 for medical treatment. Upon his return to Venezuela, Ch\u00e1vez announced on December 8, 2012, that his cancer had returned and that he would soon undergo a fourth cancer surgery in Cuba. Most significantly, Ch\u00e1vez announced his support for Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro if anything were to happen to him. (Maduro had been sworn into office on October 13, 2012, and retained his position as foreign minister, which he has held since 2006. Under Venezuela's Constitution, the president has the power to appoint and remove the vice president; it is not an elected position.) According to Ch\u00e1vez: \"If something happens that sidelines me, which under the Constitution requires a new presidential election, you should elect Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\" Ch\u00e1vez reportedly faced complications during and after his December 11 surgery, and while there were some indications of improvement by Christmas 2012, by year's end the President faced new respiratory complications. ", "Ch\u00e1vez's grave health condition has introduced a significant measure of uncertainty into Venezuela's political system. After considerable public speculation about the inauguration scheduled for January 10, 2013, Vice President Maduro announced on January 8 that Ch\u00e1vez would not be sworn in that day. Instead, the Vice President invoked Article 231 of the Constitution, maintaining that the provision allows the President to take the oath of office before the Supreme Court at a later date. ", "A day later, on January 9, 2013, Venezuela's Supreme Court upheld this interpretation of the Constitution, with the court's President, Luisa Estella Morales, maintaining that Ch\u00e1vez could take the oath of office before the Supreme Court at a later date when his health improves. Current government officials also would continue to fully exercise their functions after January 10, essentially allowing Vice President Maduro and other ministers to remain in power. The Supreme Court President also maintained that Ch\u00e1vez's medical treatment in Cuba was not a \"temporary absence\" involving Article 234 of the Constitution, but rather such a situation that was anticipated by Article 231, which allows for the oath of office to be taken at a later date. She also ruled out convening a medical board at this time to assess the health of the President (as outlined in Article 233 of the Constitution) that would certify whether Ch\u00e1vez's condition constituted permanent incapacity. (See Table 1 for the language of Venezuela's relevant constitutional provisions.)", "Some opposition leaders, as well as some Venezuelan legal scholars, have argued that the January 10 inauguration date is fixed by Article 231, and that since Ch\u00e1vez could not be sworn in on that date, then the President of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, should have been sworn in as interim or caretaker President until either a new election was held or Ch\u00e1vez recovered. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles appeared to accept the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution, but maintained that it did not end the uncertainties facing the country. He maintains that the court's decision was politically motivated to deal with a reported power struggle between Cabello and Vice President Maduro. According to Capriles: \"The excuses are over....Mr. Maduro, you have to step up and govern, and solve the problems of all Venezuelans now.\"", "Many Latin American leaders expressed hope for Ch\u00e1vez's recovery, and Brazil maintained that its support for the delay in the President's inauguration. Leaders from Bolivia, Ecuador, and Uruguay also announced that they would attend a rally in Caracas on January 10 to express their support for Ch\u00e1vez.", "The State Department has maintained that the potential succession issue as well as the delay of the presidential inauguration is one for Venezuelans to decide, not the United States, but has stressed that the decision needs to be consensual. According to a State Department spokesman: \"We do not believe that there is a made-in-America solution for Venezuela's transition. Only Venezuelans can make that set of decisions. This is the message that we are giving to Venezuelans of all stripes, that we want to see any transition be democratic, be constitutional, be open, be transparent, be legal within Venezuela, and that it has to be decided by Venezuelans.\"", "If Ch\u00e1vez does not recover, Venezuela will face a new presidential election. Article 233 of the Constitution requires that a new election is to be held within 30 days if the president dies or is incapacitated during the first four years of his term. President Ch\u00e1vez himself acknowledged before his recent operation in December 2012 that new elections would be needed if anything were to happen to him. In the scenario of a new election, while Henrique Capriles would likely be the opposition candidate, and would be advantaged by not having Ch\u00e1vez on the ballot, many observers contend that sympathy for Ch\u00e1vez would engender support for a Chavista candidate, most likely Vice President Maduro, aiming to protect Ch\u00e1vez's legacy and programs.

The country is classified by the World Bank as an upper middle income developing country because of its relatively high per capita income of $11,820 (2011).", "Despite Venezuela's oil wealth, economic conditions in the country deteriorated in the 1990s. The percentage of Venezuelans living in poverty (income of less than $2 a day) increased from 32.2% to 48.5% of the population between 1991 and 2000, while the percentage of the population in extreme poverty (income of less than $1 a day) increased from 11.8% in 1990 to 23.5% in 2000. ", "In 2002-2003, the country's political instability and polarization between the government of populist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and the political opposition contributed to a poor investment climate, capital flight, and declines in gross domestic product (GDP). A national strike orchestrated by the political opposition from late 2002 to early 2003 contributed to a contraction of the national economy by almost 9% in 2002 and 7.8% in 2003.", "From 2004-2008, however, Venezuela benefitted from the rise in world oil prices that began in 2004. Fueled by the windfall from oil price increases, the Venezuelan economy grew by over 18% in 2004 and averaged 8.6% growth annually from 2005 through 2008 (see Figure 2 ). The economic boom allowed President Ch\u00e1vez to move ahead with economic goals that fit into his \"Bolivarian revolution.\" These included the expansion of a state-led development model, renegotiation of contracts with large foreign investors (especially in the petroleum sector) for majority government control, and the restructuring of operations at the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A . (PdVSA). The government also nationalized numerous enterprises, including telecommunications, electricity, and steel companies, as well as cement, coffee, sugar, flour, and milk production facilities.", "The economic boom also allowed President Ch\u00e1vez to increase expenditures on social programs associated with his populist agenda. The government began implementing an array of social programs and services known as misiones or missions. There have been some 25 missions offering a wide array of services in the fields of education, health, nutrition, the environment, sports, culture, and housing, as well as targeted programs for indigenous rights and services for street children and adolescents. As a result of the booming economy and increased social spending, poverty rates in Venezuela declined from 48.6% in 2002 to 27.6% in 2008, with extreme poverty or indigence falling from 22.2% to 9.9% over the same period. ", "The global financial crisis and associated drop in the price of oil had significant negative effects on the Venezuelan economy, which contracted 3.2% in 2009 and 1.5% in 2010. This made Venezuela the only country in South America, and one of the few in the region, to continue to decline economically in 2010, and poverty rates increased slightly in that year. Economic growth returned in 2011, however, with a growth rate of 4.2% because of the rise in oil prices and because of increased central government expenditure. The government increased its fiscal spending in order to help Ch\u00e1vez in the October 2012 presidential election. With this spending and high oil prices, estimated growth for 2012 is 5%. (See Figure 2 .)", "The Venezuelan government continues to face significant economic challenges. Over the past four years, high levels of inflation, averaging almost 28% annually from 2008 to 2011, have eroded purchasing power. The estimate for 2012 is almost 21%. (See Figure 3 .) In addition to inflation, there have been periodic shortages of basic food staples and other products because of price controls that have stifled local production. The government's response to shortages has been to nationalize some domestic agricultural producers or distributors. ", "Venezuela's private sector describes the business community as being under siege from the government because some companies have been nationalized without compensation and without appropriate legal procedures being followed. In June 2010, Venezuelan authorities discovered 30,000 tons of rotten food at a government warehouse that was supposed to be delivered to state-run supermarkets known as Mercal . The scandal prompted widespread criticism of the government, and raised questions about its strategy of taking over more economic activities. Since 2002, hundreds of companies, both domestic and foreign, have been nationalized. Companies that have been nationalized under the Ch\u00e1vez government are in a variety of economic sectors, including energy, food and agriculture, finance, heavy industry, gold, steel, telecommunications, electricity, transportation, and tourism.", "While the government maintains that it will provide compensation for the nationalizations, foreign companies are often forced to seek settlement through international arbitration. There are currently 28 pending cases against Venezuela at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) affiliated with the World Bank. In January 2012, ExxonMobil won a settlement valued at some $900 million at the International Court of Arbitration (of the International Chamber of Commerce). The Ch\u00e1vez government reportedly welcomed the settlement because ExxonMobil had sought much more, but the company has another outstanding case against Venezuela at the ICSID that could provide it with a potentially much more significant settlement. President Ch\u00e1vez announced in early January 2012 that he would not recognize any decision made by the ICSID, and later in the month his government began procedures to withdraw from the organization. Some analysts, however, maintain that that the withdrawal process will be complex and could take as long as 15 years and involve Venezuela's renegotiation of bilateral investment treaties with over 20 countries.", "In January 2010, the Venezuelan government took action to shore up its fiscal situation by devaluing Venezuela's currency, the bolivar fuerte , which increased the value of its oil earnings and boosted government revenues. The government shifted the official exchange rate from Bolivares Fuertes (BsF) 2.15/U.S. $1 to BsF2.6/U.S.$1 for essential imports such as food, medicine, and for public-sector projects and strategic sectors, and established a second fixed exchange rate of BsF4.3/U.S.$1 for other imports. The increased revenue enabled the government to continue spending ahead of the September 2010 legislative elections, but also increased inflationary pressure. ", "In January 2011, the government unified the two fixed foreign exchange rates by eliminating the BsF2.6/U.S.$1 rate for essential imports in favor of a rate of BsF4.3/U.S.$1 for all imports. According to some analysts, the government's move appears to be an effort to reduce the complexity of the multiple exchange-rate system, but the action has raised concerns about an increase in inflation. The government still retains an exchange rate of BsF5.4/U.S.$1 for bond swaps operated by the Central Bank, while the illegal black market rate is estimated at BsF9.3/U.S.$1, a reflection of the continued overvaluation of Venezuela's currency. Given the overvaluation, economic analysts expect Venezuela to devalue its currency again in 2013.", "As noted above, Venezuela still remains highly dependent on oil, which accounts for some 90% of its exports. Because of its substantial oil exports, the country generally runs a positive trade balance. The country's trade surplus began to grow significantly as oil prices began to increase in 2004. Venezuela's trade surplus grew from $16.7 billion in 2003 to a high of $44 billion in 2008. The decline in the price of oil beginning in 2009 reduced the country's exports by about 40%, from $95 billion in 2008 to $57 billion in 2009. During the same period, imports declined at a slower rate so that the trade surplus declined to almost $18 billion in 2009. Since then, with the recovery and increase of oil prices, the trade surplus grew to $27 billion in 2010 and $46 billion in 2011. (See Table 2 .)", "In terms of export markets, Venezuela's oil-based economy is highly dependent on the United States and has been for many years, even though the U.S. share of Venezuela's oil exports has been declining in recent years. The country is a major supplier of foreign oil to the United States, providing almost 10% of U.S. crude oil imports in 2011. In 2010, the United States was the destination of about 40% of Venezuela's total exports. Ten years earlier\u2014in 2000\u2014about 55% of Venezuela's exports were destined for the United States. The percentage of Venezuela's imports that come from the United States has also declined somewhat over time, although the United States still remains the single largest country of origin for Venezuelan imports.

Declining Venezuelan cooperation on antidrug and antiterrorism efforts also has been a U.S. concern. Since 2005, Venezuela has been designated annually (by President Bush and President Obama) as a country that has failed to adhere to its international anti-drug obligations.

After Ch\u00e1vez's ouster, the United States expressed solidarity with the Venezuelan people and maintained that undemocratic actions committed or encouraged by the Ch\u00e1vez administration had provoked the political crisis. Yet at the same time, the leader of the interim government was dismantling the National Assembly, firing the Supreme Court, and suspending the Constitution. The interim government's hardline actions resulted in its loss of support from the Venezuelan military, and paved the way for Ch\u00e1vez's return to power. With Ch\u00e1vez's return, the United States called on him to heed the message sent by the Venezuelan people by correcting the course of his administration and \"governing in a fully democratic manner.\" In contrast, many Latin American nations immediately condemned the overthrow of Ch\u00e1vez, labeling it a coup. The failure of the United States to quickly condemn the coup and instead to criticize President Ch\u00e1vez upon his return to power set the stages for continued deterioration in U.S.-Venezuelan relations.

In March 2010, the president of Globovisi\u00f3n , Guillermo Zuloaga, was arrested for making remarks deemed offensive to President Ch\u00e1vez at a meeting in Aruba of the Inter-American Press Association. After strong domestic and international criticism, Zuloaga was released, but in June 2010, he fled the country after another arrest warrant charged him with hoarding cars in an effort to capitalize on future price increases at his car dealership. In October 2011, the Venezuelan government fined Globovisi\u00f3n about $2.1 million for extensive coverage of a month-long standoff between prisoners and government troops at a large prison outside Caracas.

Cuba benefits from a preferential oil agreement with Venezuela signed in 2000, which provides Cuba with more than 90,000 barrels of oil per day. In payment for the oil, Cuba has provided extensive services to Venezuela, including thousands of medical personnel and advisers in a number of other areas, including sports, education, agriculture, communications, and even security programs involving the military.

PdVSA has signed an offshore oil exploration and production agreement with Cupet, Cuba's state-oil company (although in early November 2012, Cuba announced that an oil well drilled offshore Cuba by PdVSA was not commercially viable). Because of Venezuela's oil assistance, the country is very much an economic lifeline for Cuba. There would be significant economic disruption in Cuba if the flow of Venezuelan oil were curtailed.

Under the program, Venezuela initially offered to supply oil to the region on preferential terms with 50% of the oil financed over 25 years at an annual interest rate of 1%. At a July 2008 PetroCaribe summit, President Ch\u00e1vez announced that up to 60% of the oil could be financed while oil prices remained over $100 a barrel, and this would rise to 70% financed if oil prices rise to over $150 a barrel. Most Caribbean nations are members of PetroCaribe, with the exception of Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. In Central America, Nicaragua and Honduras joined PetroCaribe in 2007 and Guatemala joined in July 2008. Venezuela stopped exporting preferential oil to Honduras under PetroCaribe in 2009 after the ouster of Honduran President Zelaya, but the new Honduran government of President Porfirio Lobo rejoined the program in January 2012. PetroCaribe also has the goal of putting in place a regional supply, refining, and transportation and storage network, and establishing a development fund for those countries participating in the program.", "Favorable opinions of President Ch\u00e1vez in Latin America are weak. As reflected in the annual Latinobar\u00f3metro public opinion survey of Latin American countries, President Ch\u00e1vez has been one of the least favorite leaders in the Americas over the past several years. His rating improved in the 2011 survey, likely because of sympathy because of his illness, but he still ranked among the least favorite leaders in the region.

Security Council Resolutions\u20141737 (2006), 1747 (2007), and 1803 (2008)\u2014that imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear technology transfers. In September 2010, President Ch\u00e1vez maintained that his government was carrying out initial studies into starting a nuclear energy program. In October 2010, Russia agreed to help Venezuela build its first nuclear power plant, but in March 2011, in the aftermath of Japan's nuclear plant disaster, President Ch\u00e1vez said that he was freezing plans for a nuclear power program.", "In September 2009, comments by Venezuelan officials offered conflicting information about Iran's support for Venezuela's search for uranium deposits. Venezuelan Minister of Basic Industry and Mining Rodolfo Sanz said that Iran was assisting Venezuela in detecting uranium reserves in the west and southwest of Venezuela. Subsequently, however, Venezuela's Minister of Science, Technology, and Intermediary Industry Jesse Chacon denied that Iran was helping Venezuela seek uranium, while Venezuela's Minister of Energy Rafael Ramirez maintained that Venezuela has yet to develop a plan to explore or exploit its uranium deposits. Observers point out that Venezuela does not currently mine uranium. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 (June 9, 2010) bars Iranian investment in uranium mining projects abroad. ", "Another reason for U.S. concerns about Iran's deepening relations with Latin America is its ties to Hezbollah, a State Department-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. Hezbollah, along with Iran, is reported to have been linked to two bombings against Jewish targets in Argentina in the early 1990s: the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 30 people and the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people. The United States has imposed sanctions on individuals and companies in Latin America for providing support to Hezbollah. Specifically as it relates to Venezuela, in June 2008, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Venezuelans\u2014Ghazi Nasr al Din (a Venezuelan diplomat serving in Lebanon) and Fawzi Kan'an\u2014for providing financial and other support to Hezbollah. U.S. citizens are prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the two Venezuelans, including any business with two travel agencies in Caracas owned by Kan'an. In June 2012, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on three dual Lebanese-Venezuelan citizens and a company in Venezuela involved in an international drug trafficking network run by Lebanese citizen Ayman Joumaa that has links to Hezbollah.", "The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 (issued in July 2012) maintained that \"there were credible reports that Hizballah sympathizers and supporters engaged in fundraising and support activity in Venezuela.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Initiatives in the 112th Congress", "paragraphs": ["P.L. 112-220 ( H.R. 3783 ) .
