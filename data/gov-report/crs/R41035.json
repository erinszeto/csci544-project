Some of those statutes outlaw crimes committed aboard a commercial airliner; some, crimes committed against the aircraft itself; others, crimes involving the use of firearms or explosives; still others, crimes committed for terrorist purposes. Within each category, the law reaches co-conspirators and other accomplices. Moreover, although most apply when committed within the United States, many apply to terrorist attacks overseas, particularly but necessarily, when the victims are Americans or U.S. airlines."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["A handful of terrorists have been prosecuted in federal court for attacks on commercial airlines or their passengers. Most often they have been charged with several crimes. Prosecution for some crimes depends upon where they were committed; some on the nationality of the airline, of the victim, or of the offender; some on whether the crimes has been planned, attempted, or completed; some on the nature of the attack; and some without regard to any of these factors. For instance, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the alleged so-called Christmas bomber, has been charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction; attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; attempt to destroy an aircraft within such jurisdiction; placing an endangering destructive device upon an aircraft there; and possession of a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence. The offenses with which terrorists may be charged fall within one or more of several categories: crimes committed aboard an aircraft; crimes committed against an aircraft; crimes committed using dangerous instrumentalities, such as a bomb; crimes of terrorism; crimes committed by or against certain classes of individuals; and crimes for which accomplices may be liable. This is a brief description of those offenses, and an outline of the penalties to which they may be subject and of the jurisdictional circumstances under which offenses they may be federally prosecuted regardless of whether they are committed within the United States or overseas. Perhaps because of the range of existing criminal proscriptions, there have been no legislative proposals to enlarge upon them as of yet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crimes Aboard an Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["Chapter 465 of title 49 of the United States Code prohibits, among other offenses, murder, manslaughter, attempted murder or manslaughter, and assault, when committed within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States. It defines the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States to include any aircraft in flight (from when the doors are closed after boarding until when they are opened after landing) in the United States. It includes any aircraft of an America carrier, or any U.S. military craft, in flight anywhere else in the world. It also includes any aircraft of a foreign carrier in flight and destined for, or departing from, the United States, as well as any foreign aircraft which in a case of air piracy lands in the United States with the hijacker aboard. ", "In addition to outlawing murder, manslaughter, attempted murder or manslaughter, assault and a few other common law crimes committed within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, chapter 465 outlaws:", "aircraft piracy within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the U.S. (violently taking over an aircraft in flight or the attempt or conspiracy to do so); aircraft piracy outside the special aircraft jurisdiction of the U.S. (violently taking over an aircraft in flight or the attempt or conspiracy to do so where an American was aboard, the offender is an American, or where the offender is later found in the U.S.); interfering with (assaulting) security screening personnel in the United States; interfering with (assaulting, intimidating, or attempting or conspiring to assault or intimidate) a flight crew member or attendant in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; placing, causing to be placed, or possessing a loaded firearm, explosive, or incendiary device aboard an aircraft in intrastate, interstate, or foreign air transportation (or attempting to do so); and threatening to commit, or provide false information concerning the commission of, one of these offenses. ", "Terrorists who have attacked commercial aircraft have most often been prosecuted under chapter 465 or its air piracy predecessor 49 U.S.C. App. 1472 (1988 ed.). This is a because of the number of individual offenses in the chapter and because the air piracy statute was one of the first federal laws that addressed directly terrorism aboard commercial airlines.", "The early air piracy statute was used to convict Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq. Rezaq was one of several terrorists who hijacked an Air Egypt flight after it took off from Athens and who subsequently murdered or attempted to murder several passengers including three Americans. The statute was also used to prosecute Fawaz Yunis who participated in the seizure of a Jordanian airliner in flight from Beirut to Cyprus. ", "Over the years, Congress added other on board crimes to the section before it broke them out into the separate sections of chapter 465. For instance, the expanded statute was used to convict Mohammed Rashed for placing a bomb on a Pan Am flight from Tokyo to Honolulu that killed a Japanese passenger and injured several others.", "Since the components of the original air piracy statute have been divided into the various sections of chapter 465, they have been used to prosecute Richard Reid, the shoe bomber; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the alleged Christmas bomber; Zacarias Moussaoui, the co-conspirator of the 9/11 terrorists; and Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, convicted in connection with the activities of an al Qeada cell in Saudi Arabia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crimes Against an Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["Although there is some overlap with chapter 465, crimes committed against aircraft are the province of chapter 2 of title 18 of the United States Code, principally 18 U.S.C. 32. Among other things, section 32 outlaws damaging or destroying an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States by fire or destructive device (or attempting or conspiring to do so). It provides similar protection for foreign flagged aircraft, when the offender is an American, when an American is aboard the aircraft which is the subject of the attack, or when the offender later comes or is brought to the United States.", "The inventory of section 32 crimes includes:", "damaging or destroying an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States or one used in interstate, overseas, or foreign air commerce; endangering the safety of such aircraft by placing a destructive device or substance on or near it (causing such advice or substance to be so placed); endangering the safety of such aircraft by damaging, destroying, or violently interfering with the operation of air navigation facilities; intending to damage, destroy, or disable such aircraft by damaging or destroying nearby or closely related equipment, material or facilities; interfering with those operating such aircraft or related navigation facilities with the intent to injury or reckless disregard of the risk of injuring such individuals; assaulting or incapacitating another aboard such aircraft when likely to endanger its safety; endangering the safety of such aircraft in flight by communicating a hoax; attempting or conspiring to commit any such offense;", "and with respect to foreign flagged aircraft (those registered outside the U.S.)", "assaulting another aboard such aircraft when likely to endanger its safety; incapacitating, destroying, or inflicting endangering damage to such aircraft; placing aboard such aircraft (or causing to be placed) a device or substance likely to incapacitate it, destroy it, or inflict endangering damage upon it; attempting or conspiring to commit any such offense.", "Since terrorist attacks upon airline passengers and crew will often involve damage to the plane as well, it is not surprising that most prosecutions have involve charges under both section 32 and chapter 465. One exception is the case of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. Yousef, who had participated in the first attack on the World Trade Center, then proceeded to devise a scheme to place explosive devices on a dozen American airliners operating in Asia. As a test, he planted a bomb on a Philippine Airlines flight from Manila to Japan. The bomb exploded in flight killing a Japanese passenger and injuring several others. The plot was discovered, however, before he could plant explosives on the planes he had targeted. Yousef was convicted for complicity in the first World Trade Center bombing and for the airline offenses. He was sentenced to 240 years imprisonment for the World Trade Center bombing and life imprisonment for the airline bombing offenses. ", "In addition to the proscriptions in chapter 465 and section 32, prosecutors originally charged Reid under 18 U.S.C. 1993 (2000 ed. Supp. I), which prohibited terrorist attacks on mass transit systems. The court dismissed, however, the charge on the grounds that the section's proscriptions did not protect air travel. Congress amended the proscription so that as section 1992 it now protects commercial air travel in terms reminiscent of section 32. It condemns:", "wrecking or disabling a mass transportation vehicle (which includes any vehicle \"used . . . as a means of transportation . . . through the air\"); endangering personal safety on a mass transportation vehicle by placing a destructive device or dangerous substance on or near it; endangering personal safety on a mass transportation vehicle by placing a destructive device or dangerous substance on or near equipment, material, or facilities relating to its operation; damaging or contaminating equipment, material, or facilities relating to the operation of a mass transportation vehicle; interfering with those operating or controlling a mass transportation vehicle with the intent to injury or reckless disregard of the risk of personal injury; use of a dangerous weapon with the intent to cause serious injury to a person on a facility used to operate or facilitate the operation of a mass transportation vehicle; collecting information to facilitate the commission of one of these offenses; communication false information relating to a purported commission of an offense under the section; and attempting or conspiring to commit one of these offenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crimes Involving Destructive Devices", "paragraphs": ["Federal prohibitions relating to the use of destructive devices are implicated whenever terrorists use (or conspire to use or attempt to use) explosives in their attacks on commercial air carriers.

It defines destructive devices by cross reference to include explosive and incendiary devices. Section 844 outlaws, among other things, damage or destruction of property used in, or whose use affects, interstate or foreign commerce, or conspiracy to do so. Section 924 outlaws, among other things, using or carrying an explosive or incendiary device during and in relation to a federal crime of violence.", "Finally, 18 U.S.C. 2332f outlaws, among other things, placing or detonating explosives on foreign flagged airlines in the United States or on U.S. flagged airlines overseas (or attempting or conspiring to do so).

So do the weapons of mass destruction offenses of section 2332a and the bombing of public facilities offenses of section 2332f.", "Other statutes focus on the offenses which a terrorist might commit against an American. For instance, both Reid and Yousef were convicted for violating 18 U.S.C. 2332 which outlaws killing or attempting to kill an American overseas for terrorist purposes.

Beyond section 2332 which protects Americans from overseas terrorist attacks and other sections already mentioned, federal law outlaws killing or assaulting federal employees and officers and members of the U.S. armed forces during or because of the performance of their duties, anywhere in the world. Under separate legislation, it protects the President and high executive branch officials, Members of Congress and the Supreme Court, and foreign dignitaries. Each would apply to killings and assaults by terrorists aboard an aircraft no matter the registry of the aircraft or where it was located when the crime occurred. Each proscription applies to attempts and conspiracies as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accomplice Liability", "paragraphs": ["The accomplices who facilitate a terrorist attack on a commercial airline or help the terrorist avoid apprehension may be subject to federal criminal liability as well. Regardless of the offense, anyone who aids or abets in the commission of a federal crime is punishable as if he had committed the act himself. To aid and abet in the commission of a federal crime, an accused must have contributed, and intended to contribute, to the success of the criminal endeavor of another. ", "Aiding and abetting occurs prior to or during the commission of an offense. Criminal liability as an accessory after the fact flows from conduct committed after another has committed an offense. Under federal law, an accessory after the fact is one who knowing a federal offense has been committed \"receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment,\" 18 U.S.C. 3. The elements of the offense are \"(1) commission of a specified offense by some person, (2) the defendant's knowledge of the crime's commission and the principal's participation in it, and (3) the defendant's assistance to the principal with the specific purpose or plan to hinder or prevent the principal's apprehension, trial, or punishment.\" ", "The aiding and abetting statute also treats as a principal one who commands the commission of a completed federal offense; 18 U.S.C. 373 imposes criminal liability upon one who recruits another to commit a federal crime of violence even if the crime is in fact never committed. Conviction requires that the prosecution establish that the defendant \"(1) had the intent for another to commit a crime of violence and (2) solicited, commanded, induced or otherwise endeavored to persuade such other person to commit the crime of violence under circumstances that strongly corroborate evidence of that intent.\"", "There is also a general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371. It outlaws conspiracies to commit any other substantive federal criminal offense. Because offenses under section 371 are only punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years, Congress has often made conspiracy to commit more serious offenses, including several of the offenses already discussed, punishable to the same extent as the underlying substantive offense. Thus, for example, conspiracy to violate any of the proscriptions of sections 32(a) or 32(b) is punished just as severely as the underlying substantive offense.
