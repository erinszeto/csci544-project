Such engagements have been viewed by many, including in Congress, as a tool of foreign policy. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) implements some of these programs, but for many decades, it otherwise relegated the training, equipping, and assisting of foreign military forces as a secondary mission on its list of priorities, far below war-fighting.", "Over time, however, and particularly since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has granted DOD new authorities in annual NDAAs and in Title 10 (Armed Services) of the U.S. Code to engage in \"security cooperation\" with foreign militaries and other security forces\u2014now considered by DOD to be an \"important tool\" for executing its national security responsibilities and \"an integral element of the DOD mission.\" This trend underlies a significant expansion of DOD direct engagements with foreign security forces and an accompanying increase in DOD's role in foreign policy decision-making. The incremental nature of Congress's adjustments to DOD's Title 10 authorities, however, has resulted in some 80 or more provisions that are described as an unwieldy \"patchwork,\" which complicates the management, application, and oversight of such engagements.

Some practitioners view today's mix of provisions as an obstacle to DOD's effective planning and execution of its objectives.

The authority would also provide specific authority for DOD to train and equip foreign forces for humanitarian and disaster assistance and to fund programs in support of foreign national territorial defense. S. 2943 would also newly authorize DOD to support the sustainment of previously provided equipment under Section 333 to foreign partners.

Furthermore, 10 U.S.C. 2282 requires the Secretary of State's \"concurrence\" (approval) of such programs before they could be implemented. S. 2943 would retain the Secretary of State concurrence requirement and extend it to all engagements covered under the proposed new authority, but it would remove the requirement for joint formulation.

Expanding authorized activities. DOD's proposals and S. 2943 would expand 10 U.S.C. 127d to authorize the provision of operational support (i.e., logistic support, supplies, and services) not only to foreign countries participating in military or stability operations that benefit U.S. national interests, but also for such operations even if the United States is not participating.

Changing funding limits and related provisions. DOD's proposals and S. 2943 include provisions to change existing funding caps, conditions on the availability of funds across fiscal years, and congressional notification requirements upon which funding is predicated.

In parts of the world where the State Department has historically devoted relatively little \"traditional\" Title 22 security assistance, such as sub-Saharan Africa, DOD's growing presence is particularly felt\u2014not only in the form of increased DOD funding and activities with partner nations, but also in the form of greater DOD weight in interagency policymaking processes.

It does, however, provide for a maximum of $850 million in O&M, Defense-wide funds to remain available until September 30, 2018 and \"be available to provide support and assistance to foreign security forces or other groups or individuals to conduct, support or facilitate counterterrorism, crisis response, or Security Enhancement Activities in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\" ", "Beyond the FY2017 NDAA, broader efforts to review U.S. security sector assistance and explore models of interagency collaboration and alternative budgeting mechanisms, including transfer authorities between DOD and the State Department, are likely to persist. Many anticipate that security cooperation policy questions will continue to challenge policymakers in the next Administration and the 115 th Congress. Key policy questions include the following: ", "Does the current statutory framework adequately reflect today's strategic environment? If not, would the proposed changes in the FY2017 NDAA meet the needs of existing and emerging threats? If gaps remain, what legislative proposals could be anticipated in future NDAAs? How does security cooperation contribute to U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives? What are the national security implications of unsuccessful security cooperation programs and activities? How should the effectiveness of security cooperation programs and activities be measured and assessed? To what extent should security assistance be viewed as a tool to achieve U.S. military objectives (and thus, a potentially central DOD mission), versus a tool to further U.S. diplomatic partnerships with foreign nations (and thus, primarily a State Department function)? Can those two potentially competing objectives be harmonized? If so, how? What are the key differences between security assistance carried out under Title 22 (State Department) of the U.S. Code and security cooperation programs and activities carried out under Title 10 (DOD) authorities? What are the implications of potentially duplicative authorities? What challenges does the State Department face in meeting its responsibility of \"continuous oversight and general direction\" of military assistance, education, and training programs, among other features of the conduct of foreign affairs? What aspects of security sector assistance are a shared responsibility? How might changes in DOD's security cooperation authorities affect interagency relations, global perceptions of U.S. civil-military balance, and foreign government interactions on security sector issues? What is the appropriate role for DOD and the U.S. military to play vis-a-vis the domestic and/or civilian security forces, such as police, of foreign countries? In what contexts, if any, is DOD the agency best-placed to train and equip these forces? What risks may be associated with such engagements? How might proposals in the FY2017 NDAA change the scope of DOD's security cooperation mission and the distribution of funding among combatant commands? What are the implications of any such changes? If provisions in the Senate-passed version of the FY2017 NDAA were enacted, would it be feasible for DOD to implement those provisions within timeframes required by the legislation? What would be the implications of delays? How might reforms strengthen or weaken congressional policymaking control and oversight of security cooperation, including implications for committee jurisdiction over such matters? To what extent should Congress place limits (temporal, geographic, human rights-related, etc.) on DOD's ability to provide assistance to foreign security forces? To what extent do such restrictions support, or impede, congressional oversight?", "In addition to appropriations decisions and funding constraints in the near-term, the next Administration's management and execution of security sector assistance could be affected by future national-level and agency-specific policy decisions. Further debate on this issue could inspire subsequent rounds of proposals for FY2018 and beyond.", "Appendix A.
