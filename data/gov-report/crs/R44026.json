With respect to research studies, privacy may be considered in terms of three components, or decision points: (1) the individual's decision to disclose personal data, (2) decisions about controls on access to the data, and (3) decisions about appropriate uses (and what constitutes \"misuse\") of the data.

NIH defines de-identified data as that data where information that could be used to associate the data with an individual has been removed. Where data is considered to be \"de-identified,\" relevant laws and regulations generally treat it as not posing the potential for a breach of individual privacy. This issue is illustrated by large-scale genomic sequence data, which are generated in large quantities, often entered into the public domain, and generally agreed to be de-identified in the absence of other data sources.

One study, in particular, has challenged the traditional paradigm that de-identified personal genome data could not be reidentified. In January 2013, a study by Gymrek et al. was published wherein researchers were able to reidentify nearly 50 participants in the International HapMap Project. Researchers were able to reidentify these individuals using their publicly available de-identified personal genome data and other publicly available data. ", "Essentially, to reidentify de-identified personal genome data, a researcher needs to be able to match the de-identified data to a second source of genetic data that is, in turn, linked to some (or multiple) pieces of identifying data. The January 2013 study by Gymrek et al. accomplished this by using a public genealogy database containing genetic information linked to surnames as its second source of genetic data. The study matched the de-identified personal genome data with the genetic information contained in the genealogy database, allowing the researchers to link the de-identified genome data with a surname and other identifying pieces of data (e.g., geographical location). The researchers then used public databases to combine surname, year of birth, and state of residence to identify specific individuals. ", "As noted, the 2013 Gymrek study relied on genealogy data. For this reason, the study's findings cannot be assumed to be broadly generalizable to the whole population; that is, the risk of reidentification using this particular second source of genetic data may not be uniform throughout the general population. In addition, this study relied on the 1000 Genomes database, which is open access; conversely, most NIH data repositories maintain some or all data in a controlled-access manner, which makes accessing data more time-consuming and makes it more difficult to access multiple databases at one time. ", "However, genetic genealogy and other genomic databases are growing, and \"the more genomic data collected, and the more refined the connections between genetic variations, disease states, and other personal characteristics, the easier it becomes to reidentify an individual and discover private information.\" Given the technical feasibility of reidentification demonstrated by the 2013 Gymrek study, along with the increasing amount of genetic data and analytics available, it is reasonable to expect that, over time, the risk of reidentification will expand to encompass more of the general population.

This consent can occur when the primary research study is paired with other activities, such as the creation of a research database or repository where information and specimens obtained from a research participant are transferred and maintained for future research.

Third, PHI of persons who have died may be used or disclosed if necessary for research purposes.", "In 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report on the Privacy Rule's impact on research.

As noted above, although the information submitted to NIH is considered de-identified, researchers have demonstrated an ability to identify individual genomic or genetic material despite attempts to anonymize the data. Public release of the de-identified data, therefore, may generate unease about personal privacy protection as well as lead to calls for legislation further clarifying public access to such information.", "Among FOIA's nine exemptions that permit agencies to withhold applicable records, two categories are more likely to affect the disclosure of genetic or genomic material:", "Exemption 3: data specifically exempted from disclosure by a statute other than FOIA if that statute meets criteria laid out in FOIA; and Exemption 6: Personnel, medical, or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.", "An example Exemption 3 statute, in the context of potentially withholding genetic material, might include 42 U.S.C. \u00a7242m(d) (a provision of the Public Health Service Act, as amended), which protects from public release certain information that would allow an individual to be identified if that information was collected for epidemiological or statistical activities. These types of Exemption 3 statutes are often referred to as b(3) exemptions because they are authorized in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(3).", "A second potentially applicable b(3) exemption is provided in 15 U.S.C. \u00a73710a(c)(7)(a) (a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991), which protects from public release \"trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential ... obtained in the conduct of research ...\" Also, Exemption 3 would prohibit the disclosure of any information that is covered by future statutes passed by Congress. As a result, legislation enacted at any time that would specifically prohibit the release of genetic and genomic data may qualify as a b(3) exemption and could be used to withhold qualifying genetic material.

According to the NIH \"points to consider\" memorandum, NIH \"believes that the release of unredacted GWAS datasets ... would constitute an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy under FOIA Exemption 6.\" Moreover, Exemption 6 has been read historically as applying to information that can be linked to a particular individual. ", "As discussed above, the ability to identify an individual using genetic research material that was previously not thought to be identifiable has been demonstrated. Where this data could be traced to specific individuals, it is possible that the potential release of the information would trigger a privacy interest of a degree that might warrant withholding under Exemption 6. The federal government, however, has maintained that the data collected are currently not identifiable, possibly removing any ability for an agency to apply an exemption that relies on the personal identification of an individual. Moreover, a determination that the data allows for an individual's identification would not necessarily permit the withholding of information; pursuant to FOIA, the privacy interests of the individuals who may be affected by the information's release would still need to be weighed against the public's interest in the information's disclosure.", "In addition to these two exemptions, the specific facts surrounding each information request could trigger a number of other FOIA exemptions.

As described previously, one way to consider the security of data from a policy perspective is to consider it in terms of both controls on access to, and designation of appropriate uses of, the data. With respect to genetic information, GINA establishes prohibitions that affect primarily the appropriate use of genetic information, but that also address\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014access to genetic information. Specifically, GINA prohibits discrimination based on genetic information by both health insurers and employers. The reach of GINA's prohibitions is in part governed by its definition of the term \"genetic information\" (see \" How Does GINA Define Genetic Information? \" text box, above). Genomic sequence data would not necessarily be protected under GINA; instead, it would be the information uncovered secondary to analysis of the sequence data (i.e., a specific genetic test result) that would be protected under this statute. ", "GINA is divided into two main parts: Title I, which prohibits discrimination based on genetic information by health insurers, and Title II, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on genetic information. Title I of GINA amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as well as the Social Security Act (SSA), to prohibit group health plans and health insurance issuers from engaging in genetic discrimination. Broadly, GINA prohibits group health plans and health insurance issuers from engaging in three practices: (1) using genetic information about an individual to adjust a group plan's premiums, or, in the case of individual plans, to deny coverage, adjust premiums, or impose a preexisting condition exclusion; (2) requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information for underwriting purposes or prior to enrollment; and (3) requiring or requesting genetic testing.", "While the first prohibition addresses the use of the information, the second addresses both access to and use of the information, and the last addresses access to the information. ", "The health reform law (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , as amended) contains provisions that may overlap to some extent with those in Title I of GINA. In evaluating the interaction of these two statutes, one may argue that it is possible to read these statutes together as establishing non-conflicting limitations on insurance premiums. Although GINA prohibits using genetic information to determine health coverage and insurance premiums for individuals or groups, the ACA specifically defines the factors on which insurers may predicate issuance of coverage or determination of premiums. The relevant provisions in GINA and the ACA are not identical in scope; however, the provisions of the ACA may obviate some of the requirements of GINA. Importantly, in terms of access to genetic information, there does not seem to be a comparable provision in the ACA to GINA's prohibition on group health plans and health insurers from requiring an individual or family member to undergo a genetic test. ", "Title II of GINA includes provisions that address both access to and appropriate use of genetic information by employers. Specifically, Title II of GINA prohibits discrimination in employment because of genetic information and, with certain exceptions, prohibits an employer from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information. The law prohibits the use of genetic information in employment decisions\u2014including hiring, firing, job assignments, and promotions\u2014by employers, unions, employment agencies, and labor-management training programs. Title II outlines exceptions whereby an employer may lawfully acquire genetic information (e.g., through inadvertent requests, wellness programs, or DNA analysis for law enforcement purposes, among others). However, even if genetic information is acquired through these exceptions, the employer may not use it to discriminate. ", "If genetic information, as defined by GINA, becomes more easily accessible because of the ability to link genomic sequence data with specific individuals, then policymakers may consider expanding GINA's applicability to broaden its protections regarding the use of genetic information. In other words, if access to the data is becoming more difficult to control due to advances in technology or the favoring of countervailing policy goals (e.g., promoting advances in research), then an alternative policy approach is to strengthen requirements governing how the data are able to be used lawfully. This may be done by adjusting the requirements themselves to make them stricter, by broadening the applicability of the existing requirements to additional settings or arrangements, or by a combination of both of these approaches. GINA, for example, does not apply to life, disability, or long-term care insurance, nor does it apply to TRICARE, the Indian Health System (IHS), the Veterans Health Administration, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB).
