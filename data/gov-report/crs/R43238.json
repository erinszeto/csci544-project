{"id": "R43238", "title": "Presidential Appointments to Full-Time Positions on Regulatory and Other Collegial Boards and Commissions, 111th Congress", "released_date": "2013-09-02T00:00:00", "summary": ["The President makes appointments, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to some 148 full-time leadership positions on 33 federal regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions. This appointment process consists of three distinct stages: selection, clearance, and nomination by the President; consideration by the Senate; and appointment by the President. These advice and consent positions can also temporarily be filled by the President alone through a recess appointment. Membership positions on this set of collegial bodies often have fixed terms, and incumbents are often protected from arbitrary removal by the President. The enabling statutes for most of these boards and commissions require political party balance in their membership.", "During the 111th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted nominations to the Senate for 77 of these 148 positions. (Most of the remaining positions on these boards and commissions were not vacant during that time.) A total of 99 nominations were submitted, of which 76 were confirmed, 4 were withdrawn, and 19 were returned to the President. The number of nominations exceeded the number of positions being filled because the President submitted multiple nominations for some positions. In some cases, for example, the President submitted one nomination for the end of a term in progress and a second nomination of the same person to the same position for the succeeding term. In other cases, the President submitted a second nomination after his first choice failed to be confirmed. President Obama made seven recess appointments to boards covered by this report during the 111th Congress, and he submitted an \"extra\" nomination of those individuals in order to comply with a law affecting the payment of recess appointees. At the end of the 111th Congress, 24 incumbents were serving past the expiration of their terms. In addition, there were 10 vacancies among the 148 positions.", "This report specifies, for the 111th Congress, all nominations to full-time positions on 33 regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions. Profiles of each board and commission provide information on their organizational structures, membership as of the end of the 111th Congress, and appointment activity during that Congress. The organizational section discusses the statutory requirements for the appointed positions, including the number of members on each board or commission, their terms of office, whether or not they may continue in their positions after their terms expire, whether or not political balance is required, and the method for selection of the chair. Membership and appointment activity are provided in tabular form. The report also includes tables summarizing the collective appointment activity for all 33 bodies.", "Information for this report was compiled from data from the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System at http://www.congress.gov/nomis/, telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code, and the 2008 edition of United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions (more commonly known as the \"Plum Book\").", "This report will not be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["This report provides an overview of the process for filling positions to which the President makes appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate (PAS positions).

There are a number of steps in this stage of the process for most Senate-confirmed positions. First, with the assistance of, and preliminary vetting by, the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, the President selects a candidate for the position. Members of Congress and other interested parties have sometimes recommended candidates for specific positions. They have offered their suggestions by letter, for example, or by contact with a White House liaison. In general, the White House is under no obligation to follow such recommendations. Some have argued, however, that Senators are constitutionally entitled, by virtue of the advice and consent requirements of the appointments clause, to provide advice to the President regarding his selection. The scope of this entitlement is a matter of some debate. As a practical matter, in instances in which Senators have perceived that insufficient pre-nomination consultation has occurred, they have sometimes exercised their procedural prerogatives to delay or, effectively, block consideration of a nomination.", "Most boards and commissions are required, by statute, to have a political balance among their members (i.e., no more than a simple majority may be from the same political party), so the White House has often negotiated over nominations to these positions with leaders of the opposition party in Congress. These negotiations involve questions not only of patronage but of policy, especially when the board or commission is involved in areas that, at the time, may be particularly sensitive. This has sometimes resulted in a packaging process in which the President has submitted several nominations together for positions on a particular board or commission, and the Senate has then considered and confirmed them as a group. ", "During the White House clearance process, candidates for nomination to the positions discussed in this report usually are required to prepare and submit several forms: the Public Financial Disclosure Report (Standard Form (SF) 278), the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), the supplement to SF 86 (SF 86 Supplement), and sometimes a White House Personal Data Statement. The vetting process often includes a background investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which prepares a report that is delivered to the White House. It also includes a review of financial disclosure materials by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) and an ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be appointed. If conflicts are found during the financial disclosure process, OGE and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts. At the completion of the vetting process, the nomination is ready to be submitted to the Senate.", "The selection and clearance stage has often been the longest part of the appointment process. There have been, at times, lengthy delays, particularly when many candidates have been processed simultaneously, such as at the beginning of an Administration, or if conflicts needed to be resolved. Candidates for higher-level positions are often accorded priority in this process. In an effort to reduce the elapsed time between a new President's inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team, provisions added in 2004 to the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 encourage Presidents-elect to submit, for security clearance, potential nominees to high-level national security positions as soon as possible after the election. A separate provision of law, enacted as part of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, lengthens, during presidential transitions, the potential duration of a temporary appointment by 90 days. This provision does not apply to members of collegial boards and commissions, however. ", "Inasmuch as many board and commission members often serve across presidential terms and administrations, provisions intended to speed the appointment process during transitions might not do so for the positions listed in this report, as a whole. The chairmanships of these bodies often do turn over at these times, however.", "A nominee has no legal authority to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position; the authority comes with Senate confirmation and presidential appointment. A nominee who is hired by the agency as a consultant while awaiting confirmation may serve only in an advisory capacity. If circumstances permit and conditions are met, the President may give the nominee a recess appointment to the position (see below). Recess appointments may have political consequences, however, particularly if Senators perceive that an appointment is an effort to circumvent their constitutional role. Some Senate-confirmed positions, such as many of those in the executive departments, may also be temporarily filled under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. As just noted, however, positions on most boards and commissions are not covered by this act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Senate Consideration", "paragraphs": ["During the second stage, the Senate alone determines whether or not to confirm a nomination. The way the Senate acts on a nomination depends largely on the importance of the position involved, existing political circumstances, and policy implications. Generally, the Senate has shown particular interest in the nominee's views and how they are likely to affect public policy. Two other factors have sometimes affected the examination with which a nominee's personal and professional qualities are examined: whether or not the President's party controls the Senate and the degree to which the President becomes involved in supporting the nomination.", "Much of the Senate confirmation process occurs at the committee level. Administratively, nominations are received by the Senate executive clerk, who arranges for the referral of the nominations to committee, according to the Senate rules and precedents. Committee nomination activity has generally included investigation, hearing, and reporting stages. As part of investigatory work, committees have drawn on information provided by the White House, as well as information they themselves have collected. Hearings provide a public forum to discuss a nomination and any issues related to the program or agency for which the nominee would be responsible. Even where confirmation has been thought by most to be a virtual certainty, hearings have provided Senators and the nominee with opportunities to go on the record with particular views or commitments. Senators have used hearings to explore nominees' qualifications, articulate policy perspectives, or raise related oversight issues. Some committees hold hearings on nearly all nominations that are referred to them; others hold hearings for only some.", "A committee may decline to act on a nomination at any point\u2014upon referral, after investigation, or after a hearing. If the committee votes to report a nomination to the full Senate, it has three options: it may report the nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. A failure to obtain a majority on the motion to report means the nomination will not be reported to the Senate. If the committee declines to report a nomination, the Senate may, under certain circumstances, discharge the committee from further consideration of the nomination in order to bring it to the floor.", "The Senate historically has confirmed most, but not all, executive nominations. Rarely, however, has a vote to confirm a nomination failed on the Senate floor. Usually, unsuccessful nominations fail to be reported or discharged from committee. Failure of a nomination to make it out of committee has occurred for a variety of reasons, including opposition to the nomination, inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination, or factors that may not be directly related to the merits of the nomination.", "Senate rules provide that \"[n]ominations neither confirmed nor rejected during the session at which they are made shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session without being again made to the Senate by the President.\" In practice, such pending nominations have been returned to the President at the end of the session or Congress. Pending nominations also may be returned automatically to the President at the beginning of a recess of more than 30 days, but the Senate rule providing for this return is often waived."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appointment", "paragraphs": ["In the final stage, the confirmed nominee is given a commission, which bears the Great Seal of the United States and is signed by the President, and is sworn into office. The President may sign the commission at any time after confirmation, at which point the appointment becomes official.

Such recess appointments expire at the end of the next full session of the Senate. Seven recess appointments were made to positions on regulatory or other collegial boards or commissions during the 111 th Congress.", "Presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment power to circumvent the confirmation process. In response, Congress has enacted provisions that restrict the pay of recess appointees under certain circumstances. Because most prospective appointees to full-time positions cannot serve without a salary, the President has an incentive to use his recess appointment authority in ways that permit them to be paid. Under one such statute, if the position to which the President makes a recess appointment falls vacant while the Senate is in session, the recess appointee may not be paid from the Treasury until he or she is confirmed by the Senate. However, the salary prohibition does not apply if", "(1) the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session of the Senate; ", "(2) a nomination for the office, other than the nomination of an individual given a recess appointment during the preceding recess of the Senate, was pending when the Senate recessed; or ", "(3) if a nomination to the office was rejected by the Senate within 30 days of the end of the session and another individual was given the recess appointment. ", "A recess appointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by a nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the Senate. For this reason, when a recess appointment is made, the President generally submits a new nomination for the appointee even when an earlier nomination is still pending. This statute has been interpreted by the Department of Justice to preclude payment of an appointee who is given successive recess appointments to the same position.", "In addition, although a recess appointee whose nomination to a full term is subsequently rejected by the Senate may continue to serve until the end of his or her recess appointment, a provision of the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act might prevent an appointee from being paid after his or her rejection.", "From the 110 th Congress on, Congress has periodically used specific scheduling practices in an attempt to prevent the President from making recess appointments. The evolution of these practices, the President's response to them, and associated controversies are beyond the scope of this report. Detailed information may be found in other CRS reports. Notably, these practices were used only once during the 111 th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characterization of Regulatory and Other Collegial Bodies", "paragraphs": ["The boards and commissions discussed in this report share, among other characteristics, the following: (1) with the exception of one agency\u2014the United States Sentencing Commission\u2014they are executive branch bodies; (2) they are located, with four exceptions, outside executive departments; (3) several members head each entity, and at least one member serves full time; (4) the members are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate; and (5) the members serve fixed terms of office, and, except in a few bodies, the President's power to remove them is restricted. ", "For most of the boards included in this report, the fixed terms of office for the member positions have set beginning and end dates, irrespective of whether the posts are filled or when appointments are made. The end dates of the fixed terms of a board's members are staggered, so that the terms do not expire all at once. The use of terms with fixed beginning and end dates is intended to minimize the occurrence of simultaneous board member departures and thereby increase leadership continuity.", "Under such an arrangement, an individual is nominated to a particular position and a particular term of office. An individual may be nominated and confirmed for a position for the remainder of an unexpired term in order to replace an appointee who has resigned (or died). Alternatively, an individual might be nominated for an upcoming term with the expectation that the new term will be underway by the time of confirmation. Occasionally, where the unexpired term has been for a very short period, the President has submitted two nominations of the same person simultaneously\u2014the first to complete the unexpired term and the second to complete the entire succeeding term of office.", "On some commissions, the chair is subject to Senate confirmation and must be appointed from among the incumbent commissioners. If the President wishes to appoint, as chair, someone who is not on the commission, two nominations are submitted simultaneously for the nominee\u2014one for member and the other for chair.", "As independent entities with staggered membership, executive branch boards and commissions typically have more political independence from the President than do executive departments. Nonetheless, the President can sometimes exercise significant influence over the composition of the membership when he designates the chair or has the opportunity to fill a number of vacancies at once. For example, President George W. Bush had the opportunity to shape the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first two years of his presidency because of existing vacancies, resignations, and the death of a member. Likewise, during the same time period, President Bush was able to submit nominations for all of the positions on the National Labor Relations Board because of existing vacancies, expiring recess appointments, and resignations. Simultaneous turnover of board or commission membership may result from coincidence, but it may also be the result of a buildup of vacancies after extended periods during which the President fails to nominate, or the Senate fails to confirm, members. Even where the President has the opportunity to make appointments to all positions on a board, however, where statute or custom requires politically balanced membership, his ability to shape the board might be tempered.", "Two other notable characteristics apply to appointments to some of the boards and commissions. First, for 25 of the boards and commissions in this report, the law limits the number of appointed members who may belong to the same political party, usually to no more than a simple majority of the appointed members (e.g., two of three, or three of five). Second, advice and consent requirements also apply to inspector general appointments in four of these organizations and general counsel appointments in three."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appointments During the 111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["During the 111 th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted nominations to the Senate for 77 of the 148 full-time positions on 33 regulatory and other boards and commissions.
