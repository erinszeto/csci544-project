The NWPA requires DOE to remove spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants, in exchange for a fee, and transport it to a permanent geologic repository or an interim storage facility before permanent disposal. Defense-related high-level waste is to go into the same repository. In an effort to mitigate the political difficulties of imposing a federal nuclear waste facility on a single community, Congress attempted to establish a scientifically based, multi-stage statutory process for selecting the eventual site of the nation's new permanent geologic repository. Congress amended the NWPA's site selection process in 1987, however, and designated Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as the sole candidate site for the repository by terminating site-specific activities at all other sites.", "Since 2009, the Obama Administration and DOE have taken a number of steps directed toward terminating the Yucca Mountain project. First, the Administration's budget proposals have eliminated all funding for the project. Second, the President established a Blue Ribbon Commission to consider alternative solutions to the nation's nuclear waste challenges; in response to its recommendations, DOE is designing a consent-based siting process. Third, DOE attempted to terminate the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Yucca Mountain licensing proceeding by seeking to withdraw its 2008 license application. Although DOE's motion to withdraw the application was denied by the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, the NRC suspended the Yucca Mountain licensing proceeding in 2011, claiming budgetary limitations. In 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) directed the NRC to resume its review of DOE's license application using what remained of previously appropriated funds, although it acknowledged that such funds were insufficient for the NRC to complete the review.", "Following the D.C. Circuit's decision, NRC staff completed work on a Yucca Mountain Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in 2015. The SER concluded that DOE's license application met regulatory requirements, except for requirements related to ownership of land and certain water rights. Litigation challenging the Nevada State Engineer's denials of DOE's applications for permanent water rights has been stayed for more than a decade pending resolution of other issues relating to the future of Yucca Mountain. In May 2016, NRC staff also completed work on a supplement to DOE's environmental impact statement to address groundwater impacts.", "Various other related nuclear waste issues also have been litigated, including safety standards for disposal, Nuclear Waste Fund fees (no longer being collected), and the federal government's contract liability for failure to take title to and dispose of nuclear waste. In June 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected a challenge to the NRC's rule and environmental impact statement supporting the continued, and possibly indefinite, storage of nuclear waste, saying \"[t]o the extent that the petitioners disagree with the NRC's current policy for the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, their concerns should be directed to Congress.\" Meanwhile, in the absence of a permanent repository, private companies have sought to establish consolidated interim storage facilities, which would require legislative authorization as well as agency approvals.", "While the result of the ongoing disputes over the Yucca Mountain program remains uncertain, congressional action could have a significant impact on nuclear waste storage and disposal.

The NWPA requires DOE to take title to commercial nuclear power plants' SNF and, in exchange for a fee, remove and transport it to a permanent geologic repository or an interim storage facility before permanent disposal.

Separately, the government's authority to license a monitored retrievable storage facility is conditioned on the NRC having issued a license for a permanent geologic repository. This requirement was intended in part to reduce concern that any consolidated storage facility could become a de facto repository.", "With interim storage generally not authorized under the NWPA, the amount of SNF stored at civilian nuclear power reactors continues to grow. Currently, spent fuel discharged from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors is stored at 60 operating nuclear plant sites, 14 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establishing a Permanent Geologic Repository for High-Level Nuclear Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel", "paragraphs": ["The NWPA created a multi-stage statutory framework\u2014requiring the participation of the President, Congress, DOE, and the NRC\u2014that governs the establishment of a permanent geologic nuclear waste repository. The various phases of the process include site recommendation, site characterization and study, site approval, and construction authorization. At the site recommendation stage, the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) was directed to nominate at least five potentially \"suitable\" sites for an eventual repository. After identifying and conducting an initial study of these sites, the Secretary was to recommend three sites to the President for characterization as \"candidate sites.\" Pursuant to these obligations, the Secretary recommended Deaf Smith County, Texas; Hanford, Washington; and Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to the President in 1986. The Secretary's recommendations were met with significant opposition from the affected states; however, and as a result, Congress amended the NWPA's site selection process in 1987 and designated Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for the repository by terminating \"all site specific activities (other than reclamation activities) at all candidate sites, other than the Yucca Mountain site.\" The 1987 amendments, did not, however, end the site characterization, approval, and construction authorization phases, which continued as outlined under the original terms of the NWPA. ", "In accordance with the characterization stage of the NWPA framework, Yucca Mountain was extensively inspected and studied in an effort to determine if the site was in compliance with suitability guidelines established by DOE, and public health, safety, and environmental guidelines established by the Environmental Protection Agency. DOE obtained temporary (10-year) water permits from the State of Nevada for use in site characterization in 1992. In 1997, pursuant to state law and to NRC regulations requiring DOE to \"have obtained such water rights as may be needed to accomplish the purpose of the geologic repository operations area\" before proceeding with licensing, DOE filed five applications to the Nevada State Engineer for permanent water rights at the Yucca Mountain site for performance confirmation studies and eventual construction. The Nevada State Engineer denied DOE's applications for permanent water rights in 2000, finding that granting the water rights would not be in the public interest. That denial was challenged in litigation, which is still ongoing fifteen years later. Meanwhile, the federal government did not meet its contractual obligation to begin accepting SNF by 1998, leading to litigation by some utilities for contract damages to cover the costs of on-site storage.", "Following other significant litigation over the proper safety standards to be applied to the Yucca Mountain facility, and notwithstanding charges by the State of Nevada that the site was unsafe, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham recommended that the President approve the Yucca Mountain site for the development of a repository in 2002. President George W. Bush approved the Yucca Mountain site the next day, and, pursuant to the terms of the NWPA, recommended the site to Congress.", "The NWPA, however, provided the state in which the proposed repository would be located with the opportunity to object to the President's site recommendation by submitting a notice of disapproval to Congress. If a notice of disapproval were submitted, the NWPA stated that the site would be \"disapproved\" unless both houses of Congress overrode the state's objection by passing a \"resolution of siting approval.\" Although Nevada opposed the selection of Yucca Mountain and quickly submitted its notice of disapproval, Congress passed, and the President signed, the necessary approval resolution to override Nevada's objection. Thus, the site approval stage of the NWPA process ended. ", "The fourth stage of the NWPA process commenced in June 2008, when DOE submitted an application for authorization to construct the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository (license application) to the NRC. Under the NWPA, \"if the President recommends to the Congress the Yucca Mountain site \u2026 and the site designation is permitted to take effect \u2026 the Secretary shall submit to the [NRC] an application for a construction authorization for a repository at such site.\" The statute further directed that following submission of the license application, the NRC \"shall issue a final decision approving or disapproving the issuance of a construction authorization not later than the expiration of 3 years after the date of the submission of such application.\" NRC's final decision to grant or deny a construction authorization is to be made after completion of the NRC staff's independent technical review of the license application, an adjudicatory hearing before NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, and subsequent review by the Commissioners.

After steady reductions in staff, the OCRWM officially closed on September 30, 2010. The recent budget proposals follow years of steady decreases in funding for the repository: from $572 million in FY2005, to $288 million in FY2009, to only enough funds, approximately $197 million, to finance the ongoing NRC licensing process in FY2010.

The 15-member Commission, appointed by the Secretary of Energy, consisted of scientists, academics, industry representatives, labor representatives, and former elected officials. The commission's goal was to \"provide recommendations for developing a safe, long-term solution to managing the nation's used nuclear fuel and nuclear waste.\" The commission would not, however, consider specific sites for a future repository. ", "The commission issued its final report on January 26, 2012. As expected, the report did not make any specific recommendations as to the \"suitability\" of Yucca Mountain, other than to make clear that the process of selecting and establishing the Yucca Mountain facility has suffered from several flaws and should be replaced by a new \"consent-based approach\" that provides \"incentives\" and encourages interested communities to \"volunteer\" as a potential host site for an eventual repository. While acknowledging that \"the future of the Yucca Mountain project remains uncertain,\" the commission did make specific findings that may have significant influence over the future of nuclear waste disposal. Importantly, the commission concluded that deep geologic disposal \"is the most promising and accepted method [of disposal] currently available,\" and therefore recommended that the United States \"should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste.\" Additionally, the commission concluded that \"new institutional leadership for the nation's nuclear waste program is clearly needed.\" The final report therefore recommended that control over nuclear waste disposal be removed from DOE, and instead vested in a newly established \"single-purpose organization\" that could \"provide the stability, focus, and credibility that are essential to get the waste program back on track.\" The commission found a sufficiently independent \"federal corporation chartered by Congress\" to be the most promising structure for this new entity. Finally, the commission reiterated the severe consequences of continued delays and urged Congress and the President to take action to institute the Commission's recommendations \"without further delay.\"", "Recognizing the delays in a permanent disposal solution, the commission also urged \"[p]rompt efforts to develop one or more consolidated storage facilities\" to contain SNF temporarily before final disposal. Such interim storage facilities could enable removal of SNF from shutdown reactors and could also allow the federal government to begin meeting its waste acceptance obligations sooner, reducing its liability. However, legal authority for the federal government to provide or arrange for centralized, consolidated storage is lacking under the NWPA; provisions of the NWPA addressing such storage either have expired or are tied to repository-related milestones that have not been met. Currently, nuclear reactors store spent fuel in pools or (after several years of \"cooling\") dry casks on- or off-site.", "DOE responded to the commission's recommendations in January 2013 with a new waste strategy that calls for a \"consent-based\" process to select nuclear waste storage and disposal sites. The strategy calls for geologic repository siting to occur by 2026, after development by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of generic, non-site-specific, repository safety standards; the goal under the strategy is for repository licensing to be completed by 2042, and operations to begin by 2048. The strategy also calls for a pilot interim surface storage facility to open by 2021, and a larger consolidated interim storage facility by 2025, which would require new authority from Congress. In March 2015, President Obama reiterated support for the 2013 strategy and authorized DOE to move forward with planning for a separate repository for high-level radioactive waste resulting from atomic energy defense activities. This authorization reverses the conclusion made under President Reagan in 1985 that separate disposal of defense nuclear waste was not required and that defense and civilian waste could be disposed of together in a dual-purpose repository. DOE issued an invitation for public comments on the consent-based siting components of the strategy in late December 2015, held a series of public meetings in spring and summer 2016, and plans to release a draft report on the comments and meetings later in 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE's Attempted Withdrawal of Its Construction Authorization License Application", "paragraphs": ["One of the more controversial actions taken by DOE was the agency's effort to terminate the NRC licensing proceeding by attempting to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application.

The Board had admitted nearly 300 contentions, or contested issues, for adjudication. ", "DOE formally filed its motion seeking to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license on March 3, 2010.

Beginning with the plain language of Section 114, the Board held that Congress had established a \"detailed, specific procedure\" that removed control of the license application process from the Secretary by creating a mandatory statutory scheme. In the Board's view, to allow DOE to withdraw the application as a matter of policy at this stage would be contrary to Congress's intent that the licensing process be \"removed from the political process.\" ", "One day after the Board's decision, and before DOE filed a formal appeal, the NRC released an order inviting the parties to file briefs on whether the commission should review the Board's decision. However, before the NRC took further action, the NRC Chairman at the time, Gregory Jaczko, directed NRC staff to use funds appropriated under the FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act (CR) to close down the agency's review of the Yucca Mountain license application. In an October 4, 2010, memorandum, NRC staff were instructed to continue their Yucca Mountain activities \"in accordance with\" the commission's FY2011 budget request that had sought only $10 million to \"support work related to the orderly closure of the agency's Yucca Mountain licensing support activities.\" The Chairman's guidance was opposed by two fellow NRC commissioners as inconsistent with principles of appropriations law.

While recognizing (as it had in 2008) that either DOE or the NRC could prepare the EIS supplement, the NRC found that \"in promulgating the NWPA, Congress intended that the primary responsibility for evaluating environmental impacts rest with DOE,\" and that DOE had already performed significant analyses in support of the EIS supplement.

DOE sought the water appropriation to implement its responsibilities under the NWPA. ", "The applications were protested by several Nevada officials. After a hearing, the State Engineer denied the applications, based largely on the enactment of a Nevada statute banning storage of radioactive waste in the state. DOE appealed the State Engineer's ruling to the federal district court (with a protective notice of appeal in the appropriate county court). In a 2003 order, the district court revoked the State Engineer's ruling and remanded the matter back for a decision that did not consider the Nevada radioactive waste storage ban. After another hearing, the State Engineer again denied the applications later that year on the grounds that the proposed water appropriations would not constitute beneficial uses and would threaten to prove detrimental to the interests of the Nevada public. ", "The district court's 2003 order also granted a stay of the water rights proceedings while \"more encompassing\" issues involving the Yucca Mountain project were being litigated elsewhere. While the 2003 stay order was based primarily on deference to certain litigation in the D.C. Circuit, in 2005 the district court held that the decision in that litigation, Nuclear Energy Institute, Inc. v. EPA , left the status of the project still undetermined. The court recognized that \"whether the proposed repository is, in fact, licensable\" is an important consideration in determining, for the water rights appeal, \"[whether] the State Engineer was arbitrary and capricious in determining that the water permit applications are not in the public interest.\" The district court therefore maintained the stay, save for a limited allowance for DOE to file an amended complaint adding the State Engineer's updated ruling. ", "The litigation remains stayed as the licensing question remains uncertain, particularly given DOE's current opposition to the repository. However, the NRC's publication of the SER, described above, may have resolved some questions relating to \"whether the proposed repository is, in fact, licensable\" by determining that the application met regulatory requirements except for those relating to land ownership and water rights.

The State of Nevada, in particular, has challenged aspects of Yucca Mountain-related decisions for many years. Some of Nevada's claims remain ongoing. ", "The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required EPA to issue public health and safety standards for radioactive material potentially disposed of at Yucca Mountain, and also directed the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a study to provide recommendations on what such standards would be reasonable. The statute also required the NRC to modify, to be consistent with EPA's standards, its technical requirements and criteria that DOE's Yucca Mountain construction license application must meet under the NWPA to be granted by the NRC.", "NAS released its report in 1995 and EPA issued the standards for Yucca Mountain in 2001. The State of Nevada joined with various environmental groups to challenge EPA's radiation-protection regulation as insufficiently protective of public health and safety. The State of Nevada also joined with several jurisdictions within Nevada to challenge the NRC's licensing-criteria rule and DOE's site-suitability criteria as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act; DOE's 2002 Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) as unlawful under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); and Congress's 2002 site approval resolution as unconstitutional. The Nuclear Energy Institute challenged EPA's groundwater standard as unnecessary and unlawful. These cases were consolidated and decided in 2004 in Nuclear Energy Institute, Inc. v. EPA , in which the D.C. Circuit held: ", "(1) The 10,000-year compliance period selected by EPA violates section 801 of the Energy Policy Act (EnPA) because it is not, as EnPA requires, \"based upon and consistent with\" the findings and recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences [which had recommended a standard pegged to the time when radiation doses reach their peak, and had disapproved a 10,000-year period]. The remaining challenges to the EPA regulation are without merit. (2) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's licensing requirements are neither unlawful nor arbitrary and capricious except to the extent that they incorporate EPA's 10,000-year compliance period. (3) The congressional resolution selecting the Yucca site for development represents an appropriate exercise of Congress's Article IV, section 3 authority over federal property. (4) The Department of Energy's and the President's actions leading to the selection of the Yucca Mountain site are unreviewable. All but one of Nevada's challenges to these actions are moot, and the remaining challenge [to the FEIS under NEPA] is unripe. Accordingly, we vacate the EPA and NRC regulations insofar as they include a 10,000-year compliance period. We deny or dismiss the remaining petitions for review.", "Because the court dismissed Nevada's challenge to the FEIS on ripeness grounds, subsequent lawsuits bringing the same or a similar challenge to the FEIS were not foreclosed. Thus, Nevada challenged DOE's FEIS again in 2004, after DOE issued a Record of Decision based on the FEIS governing the transportation of nuclear waste from the production sources to Yucca Mountain. Nevada's petition was denied as still unripe, because DOE's implementation of the transportation plan was contingent on various conditions\u2014such as approval of a construction license for Yucca Mountain, or a \"concrete decision\" in that direction. In June 2008, DOE issued a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Yucca Mountain repository, as well as Environmental Impact Statements for the related Nevada Rail Corridor and Rail Alignment. The State of Nevada filed comments in 2008 before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board opposing DOE's application to construct the rail corridor, arguing in part that the NEPA analyses were flawed. There appears to have been little further court activity challenging the Yucca Mountain NEPA analyses in light of the developments beginning with DOE's attempted withdrawal of its license application. As noted above, NRC completed a supplement to DOE's 2008 Environmental Impact Statement in May 2016.", "After the Nuclear Energy Institute court struck down that portion of EPA's rule relating to the 10,000-year compliance period, EPA released a new proposal in 2005 and reissued the public health and safety standards for Yucca Mountain in 2008, this time establishing dose standards applicable for a period up to 1 million years after disposal. NRC reissued its regulations consistent with EPA's standards in 2009. The State of Nevada, and others, again brought lawsuits in the D.C. Circuit challenging the EPA and NRC rules as insufficiently protective and otherwise legally deficient. However, the trajectory of this litigation was changed with the Obama Administration's opposition to a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain and DOE's attempted withdrawal of the license application. Given the continued suspension of the Yucca Mountain license application adjudicatory proceedings before the Board, as well as other uncertainty surrounding the Yucca Mountain project, Nevada's lawsuits against EPA and NRC regarding their Yucca Mountain standards have been held in abeyance, subject to periodic status reports. ", "Notably, the legal validity of the EPA and NRC standards for Yucca Mountain were assumed by NRC in its Safety Evaluation Report. However, if any aspect of the standards were to be struck down in the future, then the conclusions of the SER\u2014which, as noted above, generally found DOE's license application to meet the NRC standards \u2014could be thrown into jeopardy.

Litigation on the topic reaches back to the late 1970s, when environmental groups and states asked the NRC to condition its individual reactor operating license decisions on determinations that the reactors' radioactive wastes could be disposed of safely. In the 1979 decision in Minnesota v. NRC , the D.C. Circuit agreed with the environmental groups and states. It ordered the NRC to determine, by rulemaking or other generic (as opposed to license-by-license) determination, whether offsite storage or disposal would be available for SNF when reactors' licenses expired, and if not, whether the SNF could be safety stored at decommissioned reactors until an offsite solution became available.", "In response to Minnesota v. NRC , the NRC issued its first waste confidence rule in 1984, supported by an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact pursuant to NEPA. The NRC found \"reasonable assurance\" that, among other things, safe disposal of SNF and HLW in a geologic repository was technically feasible; one or more geologic repositories with sufficient capacity would be available by 2009; SNF and HLW would be managed safely until sufficient repository capacity became available; and if necessary, SNF could be stored safely and without significant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyond the expiration of a reactor's operating license at that reactor or at an offsite storage installation.", "The NRC amended its waste confidence rule several times, including in 2010 to extend the timeframes, due in part to the Yucca Mountain delays and uncertainties. In the 2010 waste confidence rule, the NRC found that SNF could be stored safely for at least 60 years beyond the expiration of a reactor's operating license and that sufficient mined geologic repository capacity would be available when necessary. The 2010 rule amendment was struck down in 2012, when the D.C. Circuit held that it violated NRC's NEPA obligations. In particular, the court held that the NRC had to examine the environmental effects of failing to establish a permanent repository, \"a possibility that cannot be ignored;\" and the court also ordered the NRC to examine certain potential risks relating to interim storage of SNF. The NRC largely suspended issuing reactor or storage installation licenses until its assessments and rulemaking responding to the decision were completed.", "The NRC finalized a revised rule entitled \"Continued Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel\" in September 2014, codifying the environmental impact determinations reflected in the generic environmental impact statement (GEIS) issued at the same time. \"Because the timing of repository availability is uncertain,\" the GEIS analyzes potential environmental impacts over a short-term timeframe of 60 years of continued storage after the end of a reactor's licensed life for operation; a 160-year timeframe to address the potential for delay in repository availability; and an indefinite timeframe \"to address the possibility that a repository never becomes available.\" The rule provides that the impact determinations in the GEIS shall be deemed incorporated into the environmental assessments and environmental impact statements required by other regulatory provisions for licensing actions. The NRC also lifted the suspension on licensing decisions at that time.", "The States of New York, Connecticut, and Vermont, along with the Prairie Island Indian Community and a number of interest groups, filed suit in the D.C. Circuit to challenge the 2014 Continued Storage rule, the underlying GEIS, and the NRC's order lifting the suspension on licensing decisions. The State of Massachusetts and the California State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission intervened on behalf of the petitioners, while several power companies and the Nuclear Energy Institute intervened on behalf of the respondent agencies. Administrative petitions to suspend nuclear reactor licensing decisions and motions to admit new contentions to nuclear reactor licensing dockets were also filed before the NRC in September 2014 on similar grounds; briefing in the litigation was deferred until after the NRC denied the administrative petitions and motions in February 2015.", "On June 3, 2016, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit upheld the NRC's Continued Storage rule. In its decision in New York v. NRC , the court held, among other things, that \"none of [the challenged] assumptions is so unreasonable as to render the NRC's decision-making arbitrary or capricious,\" and that the GEIS sufficiently analyzed the impacts of continued storage of SNF. The court stated:", "We acknowledge the political discord surrounding our nation's evolving nuclear energy policy. But the role of Article III courts in this debate is circumscribed. \"The scope of review under the 'arbitrary and capricious' standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\" To the extent that the petitioners disagree with the NRC's current policy for the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, their concerns should be directed to Congress.

Circuit have also affected the statutory mechanism by which the construction and operation of the Yucca Mountain repository was to be funded. As required by the NWPA, the DOE entered into contracts with nuclear power utilities in which the agency agreed to collect and dispose of SNF and high-level nuclear waste in exchange for ongoing payments by the utilities into the statutorily established Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF). The law further requires the Secretary of Energy to annually \"review\" the fees to determine if the NWF will provide sufficient revenue to fund the waste disposal program and propose an adjustment to the fee if he determines that either excessive or inadequate revenue is being collected. Despite the fact that DOE had neither begun collecting nuclear waste nor constructed a disposal facility\u2014and indeed determined that the Yucca Mountain facility is \"unworkable\"\u2014the agency continued to collect the NWF fees (amounting to approximately $750 million per year). Nor had the Secretary proposed a fee adjustment\u2014instead concluding that continued collection of the fee at established levels was warranted. ", "In 2010, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) challenged the Secretary's continued collection of the NWF fee, arguing that the Secretary had not adequately considered costs and revenues, and had failed to take into consideration the Obama Administration's decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain waste facility.", "In June 2012, the D.C. Circuit agreed with NARUC and ruled that the Secretary's fee determination was inadequate, holding that it was \"unreasonable\" for the agency to use Yucca Mountain as a \"proxy\" for calculating future costs when the DOE itself deemed the facility \"unworkable.\" The court added that the Secretary's failure to engage in \"sophisticated evaluations of the potential costs of a hypothetical repository\" was arbitrary and capricious. At the time, however, the court found it \"premature\" to order the Secretary to suspend the fee, instead directing the Secretary to respond with a new fee assessment within six months.", "The Secretary responded to the court's order by asserting that he could not determine whether the fees were inadequate or excessive because the agency had concluded that the NWF's capacity to cover the future costs of nuclear waste disposal could span anywhere from a $2 trillion deficit to a $4.9 trillion surplus\u2014a range the D.C. Circuit characterized as \"so large as to be absolutely useless as an analytical technique to be employed to determine\u2014as the Secretary is obligated to do\u2014the adequacy of the annual fees paid by petitioners.\" ", "The court rejected the Secretary's position, holding that \"[t]he Secretary may not comply with his statutory obligation by 'concluding' that a conclusion is impossible\" and that many of the agency's assumptions in reaching its estimate were in conflict with the NWPA. Given the Secretary's failure to produce an adequate fee assessment, the court ordered the Secretary to propose an alteration of the NWF fee to zero \"until such a time as either the Secretary chooses to comply with the Act as it is currently written, or until Congress enacts an alternative waste management plan.\" ", "The DOE officially ceased collection of the NWF fee on May 16, 2014.

The NWPA expressly stated that these contracts (known as the Standard Contract) require the federal government to begin disposal of the covered nuclear waste no later than January 31, 1998. With no available repository, DOE breached the Standard Contract by failing to begin the acceptance and disposal of SNF by the statutory deadline established in the NWPA. As a result, nuclear utilities have spent billions of dollars on temporary storage for toxic SNF that DOE is contractually and statutorily required to collect for disposal. The breach has triggered a prolonged series of suits by nuclear power providers seeking to recover damages for DOE's failure to perform its statutory and contractual obligations. DOE estimates total liability stemming from these cases will reach $29 billion. ", "Although DOE has acknowledged its partial breach of the Standard Contract in most cases, significant litigation has been required to determine the level of damages individual nuclear utilities may legally recover. The nuclear utilities have pursued their breach of contract claims under a partial breach theory. Generally speaking, when one party to a contract materially breaches the contract, the non-breaching party has the option to sue for damages under either a \"full breach\" or \"partial breach\" theory. A successful claim for full breach discharges the contractual obligations of both parties and allows the non-breaching party to sue for all past, present, and future damages. A claim for partial breach, on the other hand, preserves the ongoing contractual relationship between the parties\u2014meaning both parties are still obligated to perform under the terms of the contract. Additionally, a party suing for partial breach may only recover the costs of mitigating the other party's breach that were incurred between the time the party became aware of a potential breach and the date of trial, and may not, therefore, recover future damages.", "Nuclear utilities have generally been successful in recovering all reasonable and foreseeable expenses incurred in mitigation of DOE's breach. These damages typically consist of costs associated with developing, implementing, and maintaining on-site interim SNF storage. Damages are limited, however, to the costs incurred from the date at which the utility became aware of DOE's potential breach, a realization often occurring well before the January 31, 1998, deadline, to the date of trial. Nuclear utilities are free, however, to re-file future claims as new damages are incurred.
