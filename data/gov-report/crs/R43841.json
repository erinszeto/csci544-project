These issues are complex and at times controversial, and developments in the global economy often make policy deliberation more challenging.

Appendix A provides a list of CRS products covering these issues in greater detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Economic Context", "paragraphs": ["The global economy is projected to continue to recover slowly and unevenly from the 2008 financial crisis, and global trade growth is significantly slower compared to historical levels. Higher sustained rates of economic growth remain elusive in Japan, Canada, and parts of Europe. Emerging markets (EMs) as a group are facing growing vulnerabilities to their economies due to declining global trade, depreciating currencies, lower commodity prices (particularly oil), volatile equity markets, and, in certain areas, the lack of deeper economic reform. Growth rates have dropped sharply in several emerging markets, including Russia and Brazil. Additionally, China is attempting a managed slowdown as it navigates toward a more consumer-oriented economy. This combination of events is contributing to uncertainties that are jarring global financial markets and raising concerns over the pace of business investment that could dampen prospects for longer-term gains in productivity and sustained higher rates of economic growth.", "Major decreases in oil and other commodity prices in 2015, while benefitting consumers and commodity-importing nations, reduced export earnings of commodity-producing countries and negatively affected investment, production, and employment in these sectors. Declining commodity prices also raise concerns about spillover effects onto major trading partners of EMs that depend on such exports. Shifts in international capital flows arising from changes in oil and commodity prices could add to uncertainties in global financial markets, raise risks for U.S. banks of non-performing loans made to the energy sector, and complicate the efforts of some major international banks to rebuild their capital bases.", "The U.S. economy remains a relatively bright spot in terms of the global economic outlook, which could help sustain its position as a main driver of global economic growth. Although the United States is still recovering from its worst recession in eight decades, overall conditions have improved with unemployment down to below 5% in early 2016 from a high of 10% in 2009, and gross domestic product (GDP) growth projected to be in the range of 2-3% in 2016 and 2017. The substantial drop in the price of oil is impacting not only the global economy, but also the U.S. economy. The drop in energy prices is expected to raise consumer real incomes and improve the competitive position of some industries, but these positive effects are being offset to some degree by a drop in employment and investment in the energy sector. ", "Exchange rates continue to experience significant volatility, with a number of currencies depreciating against the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, and the Russian ruble. Volatile currency and equity markets combined with uncertainties over global growth prospects and rates of inflation that remain below the target levels of a number of central banks could further complicate the efforts of the U.S. Federal Reserve to take additional steps to raise U.S. interest rates due to the U.S. economic recovery. In addition, other major economies, such as Europe and Japan, may continue to pursue more expansionary monetary policies and certain EMs may continue to experience downward pressure on their currencies. Uncertainties in global financial markets could put additional pressure on the dollar as investors may seek safe haven currencies and dollar-denominated investments. For some economies, volatile currencies and continued low commodity prices could add to sovereign debt issues, raising the prospect of sovereign defaults.", "Since their peak in 2006, current account imbalances, as a share of world GDP, have fallen significantly, particularly the deficit in the United States and the surpluses in China and Japan. In the near term, concerns over a slowdown in global trade and the role the United States may play in supporting global growth as a major importer may overshadow potential concerns over global imbalances. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolving Trade Patterns and Policy Implications", "paragraphs": ["International trade and investment flows continue to evolve in significant ways, most notably through the growing integration of markets and production (e.g., the stages of transforming a good from its basic components into a final product for consumers now often occur in multiple countries) brought about by advances in technology, communications, transportation, and lower barriers to trade. These transformative changes in the global economy have decreased transaction costs and spurred growth in trade, particularly of intermediate goods, which now account for over 60% of the world's commercial exchange, as well as digital trade. According to the WTO, over the past 20 years, global trade in goods nearly quadrupled from $5 trillion in 1995 to $19 trillion in 2014. From 1995-2014, the share of trade as a percentage of global GDP grew from 20% to 30%.", "Domestically, jobs supported by trade relate to U.S. exports to U.S. foreign affiliates and production abroad, as well as foreign firms operating in the United States. These developments further complicate trade and employment policy debates, and raise other questions such as what constitutes an \"American-made\" product, who gains and who loses from trade, and how innovation and production strategies may continue to change the economic landscape.", "Other transformative changes in the global economy are the growing role of China and other EMs and a more digitally-driven economy. These and other developments present significant opportunities and challenges for the United States as it seeks to achieve more open markets, transparent and rules-based trade, and financial and monetary stability in the global economy. They also have significant policy implications with respect to the role and evolution of international trade and financial institutions and the U.S. role in these institutions. The inability of WTO members to conclude the 2001 Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, for example, confronts the WTO with an existential challenge in terms of its ability to continue as a leading force for future trade liberalization. Partly in response, the United States continues to pursue \"mega-regional\" trade agreements like TPP and the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) to break new ground in trade rules-setting and liberalization. Approaches to intellectual property rights (IPR), digital trade, and investment in U.S. trade negotiations, agreements, and programs also are expanding policy issues. The Group of 20 (G-20) process for furthering international economic cooperation among the world's 20 largest economies and newer institutions like the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) also raise significant policy issues for the United States. ", "While global economic integration has increased trade and economic growth, it also has exposed U.S. firms and workers to greater competition from lower-cost and more efficient producers in certain sectors, and increasingly, from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and other firms that receive government support. Globalization and the larger volume of imports of goods and services, therefore, may force some U.S. firms to make costly adjustments to remain competitive. In some cases this may take the form of worker dislocation and shifts to production abroad, and may raise concerns in Congress over distributional issues of global production and trade, how to respond to unfair foreign trade practices, and the scope and effectiveness of U.S. worker training and trade adjustment assistance programs.", "The appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies has implications for U.S. and global trade. For the United States, an appreciating dollar could slow the rate of U.S. export growth and increase U.S. imports. While potentially improving consumer welfare and lowering the costs of imports used as inputs in U.S. production, it also may result in increased competitive pressures on U.S. import sensitive industries and create greater trade tensions. ", "In sum, the costs and benefits of an increasingly interconnected global economy to the United States are multifaceted. The trade policy debate extends beyond free trade versus protectionism, to also involve domestic and foreign macroeconomic policies, the participation of foreign states in markets, the competitiveness of U.S. firms and workers, the implications of global value chains, and the financial stability of the international economy. For the United States, an overarching goal is to ensure a high standard of living by remaining innovative, productive, and responsive to international competition. At the same time, the United States seeks to safeguard those stakeholders who otherwise may be left behind in a fast-changing global economy or injured by noncompetitive trade practices, which may suggest a supporting role for complementary domestic policies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Role of Congress in International Trade and Finance", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Constitution assigns express authority over foreign trade to Congress. Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to \"regulate commerce with foreign nations\" and to \"lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\" For roughly the first 150 years of the United States, Congress exercised its power to regulate foreign trade by setting tariff rates on all imported products. Congressional trade debates in the 19 th century often pitted Members from northern manufacturing regions, who benefitted from high tariffs, against those from largely southern raw material exporting regions, who gained from and advocated for low tariffs. ", "A major shift in U.S. trade policy occurred after Congress passed the highly protective \"Smoot-Hawley\" Tariff Act of 1930, which, by raising U.S. tariff rates to an all-time high level, led U.S. trading partners to respond in kind. As a result, world trade declined rapidly, exacerbating the impact of the Great Depression. Since the passage of the Tariff Act of 1930, Congress has delegated certain trade authority to the executive branch. First, Congress enacted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, which authorized the President to enter into reciprocal agreements to reduce tariffs within congressionally pre-approved levels, and to implement the new tariffs by proclamation without additional legislation. Congress renewed this authority periodically until the 1960s. Second, Congress enacted the Trade Act of 1974, aimed at opening markets and establishing nondiscriminatory international trade for nontariff barriers as well. Because changes in nontariff barriers in reciprocal bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements usually involve amending U.S. law, the agreements require congressional approval and implementing legislation. Congress has renewed and amended the 1974 Act five times, which includes granting \"fast-track\" trade negotiating authority. Since 2002, \"fast track\" has been known as trade promotion authority (TPA). ", "Congress also exercises trade policy authority through the enactment of laws authorizing trade programs and governing trade policy generally, as well as oversight of the implementation of trade policies, programs, and agreements. These include such areas as U.S. trade agreement negotiations, tariffs and nontariff barriers, trade remedy laws, import and export policies, economic sanctions, and the trade policy functions of the federal government. ", "Additionally, Congress has an important role in international investment and finance policy. It has authority over bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and the level of U.S. financial commitments to the multilateral development banks (MDBs), including the World Bank, and to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It also authorizes the activities of such agencies as the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Congress has oversight responsibilities over these institutions, as well as the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury, whose activities affect international capital flows. Congress also closely monitors developments in international financial markets that could affect the U.S. economy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)2", "paragraphs": ["Legislation to renew TPA\u2014the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-26 )\u2014was signed by President Obama on June 29, 2015, after months of debate and passage by both houses of Congress during the spring.

These obligations include adhering to congressionally-defined U.S. trade policy negotiating objectives, as well as congressional notification and consultation requirements before, during, and after the completion of the negotiation process. The primary purpose of TPA is to preserve the constitutional role of Congress with respect to consideration of implementing legislation for trade agreements that require changes in domestic law, while also bolstering the negotiating credibility of the executive branch by ensuring that trade agreements will not be changed once concluded. Since the authority was first enacted in the Trade Act of 1974, Congress has renewed TPA five times (1979, 1984, 1988, 2002, and 2015).

In addition, the United States is engaged in trade liberalization efforts within and around the WTO.

The 12 TPP ministers officially signed the agreement on February 4, 2016. In its second session, the 114 th Congress is expected to continue to review the negotiated TPP text and may consider the implementing legislation necessary for the agreement to enter into force in the United States. Such legislation would be eligible to receive expedited consideration under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) ( P.L. 114-26 ) if Congress determines that the proposed TPP advances U.S. trade negotiating objectives and meets various notification and consultation requirements under TPA. There are various TPA timelines for consideration of TPP implementing legislation.", "Through the proposed TPP, the participating countries seek to liberalize trade and investment and establish new rules and disciplines beyond those that already exist in World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements. The FTA is envisioned as a \"living agreement\" open to future members and new issues, and it may become a vehicle to advance a wider Asia-Pacific free trade area. South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Colombia, among others, have indicated interest in joining the TPP. The TPP is also a U.S. policy response to the rapidly increasing economic and strategic linkages among Asian-Pacific nations. It has become the economic centerpiece of the Administration's \"rebalance\" toward the region. The TPP slowly evolved from a more limited agreement among four countries concluded in 2006 into the current 12-country proposed FTA, with the United States joining the negotiations in 2008. Japan, the most recent country to participate, joined the negotiations in 2013. Japan's participation significantly increased the potential economic significance of the agreement to the United States because Japan is the largest economy and trading partner without an existing U.S. FTA among TPP negotiating partners (thus having greater scope for trade liberalization with the United States). The United States has existing FTAs with six of the countries participating in the TPP (Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore).", "Views on the likely impact of the proposed agreement vary. Proponents argue that the TPP will boost economic growth and jobs through expanded trade and investment with countries accounting for 37% of total U.S. trade (2014 data), and deepen U.S. trade and investment integration in what many see as the region with the world's greatest economic opportunities. Proponents also argue the agreement allows the United States to \"write the rules\" of trade and investment in the region, including new disciplines on issues such as digital trade barriers, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and regulatory coherence, and to show its strategic engagement and economic leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. Opponents voice concerns over possible job losses and competition in import-sensitive industries. They also raise concerns that the proposed TPP will limit the U.S. government's ability to regulate in areas such as health, food safety, and the environment. The U.S. International Trade Commission will assess the potential economic impacts of the agreement in a legislatively-mandated report due in May 2016.", "Throughout the TPP negotiations, certain issues have proven controversial. These include select market access issues (such as on dairy and other agricultural products, autos, and textiles and apparel) as well as the level of intellectual property protection, the scope and enforcement of environment and worker rights provisions, the treatment of SOEs, approaches to investor-state dispute settlement, access to government procurement, and the potential inclusion of provisions on currency valuation and exchange rates. Congress, in reviewing the proposed TPP agreement, may wish to consider, among other issues: whether the TPP advances U.S. negotiating objectives established in TPA; the potential economic impact of the agreement on U.S. firms, workers, and consumers; the TPP's potential geopolitical impact on U.S. relations in the region; and its influence on the multilateral trading system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP)4", "paragraphs": ["T-TIP is a potential FTA between the United States and European Union (EU), through which the two sides seek to enhance trade rules and market access by addressing remaining transatlantic barriers to trade and investment (see text box ).

The timing for concluding T-TIP is now uncertain due to the complexity of unresolved issues and the current U.S. focus on the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), among other factors.", "Core components of the T-TIP negotiations include: reducing and eliminating tariffs; enhancing cooperation, convergence, and transparency in regulations and standards-setting processes; further opening government procurement markets; and strengthening and developing new rules in areas such as intellectual property rights, investment, digital trade, trade facilitation, labor and the environment, localization barriers to trade, and state-owned enterprises. Some potential rules could exceed existing U.S. FTA or World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. Issues of active debate in T-TIP include regulatory cooperation, which is sensitive in part because of divergent U.S. and EU cultural preferences and values, and approaches to investor-state dispute settlement, complicated by differing views on its role in protecting investors and its impact on the ability of governments to regulate for public welfare. Other areas of debate include treatment of geographical indications (which protect distinctive products from a certain region, e.g., Parmesan cheese from the Parma region of Italy) and facilitation of data across borders. ", "Not only is T-TIP potentially significant economically and strategically for the United States and the EU, but it also carries global significance. T-TIP involves the world's two largest advanced economies and covers a major share of global trade and investment. However, views on the potential agreement differ. Supporters see T-TIP as an opportunity to boost transatlantic economic growth and jobs, strengthen the U.S.-EU bilateral relationship, support broader and deeper trade liberalization, and develop globally-relevant rules. Opponents voice concern over T-TIP's potential adverse effects on import sensitive sectors, its impact on U.S.-EU relations should negotiations stall, a focus on regional and bilateral FTAs detracting from multilateral trade liberalization, and potential infringement on the ability of governments to regulate in health, environmental, and other areas. ", "Congress has a direct interest in the T-TIP negotiations because it establishes overall U.S. trade negotiating objectives and would approve future implementing legislation for any final T-TIP agreement to enter into force. As it continues oversight of the negotiations, Congress may wish to examine to what extent T-TIP may address U.S. trade negotiating objectives. T-TIP presents other possible issues to Congress, including T-TIP's potential impact on the U.S. economy and particular sectors, its role in U.S.-EU relations and broader strategic implications, and its relationship to the proposed TPP and other trade agreements.

It also serves as a forum for dispute settlement resolution and trade liberalization negotiations. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO on January 1, 1995, and the new rules and trade liberalization agreements that occurred as a result of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994). The WTO succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1947.", "The WTO Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, begun in November 2001, has remained deadlocked for several years. At the WTO's 9 th Ministerial Conference, held in Bali, Indonesia, in 2013, WTO members agreed to a package of trade facilitation, agriculture, and development measures. Though considered modest in scope, it represented the first successful conclusion of a negotiation in the WTO's nearly 20-year history. The Bali agreements also directed the WTO Secretariat to develop a clearly defined work program to complete the Doha Round. However, the10 th Ministerial Conference, held in Nairobi, Kenya in December 2015, concluded with no clear path forward for the WTO Doha Round. Trade ministers and their senior representatives in Nairobi did reach consensus on a limited set of deliverables (see text box ). While the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration affirms the WTO as an important consensus-driven multilateral institution, it does not clearly endorse the continuation of the Doha Round and reflects the wide division among WTO members. The WTO's future as an effective multilateral trade negotiating organization remains in question. The deadlock in negotiations is largely due to differences between developing and advanced countries. Most developing countries want to continue to link the broad spectrum of agricultural and non-agricultural issues under the Doha Round. They maintain that unless all issues are addressed in a single package, issues important to developing countries will be ignored. Conversely, the developed economies have pushed for change, arguing that the WTO needs to address new issues, such as digital trade and investment, especially given the growth of major emerging markets, such as China and India. ", "Looking forward, the Nairobi Declaration underscored the importance of a multilateral rules-based trading system with regional and plurilateral agreements as a complement to, not a substitute for, the multilateral forum. Some WTO members, such as the United States and European Union (EU), support continued efforts to address the outstanding issues from the Doha Round, but advocate for new approaches rather than the single undertaking process in which no issue can move forward without agreement in all other areas. Such approaches could include de-linking the agriculture from the various non-agriculture issues within the WTO context, or pursuing separate sectoral agreements as is being done inside and outside the WTO. To this end, work continues to build on the current WTO agreements outside the scope of the Doha Round, including through plurilateral agreements that involve only a subset of WTO members. These efforts include: ", "WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). The TFA, which aims to streamline the flow of goods across borders, was finalized in Bali in 2013 and was the first formal new agreement reached under the WTO. Originally part of the Doha Round, the agreement contains provisions to expedite and achieve greater transparency in the movement, release, and clearance of goods, including goods in transit. The TFA will be implemented after two-thirds of WTO's currently 162 members have ratified the deal; 69 members (including the United States) have ratified it to date.WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA). The ITA, originally concluded in 1996 by a subset of WTO members, provides tariff-free treatment for covered IT products. While a plurilateral agreement, it is applied on a most-favored-nation (MFN) basis so that all WTO members benefit from the tariff cuts. ITA members have been involved in negotiations to expand the agreement. During the 2015 Nairobi Ministerial, the United States and other parties finalized an updated version of the ITA, further cutting tariffs on IT products. The expanded ITA will eliminate tariffs over a seven-year period on 201 additional goods over the 1996 original ITA. According to the WTO, the goods represent $1.3 trillion in annual global sales (10% of global trade), $180 billion by U.S. companies. Notably, Turkey, an original ITA member, did not join the revised version, and China maintained lengthy staging timeframes (up to seven years) on tariffs for approximately 40% of the items covered. WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). The GPA is a plurilateral agreement that provides market access for various non-defense government projects to its signatories. Each member submits lists of government entities and goods and services (with thresholds and limitations) that are open to bidding by firms of the other GPA members. Non-GPA signatories do not enjoy any rights under the GPA. Negotiations to expand the GPA were concluded in March 2012, and a revised GPA entered into force on April 6, 2014. The United States is among the 45 WTO members that are a part of the GPA. Several countries, including China, are in negotiations to accede to the GPA. Armenia, Montenegro, and New Zealand joined the GPA in 2015. WTO Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA). In July 2014, the United States and 13 other countries launched plurilateral negotiations within the WTO to liberalize trade in environmental goods and services, which are viewed as promoting sustainable development\u2014through tariff elimination. The first stage of the talks builds on a list of 54 environmental goods produced by the members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and, like the ITA, is being conducted on an open plurilateral basis, meaning that all benefits achieved through negotiation would be extended on a MFN basis to all members of the WTO. Thus, achieving a \"critical mass\" of participation by the producers of such goods\u2014suggested to be 90%\u2014is considered necessary to avoid the problem of free-riders. In 2016, negotiators are expected to continue to work on finalizing the scope of products to be covered under the potential tariff-cutting EGA. Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA).

The term \"services\" refers to an expanding range of economic activities, such as construction, retail and wholesale sales, e-commerce, financial services, professional services (such as accounting and legal services), logistics, transportation, tourism, and telecommunications. The impetus for TiSA comes from the lack of progress in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round on services trade liberalization. Given the impasse in the WTO, a subset of WTO members, led by the United States and Australia, launched informal discussions in early 2012 to explore negotiating a separate agreement focused on trade in services. On January 15, 2013, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) notified Congress of the United States' intention to engage formally in negotiations to reach a plurilateral TiSA. Negotiations began on April 15, 2013, and, as of February 2016, 16 rounds of TiSA negotiations and intercessional meetings have taken place in an effort to make further progress. The final scope and structure of TiSA are still under negotiation, but participants aim to conclude negotiations in 2016. The United States and the 22 other TiSA participants account for more than 70% of global trade in services. China has expressed interest in joining the TiSA.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Monetary Fund (IMF)25", "paragraphs": ["Recent congressional attention has centered on the use of IMF resources since the 2008 global economic crisis, proposed IMF governance changes, and the IMF's role in the Eurozone debt crisis. In December 2010, the Board of Governors of the IMF agreed to a set of institutional reforms that would increase the institution's core source of funding and expand the representation of major emerging markets, such as Brazil, China, India, and Mexico. The reform package will not take effect unless three-fifths of IMF members (113) representing 85% of the total voting power approve the reforms. Under this formula, approval by the United States is essential because it controls 16.75% of the voting power. By U.S. law, congressional authorization is required for the United States to consent to change the U.S. quota in the IMF, which determines the U.S. share of total voting power. Furthermore, depending on how the newly authorized U.S. contributions to the IMF are treated under the budget, appropriations may be required. ", "The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 114-47 ) authorizes U.S. participation in the IMF reform package once certain conditions have been met. Implementing the 2010 reform package would effectively transfer about $56.7 billion in U.S. financial commitments from the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) to quota. The U.S. quota commitment nearly doubled to about $115.2 billion, and U.S. commitments to the NAB falls to about $39.1 billion. Debate in the United States has focused on several areas; foremost is whether the IMF quota should be increased at all. Other issues that Members of Congress and analysts have considered are whether the United States would retain greater control over the use of its financial resources in the NAB relative to quota, due to procedural differences in how the two funds operate, and the budgetary treatment of U.S. participation in the IMF, among other issues. The United States retains veto power over major IMF policy decisions and keeps a representative on the IMF Executive Board. ", "Members may be interested in following the implementation of several policies and reporting requirements. The FY2016 appropriations act restricts the transfer from the NAB to quota until the U.S. Treasury certifies it has taken \"all necessary steps\" to seek eliminating the IMF's \"systemic exemption\" policy. This policy was introduced in 2010 to allow the IMF to approve large-scale lending programs to a country, despite concerns about the country's debt sustainability, if there is a high risk that not providing financial assistance would have spillover effects to other countries and potentially destabilize the global economy. Recent IMF loans to Greece, Portugal, and Ireland would likely not have been justified in the absence of the \"systemic exemption.\" In recent years, IMF staff has supported eliminating the \"systemic exemption,\" and proposed other reforms to increase the IMF's ability to provide support to highly-indebted, systemically important countries. ", "The FY2016 appropriations act also requires the U.S. Executive Director at the IMF to consult with Congress in advance of approving large IMF loans. It further requires the U.S. Treasury to submit a report to Congress providing a debt sustainability analysis and documentation justifying the loan. Additional reporting requirements relate, for example, to the cost estimates and budgetary treatment of U.S. contributions to the IMF, the practices of the IMF, and U.S. participation in the IMF.

The AIIB is expected to make its first loans in mid-2016. As its name suggests, the new entity is expected to focus on financing infrastructure projects throughout the region. China sees the AIIB and other financing mechanisms, including a $40 billion Silk Road Fund, the $100 billion New Development Bank (formerly known as the BRICS Development Bank), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Development Bank, as a means to finance what it calls a \"Silk Road Economic Belt\" and a \"21st Century Maritime Silk Road.\" The \"Silk Road Economic Belt\" would be a network of highways, railways and other critical infrastructure linking China to Central and South Asia, the Middle East and Europe. The Silk Road Maritime Route entails building or expanding ports throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. ", "The AIIB announcement followed closely an agreement in July 2014 on a separate development institution, the New Development Bank (NDB), by the leaders of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). Some observers are concerned that these new development banks may be duplicative of existing multilateral and regional institutions, and might provide financing with minimal, if any, policy conditionality and without adhering to established environmental and social safeguards, which many developing countries believe are too burdensome. By contrast, the United States and other major donors consider policy conditionality, safeguards, and other governance best practices, including measures such as rules on procurement, as being central to the effectiveness of development assistance, and have used their leadership in the MDBs to advance these priorities.", "While the United States has not opposed the creation of the AIIB and the BRICS Bank, U.S. officials reportedly initially pressured governments not to join. U.S. Administration officials recognize the need to support infrastructure investment globally, but express concerns about whether AIIB will incorporate the high standards of the World Bank and regional development banks particularly with respect to governance, and environmental and social safeguards. A broader concern is the emergence of Chinese-led regional economic institutions in which the United States has little influence and which offer alternatives to U.S.-led economic efforts in the region.

Although concerns have long focused on China, recently attention also has focused on Japan. Japan's currency, the yen, has depreciated against the U.S. dollar by about 50% between mid-2012 and the end of 2015 following a new set of expansionary monetary policies, similar to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programs. Some economists are skeptical about \"currency manipulation\" and whether it is a significant problem.

Greece's crisis has been rooted in concerns about the sustainability of its public finances and high debt levels, but it has had broader effects on Greece's economy, including a collapse in economic growth, high unemployment, and instability in the country's banking system. Although the Greek economy is small, accounting for less than 2% of Eurozone gross domestic product (GDP), many policymakers and analysts have been concerned about the potential contagion of the crisis in Greece to the rest of the Eurozone and the global economy. More fundamentally, the crisis has exposed problems with the institutional architecture of the Eurozone, whose member states share a common currency and monetary policy, but retain national control over fiscal and banking policies.", "Agreement on a third financial assistance package for Greece in the summer of 2015 has stabilized the economic situation in Greece, although some analysts still argue that the crisis could resurface. More broadly, Eurozone members face a challenging set of issues: (1) there are double-digit unemployment rates across the Eurozone as a whole and interest rates are close to zero; (2) persistently low rates of inflation raise the risk of economic stagnation; (3) business investment, a key factor in future economic growth, registers few signs of life; and (4) productivity and competitiveness gains have nearly disappeared. A prolonged economic slowdown could have implications for the U.S. economy, and particularly could depress demand for U.S. exports.

Argentina repaid the IMF in full in 2006 but only reached an agreement to repay the Paris Club creditor governments (including the United States) in May 2014. In terms of debt owed to private creditors, Argentina restructured more than 90% of the debt owed to private bondholders. A small group of private investors, the holdouts, did not participate in the exchanges and have not received any payment from Argentina since the 2001 default. The holdouts, mostly hedge funds that bought the bonds in secondary markets at steep discounts, have pursued litigation to seek full repayment from Argentina, primarily in the United States, since a large proportion of Argentine bonds were issued under New York law.
