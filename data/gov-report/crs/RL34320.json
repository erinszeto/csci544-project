Major areas of U.S. assistance and bilateral cooperation include de-mining and counter-narcotics programs, strengthening the country's regulatory framework and trade capacity, HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, the recovery of Americans missing in action during the Vietnam War, and military education and training. In 2008, the United States and Laos exchanged defense attach\u00e9s the first time in over 30 years. The U.S. government has embarked upon a policy of economic engagement with the LPDR as a means of influencing the future direction of Lao policy.", "The Obama Administration and Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the plight of former ethnic Hmong insurgents and their families, who have historical ties to the U.S.-backed Lao-Hmong guerilla army of the Vietnam War period, and efforts by Thai authorities to repatriate over 4,500 Lao-Hmong living in camps in Thailand, many of whom claim that they likely will be persecuted or discriminated against if they return to Laos. In June 2009, 31 Members of Congress signed a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urging her to appeal to the Thai government not to forcibly repatriate Hmong asylum seekers. U.S. officials have called upon the Thai and Lao governments for greater transparency in the repatriation and resettlement process.

Religious freedom reportedly has improved, particularly in urban areas. In 2009, the LPDR ratified the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and promulgated a legal framework for non-governmental organizations. Opium production and use have dropped dramatically since 1998. Between 1988 and 2008, the economy grew by over 6% per year, with the exception of 1997-1998 due to the Asian Financial Crisis. Meanwhile, U.S.-Laos trade has grown rapidly, albeit from a low base. In 2008, total trade between Laos and the United States was valued at $60 million compared to $15 million in 2006. The government has implemented market-oriented reforms, but progress has been slow.", "Major U.S. policy considerations include urging the Lao government to accept independent, international monitoring of the resettlement of former Lao-Hmong insurgents and Hmong returnees from Thailand; urging the Thai government not to forcibly repatriate Hmong determined to be political refugees; increasing assistance for de-mining activities in Laos; granting trade preferences or tariff relief for Lao products, particularly garments; and developing programs for sustainable management of the Mekong River."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The United States and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR), a small, largely agrarian Southeast Asian country ruled by a communist government, cooperate in many areas despite ideological differences and U.S. concerns about the ethnic Hmong minority.

The U.S. government has embarked upon a policy of economic engagement with Laos, expanding technical assistance to the Lao government to build its capacity to implement trade agreements and modernize its legal and regulatory framework: \"This is probably the most important action the U.S. Government can currently take to influence the future direction of Laos' policy.\" In June 2009, the Obama Administration removed the prohibition on U.S. Export-Import Bank financing for U.S. companies seeking to do business in Laos, citing Laos' commitment to opening its markets.

In 2008, the United States and Laos exchanged defense attach\u00e9s (the first time in over 30 years). Although substantial restrictions on civil rights and political freedoms remain, fewer human rights abuses have been reported in recent years. The country was upgraded to Tier 2 on the U.S. State Department's trafficking in persons list in 2007, and in 2008-2009 the Lao government \"demonstrated some progress in its anti-trafficking law enforcement.\" However, Laos increasingly has become a transit area for the trafficking of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Burmese women destined for Thailand. Bilateral cooperation on counter-narcotics activities has contributed to a 96% decline in opium production between 1998 and 2007, although smuggled methamphetamine use reportedly has risen among Lao youth.

The largest aid programs in Laos focus on de-mining and counternarcotics programs. New programs include those strengthening the country's legal and regulatory framework and trade capacity. Other, ongoing areas of U.S. assistance and bilateral cooperation include HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, military education (training in English language and military professionalism), and the recovery of Americans missing in action (MIAs).

It has pursued pro-market reforms and attempted to reduce political corruption and cronyism. In addition, the National Assembly reportedly has become more vocal about corruption, government accountability, and economic policy. In 2008, the National Assembly passed laws allowing for private ownership of media outlets and the formation of civil society groups. In May 2009, Prime Minister Bouasone signed the Decree on Associations establishing a legal framework for the formation of local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which foreign activists say is key toward establishing an effective international NGO presence and civil society in Laos. In 2009, the LPDR ratified the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

During that time, university students and teachers staged two demonstrations for democratic reforms. Rebel militias operating out of Thailand carried out several attacks on Lao border posts. Anti-government groups detonated over a dozen small bombs in the capital, Vientiane, and other cities, killing several people. Several ambushes of highway buses and other vehicles, in which over 40 people died, were reported.

Vietnam's influence on Laos remains strong and paternalistic, particularly in political and military affairs and among the Revolutionary Party's old guard, although China's economic influence is growing. Laos' northern provinces reportedly are becoming economically integrated with China's Yunnan province, while Chinese commercial influence is emerging in Vientiane. In addition, China has become a principal source of economic assistance, including grants, low-interest loans, technical assistance, and foreign investment. Some observers believe that Hanoi has encouraged the Lao government to improve relations with the United States in an effort to counteract Chinese influence.

The LPDR shares cultural and religious traditions and maintains close economic ties with Thailand, and its relations with Cambodia and Burma (Myanmar) are generally cordial. Laos joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1997, partly to tie its development to the group's growing internal and external trade linkages. As a member of ASEAN, Laos is a party to the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which requires Laos to fully comply with tariff reduction requirements by 2015. Vientiane hosted the 10 th ASEAN Summit in November 2004, the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in July 2005, and the Southeast Asian Games in December 2009.", "The United States and Japan have stepped up efforts to engage the lower Mekong sub-region of which Laos is a part.

On the sidelines of this gathering, Clinton participated in the first U.S.-Lower Mekong Delta Ministerial meeting. At the Ministerial meeting, which included the nations of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, the United States pledged to continue or enhance cooperation and assistance in the areas of the environment, health, and education. In recent years, Japan also has made an attempt to enhance ties in the sub-region, largely reflecting a response to China's growing influence.

The EU is also a major regional trading partner and a large market for Lao products. Laos is still not heavily dependent upon foreign trade, however, and has been somewhat insulated from the global economic downturn. Vietnam, China, Thailand, and South Korea are the LPDR's largest foreign investors.

The Lao People's Army then allegedly carried out a war of attrition in the northern mountains against remaining Hmong militias and communities that had resisted surrendering.

Thailand has long been reluctant to allow UNHCR involvement for fear of encouraging an influx of refugees from Laos and other neighboring countries, and reportedly has restricted international access to the camp.
