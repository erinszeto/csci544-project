It recommended establishing a national mandatory reporting systemto hold hospitals and other health care facilities accountable for errors that lead to serious injury ordeath. Emphasizing that medical errors are primarily the result of faulty systems, process, andconditions that lead people to make mistakes, the IOM also recommended the development ofvoluntary, confidential systems for reporting medical errors that result in no harm (i.e., close calls)or minimal harm. Analysis of such voluntarily reported information could then be used to identifysystem vulnerabilities and develop preventive strategies. The Patient Safety and QualityImprovement Act attempted to implement that recommendation.", "The IOM based its conclusions on epidemiologic studies published in the 1980s and early1990s. While medical researchers were familiar with the published estimates of the prevalence ofmedical errors in hospitals and other inpatient settings, the information was new to the public andit caught the attention of federal and state legislators and health care policymakers. Indeed, a 1999survey showed that patient safety was the most closely followed health policy story of the year. (2) As a result of the IOM report,numerous patient safety initiatives were initiated within the federal government and throughout theprivate sector, in health plans and health care trade organizations and accrediting andstandard-setting bodies.", "States responded to the IOM report by considering legislation to expand existing mandatoryreporting systems and, in some cases, enact new systems. Currently, 22 states have mandatoryreporting systems. The goal is to hold hospitals and health care providers accountable to the publicfor the most serious mistakes in the delivery of health care. In an effort to encourage providers toreport errors, most states have adopted measures to protect reporting system data from use bymalpractice attorneys. Policymakers have had to balance provider concerns about the legalconsequences of making information available to attorneys and patients with the desire for publicaccountability.", "Legislation to encourage medical errors reporting was first introduced in the 106th Congress,following the release of the IOM report. (3) Much of it was reintroduced in the 107th Congress and again in the108th. Patient safety lies at the heart of the current debate on medical malpractice reform. Many trialattorneys defend the current tort system, claiming that the threat of litigation makes providerspractice safer medicine. They view tort law as an important driver of health care quality. Butexperts on health care quality reject this argument. Echoing the IOM's recommendations, theycontend that the only way to realize significant improvements in patient safety is by improving healthcare systems. And that, in turn, requires the analysis of medical errors report. By discouragingphysicians from reporting such information, the tort system is in conflict with this approach to safetyimprovement.", "This report provides an overview and some analysis of medical errors reporting and theHouse and Senate patient safety bills.

Medicalerrors can happen at all stages of the process of care, from diagnosis, to treatment, to preventive care. Not all errors result in harm. Those that do are referred to as preventable adverse events. An adverseevent is an injury related to a medical intervention and not due to the underlying medical conditionof the patient. While adverse events are often attributable to error and, therefore, preventable, theyneed not always be the result of medical mismanagement (see discussion of adverse drug reactionsbelow).", "A limited number of published studies have examined adverse events among hospitalizedpatients. Extrapolating from the results of two large, retrospective reviews of hospital records, theIOM estimated that more than 1 million medical errors occur each year in the United States, of whichbetween 44,000 and 98,000 are fatal. (4) It also concluded that errors may cost the nation as much as $29billion annually in direct medical costs and lost income and productivity. Some researchers havechallenged the accuracy of the IOM's numbers, but there is general agreement that the problem isserious. (5) Still others saythe IOM may have underestimated the true incidence of medical errors because it only considerederrors that occur among hospital patients, which represent a small proportion of the total populationat risk. Many patients receive increasingly complex care in ambulatory settings such as outpatientsurgical centers, physicians' offices, and clinics.", "Echoing the views of most health care analysts, the IOM emphasized that medical errors areprimarily a systemic problem and generally not attributable to individual negligence or misconduct.

For example, Washington requires the reporting ofmedication-related errors, whereas Tennessee requires health care facilities to report any \"unusualevents.\" In Florida, hospitals are required to report errors that result in certain specified injuries(e.g., brain or spinal damage), whereas in Pennsylvania they must report \"any situation or occurrencethat could seriously compromise quality assurance or patient safety.\" Arizona requires health carefacilities to review reports made by medical practitioners regarding violations of professionalstandards or the law. In contrast, New Jersey requires hospitals and other institutions to report\"serious medical errors\" to regulators and patients. Some states also include in their reportingmandates provisions to prevent the discovery of error information in civil or administrativeproceedings. Few states have the experts to analyze more than a fraction of the reports they receive. Most reports are not investigated and few hospitals receive any feedback.

They must motivate health care providers and facilities toreport errors promptly and accurately, while at the same time holding them accountable through asystem of public disclosure of information about errors. The IOM concluded that the public has aright to information concerning the safety of the health care system. Providers, however, arereluctant to report adverse events.

(11) Some states have exempted reporting system data from theirpublic disclosure (i.e., Freedom of Information) laws, while others have relied on their existing peerreview statutes. (12) Peerreview laws can provide strong protections for reporting system data if they cover (or are interpretedto cover) all activities related to the administration of the reporting system. However, courts haveoccasionally found that the rights of an individual to information relating to a personal lawsuittrumps peer review protection.", "For these reasons, most of the mandatory reporting systems established since the IOM reporthave comprehensive, system-specific protections of data and reporters built into the authorizingstatute. For example, information may be protected from discovery, subpoena, search warrant, andevidence in civil or administrative proceedings. Protections for reporters may include exclusionfrom civil and criminal lawsuits, monetary liability, state antitrust lawsuits, compelled testimony,and employer retaliation (i.e., \"whistleblower\" protection).", "System design features, such as de-identifying data and receiving reports anonymously, mayreduce the need for strong legal protections by making it more difficult to link specific incidents toindividuals or institutions. Of course, such measures also limit the utility of the information toanalysts.", "Despite their efforts to shield error information from legal discovery and public disclosure,states have had limited success in encouraging providers to report adverse events. Underreportingis a serious issue for state reporting systems and it can have important consequences for health carequality. (13) Failure toinform a patient of a medical error may delay or deprive prompt treatment, which in turn may exposethe physician to greater liability. Underreporting also hinders research on the prevalence and rootcauses of errors, hampering quality improvement initiatives.", "While providers' fears of legal exposure are real and must be addressed, it remains unclearwhether they have merit. There are no studies on whether reported error information is being usedin malpractice litigation. Moreover, there is little research on the influence of specific laws onreporting behavior. Further complicating the issue is the fact that fear of liability is just one ofseveral factors that lead to the underreporting of medical errors. Other factors include facilities' lackof internal systems to identify events, the culture of medical practice that discourages drawingattention to errors, fear of institutional sanctions, anxiety about maintaining good relationships withpeers, loss of business, damage to reputation, and whether the amount of feedback and the potentialbenefits from reporting justify the time and effort it takes to report. There is not enough evidenceto predict the impact that eliminating one or more of these disincentives would have on reportingbehavior.

In some cases, states are also reluctant todisclose information in order to alleviate the concerns of hospitals and practitioners.

The IOM reportobserved that few states aggregate the data or analyze them to identify general trends. Analysis andfollow-up tend to occur on a case-by-case basis.

The program has become well-established andtrusted within the airline industry and is credited with contributing to improvements in aviationsafety over the past 28 years. ASRS analyzes the voluntarily submitted aviation safety incidentreports to identify deficiencies and discrepancies in the national aviation system so that correctiveaction can be taken. ASRS data are also used to support policies and planning for improving thenational aviation system, and to strengthen the foundation of aviation human factors safety research. This is especially important given estimates that as much as two-thirds of all aviation accidents andincidents are rooted in human performance error.

The NCPS developed aninternal, confidential, non-punitive reporting and analysis system, the Patient Safety InformationSystem (PSIS), which permits VA employees to report both adverse events and close calls withoutfear of punishment. The PSIS is not a blame-free system.

Using toolsdeveloped by NCPS, multidisciplinary teams conduct a root cause analysis of reported adverseevents. Root cause analysis is a process for identifying the causal factors that underlie an event. Itfocuses primarily on systems and processes, not individual performance. The end product of a rootcause analysis is an action plan outlining strategies that the organization intends to implement toreduce the risk of a similar event occurring in the future.", "Following PSIS implementation, NCPS saw a 900-fold increase in reporting of close calls,and a 30-fold increase in reporting of adverse events. For its efforts in improving patient safety inthe VA health care system, NCPS was awarded the prestigious Innovations in American GovernmentAward in 2001.

JCAHO initiated a sentinel eventreporting system for hospitals in 1996. A sentinel event is defined as one that results in anunanticipated death or major permanent loss of function not related to the natural course of thepatient's illness or underlying condition. Sentinel events also include: patient suicide in a settingthat provides round-the-clock care; rape; infant abduction or discharge to the wrong facility; majorincompatibility reactions in blood transfusion recipients; and surgery on the wrong patient or bodypart.

To encourage sentinel event reporting, JCAHO has established a policy ofnot penalizing the accreditation status of an organization that reports such events and performs a rootcause analysis. Reporting sentinel events to JCAHO is not entirely voluntary. If a hospital fails toreport an event and JCAHO learns of it from a third party, it requires the hospital to conduct a rootcause analysis or risk loss of accreditation. JCAHO analyzes the error-related information it receivesand publishes recommendations in the Sentinel Event Alert . Despite these efforts, few hospitalsreport sentinel events because they view the program as cumbersome, time-consuming,unresponsive, and potentially risky.

For one thing, severalnational reporting systems already exist, particularly for medication errors. Moreover, acomprehensive national reporting system would require an enormous investment in funding andpersonnel, in view of the potential volume of reports.

That approach would help manage the potential volume of reports and matchthe expertise to the problems. There also needs to be a mechanism for sharing information acrossdifferent reporting systems. A report in one system may have relevance for another system (e.g.,errors in surgery that also involve medications).

Patient safety workproduct would be privileged and not subject to: a civil or administrative subpoena; discovery inconnection with a civil or administrative proceeding; or disclosure under the Freedom of InformationAct. Moreover, it could not be used in any adverse employment action against an employee who ingood faith reports the information to a provider (with the intention of having it reported to a patientsafety organization) or reports the data directly to a patient safety organization. Patient safety workproduct would not encompass documents or communications that are part of traditional medicalrecord keeping.

Anypublic or private organization seeking PSO certification would have to meet certain criteria. Forexample, they would have to contain appropriately qualified staff, including licensed or certifiedmedical professionals, and not be part of a health insurance company. A PSO would also have tobe managed and operated independently from any provider that reported to it. The House bill didnot include any language to encourage the establishment of PSOs in every state or region of thecountry.", "H.R. 663 would have required AHRQ to establish a national database to receiveand analyze de-identified information submitted by PSOs.

While S. 720had the same basic structure as the House-passed legislation, there were several key differences. Lawmakers were unable to reconcile those differences before the 108th Congress adjourned. OnMarch 8, 2005, Senator Jeffords reintroduced the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act( S. 544 ). S. 544 , which is identical to last year's Senate-passed measure( S. 720 ), was unanimously approved by the Senate HELP Committee on March 9, 2005. Table 3 on page 22 compares the patient safety legislation with the IOM report's recommendations. Table 4 , which begins on page 23, provides a side-by-side comparison of H.R. 663 and S. 544 .", "Definition of Protected Information. As passedby the House, H.R. 663 would have provided legal protection to \"patient safety workproduct,\" which it defined as any document or communication that is: developed by a provider forthe purpose of reporting to a PSO, and reported to a PSO; created by a PSO; or that would reveal theworkings of a \"patient safety evaluation system.\" The bill defined a patient safety evaluation systemas a process for collecting, managing, or analyzing information submitted to or by a PSO. Patientsafety work product would not include a document or communication that is developed, maintained,or exists separately from any patient safety evaluation system (e.g., a patient's medical record or anyother patient or hospital record).", "The legal protections in S. 544 apply to all \"patient safety data.\" When theSenate bill was first approved by the HELP Committee during the 108th Congress, some analystsraised concerns that the definition of patient safety data was too broad. It included, for example,\"any data ... that could result in improved patient safety or health care quality or health careoutcomes, that are ... collected from a provider ....\" Critics of this language argued that it wouldextend the bill's evidentiary privilege and confidentiality protections to a wide range of quality- andoutcomes-related information. As a result, the bill would have the unintended effect of preemptingstate laws that require hospitals to report infection rates, medical outcomes, and serious adverseevents.", "To address those concerns, the definition of patient safety data was modified to more closelyresemble the language in H.R. 663 , which was tied to the activities of PSOs. S. 544 defines patient safety data as any data, reports, records, memoranda, analyses,or written or oral statements that are: collected or developed by a provider for reporting (within 60days) to a PSO; requested by a PSO and reported within 60 days; reported to a provider by a PSO;or collected by a PSO from another PSO, or developed by a PSO. The definition also states that\"patient safety data shall not include information (including a patient's medical record, billing anddischarge information or any other patient or provider record) that is collected or developedseparately from and that exists separately from patient safety data.\" This separate data provision hasbeen criticized as circular, because it says in effect that information that is not patient safety data isnot patient safety data.", "S. 544 also includes a provision that is intended to protect mandatory statereporting laws. The provision states that nothing in the bill limits the reporting of information thatis not patient safety data to a \"federal, state, or local governmental agency for public healthsurveillance, investigation, or other public health purposes or health oversight purposes. H.R. 663 included comparable language. It said that nothing in the bill preempts orotherwise affects \"state law requiring a provider to report information ... that is not patient safetywork product.\"", "Privilege. H.R. 663 would haveprotected patient safety work product from discovery in connection with a civil and administrativeproceeding, and from admission as evidence or disclosure in any such proceeding. Patient safetywork product would not be protected from use in criminal proceedings. By comparison, S. 544 would prohibit lawyers from obtaining or using patient safety data in civil,administrative, and criminal proceedings, unless a judge determined that the information containedevidence of \"a wanton and criminal act to directly harm the patient.\" That language was includedis an effort to ensure that the legislation does not unduly compromise the rights of injured patientsto obtain compensation.", "In its 1999 report, the IOM focused on protecting voluntarily reported patient safetyinformation from discovery and admission as evidence in civil and administrative proceeding, notingthat \"instances of criminal prosecution for medical errors are exceptionally rare.\" The intent was toencourage the voluntary reporting of information about near misses and other problems that wouldotherwise go unreported were it not for legal protection. Analysis of such information would thenbe used to identify vulnerabilities in health care systems. Voluntary reporting systems, as envisionedby the IOM, would not interfere with the mandatory reporting of more serious errors, as requiredunder state law and other accountability systems.", "Confidentiality. S. 544 designatespatient safety data as confidential and not subject to disclosure, except in certain specifiedcircumstances (e.g., disclosure by a provider to a PSO). Negligent or intentional disclosure of patientsafety data in violation of the bill's confidentiality provisions is subject to civil fines of up to $10,000per violation.", "H.R. 663 also specified the circumstances under which disclosure of patientsafety work product (identifiable and nonidentifiable) was permitted and provided for penalties ofup to $10,000 per violation for disclosures other than those permitted. Unlike S. 544 ,the House bill did not expressly state that work product is confidential, though this was implied inthe bill's language. H.R. 663 said that disclosures in violation of the bill's provisionsare unlawful and subject to fines, provided such disclosures constitute \"a negligent or knowingbreach of confidentiality.\"", "Both H.R. 663 and S. 554 state that if the disclosure is in violationof the HIPAA privacy rule, then the HIPAA penalties apply instead. For details of the civil andcriminal penalties under HIPAA, see CRS Report RS20500 , Medical Records Privacy: Questionsand Answers on the HIPAA Rule .", "PSO Certification and Listing. Under the patientsafety legislation, providers would voluntarily submit information on medical errors to public orprivate entities designated as PSOs. The PSOs would analyze the data and develop and disseminateevidence-based information to providers to help them implement changes that would improve patientsafety. H.R. 663 would have required AHRQ to establish a process for certifying PSOs. The bill listed several criteria for certification. For example, a PSO must not be \"a component ofa health insurer or other entity that offers a group health plan or health insurance coverage,\" and mustbe \"managed, controlled, and operated independently from any provider\" that reports patient safetywork product to the PSO. That would appear to exclude the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),among others, from PSO certification. As previously discussed, the VA has developed an internal,confidential, non-punitive reporting and analysis system and is widely recognized as a leader inpatient safety. H.R. 663 also would have required PSOs that are components of otherorganizations to protect the confidentiality of patient safety work product and ensure that theirmission did not create a conflict of interest with the rest of the organization.", "By comparison, S. 544 relies on a process of PSO self-certification.Organizations would be required to submit a certification to AHRQ that they intend to perform thevarious PSO activities specified in the legislation. The agency would review the submission and,if acceptable, place the name of the organization on a list of certified PSOs. S. 544 doesnot include any criteria that place limits on the types of public or private entities that seek PSOcertification and listing, nor does it address the issue of conflict of interest.", "Civil Penalties. As noted above, both billsprovide for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each negligent or intentional disclosure ofpatient safety information in violation of the provisions in the legislation. The bills also prohibit ahealth care provider from taking any adverse employment action against an employee who in goodfaith reports information to the provider with the intention of having it reported to a PSO, or whoreports the information directly to a PSO. But whereas H.R. 663 included civil finesof up to $20,000 per violation for providers who took such action, S. 544 permits anemployee to sue their employer to enjoin a wrongful adverse employment action and to obtainequitable relief, including reinstatement, back pay, and restoration of benefits.", "Unlike the House bill, S. 544 specifies that providers include state-run facilities.Because the federal government cannot give state employees a right to sue the state, S. 544 includes a provision requiring state hospitals to agree to be subject to such civil action in orderto assert the privileges established by the legislation.", "Drug and Biological Product Identification. H.R. 663 instructed FDA to require unique product identifiers on the packaging of drugsand biological products. That provision would appear to have been met by the agency's February26, 2004 bar code rule. There is no comparable provision in S. 544 .", "Health Information Technology (IT) Standards, Grants andAdvisory Board. Both bills would require the Secretary of Health and HumanServices to adopt voluntary, national interoperability standards for the electronic exchange of healthcare information. H.R. 663 contained three additional health IT provisions, none ofwhich are included in the Senate version. The House measure authorized grants to physicians forelectronic prescription programs, and to hospitals for purchasing health IT systems. It also wouldhave created a Medical Information Technology Advisory Board (MITAB) to makerecommendations to the Secretary and Congress on promoting electronic information exchange toimprove patient safety and the quality of health care.", "Congress and the Administration have taken a number of important steps in the past twoyears to promote the adoption of IT systems for the electronic collection and exchange of patientinformation in order to reduce medical errors, lower health care costs, and improve the quality ofcare. The health IT provisions in the patient safety legislation duplicate some of those actions. Forexample, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act ( P.L. 108-173 )required the Secretary to adopt electronic prescribing standards and establish a Commission onSystemic Interoperability to develop a comprehensive strategy for the adoption and implementationof health IT data standards.
