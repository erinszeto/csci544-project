During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs also pursued a number of other U.S. policy goals, such as reducing high rates of population growth, promoting economic development in general, advancing U.S. trade interests, expanding access to basic education and health care, and protecting the environment. In the 1990s, other goals included stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, expanding peace efforts in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting human rights and religious freedom, and countering trafficking in persons.", "A defining change in focus came following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Since then, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have taken on a more strategic sense of importance, and have been frequently cast in terms of contributing to the war on terrorism. In 2002, President Bush released his National Security Strategy that for the first time established global development as the third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. Development was again underscored in the Administration's re-statement of the National Security Strategy released on March 16, 2006.", "Also in 2002, foreign assistance budget justifications began to highlight the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority, emphasizing amounts of U.S. assistance to 28 \"front-line\" states\u2014countries that cooperate with the United States in the war on terrorism or face terrorist threats themselves. Large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq, which peaked in FY2004, are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism. State Department efforts focused extensively on building coalitions to assist in the war on terrorism and finding new and more effective ways of presenting American views and culture through public diplomacy.", "In the context of the post 9/11 environment, the Bush Administration announced significant initiatives relating to diplomacy and foreign aid. A new transformational diplomacy initiative, announced in 2006, would reposition diplomats to global trouble spots, create regional public diplomacy centers, localize small posts outside of foreign capitals, and train diplomats in new skills. (See \" Transformational Diplomacy \" section for more information.) Also announced in 2006 was the creation of a new position at the State Department, the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA), who serves concurrently as USAID Administrator. Heading up the new \"F bureau\" at State, the DFA has created a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance with the objectives of providing more coordination, coherence, transparency, and accountability for aid programs. (See Transformational Development section for more information.)", "Other presidential initiatives address development and global health concerns. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is a new aid delivery concept, proposed by President Bush in 2002, authorized by Congress (Title VI, Division D of P.L. 108-199 ), and established in early 2004. It is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of U.S. resources in a few low- and low-middle income countries that have demonstrated a strong commitment to political, economic and social reforms. The President initially pledged $5 billion annually by FY2006, although funds requested and appropriated have never reached this level.", "With regard to global health issues, President Bush announced in 2003 a five-year, $15 billion commitment to combat HIV/AIDS. Known as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, the initiative has focused significant funds in 15 focus countries, largely in Africa. Subsequently, the President launched a new initiative in mid-2005 aimed specifically at malaria (President's Malaria Initiative, or PMI), pledging $1.2 billion in additional resources through 2010. These initiatives, which have benefitted African nations, have contributed to fulfilling the Administration's pledge to double aid to Africa in the 2004-2010 period. In May 2007, the President announced a second phase commitment of an additional $30 billion through FY2013.", "Beyond these recently emerging foreign policy goals relating to terrorism and global health concerns, other prominent objectives have continued since the early 1990s including supporting peace in the Middle East through assistance to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians; fostering democratization and stability for countries in crisis, like Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda, Kosovo, Liberia, and Sudan; facilitating democratization and free market economies in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union; suppressing international narcotics production and trafficking through assistance to Colombia and the Andean region; and alleviating famine and mitigating refugee situations in places throughout the world.", "The international affairs budget can be divided into two components\u2014State Department/Diplomacy/Broadcasting and Foreign Operations.

The category of Developing countries includes low and lower-middle income countries that are not yet meeting performance criteria. Sustaining Partnership countries include upper-middle income countries with which the United States maintains economic, trade, and security relationships beyond foreign aid. Restrictive countries include authoritarian regimes with significant freedom and human rights issues, most of which are ineligible for U.S. aid. Programs in these countries operate through non-governmental organizations or through entities outside the country. A sixth category was created to encompass global or regional programs that transcend any one country's borders.", "Each category represents common development challenges around which aid programs are to be designed and coordinated. Strategic objectives have been created and linked to country categories. Strategic objectives include peace and security; governing justly and democratically; investing in people; economic growth; and humanitarian assistance.

Second, a sizeable portion of ESF funds\u00a0has been used for budget support rather than development projects.

The largest portion of this increase is in the HIV/AIDS initiative, with both DA and CSH falling from last year's levels. If one also includes other accounts (Millennium Challenge, Transition Initiatives, disaster and famine aid, food aid, and migration and refugee assistance), the increase from last year is 13%. However, virtually all of this increase can be attributed to the 71% increase in funds for the Millennium Challenge Corporation. All other accounts receive the same or decreased funding.", "Dividing the ESF account into budget support versus program funding helps clarify the debate of how to characterize ESF. Of the amount requested for Economic Support Fund, approximately $478 million would go for budget support with the remainder presumably funding development projects. Using this scenario, the ratio of core to non-core for FY2008 is 86% to 14%.", "The Administration prefers that the focus be on strategic objectives rather than accounts.

An additional $32 million is from the ESF ($6 million) and FSA ($26 million) accounts. The allocation for GHAI is 7% above the request. Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria . The bill allocates $550 million for the Global Fund, $250 million from the CSH account and $300 million from GHAI. Unlike in previous years, the Administration did not request a Foreign Operations contribution for the Fund, but instead proposed a $300 million transfer from the Department of Health and Human Services. Malaria . The bill provides $352.5 million for malaria treatment and prevention programs, of which $270 million is designated for the President's Malaria Initiative. Of the total, $350 million is allocated from the CSH account, with the remainder from ESF. The Administration had requested $387.5 million for malaria programs. Tuberculosis . The bill provides $266 million for tuberculosis and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, of which $103 million is from the CSH account, $150 million from GHAI, $10 million from FSA, and $3 million from ESF. The Administration had requested $89.9 million. Avian Influenza . The bill includes $100 million for avian flu programs from the CSH account, an amount equal to the request. Family Planning and Reproductive Health . The bill provides $374.2 million for Child Survival and Maternal Health programs, and $441 million for Reproductive Health and Voluntary Family Planning, of which $375 million is from the CSH account. Contraceptives . New language (Section 622) exempts the provision of contraceptives from the March 28, 2001, Memorandum to the Administrator of USAID. The memo restored the Mexico City language that required foreign NGOs to certify that they do not perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning in order to receive U.S. family planning assistance. The bill retains language from previous years that restricts funding to organizations that support or participate in programs of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The bill also retains language prohibiting funding for the performance of abortions. Development Assistance and Economic Support Fund . The bill provides $1.734 billion for the Development Assistance (DA) account, an increase of 67% over the request. The President's budget proposed a sharp decrease in DA, down 31% from FY2006, because of a shift of funds to the ESF account as a result of the Strategic Framework on Foreign Assistance. The President's budget called for a 35% increase in ESF. Instead, the bill provides $2.66 billion for ESF, a reduction of 20% from the request. Report language states that the DA account includes $365 million that had been requested in ESF, and the committee directs that this amount be provided to certain countries in addition to the requested DA amounts for Afghanistan ($150 million), Democratic Republic of Congo ($10 million), Liberia ($30 million), Pakistan ($30 million), and Sudan ($145 million). Basic Education . The bill provides a total of $750 million for basic education, and directs that $519 million come from the DA account. Of the total, $265 million is to be used to implement basic education assistance consistent with H.R. 2092 , the Education for All Act of 2007, as introduced on May 1, 2007. Millennium Challenge Corporation . The bill provides $1.8 billion for MCC, a cut of $1.2 billion from the request. An amendment offered in full committee to increase this amount by $200 million was withdrawn. Foreign Military Financing . The bill provides $4.46 billion for the FMF program, a 2% decrease from the request. Iraq . The bill provides no funding for the Administration's request for Iraq. The report notes that Congress provided $2.86 billion for Iraq in the FY2007 Supplemental, and that more than $3 billion remains unspent from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. In full committee, an amendment to provide $133 million in Iraq assistance was defeated.", "In other full committee action, a number of amendments were approved", "to increase military assistance to Pakistan by $50 million; to require a report, rather than a certification, from the Secretary of State on human rights in Indonesia; to encourage the President to use $50 million for democracy promotion in Iran; to encourage the President to use $10 million in previous years' funds to protect Iraqi Christians; to direct the Secretary of State to review the need for enhanced facilities of the Haitian Parliament and to consider granting an exception to current Department policy, allowing a portion of the $23.9 million requested for democracy assistance to be used by Haiti to purchase the U.S. Embassy property adjacent to the Haitian Parliament; to clarify the dates on which the State Department must report to Congress with regard to restrictions on family planning funds; to require a report from the State Department on the evidence and criteria used if the Department should determine that an organization or program supports and participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization; to recommend that Development Assistance funding for countries in the Western Hemisphere be increased by $56 million to restore country program levels to at least FY2006 levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Foreign Operations\u2014Floor Action", "paragraphs": ["The House completed action on H.R. 2764 ( H.Rept. 110-197 ) on June 22, 2007, including several amendments.

An amendment to increase ESF funds for Cuba democracy programs was adopted by a vote of 254-170.
