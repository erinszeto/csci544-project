The Administration has also provided sparse information about the allocationof spending between Iraq, Afghanistan, and enhanced security for defense installations, as well asthe number of troops deployed and current and future plans. For example, DOD has only providedthe distribution of funding by mission to Congress in the FY2004 Emergency Supplemental request,and only for FY2004, but not for earlier years or for the current request. (11) Some have expresseddissatisfaction with the quality and level of detail in DOD reporting on previous flexible funding.While flexible funding gives DOD a special tool to respond to the uncertainties of operations, it mayreduce the information available to Congress on U.S. plans, actions and options, and hence maymake oversight more difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["Both the House and Senate provide the $25 billion requested by the Administration for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the FY2005 DOD authorization bill ( H.R. 4200 and S. 2400 ) and the FY2005 DOD appropriation bills ( H.R. 4613 for bothhouses, H.Rept. 108-533 and S.Rept. 108-284 ), passed on June 22 and June 24 respectively.

TheAdministration has generally been reluctant to provide reconstitution funding in supplementals,although DOD has transferred funds provided in the FY2003 and FY2004 supplementals for forceprotection items such as body armor and uparmored HUMVees.

The conference version also provides lessfunding for procurement, primarily for Other procurement, Army, where force protection equipmentsuch as uparmored HUMVees is funded.

(25) The House appropriators providefunds in specific military personnel accounts tocover costs for the first quarter of the year.

Both appropriation bills provide additional funding for body armor fortroops in the Army's O&M accounts (e.g. $334 million in the House and $295 million in the Senate)and over $2 billion for procurement, much of it for force protection items (e.g., over $850 millionfor new vehicles or kits to uparmor HUMVees). (26)", "Funding Flexibility. Of the $25 billion total, the conference version provides $3.4 billion or 14% in flexible funding. That $3.4 billion total includes$1.9 billion of unallocated funding in the Iraqi Freedom Fund (the IFF also includes $1.8 billion forclassified programs and $100 million for the Coast Guard) and $1.5 billion in transfer authority. ", "Both the House and the Senate appropriation bills provided about the same level of flexibility as the authorization bills, between $2 billion and $3 billion. The House version includes $2 billionin the Iraq Freedom Fund (IFF) Committee but specifies that $2.0 billion is for intelligence activities,leaving $1.0 billion for DOD to allocate. To provide additional flexibility, the House appropriatorsinclude $2.0 billion in transfer authority for the $25 billion in war-related funding, subject tostandard reprogramming rules. The Senate appropriators would give DOD $2.5 billion in the IraqiFreedom Fund to be allocated at DOD's discretion, but no additional transfer authority.", "To ensure that the Army has sufficient funds available to finance its operations in FY2004 -- a current concern -- the conference version (reflecting both houses) makes the $25 billion availableupon enactment. (27) The conference versiondropped the requirement in the Senate bill that theAdministration submit an official request. Like both houses, the conference bill also designates thefunds as emergency but no longer requires an emergency designation from the executive branch. (28)", "There is an ongoing debate about the size of the Army's shortfall in funds to finance its operations in Iraq in FY2004. DOD contends that sufficient funds will be available. (29) , CRSestimated that the shortfall in operations and maintenance (O&M) funding would range from $5.3billion to $7.1 billion but that DOD could tap about $7.0 billion in lower-than-anticipated costselsewhere to finance the shortfall. (30) Based onforecasts by the services, a new GAO report estimatesthat the Army will face an O&M shortfall of $10.2 billion, with the other services reporting shortfallsof about $3.0 billion more. To meet these shortfalls, GAO reports that the Army and the otherservices plan to transfer funds from other accounts with surpluses and defer some activities (likedepot maintenance) to the following fiscal year. (31) To accommodate these shifts in funding, theconference version of the FY2005 DOD appropriation bill ( H.R. 4613 ) increases DOD'sgeneral transfer authority from $2.1 billion to $2.8 billion. (32)", "Reporting Requirements. The conference version of H.R. 4613 provides most of the funding in regular appropriations bills and $2.0 billionin the Iraq Freedom Fund, which would be subject to the five-day advance notification and quarterlyreporting that was included in both the House and Senate version of the bill. The conference versiondid not adopt the Senate approach where all funds were appropriated to the IFF with floors byappropriation account. Under that approach, all transfers would have been under the reportingrequirement (see Table 1 ). Extending the availability of funds beyond one year also gives DODadditional flexibility. All funds, except for procurement funds and IFF funds, are available for oneyear in the conference version rather than one year in the House bill and two years in the Senatebill. (33)", "The conference bill adopted the extensive report to the Congress as a whole on military operations and reconstruction activities in Iraq that was required in the House bill. Required byApril 30 and October 31, DOD is required to report on amounts expended for Iraq and Afghanistan,progress in preventing attacks on U.S. personnel, effects on readiness, recruitment, retention, andequipment, on reserve forces. The report on treatment of prisoners in Iraq included by the Housewas dropped in conference. (34) The conferenceversion did retain the House provison (reflectingadoption of the Obey amendment on the floor) that the Administration provide estimates of costs formilitary operations and reconstruction for Iraqi and Afghanistan operations, reconstruction, andeconomic support for the period FY2006 to FY2011 unless the President certifies that the estimatescannot be provided because of national security.

Theconference also provides up to $500 million in funds to \"train and equip\" only the Iraqi Army andthe Afghan National Army, with a 15-day advance notification, a modification of the House versionthat could be used for any Iraqi or Afghan military or security forces. (36)", "Funding for Embassy Operations and Darfur, Sudan. Like the House and Senate appropriation bills, the conference bill also provides $70 million fordisaster assistance and $25 million for refugee assistance for Darfur, Sudan, to be transferred to theState Department, and like the Senate bill, $665 million for embassy operations and $20 million forconstruction.

For funding in regular accounts,Congress generally requires that DOD follow standard reprogramming practices under which DODmust receive prior approval for transfers above specified thresholds.", "Based on precedents since 1990, and going from least restrictive to most restrictive, Congress could apply the following options to the FY2005 $25 billion budget amendment for Iraq that iscurrently under consideration.", "Option 1: Provide Extensive Flexibility as After 9/11. This option parallels the provisions governing the initial $20 billion providedin the Emergency Terrorism Response Supplemental passed on September 18, 2001, in theimmediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks ( P.L. 107-38 ). That measure required only that thePresident consult with the chairmen and ranking minority members of the appropriations committeesbefore transferring funds, that $10 billion of the amount could not be transferred until 15 days afternotifying the appropriations committees, and that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)report on funding allocations quarterly to the appropriations committees.", "Option 2: Split Funding Between a Transfer Account and RegularAppropriations with Brief Notification Period. This approach was followed, withsome variations, in the FY2003 Iraq Emergency Supplemental ( P.L. 108-11 ), and in the mainappropriation of supplemental funding for the first Gulf War ( P.L. 102-28 ). Both measures providedfunding in regular appropriations accounts for those expenses that could be predicted, but providedrelatively large amounts ($10.0 billion to $11.0 billion in the FY2003 supplemental and $8 billionin the FY1991 Desert Storm supplemental) in a flexible transfer account for less predictableexpenses. Both also required 5- or 7-day advance notification to the congressional defensecommittees for transfers from the flexible account and quarterly after-the-fact reporting to the fourdefense committees.", "Option 3: Put Most Funds in Regular Accounts with Longer Notification and More Extensive Reporting. This approach parallels some featuresof the Persian Gulf Conflict Supplemental Authorization and Personnel Benefits Act of FY1991( P.L. 102-25 ) and the FY2004 Emergency Supplemental ( P.L. 108-106 ). The FY2004 supplementalprovided just $2 billion of the $65 billion for the Defense Department in a flexible transfer accountwith the remainder in regular appropriations accounts. Both measures on the first Persian Gulf warrequired extensive reports on strategy, force levels, time lines, and monthly reporting on transfersand allied contributions. Recent supplementals have required quarterly reporting to the fourcongressional defense committees.", "Option 4: Provide All Funds in Regular Accounts with SomeFlexibility, Longer Notification, and Require Planning Assumptions. Congresscould provide additional general transfer authority and could create special higher reprogrammingthresholds that would allow DOD to make changes to funding after enactment more easily. Fundingcategories could reflect current reporting on the costs of Iraq, Afghanistan and enhanced security fordefense installations (Operation Noble Eagle).

(92) As in the previoussupplemental, DOD was required to provide five-day advance notification oftransfers from the IFF.", "Within the IFF, Congress set statutory ceilings and floors on various types of expenses, (e.g. fuel and classified programs). (93) Once the amounts governed by theceilings were taken into account, the Secretary of Defense had flexibility to transfera total of between $10 billion and $11 billion to respond to the uncertainty of majorcombat operations. (94) The FY2005 BudgetAmendment requests a larger amount offlexible funds for DOD.", "Reporting Requirements. As in previous supplementals, DOD was required to report transfers of funds quarterly. The appropriators also stated that they expected DOD to be able to produce \"better,more refined projections of expected costs,\" later in the year and to provide thecommittees with a \"comprehensive financial analysis and update for FY2003,\"including both actual and projected obligations for both peacetime and war-relatedspending. (95) Although these reportingrequirements were more extensive than in theprevious two supplementals, the reports were not required to include planningassumptions or cost drivers as Congress required in monthly reports after the firstGulf War. ", "In addition, the appropriators added several new restrictions to ensure that funds in the supplemental were not used to fund programs previously denied by Congressor for items that would not be available within four years. (96) In report language, theappropriators required advance approval of funding for any investment items thatwould be fielded more than 18 months from enactment. (97)", "FY2003 Regular Budget Requests $10 Billion for Contingencies. Earlier in 2002, in its regular FY2003 budget, DODrequested discretion to transfer $20.1 billion from the Defense Emergency ResponseFund either for force protection, communication, or other projects, including up to$10 billion to be \"used to fund continued operations for the war on terrorism.\" (98) Congress initially refused to provide the $10 billion for unspecified war costs.", "The Administration later provided an allocation of the $10.0 billion by appropriations title (for example, \"Military Personnel\" for all services). Although theArmed Services committees authorized the funds, Congress initially refused toappropriate funds. Later in the year in response to DOD concerns that there could bea shortfall of funding for Afghanistan and intelligence activities, Congress includedthese funds in the FY2003 Consolidated enacted on February 20, 2003, ( P.L. 108-7 )but provided the funds in regular appropriation accounts. (99)", "FY2004 Emergency Supplemental Limits Amount of Flexible Funding. Reversing course in the FY2004 EmergencySupplemental, DOD requested all but $2.0 billion of the $65.6 billion for DOD inregular appropriation accounts to fund ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistanand enhanced security. The only exception was $2.0 billion requested in the IraqFreedom Fund to cover the cost of foreign forces or to pay for U.S. troops if foreignforces did not become available. Congress accepted this rationale ( P.L. 108-337 ). ", "Submitted in September 2003, the FY2004 Emergency Supplemental was intended to \"sustain the level of support necessary to continue our operations in Iraqand Afghanistan ... \"and \"other areas around the world,\" and to pay for a forcestructure that was expected to decline from five to two-plus active U.S. Armydivisions in Iraq. (100) DOD's reduced requestfor flexible funds was predicated on thegreater predictability of costs after the end of the war.", "With the recent upsurge in violence, and the decision to keep an additional 20,000 troops in Iraq for the indefinite future, the Army has expressed concern thatit will not have sufficient funds to last the year. Others observers, including DODofficials, believe that funds can be transferred from other activities where expenseshave been lower than anticipated. Although the Army's costs are likely to be higherthan anticipated, their needs may be able to be accommodated by transferring fundsfrom other services and other areas within the Army. Rather than relying on aflexible account, DOD may be able to use the additional transfer authority that it wasprovided in the FY2004 Emergency Supplemental. (101) Expanding general transferauthority, but requiring that reprogramming practices are followed, may be analternative approach to giving DOD flexibility while maintaining traditionaloversight mechanisms.", "As in the previous two supplementals, DOD was required to provide five-day advance notification of transfers from the IFF (or the DERF in FY2002), and toreport quarterly to the congressional defense committees on all transfers. In addition,the FY2004 supplemental also formally closed the Defense Emergency ResponseFund.
