This action includes the EU27 countries and the UK (EU28), as U.S. exports to the UK remain subject to the additional tariffs. The value of U.S. agricultural exports to the EU28 targeted by these additional tariffs is estimated to have been approximately $1.2 billion in 2018, or nearly 9% of total U.S. agricultural exports to the EU28 (excluding nonagricultural products) ( Table 2 ).

This action, authorized by WTO dispute settlement procedures, followed a USTR investigation initiated in April 2019 under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The USTR determined that the EU had denied U.S. rights under WTO agreements. Specifically, USTR concluded that the EU and certain member states (including the UK) had not complied with a WTO Dispute Settlement Body ruling recommending the withdrawal of WTO-inconsistent EU subsidies to Airbus for the manufacture of large civil aircraft.", "The list of products subject to additional tariffs stemming from the Airbus subsidy dispute targets mainly the EU member states responsible for the illegal subsidies.

Among regulatory issues, key U.S. objectives include harmonizing regulatory processes and standards to facilitate trade, including SPS standards, and establishing specific commitments for trade in products developed through agricultural biotechnologies. The U.S. objectives also include addressing GIs by protecting generic terms for common use. U.S. agricultural interests generally support including agriculture in a U.S.-EU trade agreement. The stated overarching goal for the U.S. side is addressing the U.S. trade deficit in agricultural products with the European Union.", "Early on, the EU indicated that it was planning for a more limited negotiation that does not include agricultural products and policies. The EU negotiating mandate, dated April 2019, states that a key EU goal is \"a trade agreement limited to the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods only, excluding agricultural products.\" Several Members of Congress opposed the EU's decision to exclude agricultural policies in its negotiating mandate. A letter to USTR from a bipartisan group of 114 House members states that \"an agreement with the EU that does not address trade in agriculture would be, in our eyes, unacceptable.\" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley reiterated, \"Bipartisan members of the Senate and House \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 have voiced their objections to a deal without agriculture, making it unlikely that such a deal would pass Congress.\" ", "Then, in January 2020, public statements by U.S. and EU officials signaled the possibility that the U.S.-EU trade talks might include negotiation on SPS and regulatory barriers to agricultural trade. It is not clear, however, that both sides agree on which specific types of non-tariff trade barriers might actually be part of the U.S.-EU trade talks. As reported in the press, statements by some USDA officials have suggested that selected SPS barriers as well as GIs would need to be addressed by the trade talks. Meanwhile, other press reports indicate that some EU officials have downplayed the extent that certain non-tariff barriers\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as biotechnology product permits, approval of certain pathogen rinses for poultry, regulations on pesticides, or food standards\u00e2\u0080\u0094would be part of the talks; instead, regulatory barriers might be lowered for certain \"non-controversial\" foods. The United States continues to push for additional concessions from the EU. More formal discussions are expected in the spring of 2020\u00e2\u0080\u0094in an effort to ease trade tensions regarding the imposition of retaliatory tariffs.", "The EU has taken certain measures to avoid escalating agricultural trade tensions with the United States. For example, it has expanded the U.S.-specific quota for EU imports of hormone-free beef, increased imports of U.S. soybeans as a source of biofuels, approved a number of long-pending genetically engineered products for food and feed uses, and proposed to lift a ban on certain pest-resistant American grapes in EU wine production, and other trade-related measures.", "In a separate but indirectly related action, in August 2019, USTR asked the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) to conduct an investigation examining SPS barriers related to pesticide maximum residue levels (MRLs) across all U.S. markets, including Europe.", "Previously, during T-TIP negotiations, both market access and non-tariff barriers were part of the U.S. negotiating objectives. At that time, non-tariff barriers to agricultural trade\u00e2\u0080\u0094including SPS and TBT measures, and GIs\u00e2\u0080\u0094were among the agricultural issues actively debated. In addition, regulatory coherence and cooperation was part of USTR's stated objectives. Some of the same issues that proved to be challenging during the T-TIP talks may continue to challenge negotiators. Various studies at the time reported that removing tariff and non-tariff barriers in U.S.-EU trade would result in economic benefits to the U.S. and EU agricultural sectors. Another study by the European Parliament acknowledged that gains from tariff cuts would be limited unless regulatory and administrative barriers were also addressed.

However, these issues remain important for U.S. agricultural exporters. This is especially true regarding the EU's use of restrictive tariff rate quotas (TRQs) on certain agricultural products. TRQs allow imports of fixed quantities of a product at a lower tariff. Once the quota is filled, a higher tariff is applied on additional imports. The EU allocates TRQs to importers using licenses issued by the member states' national authorities. Only companies established in the EU may apply for import licenses. For exports under a U.S.-specific TRQ, a certificate of origin must be supplied. The EU applies TRQs on many types of beef and poultry products, sheep and goat meat, dairy products, cereals, rice, sugar, and fruit and vegetables. Some products are heavily protected by both TRQs and non-tariff SPS measures. ", "Import tariffs for agricultural products into Europe tends to be relatively high compared to tariffs for similar products into the United Sates. The WTO reports that the simple average most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff applied to agricultural products entering the United States is about 5%, compared to an average tariff of about 13% for products entering the EU. Including all products imported under an applied tariff or a TRQ, USDA reports that the calculated average rate across all U.S. agricultural imports is roughly 12%, well below the EU's average of 30%. By commodity group, EU tariffs average more than 40% for imported meat products, grains, and grain products and average at or above 20% for most fruit and vegetable products. For some products, EU tariffs are even greater, averaging more than 80% for imported dairy products, more that 50% for sugar cane and sweeteners, and nearly 350% for sugar beets. The EU has concluded preferential trade agreements with more than 35 non-EU countries and continues to negotiate agreements with several others. This preferential access provides U.S. export competitors an advantage over U.S. agricultural exporters, particularly in countries where the United States does not have a preferential agreement in place.", "Previously, during the T-TIP negotiations, Senate leadership sent a letter to USTR reiterating that a final agreement would need to include \"a strong framework for agriculture,\" including \"tariff elimination on all products\u00e2\u0080\u0094including beef, pork, poultry, rice, and fruits and vegetables\" and that \"liberalization in all sectors of agriculture\" was a priority, if the agreement were to obtain the support of Congress.

Previous negotiations were complicated by longstanding trade disputes between the United States and EU involving food safety and product standards that are often embodied in laws and regulations in the United States and EU, as well as separate requirements that may be in force within individual EU member states. For example, the EU restricts some types of genetically engineered (GE) seed varieties and also prohibits the use of hormones in meat production and certain pathogen reduction treatments in poultry production. As these types of practices are commonplace in the United States, this tends to restrict U.S. agricultural exports to the EU. Other EU regulations and standards involve pesticide residues on foods, drug residues in animal production, and certain animal welfare requirements that may vary from those in the United States. The United States has also opposed the EU's GI protections that govern product labeling on products within the EU and within some countries that have a formal trade agreement with the EU. Such GI protections also tend to restrict U.S. agricultural exports to the EU and to some other countries where such protections have been put in place. ", "As part of a trade negotiation, non-tariff barriers tend to be broadly grouped along with other issues related to regulatory coherence. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce defines regulatory coherence as \"good regulatory practices, transparency, and stakeholder engagement in a domestic regulatory process\" and regulatory cooperation as \"the process of interaction between U.S. and EU regulators, founded on the benefits regulators can achieve through closer partnership and greater regulatory interoperability.\" Related terminology may refer interchangeably to regulatory convergence, cooperation, and/or harmonization. Trade negotiations involving regulatory and intellectual property rights issues have focused, in part, on the goals of ensuring greater transparency, harmonization, and coherence to improve cooperation and streamline the regulatory approval process among the trading partners.

Examples include product standards, requirements for products to be produced in disease-free areas, quarantine and inspection procedures, sampling and testing requirements, residue limits for pesticides and drugs in foods, and limits on food additives. TBT measures cover both food and non-food traded products. TBTs in agriculture include SPS measures, but also include other types of measures related to health and quality standards, testing, registration, and certification requirements, as well as packaging and labeling regulations.

Improper use of SPS and TBT measures can create substantial barriers to trade when they are disguised protectionist barriers, are not supported by scientific evidence, or are otherwise unwarranted. Bilateral and regional FTAs between the United States and other countries regularly address SPS and TBT matters.

Other EU concerns have involved the use of \"Buy American\" restrictions in the United States governing public procurement. During the T-TIP negotiations, some expressed concern that including \"Buy American\" provisions could affect local food procurement, including restricting bidding contract preferences contained in U.S. and EU farm-to-school programs.", "The EU's application of the so-called precautionary principle remains central to the EU's risk management policy regarding food safety and animal and plant health and is often cited as the rationale behind the EU's more risk-averse approach. The precautionary principle was reportedly referenced as part of the 1992 Treaty on European Union that further integrated the EU, and its use was further outlined in a 2000 communication and then formally established in EU food legislation in 2002 (Regulation EC No 178/2002). The EU's 2000 communication further outlines guidelines for implementation, the basis for invoking the principle, and the general standards of application. Regarding international trade, under EU law, the precautionary principle provides for \"rapid response\" to address \"possible danger to human, animal, or plant health, or to protect the environment\" and can be used to \"stop distribution or order withdrawal from the market of products likely to be hazardous.\" Although the principle may not be used as a pretext for protectionist measures, many countries have challenged some EU actions that invoke the precautionary principle as \"protectionist.\" The EU, however, continues to invoke the precautionary principle to justify its policies regarding various regulatory issues and generally rejects arguments, on the grounds of risk management, that the lack of clear evidence of harm is not evidence of the absence of harm.", "No universally agreed-upon definition of the precautionary principle exists, and many differently worded or conflicting definitions can be found in international law. However, within the context of the WTO and the SPS agreement, the precautionary principle (or precautionary approach) allows a country to set higher standards and methods of inspecting products.

The WTO has generally acknowledged that the need to take precautionary actions in the face of scientific uncertainty has long been widely accepted, particularly in the fields of food safety and plant and animal health protection. Examples might include a sudden outbreak of an animal disease that is suspected of being linked to imports, which may require a country to impose certain trade restrictions while the outbreak is assessed.", "Application of the precautionary principle by some countries remains an ongoing source of contention in international trade, particularly for the United States, and is often cited as a reason why some countries may restrict imports of some food products and processes.

Many U.S. agricultural and food organizations contended that the EU's application of the precautionary principle undermines sound science and innovation and results in \"unjustifiable restrictions\" on U.S. exports, allowing the EU \"to put in place restrictions on products or processes when they believe that scientific evidence on their potential impact on human health or the environment is inconclusive.\" Some asserted that application of the principle results in a bias against new technologies, such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. As a result, these groups said that \"science-based decision making and not the precautionary principle must be the defining principle in setting up mechanisms and systems\" to address SPS concerns. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported a \"science-based approach to risk management, where risk is assessed based on scientifically sound and technically rigorous standards\" and opposed \"the domestic and international adoption of the precautionary principle as a basis for regulatory decision making.\" Many in Congress also called for \"effective rules and enforceable rules to strengthen the role of science\" to resolve international trade differences. ", "More recently, the EU's SPS were among the issues that raised the most concerns during a WTO review of the EU's trade policies. Among the cited concerns were certain SPS measures that were viewed to be not based on science or on international standards, and that were also deemed to not allow for adequate opportunity to take into account for the views of third countries.

For example, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) administers various regulatory and control programs pertaining to animal and plant health and quarantine, humane treatment of animals, and the control and eradication of pests and diseases. APHIS also oversees SPS certification requirements for imported and exported agricultural goods. This work is ongoing. ", "The United States also maintains ongoing interagency processes and mechanisms to identify, review, analyze, and address foreign government standards-related measures that may be barriers to trade. These activities are coordinated through the USTR-led Trade Policy Staff Committee, which is composed of representatives from several federal agencies, including USDA, the Department of Commerce, and the State Department. USTR also chairs an interagency group (i.e., both USDA and non-USDA agencies with SPS and TBT responsibilities) that reviews SPS and TBT measures that are notified to the WTO, as required under the SPS and TBT agreements. These agency officials also work with their international counterparts on concerns involving SPS and TBT measures. USTR tracks issues related to such measures as part of its annual reports.

The term GI is most often applied to wines, spirits, and agricultural products. GIs allow some food producers to differentiate their products in the marketplace. GIs may also be eligible for relief from acts of infringement or unfair competition. While GIs may protect consumers from deceptive or misleading labels, they can also impair trade when names that are considered common or generic in one market are protected in another. Examples of registered or established GIs include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di Parma ham from the Parma region of Italy, Toscano olive oil from the Tuscany region of Italy, Roquefort cheese from France, Champagne from the region of the same name in France, Irish whiskey, Darjeeling tea, Florida oranges, Idaho potatoes, Vidalia onions, Washington State apples, and Napa Valley wines. ", "GIs are an example of IPR, along with patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The use of GIs has become a contentious international trade issue, particularly for U.S. wine, cheese, and sausage makers. In general, some consider GIs to be protected intellectual property, while others consider them to be generic or semi-generic terms. GIs are included among other IPR issues in the current U.S. trade agenda. GIs were an active area of debate during the T-TIP negotiations. Laws and regulations governing GIs differ markedly between the United States and EU, which further complicates this issue. ", "GIs are protected by the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which sets binding minimum standards for intellectual property protection that are enforceable by the WTO's dispute settlement procedure. Under TRIPS, WTO members must recognize and protect GIs as intellectual property. Both the United States and the EU are signatories of TRIPS and therefore subject to its rights and obligations. Accordingly, under TRIPS, the United States and EU have committed to providing a minimum standard of protection for GIs (i.e., protecting GI products to avoid misleading the public and prevent unfair competition) and an \"enhanced level of protection\" to wines and spirits that carry a GI, subject to certain exceptions. TRIPS builds on treaties administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization, a specialized agency in the United Nations with the mission to \"lead the development of a balanced and effective international intellectual property (IP) system.\" It also oversees the \"International Register of Appellations of Origin\" established in the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration. The agreement's multilateral register covers food products and beverages and related products, as well as non-food products. ", "The EU's GI program remains a contentious issue for some U.S. producer groups, particularly among wine, cheese, and sausage makers. Some have long expressed their concerns about EU protections for GIs, which they claim are being misused to create market and trade barriers. Much of this debate involves certain terms used by cheesemakers, such as parmesan, asiago, and feta cheese, which the U.S. cheese sectors consider to be generic terms. For example, feta cheese produced in the United States may not be exported for sale in the EU, since only feta produced in countries or regions currently holding GI registrations may be sold commercially. A 2019 study commissioned by the U.S. dairy industry forecasts declining U.S. cheese exports due to expanding restrictions on parmesan, asiago, and feta cheese. Another study concluded that up to $15 million in cheese trade might need to be relabeled due to the restriction on certain GI terms, while other traded foods, such as oilseeds and vinegars, would experience little impact.

The American Origin Products Association represents certain U.S. potato, maple syrup, ginseng, coffee, and chile pepper producers and certain U.S. winemakers, among other regional producer groups. It seeks to work with federal authorities to create \"a list of qualified U.S. distinctive product names, which correspond to the GI definition.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Differences in U.S. and EU Laws and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Laws and regulations governing GIs differ markedly between the United States and EU. In the United States, GIs generally fall under the common law right of possession or \"first in time, first in right\" as trademarks or collective or certification marks under the purview of the existing trademark regime, administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and protected under the U.S. Trademark Act. Trademarks are distinctive signs that companies use to identify themselves and their products or services to consumers and can take the form of a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements. Trademarks do not refer to generic terms, nor do they refer exclusively to geographical terms. Trademarks may refer to geographical names to indicate the specific qualities of goods either as certification marks or as collective marks. PTO does not have a special database register for GIs in the United States. PTO's trademark register, the U.S. Trademark Electronic Search System, contains GIs registered as trademarks, certification marks, and collective marks. USTR says that EU farm products hold nearly 12,000 trademarks. These register entries are not designated with any special field (such as \"geographical indications\") and cannot be readily compiled into a complete list of registered GIs. In the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) also plays a role overseeing the labeling of wine, malt beverages, beer, and distilled spirits. ", "In the EU, a series of regulations governing GIs was initiated in the early 1990s covering agricultural and food products, wine, and spirits. Legislation adopted in 1992 covering agricultural products (not including wines and spirits) was replaced by changes enacted in 2006 following a WTO panel ruling that found some aspects of the EU's scheme inconsistent with WTO rules. The new rules came into force in January 2013. The EU laws and regulations provide product registration markers for the different quality schemes. The EU regulations establish provisions regarding products from a defined geographical area given linkages between the characteristics of products and their geographical origin. The EU defines a GI as \"a distinctive sign used to identify a product as originating in the territory of a particular country, region or locality where its quality, reputation or other characteristic is linked to its geographical origin.\" ", "EU registered products often fall under GI protections in certain third-country markets, and some EU GIs have been trademarked in some non-EU countries. This has become a concern for U.S. agricultural exporters following a series of trade agreements the EU has concluded with Canada, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, and other countries that in many cases are also trading partners of the United States. For example, Canada has agreed to recognize a list of 143 EU GIs in Canada, and Japan has agreed to recognize more than 200 EU GIs in Japan. These GI protections could limit U.S. sales of certain products to these countries. The EU is in the process of negotiating FTAs with several other U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and the Mercosur states (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). Each of these efforts includes a selected list of GIs that would become protected under an FTA between these countries and the European Union. In December 2019, the EU also entered into an agreement with China regarding GIs that would protect a reported 100 EU GIs in China. As of January 2020, 3,316 product names are registered and protected in the EU for foods, wine, and spirits originating in both EU member states and other countries.

", "Previously, during T-TIP negotiations, U.S. officials indicated that the United States would likely not agree to EU demands to reserve certain food names for EU producers and have expressed concerns about the EU's system of protections for GIs. At the time, U.S. trade policy objectives regarding the EU's GI protections was to ensure that they \"do not undercut U.S. industries' market access\" and to defend the use of certain \"common food names.\" In general, the United States is seeking protection for current U.S. owners of trademarks that overlap with EU-protected GIs, the ability to use U.S. trademarked names in third countries, and the ability to use U.S. trademarked names in the EU.", "In recent developments, according to USITC, USMCA \"increases the transparency of applications, approvals, and cancellations\" regarding GIs and \"provides guidelines for determining whether a term is customary in common use.\" In addition, a side letter between the United States and Mexico commits Mexico to not restrict market access for a list of more than 30 cheeses. USITC says this could \"help prevent future losses of U.S. market access for cheeses with common names\" such as \"blue\" or \"Swiss\" cheese. The final U.S.-China Phase One Trade Agreement also addresses longstanding concerns regarding IPR, including GIs, building on previous commitments regarding IPR and GIs. The agreement is expected to require that China ensure that it will \"not undermine market access for U.S. exports to China of goods\" and will apply relevant factors when providing certain GI protections, as well as provide the United States with \"necessary opportunities to raise disagreement\" regarding GIs. GI provisions in these two recent U.S. FTAs, however, could prove to be incompatible with other EU agreements regarding GIs with these countries. For Mexico and Canada, these include GI protections that are likely to be part of the EU-Mexico Global Agreement, as well as existing GI protections in the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.

Some press reports indicate that certain non-tariff barriers and regulatory cooperation could become part of the new trade talks, while other press reports raise questions about the EU's willingness to address specific types of non-tariff barriers as part of the negotiation. Even if regulatory coherence and cooperation become part of the U.S.-EU trade talks, their resolution in a manner that benefits U.S. agricultural exporters is far from assured.
