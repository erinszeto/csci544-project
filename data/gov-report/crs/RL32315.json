The Energy Policy and Conservation ActAmendments of 2000 (EPCA) mandated a study which was released in January 2003 to assess theoil and gas resource potential underlying restricted federal lands. It concluded that although theamount of land prospected for natural gas that was completely \"off-limits\" for development was35.6%, other restrictions and lease stipulations are in place. The conference report to the EnergyPolicy Act of 2003 ( H.R. 6 ) as well as the scaled-back Senate version of the bill( S. 2095 ) contains provisions that would address restrictions and impediments to oil andgas development on public lands.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is required to process the APD in 30days but delays may occur, extending the average approval time to over 120 days. Some approvalshave taken over three years. A new process to expedite the APDs has been established at the BLMthat includes, among other features, the processing and conducting of environmental analyses onmultiple permit applications with similar characteristics.", "Energy and mineral industry representatives maintain that federal withdrawals and/orrestrictions inhibit mineral exploration and limit the reserve base even when conditions are favorablefor development. They further contend that sufficient environmental standards are in place to protectpublic lands. Critics who oppose opening up more federal lands or the mineral estate under privatelands argue that the general environmental requirements are not adequate and that some forms ofdevelopment threaten water quality and quantity; therefore, certain restrictions and withdrawals areappropriate.", "Concern exists regarding natural gas supply and declining production rates. As a result, thereis increased interest in potential gas supplies in the Rocky Mountain region. Several resourceestimates suggest significant amounts of natural gas on public and private lands in the region, andRocky Mountain natural gas may become much more important to the overall supply picture.", "Elsewhere, the outlook is mixed for increased oil and natural gas production on U.S. publiclands.

For example, the conference report on theomnibus energy bill ( H.R. 6 ) and the Senate substitute, S. 2095 hasprovisions that would examine restrictions and impediments to oil and gas development on publiclands, including an evaluation of the current permitting process. Reportedly, reflecting its EnergyTask Force recommendations, the Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil andgas permitting process on federal lands.", "Oil and gas development practices have generated considerable debate in Congress since theearly years of the industry. Originally, oil and gas resources on public lands could be transferred toprivate ownership (patented) under the Mining Law of 1872 -- essentially, lands containing oil weresold at a fixed price per acre to the first claimant. (1) Conservationists contended that there was widespread abuse of theMining Law that led to wasteful use of public lands. In 1909 President Taft withdrew 3 million acresof lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California from availability under the Mining Law of1872. Taft requested congressional approval for his action, leading to the Pickett Act of 1910 (43U.S.C. 141-143), which explicitly recognized executive branch authority to make such public landswithdrawals. (2) ", "Congress eventually decided that defense-related minerals -- including oil and gas -- shouldremain under federal ownership. As a result, the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 181,et. seq.) removed oil and gas from the patenting process and placed it under a leasing system. Underthe leasing system, the federal government has raised billions of dollars in revenues from royalties,rents and bonus bids. (3) ", "Minerals owned by the federal government under lands held privately (patented) creates a\"split-estate.\" There are other split-estate situations as well: surface and mineral rights held bydifferent private interests, or state owned mineral rights and privately held surface rights. Threemajor federal statutes (4) allowed the federal government to issue patents to land but reserve the right to the minerals. Underthese statutes the mineral estate became the dominant estate and the surface use servient. There arespecific policies and procedures that must be followed by the mineral estate holder in order todevelop minerals. Generally, for oil and gas, a federal lessee must meet one of the followingconditions: a surface agreement; written consent or a waiver from the private surface owner foraccess to the leased lands; payment for loss or damages; or the execution of a bond not less than$1,000. (5) About 11% ofthe public lands are under the split-estate category. However, in Wyoming 50% of the lands aresplit-estate and in Montana about 57%. (6) ", "Environmentalists have supported public land withdrawals and other restrictions because ofconcern that the Mining Law of 1872 and then the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 provided inadequateenvironmental protection. Recently, ranchers and other groups have expressed similar concernsspecifically about the impact of development on water and land. Conversely, development supporterscontend that numerous environmental laws are now in place to regulate oil and gas development onpublic lands. They note that the federal government must comply with the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) in leasing oil and gas and that the oil and gas industry must comply withapplicable requirements of the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, theResource Conservation and Recovery Act, and state and federal reclamation standards, among otherlaws. The industry complains that environmental and other reviews often create long delays indrilling exploratory and production wells on leased lands.", "The proposed conference report on a comprehensive energy bill ( H.R. 6 ) and S. 2095 addresses some of the industry and Bush Administration concerns overincreasing domestic oil and natural gas supplies. Title III of H.R. 6 and S. 2095 , if enacted, would establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to helpexpedite permitting on public lands and identify restrictions and impediments to resourcedevelopment on public lands.

The need for a revised/amended RMP would necessarily delay anysite-specific analysis conducted in the drilling permit process by the BLM and the surface managingagency.

The USGS reports that the water pumped out of coal beds can vary inquality. Some water can be discharged near the surface for reuse if \"sufficiently fresh,\" or if the waterdoes not meet reuse standards, it can be disposed of by subsurface injection or surface discharge intowetlands, streams, or impoundments. (44) Water quality and water disposal have become central concernsin the production of CBM.", "A 1980 tax credit (section 29) for unconventional fuel production provided a major incentivefor CBM development. Significant production of CBM began in 1987. Production has increasedfour-fold since 1991, and coalbed gas accounted for about 8% (1.6 tcf) of the 18.8 tcf of natural gasproduced in 2002 in the United States. (45) In 2002 there were 10,000 CBM wells also producing 1.65million barrels of water (46) per day. The leading producers are in New Mexico, Colorado,and Wyoming. Production rates vary widely because of the heterogenous geology of coalbeds. DOEestimates that out of the 39,000 new wells anticipated by 2010, 23,900 will be on federal lands. (47) ", "CBM reserves are still largely undeveloped. Of the estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane inthe United States, only about 100 tcf are classified as economically recoverable. The previouslydiscussed EIA study of U.S. oil and gas resources found that of the 293 tcf of unproved technicallyrecoverable unconventional fuels in the Rocky Mountain region, about 46 tcf are coalbed methane,of which about 20% would fall under the \"no access\" category. Coalbed methane proved reserveswere 18.5 tcf in 2001, which was 10% of U.S. dry gas reserves. CBM reserves have more thandoubled since 1991. Two states, Colorado and New Mexico, account for more than half of U.S.CBM reserves. Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant reserves. The San JuanBasin (48) is the mostproductive. It contains 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. The Warrior Basin inAlabama is the second most productive, claiming 9% of U.S. production and 8% of reserves. (49) USGS estimates CBMresources in the Powder River Basin (PRB) at 39 tcf. (50) ", "The federal government owns over half the mineral rights in the PRB, while the majority ofthe surface rights are held privately, resulting in spilt-estates. However, most of the currentproduction of CBM is taking place on private lands. Over 80% of the land overlying of CBM wellsis privately or state held in Wyoming, and some surface owners oppose development and otherscontend they are not compensated fairly for surface use. (51) A number of concerns has come up regarding surface useagreements between the surface owner and the mineral lessee or mineral owner. The central concernfor the surface owner is receiving adequate compensation for damages from CBM or productionfrom other extractive industries. In Wyoming, stakeholders such as the Petroleum Association,ranchers and the Farm Bureau Federation established the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative in 2002.They have created a new framework to help resolve conflicts between surface owners and mineralowners or lessees.

A draft EPA report (54) concluded that there is no evidence of contamination of drinkingwater wells from CBM hydraulic fracturing. However, the EPA did express concern over the use ofdiesel fuel as an injection fluid because it contains many of the EPA's \"constituents of concern\",(chemicals). Thus, the EPA and the major companies using diesel fuel entered into anMemorandum of Agreement (MOA) in December 2003, to end the use of diesel fuel as an injectingfluid. Proposed energy legislation ( H.R. 6 and S. 2095 ) include provisionsthat would prohibit EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturingpurposes under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

", "CBM production resulted in water discharges of 602 million barrels annually or 1.65 millionbarrels per day in 2002, typically into surface waters or holding ponds. Water is also reinjectedunderground. Environmentalists contend that holding ponds are like wastewater treatment pondsthat are unlined and leak into groundwater. There is concern about the lowering of the water tableand the effects on wells and water sources used by wildlife. The Wildlife Management Institute ofWashington D.C. argues that CBM production and the disposal of high volumes of water may leadto, among others things, the depletion of underground aquifers, the loss of natural vegetation, andaquatic life within waterways that receive CBM water. Further, the infrastructure required by CBMproduction may threaten wildlife habitats. (56) ", "In response to concerns over the impact of CBM on groundwater quality and quantity, BLMhas required CBM producers to drill two monitoring wells per township with CBM leases since1992. The cost of drilling each well is about $50,000, plus an additional $5,000 for monitoringequipment. After BLM review, it was established that one set of wells (one shallow and one deep)is required per four townships with CBM leases. The wells monitor both the water quality and waterlevels from CBM production. On private lands, monitoring wells are not required (57) .", "The Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) invalidated three leases in April 2002 becauseenvironmental issues related to CBM production, as discussed above, were not evaluatedsufficiently. Supplemental environmental assessments (EA) were prepared for the Powder RiverBasin to help determine where to develop CBM in areas already approved for leasing. (58) Generally, the results haveallowed more CBM drilling to occur; however, there have been new conditions imposed upon someproducers.

After the suit,BLM did not proceed with any lease sales on public lands with high CBM content, including the fourparcels that prompted the suit, while the IBLA ruling was being interpreted by Bureau attorneys.

The President acted as chief custodian of the public lands and with tacitapproval of Congress withdrew public land from entry or location by the private sector. TheConstitution vests authority over public lands in Congress rather than with the Executive, butPresidents have repeatedly exercised \"an inherent power to withdraw\" or reserve some lands.
