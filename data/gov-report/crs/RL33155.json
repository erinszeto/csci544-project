As enacted, the Deficit Reduction Act includes two child welfare provisions intended to reduce federal foster care spending under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Those provisions, sometimes called the Rosales provision and candidates provision, respectively, would 1) clarify individual eligibility for federal foster care and adoption assistance programs (Title IV-E of the Social Security Act); and 2) limit certain kinds of state claims for federal reimbursement of administrative costs under the federal foster care program. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that together, these changes will reduce federal spending under the foster care program by $554 million over five years, and by almost $1.3 billion over 10 years.", "As enacted, the Deficit Reduction Act also includes several child welfare provisions that will increase federal child welfare spending and make other limited changes to federal child welfare policy. These provisions were added during conference negotiations and were not included in either of the earlier Senate or House versions of the budget reconciliation bill ( S. 1932 ) that passed in November 2005. Those provisions 1) increase the FY2006 mandatory funding authorization under the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program (Title IV-B, Subpart 2 of the Social Security Act) to $345 million (from current $305 million); 2) appropriate $100 million in mandatory funds over five years (FY2006-FY2010) to improve state courts' handling of child welfare proceedings; 3) require court and child welfare agency collaboration; and 4) clarify confidentiality rules with regard to open child welfare court proceedings. CBO estimated that the first two of these provisions will increase federal budget authority for child welfare purposes by $300 million over five years.", "As enacted, the Deficit Reduction Act also includes provisions related to federal reimbursement of costs for \"targeted case management\" (TCM) under the Medicaid program (Title XIX of the Social Security Act). These provisions were included in both the House and Senate reconciliation bills (as they were passed in November 2005), and may limit the ability of state child welfare agencies to use Medicaid TCM for children in foster care. CBO estimated the net federal savings for this change, all of which would be to Medicaid (and not all of which would affect financing of services for children in foster care), at $760 million over five years and $2.1 billion over 10 years.", "Finally, as enacted, the Deficit Reduction Act does not include House and Senate proposals that would have 1) extended the authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to grant child welfare waivers; 2) amended the Higher Education Act to improve higher education access for youth leaving foster care; and 3) authorized a discretionary student loan forgiveness program available to child welfare workers.

The largest child welfare programs receive mandatory federal funding, and certain changes to these programs would be made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Some of these were initially provided for only in the House version of the reconciliation bill, and some were in neither the initial Senate nor House version of the reconciliation legislation ( S. 1932 ) as it was passed in November 2005. These were added during the December 2005 conference agreement negotiations.", "The federal foster care and adoption assistance programs are open-ended entitlement programs. This means that the statutory language (contained in Title IV-E of the Social Security Act) commits the federal government to reimbursing states for every eligible claim submitted on behalf of an eligible child receiving foster care maintenance payments or an adoption assistance subsidy. Because of the open-ended nature of this mandatory spending, any statutory changes that redefine who is eligible to receive foster care or adoption assistance\u00e2\u0080\u0094or what kind of costs a state may submit as eligible for reimbursement\u00e2\u0080\u0094should have a direct effect on the level of federal spending in the program.

A set-aside from the program's funding is used for grants intended to help state courts assess and improve their handling of child welfare proceedings.

This change is sometimes called the Rosales provision because, as intended, it makes moot a 9 th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision, Rosales v. Thompson (321 F. 3d. 835). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that this provision will reduce federal outlays to the foster care program by $380 million over five years (FY2006-FY2010) and $863 million over 10 years (FY2006-FY2015).", "The Senate did not include the Rosales provision in the reconciliation legislation it approved in early November.

Changes to the adoption assistance eligibility criteria were made to conform with those foster care changes and to somewhat simplify the eligibility test. As included in the enacted legislation, the change does not prohibit payment of foster care maintenance payments to foster children living with grandparents. However, it may make it less likely that children who lived with a non-parent relative before they were formally brought into foster care (and who are in one of the 9 th Circuit states), will be eligible for federal foster care assistance.", "Eligibility for Title IV-E foster care and adoption assistance is multifaceted but, with limited exceptions for adoption assistance, includes a link to the income, deprivation, and resources tests as they were included in a state's Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, as that program existed on July 16, 1996. (Congress repealed the AFDC program as part of the 1996 welfare reform legislation that became P.L. 104-193 .) HHS has historically maintained that the AFDC income, deprivation, and resource tests must determine whether or not a foster child was or would have been considered needy if that child had still been living in the home from which he or she was removed for safety reasons (generally the home of the biological parent(s)). However, this HHS interpretation of how to apply the AFDC eligibility tests was challenged in California, and in March 2003, the 9 th Circuit Court of Appeals ( Rosales v. Thompson, 321 F. 3d. 835) ruled against HHS. The 9 th Circuit court interpreted the law to permit, in some instances, a state to determine whether a foster child would have met the AFDC tests while living in the home of a relative instead of in the home of the parent (e.g., a grandmother or aunt who informally cared for the child because the parents were unfit or unwilling).", "Under AFDC program rules, a child living with a non-parent relative is virtually always considered needy because the AFDC income, resource and other tests are applied only to the child. This means that whether the non-parent relative is very wealthy or very poor is not a consideration in determining a child's eligibility for federal foster care assistance; only the child's personal income is considered. Therefore, this reading of the law permits expanded eligibility for federal (Title IV-E) foster care assistance if a child lived with a non-parent relative before being formally placed in foster care (provided the child lives in a 9 th Circuit state).", "HHS chose not to appeal the decision of the 9 th Circuit. Instead, it notified the nine states in the 9 th Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) that they should amend their Title IV-E state plans to follow the eligibility logic of the Rosales decision. At the same time, HHS notified all other states that they must continue to determine Title IV-E foster care eligibility based on the traditional HHS reading of the law. Finally, the Department sought a statutory change to bolster its longstanding interpretation of Title IV-E (foster care and adoption assistance) eligibility rules, and to restore their uniform application in all states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of Provision", "paragraphs": ["All states in the 9 th Circuit have amended their state Title IV-E plans to provide for expanded Title IV-E foster care eligibility (as permitted by the Rosales decision). Enactment of the statutory eligibility clarifications in the Deficit Reduction Act, however, means that states will have to redo those plans again, because children entering foster care in the 9 th Circuit states are again required to meet the eligibility criteria currently used in all states outside the 9 th Circuit. In June 2006, HHS issued an Information Memorandum that permits 9 th Circuit states to continue to make Title IV-E foster claims for children who were federally eligible solely because of the Rosales definition of eligibility only until the annual re-determination of that child ' s Title IV-E foster care eligibility . In addition, those states may no longer apply the Rosales eligibility criteria for children entering foster care. Instead, all children must now qualify under the more narrow eligibility criteria. Accordingly, states in the 9 th Circuit may see a decline in the share of children in their caseloads for whom they may receive federal reimbursement for foster care costs. These states would then need to support a larger share of foster care children using state dollars only (or possibly some other capped source of federal funding such as the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families\u00e2\u0080\u0094or TANF\u00e2\u0080\u0094block grant).

Prior policy provided that, in cases where adoption assistance eligibility rests in some part on AFDC eligibility, the AFDC eligibility criteria must have been met at two points: 1) when the child was removed from his or her home and placed in foster care, and 2) when adoption proceedings were initiated. P.L. 109-71 , as had previously been passed by the House ( H.R. 4241 ), would eliminate the second AFDC test.

In January 2005, the Administration published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed regulations similar to the statutory changes included in P.L. 109-171 . Those statutory changes were included in the House budget reconciliation bill ( H.R. 4241 ), but were not a part of the reconciliation bill that passed the Senate in November.", "In sum, this provision puts in statute a definition of \"candidate for foster care\" that is more narrow than previous HHS policy, and which consequently limits the ability of states to receive federal reimbursement for foster care administrative costs made on behalf of certain children. CBO estimated that these provisions will reduce federal outlays for the Title IV-E foster care program by $174 million over five years (FY2006-FY2010) and $405 million over 10 years (FY2006-FY2015)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Explanation of the Change", "paragraphs": ["Under current law, states are permitted to seek federal reimbursement (a 50% match) for any eligible administrative costs necessary for the \"proper and efficient\" operation of their foster care programs. Among other things, Title IV-E administrative costs are defined to include payment for time spent by a social worker finding and making a foster care placement, as well as ensuring that the child's placement setting and permanency goal (e.g., reuniting with family or adoption) are reviewed at federally specified intervals, and that other federal case review protections are afforded each child in foster care.", "In general, these administrative costs may only be reimbursed if the child on whose behalf the costs are incurred meets the federal Title IV-E eligibility requirements for foster care maintenance payments. Those eligibility requirements include a stipulation that the foster child must be living in a family home or other eligible child care institution that is licensed by the state to provide foster care. However, some states previously made Title IV-E administrative claims (only) for costs incurred on behalf of children who meet all of the Title IV-E foster care eligibility requirements except that they are placed in an unlicensed setting. This kind of administrative claim was specifically permitted by a 1993 memorandum from HHS, which suggests that these children could be considered \"candidates\" for Title IV-E foster care because the possibility existed that they might be moved to an eligible setting. More recently, however, HHS argued that the 1993 memorandum was too broadly interpreted and that parts of it are inconsistent with the statute. Specifically, HHS asserted that a child already placed in foster care may never be considered a candidate for foster care.", "In the January 2005 NPRM, however, the Administration conceded that a complete prohibition on Title IV-E administrative claims for placement of otherwise eligible foster children in homes of unlicensed relatives might be contrary to the federal law/policy that encourages states to place a foster child with relatives. Further, in recognition of the fact that states cannot be expected to have a ready pool of relatives licensed to provide foster care, HHS proposed to allow continued Title IV-E administrative claims for otherwise eligible children placed in unlicensed relatives ' homes but only for the length of time it normally takes the state to license a foster family home . As enacted, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 adopts this language (except that it provides that states may make such claims only for as long as the length of time it normally takes a state to license a home, or up to 12 months\u00e2\u0080\u0094whichever is shorter). Like the NPRM, the statutory language included in P.L. 109-171 also stipulates one additional instance in which a state may continue to make Title IV-E administrative claims (but not Title IV-E maintenance payments) on behalf of an otherwise eligible foster care child placed in an ineligible setting. These administrative claims may be made on behalf of a child placed temporarily in a setting such as a juvenile detention home or certain psychiatric hospitals (ineligible settings under Title IV-E)\u00e2\u0080\u0094but only for one calendar month and only if the child is subsequently moved back to an eligible setting.", "Finally, the changes included in P.L. 109-171 restate current Title IV-E administrative claims policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094which permits states to make claims on behalf of children who are not yet in foster care but who are considered at imminent risk of removal from their homes. Such children are now considered by HHS as \"true\" candidates for foster care, and in need of pre-placement services (required under Title IV-E) to prevent their removal from their homes. However, the new law (as proposed in H.R. 4241 and the NPRM) newly provides that in order to make these Title IV-E administrative claims, the state must redetermine, no less often than every six months, a child's status as a candidate for foster care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of the Provision", "paragraphs": ["The primary federal savings from this change are expected to come from a state's reduced ability to make administrative claims for children placed in unlicensed relatives' homes.

All foster family home licensing requirements are established and maintained by state authorities, and typically include requirements related to the physical and family environment of a home, as well as training requirements. Under current federal child welfare policy, states are required to apply the same licensing standards to both relative and non-relative foster homes.

In his brief statement regarding a proposed (but failed) amendment to strike the TCM provisions from the budget reconciliation bill that passed the Senate in November 2005, Senator Reed expressed the concern that the language would \"force\" payment for TCM services by \"third parties, States or others,\" resulting in reduced services and increased costs to states. In response, Senator Grassley said that the legislative proposal simply sought to codify a policy originally proposed by the Clinton Administration. The final bill did not significantly alter the third party liability language included in the earlier House or Senate bills.", "The CBO estimate of savings for this provision is based on the assumption that states\u00e2\u0080\u0094with regard to foster care and other programs (e.g., juvenile justice)\u00e2\u0080\u0094have too broadly billed the provision of TCM services to Medicaid. This is in keeping with the Administration's assertion that states have been shifting costs from foster care, and certain criminal justice and education programs to Medicaid. In particular, CBO believes that some states will move some of the claims they previously or currently bill as Medicaid TCM to foster care administrative claims under Title IV-E. However, as CBO also estimates net savings to the federal treasury ($760 million over five years ; $1.3 billion over 10 years), it apparently does not believe that all of these claims may be made under Title IV-E. In sum, the effect of this new provision is uncertain, but is believed\u00e2\u0080\u0094as is suggested by net CBO savings\u00e2\u0080\u0094to reduce access to Medicaid TCM claims for a range of populations, including particularly Medicaid-eligible foster care children."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Proposals Not Included in the Final Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Reconciliation legislation, passed initially in the Senate ( S. 1932 ) and the House ( H.R. 4241 ) also included several other provisions relevant to child welfare, and for which no significant budget effect (savings or cost) was estimated or expected.
