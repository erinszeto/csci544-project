As aresult, Foreign Operations spending measures developed by the appropriationscommittees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues andplayed a major role in shaping, authorizing, and guiding both executive andcongressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives. It has been largelythrough Foreign Operations appropriations that the United States has modified aidpolicy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the Cold War.

Forexample, the large increase in FY1981 did not represent higher funding levels, butrather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriationsrather than as \"off-budget\" items. Part of the substantial rise in spending in FY1985came as a result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aidloans rather than only a partial appropriation required in the past. Beginning inFY1992, Congress changed how all Federal credit programs are \"scored\" inappropriation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded inForeign Operations.", "All of these factors make it very difficult to present a precise and consistent data trend line in Foreign Operations funding levels.

Since FY1984, the State Department has maintained the ATA program designed tomaximize international cooperation in the battle against global terrorism.

Between1984 and 1999 (the most recent year for which ATA data are available), over 23,000officials from 112 countries participated in ATA programs. Two years ago, ATAconducted training programs in 32 countries, with the largest number of studentscoming from 11 Middle East nations. The proposed FY2002 program wouldcontinue its Middle East focus, but augment training in Colombia and Ecuador, andseveral former Soviet states where emphasis would be placed on terrorist threats togas pipelines and other energy sector targets. In FY1999, the ATA program addeda new element specifically aimed at countering the use of weapons of massdestruction (WMD) - chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear - by terrorists. Following the 1998 terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,ATA funding more than doubled - to $41 million. Congress appropriated $38million for FY2001 and the State Department requested the same amount forFY2002. About $1 million would support WMD activities.

As one response to the 1998 bombings of American embassies in East Africa, theState Department launched the Terrorist Interdiction Program, an activity intendedto restrict the ability of terrorists to cross international borders, launch attacks, andescape. TIP strengthens border security systems in particularly vulnerable countriesby installing border monitoring technology and training border security andimmigration officials in its use, and by expanding access of international criminalinformation to participating nations. While the State Department has identified 34countries as possible TIP recipients, programs in only five countries had beenplanned for each of FY2001 and FY2002.

Pakistan owes theUnited States roughly $3 billion and was scheduled to receive economic aid totaling$7 million in FY2002 to support democracy promotion and basic educationprograms. Pakistan, however, was barred from receiving non-humanitarian bilateralforeign aid due to two Foreign Operations restrictions of assisting countries that haveundergone a military coup and which are more than a year in arrears on debtpayments to the United States.

(6) TheExport-Import Bank is the chief U.S. government agency that helps finance Americanexports. With a budget of nearly $1 billion, the Bank finances around 2% of U.S.exports a year. Eximbank provides guarantees and insurance to commercial banks tomake trade credits available to U.S. exporters. The Bank also offers direct financingto U.S. exporters on a limited basis, primarily to counter subsidized trade creditsoffered to foreign exporters by their governments. ", "Such government-sponsored trade financing, however, has long been controversial. One rationale for the Export-Import Bank is the acknowledgedcompetition among nations' official export financing agencies. Most economistsdoubt, however, that a nation can improve its welfare over the long run bysubsidizing exports. Economic policies within individual countries are the primefactors which determine interest rates, capital flows, and often exchange rates, which,in turn, largely determine the overall level of a nation's exports. This means that, atthe national level, subsidized export financing merely shifts production amongsectors within the economy, rather than adding to the overall level of economicactivity, and subsidizes foreign consumption at the expense of the domestic economy. This also means that promoting exports through subsidized financing or throughgovernment-backed insurance and guarantees will not permanently raise the level ofemployment in the economy, but it will alter the composition of employment amongthe various sectors of the economy. ", "Some Eximbank opponents argue that the Bank's programs serve only to aid the richest American firms. Nevertheless, the Bank also is attempting to make itsprograms more accessible to small businesses, which account for 12 to 15% of theBank's total authorizations. Some opponents further argue that, by providingfinancing or insurance for exporters that the market seems unwilling, or unable, toprovide, Eximbank's activities draw from the financial resources within the economythat would be available for other uses. Another consideration is that subsidizedexport financing raises financing costs for all borrowers by drawing on financialresources that otherwise would be available for other uses, thereby possibly crowdingout some borrowers from the financial markets. This crowding-out effect mightnullify any positive impact subsidized export financing may have on the economy. ", "Eximbank supporters maintain that the Bank's programs are necessary for U.S. exporters to compete with foreign subsidized export financing and also to pressureforeign governments to eliminate concessionary financing. As a result, Eximbank isrequired in the Bank's Act to provide U.S. exporters with financing terms that are\"competitive\" with those offered by other official trade financing institutions. These,and other supporters of the Bank, also stress that deficiencies in financial marketsbias those markets against exports of high value, long-term assets.", "For FY2002, the Bush Administration proposed a $223 million, or 25% cut in spending for the Export-Import Bank. The Administration estimated that about $120million of the reduction was the result of lower risks in countries where theEximbank would lend. Because the level of risk and prospects for repayment arefactors in determining how much must be appropriated, this part of the proposed cutwould not affect the level of Bank financing. But the remaining reduction of about$100 million would limit the Export-Import Bank's ability to meet continuingdemands from American exporters. The Administration said that Bank lendingwould focus on U.S. businesses that have no access to private financing and wouldseek to increase the risk sharing with the private sector. Export coalitions opposedthe proposed funding reduction arguing that it would result in fewer U.S. exports, lostAmerican jobs, and would come at a time when major trading competitors wereincreasing their own export credit activities.", "Congressional Debate. The House in H.R. 2506 provided $787 million for the Export-Import Bank, aboutmid-way between the amounts for FY2001 and the Administration's proposed cut forFY2002.

The full Houseadopted an amendment (Visclosky) reducing the appropriation level by $18 million,an action some estimated would cut Eximbank loan guarantees by $275 million fromwhat the Committee recommended. Amendment proponents argued that last year,over the objections of the White House and some lawmakers, the Bank extended an$18 million loan guarantee package to Benxi Iron and Steel in China. This, theyclaimed, hurt American workers in the steel industry by extending credits to aChinese firm that was involved in an anti-dumping case before the InternationalTrade Commission. Critics of the amendment argued that reduced Eximbankfunding would have little impact on the loan guarantee issued last year to Benxi Ironand Steel, but would cut into resources available to other American exporters tryingto compete internationally.", "The Senate bill, as reported from Committee, had provided a somewhat higher funding level than the House - $806 million - an amount the Committee believedwould increase Bank financing in support of about $1 billion more exports than inFY2001. An amendment offered during Senate debate on H.R. 2506 ,however, reduced the Bank's funding level to $780 million, slightly below the Houseamount. The reduction was part of larger package of off-sets for increases inHIV/AIDS and other global health funding.", "As enacted, H.R. 2506 provides $779 million, slightly below House and Senate-passed levels, but $92 million higher than the request.

Many of these critics argue that aid can be transformed into a smaller,more targeted, and often privatized instrument to support only the highest priorityU.S. foreign policy interests. A perspective promoted by Senator Helms and otherssuggests that development assistance could have a more significant impact if it wasmanaged to a greater extent by non-governmental organizations - especiallyfaith-based groups - rather than by the U.S. Agency for International Development(USAID). Senator Helms, for a number of years, has advocated the abolishment ofUSAID, the creation of a separate foundation that would issue development aid blocgrants to NGOs, universities, and other private groups, and transfer the remainingresponsibilities of USAID to the State Department.", "The Clinton Administration strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policy which was used to bolster a variety of U.S. foreign policyinitiatives around the world.

The Administration alsobacked these programs, but officials objected to congressional efforts to increasefunding for children and health activities at the expense of other development sectors. When Congress increased appropriations for its priorities but cut the overalldevelopment aid budget, some areas including, economic growth and theenvironment, received substantially reduced funding.", "For FY2002, the Bush Administration sought $2.368 billion for development aid funded in the two Foreign Operations accounts of Child Survival/HealthPrograms and Development Assistance. This represented an increase of $133million, or 6% over FY2001 levels. Most of the additional resources would fall inthree areas. Bilateral HIV/AIDS funding would grow by $30 million to $329 million, basic education for children would increase by $20 million to $123 million, and $80million would be available for a new Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, andTuberculosis. (The Global Fund contribution would total $200 million with $100million coming from the Department of Health and Human Services budget and $20million from the FY2001 Foreign Operations bill.) During testimony at hisconfirmation hearing on April 25, USAID Administrator-designee Andrew Natsiosexpressed strong support for agriculture and food security programs, areas that wouldalso receive additional funding in the FY2002 request. For most other developmentaid activities, it appeared that spending would remain the same or decline.", "Beyond budget issues, USAID has re-aligned the core goals of sustainable development of the previous Administration and will allocate funds around three\"spheres of emphasis\" that include Global Health, Economic Growth andAgriculture, and Conflict Prevention and Developmental Relief. The BushAdministration further planned to launch a new initiative - the Global DevelopmentAlliance - in an effort to expand public/private partnerships in development programimplementation. Under the proposal, USAID would identify good developmentopportunities being conducted by private foundations, non-governmentalorganizations, universities, and for-profit organizations, and provide parallelfinancing to leverage resources already committed to these activities. USAIDofficials envision that the agency will become much more of a coordinating andintegrating institution to expand and enhance development efforts of thesenon-governmental development partners. Roughly $160 million would be set asidein FY2002 to finance these projects.

The debate over international family planning policyand abortion began nearly three decades ago when Congress added a provision to theForeign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibiting the use of U.S. appropriated funds forabortion-related activities and coercive family planning programs. During themid-1980s, in what has become known as the \"Mexico City\" policy (because it wasfirst announced at the 1984 Mexico City Population Conference), the Reagan, andlater the Bush, Administrations restricted funds for foreign non-governmentalorganizations (NGOs) that were involved in performing or promoting abortions incountries where they worked, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S.funds . Several groups, including International Planned ParenthoodFederation-London (IPPF-London), became ineligible for U.S. financial support. Insome years, Congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition, butWhite House vetoes kept the policy in place. President Clinton in 1993 reversed theposition of his two predecessors, allowing the United States to resume funding forall family planning organizations so long as no U.S. money was used by thoseinvolved in abortion-related work.", "During the past five years, the House and Senate have taken opposing positions on the Mexico City issue that in each case held up enactment of the final ForeignOperations spending measure. The House position, sponsored by RepresentativeSmith (N.J.) and others, supported reinstatement of the Mexico City policy restrictingU.S. aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or inlobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries. The Senate, on theother hand, has rejected in most cases House provisions dealing with Mexico Citypolicy, favoring a position that leaves these decisions in the hands of theAdministration. ", "Unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides, Congress adopted interim arrangements for FY1996-FY1999 that did not resolve the broad populationprogram controversy, but permitted the stalled Foreign Operations measure to moveforward. The annual \"compromise\" removed House-added Mexico City restrictions,but reduced population assistance to $385 million, and in several years, \"metered\"the availability of the funds at a rate of one-twelfth of the $385 million per month.", "The FY2000 debate, however, concluded far differently than the previous four years. As Congress and the White House searched in November 1999 for a finalFY2000 budget agreement, international family planning and population aid issuesbecame one of the last and most contentious aspects of the negotiations. Congressional leaders insisted that if the President wanted Congress to approvelegislation authorizing the payment of nearly $1 billion of U.S. arrears owed to theUnited Nations, the White House must also accept revised Mexico City languageadding abortion restrictions to U.S. population assistance policy. In order to removethe obstacles to U.N. arrears payments, a reluctant President Clinton agreed to theabortion restrictions, marking the first time that Mexico City conditions had beenincluded in legislation signed by the President. (Enacted in the Foreign OperationsAct for FY2000, H.R. 3422 , incorporated into H.R. 3194 ,the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000, P.L. 106-113 ). Because thePresident could waive the restrictions up to a certain point, there was no majorimpact on USAID family planning programs in FY2000, other than the loss of $12.5million in population assistance that the legislation required if the White Houseexercised the waiver authority.", "Congress again came to an impasse in 2000 over the international family issue and agreed to allow the new President to set policy early in 2001. Under the FY2001Foreign Operations measure, none of the $425 million appropriation could beobligated until after February 15, 2001. ", "Subsequently, on January 22, 2001, two days after taking office, President Bush issued a Memorandum to the USAID Administrator rescinding the 1993memorandum from President Clinton and directing the Administrator to \"reinstatein full all of the requirements of the Mexico City Policy in effect on January 19,1993.\" The President further said that it was his \"conviction that taxpayer fundsshould not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion,either here or abroad.\" (8) A separate statement fromthe President's press secretarystated that President Bush was \"committed to maintaining the $425 million fundinglevel\" for population assistance \"because he knows that one of the best ways toprevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services.\" Thepress secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions \"do notlimit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegalabortions, for example, post abortion care.\" (9) OnFebruary 15, the day on whichFY2001 population aid funds became available for obligation, USAID issued specificpolicy language and contract clauses to implement the President's directive. Theguidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when theMexico City policy applied. (10) For FY2002,President Bush seeks $425 million forUSAID population assistance, the same as appropriated for FY2001. (11) The Presidentalso proposed a U.S. contribution to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) of $25million, the same as for FY2001.", "Critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds. From an administrative standpoint, they say it increases USAID costs to manage familyplanning programs because of the additional paperwork and delays implementationof projects. (USAID has contracted with John Snow, Inc. to track the certificationprocess.) They further believe that family planning organizations may cut back onservices because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do notwant to risk losing eligibility for USAID funding. This, they contend, will lead tohigher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortions. Opponentsalso believe the new conditions undermine relations between the U.S. Governmentand foreign NGOs and multilateral groups, creating a situation where the UnitedStates challenges their sovereignty on how to spend their own money and imposesa so-called \"gag\" order on their ability to promote changes to abortion laws andregulations in developing nations. The latter, these critics note, would beunconstitutional if applied to American groups working in the United States. ", "Supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans USAID funds from being used to perform or promote abortions, money isfungible; that organizations receiving American-taxpayer funding can simply useUSAID resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from othersources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations. Thecertification process, they contend, stops the fungibility \"loophole.\"", "Congressional Debate. During subcommittee markup on June 27, the House Foreign Operations panel rejected byvoice vote an amendment by Representative Lowey that would have effectivelyreversed the President's Mexico City policy. The Lowey amendment would haveallowed groups to receive USAID funding so long as they did not violate U.S. lawsor the laws of the countries in which they operate. On funding issues, H.R. 2506 assumes the complete $425 million Administration requestfor population aid and $25 million for the U.N. Population Fund. The Mexico Cityissue was not raised during subsequent House consideration.", "The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2506 increased to $450 million family planning aid, plus $40 million for the U.N. Population Fund. A Committee amendment offered by Senator Leahy and adopted by the Senate panel would haveeffectively overturned the President's \"Mexico City\" policy. The Senate provisionblocked the White House from barring foreign NGOs' eligibility for USAID fundingsolely on the basis of health or medical services they offer with their own, non-U.S.Government provided funds so long as they did not violate U.S. laws or the laws ofnations where which they operate. Foreign NGOs would also not face limitations onadvocacy or lobbying activities using their own, non-U.S. Government funds thatwere more restrictive than those that apply to U.S. NGOs which receive U.S. foreignaid grants. This provision was very similar to a measure included by the SenateCommittee in the FY2001-reported Foreign Operations bill, to S. 367 reported favorably on August 1, 2001, by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,and to the Lowey amendment defeated during House subcommittee markup.", "After a month-long stalemate on family planning issues, conferees agreed on December 19 to delete Senate language that would have overturned theAdministration's Mexico City policy, but adopt funding levels for bilateralpopulation assistance and UNFPA closer to the Senate-passed higher figures. H.R. 2506 , as enacted, appropriates $446.5 million for U.S. bilateralfamily planning/ reproductive health programs in FY2002, only slightly less than the$450 million passed by the Senate. The legislation allocates the $20.5 million overallincrease from FY2001 and the FY2002 request in such a way that will add $10.5million family planning amounts to the Child Survival account and $10 million toother economic aid accounts. The conference agreement further provides a U.S.contribution to the UNFPA of \"up to\" $34 million, with the conditions that UNFPAnot fund abortions and that it segregate and not co-mingle U.S. funds with otherUNFPA money so they are not used for UNFPA programs in China. Confereesdropped the House restriction that would have reduced the contribution by whateverUNFPA spent in China. (12)", "Debt Reduction -- HIPC. In 1996, international creditors, including the World Bank and the IMF, agreed tolaunch a substantially expanded debt relief program for the world's poorest, mostseriously debt-strapped nations. The Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)initiative encompasses forty-one countries -- mostly in Africa -- that are potentiallyeligible for HIPC relief, although only those determined to have \"unsustainable\" debtand those that maintain a sound economic reform track record would qualify for themore generous HIPC debt relief terms.", "HIPC implementation, however, moved slowly in the late 1990s. Debt relief critics, including non-governmental organizations, religious groups, and some donorgovernments, charged that HIPC terms were not deep enough -- that 90% or 100%of bilateral debt owed should be canceled, and that six years was a far too longqualification period for full HIPC relief. They further believed that thenon-sustainable debt criteria, based largely on a ratio of a country's debt-to-exports,was too high and therefore excluded many countries that were also in need of debtrelief. A number of organizations further advocated instituting mechanisms thatwould ensure that savings realized by debtor governments would be channeled intospending on poverty programs, such as health and education, with decisions on howto spend the money made jointly by government and civil society.", "At the Cologne Summit in June 1999, G-7 leaders endorsed most of the HIPC reforms proposed by critics, and the World Bank and IMF, institutions that manageHIPC debt relief, adopted the enhancements in September. By the end of 2000, 22countries had qualified for at least preliminary debt reduction, although for nearly allnations, full HIPC relief is not expected for another year or more. ", "For these 22 qualifiers, the HIPC initiative, together with existing debt relief mechanisms, will result in the cancellation of $53 billion of their total $74 billiondebt stock (nominal terms). Annual debt service for these 22 nations will fall byabout one-half, or $800 million each year during the period 2001-2003. Povertyprogram expenditures by the 22 HIPC qualifiers are estimated by the World Bank toincrease by $1.7 billion during the same time period. There are 19 other HIPCcountries, a few of which are expected to provisionally qualify this year or next. Fournations are considered to have \"sustainable\" debt without HIPC relief, while one isnot seeking HIPC terms. Several others remain involved in regional conflicts or havenot began required economic reform programs and are likely not to qualify in thenear term. Total creditor costs of the HIPC initiative are estimated at $29.3 billion. Because only about 3% of HIPC debt is owed to the United States, the U.S. financialcommitment is small relative to the cost to all creditors - roughly $800 million. (13)", "A number of NGOs, however, remain critical of the HIPC initiative, arguing that the terms are still not generous enough to ensure that poor countries will havesufficient resources to invest in health, education, and other poverty-oriented socialprograms. They contend that the World Bank and IMF should cancel 100% debtowed by HIPC in the same way as most bilateral creditors, including the UnitedStates. These critics point out that the degree of annual debt service relief fluctuateswidely among qualifying nations, and that for some, the savings will not besubstantial. Moreover, they claim that the amount of debt service will still exceedpoverty program expenditures even after HIPC relief. Many further say that thequalification criteria should be lowered so that heavily indebted countries likeBangladesh, Nigeria, and Haiti will also be able to benefit from the initiative. ", "World Bank and IMF officials, as well as several creditor governments counter that these institutions do not have the resources to cancel total debt owed by HIPCnations. Unless donors, like the United States, would be willing to increasecontributions, further HIPC expansion of multilateral debt relief would wipe out bankreserves. They further express concern that cancellation of all debt owed by thesecountries would create \"moral hazard\" and argue that some payment obligationsshould remain.", "Congress acted in 1999 and 2000 authorizing and appropriating most, but not all funding for U.S. pledged contributions to the HIPC initiative. For FY2000,lawmakers provided $110 million for the cancellation of HIPC debt owed to theUnited States, followed by an FY2001 appropriation of $435 million, of which $75million will cover the costs of writing-off bilateral debt. The other $360 million isa contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund that assists the African Development Bank,Inter-American Development Bank and other multilateral creditors cover their costsof reducing debt owed by HIPC countries. Because of concerns that HIPC nationswould accumulate new debt and fall back into a debt trap, Congress stipulated thatcountries receiving benefits from U.S. contributions must first agree not to borrowat market rate terms for two years and endorsed consideration of a policy in whichthe World Bank's International Development Association would expand grantassistance to these governments.", "For FY2002, the Bush Administration sought $224 million that, together with $16 million available from prior year appropriations, would complete the U.S.commitment of $600 million for the HIPC Trust Fund.", "Congressional Debate. The House provided full funding - $224 million - for U.S. support of the HIPC initiative inFY2002. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Treasury Secretary topress other donors to agree to the creation of a grant aid facility at the World Bank'sInternational Development Association for HIPC beneficiary countries during thefirst three years following their qualification for HIPC debt relief terms. The Senatebill also recommended the full $224 million funding level for HIPC.", "In addition, both House and Senate versions of H.R. 2506 provided resources for another debt relief initiative - the Tropical Forestry Conservation Act(TFCA). The TFCA extends a menu of debt reduction options for countries whichare willing to expend resources and implement programs protecting their tropicalforests. The Administration did not request funds for FY2002 TFCA activities, butrather sought authority to transfer $13 million from USAID development assistanceresources. The House bill directed that $25 million from prior year appropriationsbe used for TFCA debt relief, while the Senate measure appropriated $11 million forthe TFCA and directed the use of $14 million in previously appropriated money, fora total funding level of $25 million.", "As enacted, H.R. 2506 provides $224 million for HIPC, as requested. The measure further appropriates $5 million for the TFCA and providesauthority for the Administration to use $20 million from unobligated debt relief fundsin prior appropriations.

The House considered a number ofamendments seeking to reduce further funding for the initiative or limit U.S.involvement in military operations. Adopted were a Conyers amendment that cappedU.S. civilian and military personnel involved in the Andean CounternarcoticsInitiative at 800 and a Hoekstra amendment that would withhold $65 million until theSecretary of State reports on the April 20, 2001, Peruvian Air Force jet downing ofa civilian aircraft in which two Americans were killed.
