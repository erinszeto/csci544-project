As required by the Home Rule Act, the city council must approve a budget within 56 days after receiving a budget proposal from the mayor. The approved budget must then be transmitted to the President, who forwards it to Congress for its review, modification, and approval through the annual appropriations process. This typically includes subcommittee hearings, which may take place before the actual budget submission to Congress; subcommittee and committee markups in the House and the Senate; committee reports and votes; floor action; conference report consideration; and final passage.

Since 1979, with the passage of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of 1980, P.L. 96-93 (93 Stat. 719), Congress has placed some limitation or prohibition on the use of public funds for abortion services for District residents. From 1979 to 1988, Congress restricted the use of federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life was endangered or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Under these circumstances, the District was free to use District funds for abortion services. When Congress passed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1989, P.L. 100-462 (102 Stat. 2269-9), it restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were taken to term. The inclusion of District funds and the elimination of rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services were endorsed by President Reagan, who threatened to veto the District's appropriations act if the abortion provision was not modified. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush twice vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue.

Code \u00a71-203.03(d) (2012 Supp.). That provision of governing law provides in relevant part that \" the [Charter] amending procedure may not be used to enact any law or affect any law with respect to which the Council may not enact under the limitations specified in \u00a71-206.01 to \u00a7 1-206.03 .\" The statute is phrased in clear mandatory terms: a proposed amendment is precluded by law from going on the ballot through the Charter-amending procedure of Section 303 if the proposed amendment would \"enact any law or affect any law with respect to which the Council may not enact ... under the limitation specified in\" Sections 206.01-03. For reasons we detail below it is precisely these limitations, reserving to Congress, among other things, the authority to change the laws governing the role played by Congress and the President in the District's budget that in the considered judgment of this office, preclude using the charter amendment procedures, including the placement on a ballot for the electorate for the proposed amendment. Likewise, it is our view that under those express limitations, Congress or a court reviewing the merits of the legal issue would find the amendment to be outside the scope of the Charter amending process in Section 303 and also contrary to other federal laws, those found in Title 31 of the U.S. Code.", "These objections were reiterated and expanded upon in an April 8, 2014, legal analysis by the Office of Attorney General. The Attorney General's analysis articulated the following objections to the proposed charter amendment: ", "I. The a ct is null and void because the Council exceeded its authority in enacting it and because it violates federal law.", "1. The act violates the limitations of Section 602(a)(3) because it changes the functions of the United States and because it is not restricted in its application exclusively or to the District. 2. The act violates the limitations of Section 603(a) because it changes the longstanding roles and procedures of Congress, the President, and other federal entities in the formation of the District's total budget. 3. The act violates the limitations of Section 603(e) by using the ratification process to establish local budget autonomy.", "II. The legal arguments advanced in support of the a ct are unpersuasive.", "A GAO legal analysis also raised the same objection and questioned the legal standing of the proposed charter amendment. ", "On April 17, 2014, the District of Columbia Council filed a suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to compel the mayor to execute the charter amendment changes. On May 19, 2014, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an opinion concluding that the Local Budget Autonomy Act was unlawful and that District officials were permanently enjoined from enforcing it. The Council appealed the decision and on October 18, 2014, presented its case before a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Before the panel issued a ruling a new mayor was elected, Muriel Bowser, who reversed Mayor Gray's decision not to enforce the Budget Autonomy Act. On March 23, 2015, a Suggestion of Mootness and Motion to Dismiss was filed with United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The motion claimed that since there was no dispute or disagreement between the Council and the mayor, the judgment rendered by the District Court for the District of Columbia in April 2014 should be vacated, the appeal dismissed, and the case remanded to the D.C. Superior Court. ", "In an unpublished order, the Appeals Court ruled on May 27, 2015, without elaboration, to vacate the District Court's judgment, which held that the District's Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012 was invalid. In addition, the Appeals Court ordered the case to be remanded to the District Court with instructions to remand the case to the District of Columbia Superior Court. On March 18, 2016, Judge Brian F. Holman of the District of Columbia Superior Court issued a ruling upholding the legality of the District's Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012. ", "Despite all that has transpired, including the ruling by Judge Holman, the issue of budget autonomy remains an open question. Litigation initiated in 2015, by Clarice Feldman, a resident of the District of Columbia, following the filing of the Motion of the Suggestion of Mootness by Mayor Bowser, was still pending in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On February 1, 2016, in an effort to prevent the United States District Court for the District of Columbia from considering the merits of Ms. Feldman's challenge to the validity of the Local Budget Act, both defendants, the mayor and the CFO, filed motions to dismiss contending that Ms. Feldman \"lacked standing, the case was moot, and the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\" Subsequently, on March 31, 2016, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives filed an amicus brief in support of Ms. Feldman's litigation. The Court has yet to rule on merits of Ms. Feldman's legal challenge to the District's budget autonomy act as of this writing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Actions", "paragraphs": ["On May 12, 2016, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Subcommittee on Government Operations held a hearing entitled D.C.
