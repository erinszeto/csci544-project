Cambodia's human rights record has been a constant source of friction between Prime Minister Hun Sen and major providers of foreign aid, which is equal to roughly half of the country's government budget. The kingdom's dependence on this aid has helped to keep pressure on the government to maintain or strengthen basic freedoms and democratic institutions.

With the termination of quotas on textiles by WTO member states in 2005 and the expiration of U.S. safeguards against garments from China in 2008, Cambodian textile exports are threatened by competition from China and other large producers. Cambodia has pressed the United States to grant its apparel exports preferential treatment.

Five former officials have been indicted. Due to unexpected costs and delays, the court has struggled to raise more funding in order to continue its operations.

In 1965, Prince Sihanouk broke off diplomatic relations with the United States in response to U.S. and South-Vietnamese military incursions into the kingdom and growing U.S. influence in the Cambodian armed forces. Diplomatic relations were restored in 1969. Beginning in 1969, the United States conducted a four-year, sustained, large scale bombing campaign in Cambodia aimed at North Vietnamese troops in the country. According to some historians, the American bombing helped the Cambodian communists to gain followers and recruit soldiers. In March 1970, the military forces of pro-American General Lon Nol overthrew the government of Prince Sihanouk in a coup. The Prince fled to Beijing and reluctantly formed an alliance with the Cambodian communists against the Lon Nol government.

Urban Cambodians with wealth and education were particularly targeted. In January 1979, an invasion by Vietnamese forces drove the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh.

Although the royalist FUNCINPEC Party (National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia) won a 58-seat plurality, it agreed to form a coalition government with the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), with 51 seats, after the CPP threatened that it would not accept the election. The establishment of the coalition government with Prince Norodom Ranariddh, head of FUNCINPEC, and Hun Sen, head of the CPP, as co-prime ministers brought fragile political stability to Cambodia.

Some U.S. officials have expressed worry that as PRC economic support increases, the United States and other Western countries may lose leverage in calling upon the Cambodian government to engage in democratic practices and enforce the rule of law.", "The ethnic Chinese community in Cambodia reportedly has regained its former economic clout and helped facilitate PRC investment. Roughly 3%-5% of the kingdom's population, or from 350,000 to 700,000 Cambodians, are ethnic Chinese, many of whom are descendants of settlers from southern China going back five centuries while others are part of a tide of recent immigration. Before 1975, ethnic Chinese in Cambodia, mostly city-dwellers, dominated commerce and trade in the kingdom. About half of the ethnic Chinese population reportedly perished under the Khmer Rouge. They faced discrimination under the Vietnamese-backed government during the 1980s, but have prospered under Hun Sen. Some longtime Cambodian Chinese, however, wary of a Cambodian backlash against growing Chinese immigration and influence in the economy and mindful of the PRC's past support of the Khmer Rouge, reportedly feel resentful towards China's rising influence.", "The largest Chinese language school in Southeast Asia reportedly is located in Phnom Penh. Asian languages, and in particular Chinese, are catching up to English as the most sought after foreign languages for learning.

Some experts warn that the country's increasing economic openness, porous borders, weak government capacity, and corruption increase the likelihood that regional terrorist groups such as Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) favor it as a safe haven. For example, Hambali, the Indonesian accused of directing the October 2002 bombing in Bali, reportedly took refuge in Cambodia in 2002 and 2003. In 2003, Cambodian officials arrested four men\u2014one Cambodian Muslim, two Thai Muslims, and an Egyptian\u2014for belonging to JI and plotting to carry out terrorist attacks in Cambodia. The three non-Cambodians were teachers at a Saudi-funded Islamic school that Cambodian authorities subsequently shut down.", "In September 2006, U.S. Ambassador Joseph Mussomeli stated that \"Cambodia has made great strides in securing its borders and rooting out terrorists that seek to use this country as a base of operations.\" In 2004, the Cambodian government, in cooperation with the United States, destroyed 233 Soviet surface-to-air missiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the Cambodian government enacted a new counterterrorism law that was drafted with the help of Australian and British experts. In 2007, a joint National Counterterrorism Committee was established. In January 2008, FBI Director Robert Mueller visited Cambodia to preside over the opening of a permanent Legal Attache Office for Cambodia and Vietnam.", "Cambodia's Muslims, mostly ethnic Cham people who practice a tolerant, syncretic form of Islam that incorporates Buddhism and other belief systems, make up about 5% of the kingdom's population. The Cham, mostly poor farmers, fishermen, and traders, generally are not politically active. Their religious and educational institutions were destroyed by the Khmer Rouge. Since the early 1990s, however, assistance from the Middle East, Malaysia, and Indonesia have helped to build new mosques and religious schools and brought conservative strains of Islam in Cambodia."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
