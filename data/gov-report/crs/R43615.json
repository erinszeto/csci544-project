This renewed interest has been sparked by Social Security proposals that would reduce the regular benefit and by concern over poverty rates among beneficiaries who had low wages throughout their careers.

A worker may earn up to four earnings credits per calendar year. In 2018, a worker earns one credit for each $1,320 of covered earnings (i.e., earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes), up to a maximum of four credits for covered earnings of $5,280 or more. The primary insurance amoun t (PIA) is the benefit a worker would receive if the worker elects to begin receiving retirement benefits at the worker's full retirement age (FRA, sometimes called the normal retirement age ). The PIA is based on a summary measure of the worker's lifetime earnings, called the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). To compute a worker's AIME, the worker's earnings are converted into current-dollar terms by indexing each year of earnings to historical wage growth, and the sum of the highest 35 years of indexed earnings are divided by 35 to determine career-average annual earnings. This amount is then divided by 12, to get a monthly amount. If a worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings (because of time out of the labor force for family caregiving, spells of unemployment, or other reasons), years of no earnings are entered as zeros.", "Next, the standard Social Security benefit formula is applied to the worker's AIME to get the PIA. Two dollar thresholds, known as bend points , are used to divide the worker's AIME into three segments; in 2018, the two bend points are $895 and $5,397. Three conversion factors\u201490%, 32%, and 15%\u2014are applied to the three different segments of the worker's AIME to compute the basic monthly benefit; 90% is applied to the $0-$895 segment, 32% to the $895-$5,397 segment, and 15% to the over-$5,397 segment. Because the lower conversion factors apply to higher earnings segment, the benefit formula is progressive. That is, it replaces a higher percentage of the pre-retirement earnings of workers with low career-average earnings than for workers with high career-average earnings.", "Social Security also provides auxiliary benefits to eligible family members of a retired, disabled, or deceased worker. Benefits payable to family members are equal to a specified percentage of the worker's PIA.

This minimum benefit applied to people who had long careers with low annual covered earnings and to people who had shorter careers with higher annual covered earnings. ", "Successive legislation periodically increased benefit amounts, including the original $10 monthly dollar amount for newly entitled beneficiaries, in increments on an ad hoc basis until 1975. This changed with the enactment of cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs), which led to automatic adjustments to benefits based on changes in prices (P.L. 92-336, 1972). More specifically, COLAs were tied to increases in the Consumer Price Index. Annual adjustments applied to both initial benefit amounts (including the minimum benefit amount) and monthly benefits.", "The automatic increases to (initial) minimum benefits for newly entitled beneficiaries stopped shortly after, when the Social Security Amendments of 1977 ( P.L. 95-216 ) froze the minimum benefit at the amount in effect in December 1978\u2014$122 per month\u2014for beneficiaries newly entitled in January 1979 or later.

Such people include, for example, workers whose primary work was in non-covered employment subject to a staff retirement system\u2014such as Federal civilian employees. In December 1975, about 45% of civil service retirement annuitants were receiving Social Security benefits, more than a quarter of whom were receiving the minimum.\u2026 Because of the characteristics of people getting the minimum, it has been characterized as being a 'windfall' to people who have not worked regularly under the program. ", "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-35 ) eliminated the minimum benefit structure for all current and future beneficiaries, effective January 1, 1982. The bill was enacted into law on August 13, 1981, but public outcry led to reconsideration. Subsequently, in December 1981, the Highway Revenue Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-123 ) was enacted to restore the original minimum benefit structure for people who became eligible for Social Security benefits before January 1, 1982.

", "Some argue that a minimum benefit remains necessary because many elderly Social Security beneficiaries, especially elderly women, are poor or near poor. In 2016, the poverty rate for people aged 65 and older was 9.3%. Older women are more likely to have income below the poverty threshold than men; 10.6% of older women versus 7.6% older men fall below the official poverty line. Black older adults are nearly three times as likely to be poor as white older adults (18.7% versus 7.1%). The poverty rate for single black older women was nearly 30%; the rate for comparable white women was 13%. A study shows that the benefit of SSI has some shortcomings that prevent it from effectively protecting the income security of the oldest Americans. SSI benefits are about three-fourths of the poverty line for a single person and slightly over 80% of poverty for a couple. Some research suggests restructuring the Social Security minimum could be more effective in alleviating poverty than certain reforms to the SSI program, although a combination of both programs could be useful in the event that Social Security benefits are greatly reduced in the future.", "Some view minimum benefits as a way to reward long-term, low-wage work with a Social Security benefit that is at or above the poverty threshold. Restructuring the Social Security minimum benefit to provide a benefit at or above the poverty threshold (e.g., 120% of the poverty threshold) for long-term workers would more generously reward long-term participation in the workforce.", "Others view a restructuring of minimum benefits as even more helpful in the context of legislation that reduces Social Security benefits or exposes them to market risk. Several recent proposals that would reduce regular Social Security benefits have included minimum benefit guarantees.", "A minimum benefit could be designed to reduce poverty rates among older beneficiaries more efficiently than existing Social Security spousal and survivor benefits. This is partly because a redesigned minimum benefit could reach persons who do not qualify for Social Security spouse or survivor benefits because they never married or because they divorced before reaching 10 years of marriage. Among women born in the 1960s, the proportion of white and Hispanic women who reach old age qualified for spouse or widow benefits will be about 80%, versus 50% of black women. Because of changing marriage and work patterns, the number of women eligible for spousal and survivors benefits is declining, making this a more important consideration. ", "In addition, private pensions and private savings have become more insecure and unequal. Employer pension support has been declining and the fraction of full-time workers in the public and private sector offered pensions has fallen from 74% in the late 1970s to 64% in 2012. Private savings have always been the most unstable, and most Americans have more debt than savings.

Because SSA does not collect information on earnings per hour or on the number of hours worked, it is impossible to distinguish between people who had low annual earnings because they worked few hours at higher wages and those who worked many hours at lower wages. People with high annual earnings but low lifetime earnings may be seen as having chosen their low lifetime earnings by working less than others.", "Another argument is that means-tested programs, such as SSI, are a more appropriate way to supplement the incomes of people with low incomes and assets. Means testing can help target transfers to those who are in greatest financial need. Some research suggests, however, that means testing can harm incentives for work and saving because SSI's asset limits are currently low: countable resources must not be worth more than $2,000 for an individual or $3,000 for a couple. There are other considerations that could limit SSI's impact. For example, Social Security is available to retired workers earlier than SSI; retired workers can claim Social Security benefits starting at the age of 62 while SSI is available to aged beneficiaries starting at age 65 (though disabled retired workers aged 62-64 can receive SSI). Furthermore, SSI is generally insufficient to move recipients above the federal poverty level."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Considering Minimum Benefit Proposals", "paragraphs": ["There are two major considerations in proposals for a minimum benefit.

Lowering the required number of years of coverage would allow the minimum benefit to reach more workers, including more part-time and part-year workers. Women are more likely than men to work fewer years. The fraction of stay-at-home mothers has been increasing since 2000, especially during the Great Recession in 2009.

The long-range shortfall of OASDI trust funds would increase by 5% and 8% respectively. Under this scenario, the payroll tax rate would need to be increased from the current 12.40% to 12.55% (or 12.66% with childcare years) or other policy changes would have to be made for the system to be solvent for the next 75 years.", "Several similar options were proposed in the last decade. In 2010, the Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested keeping everything else the same as the above option, with a starting time of the new policy in 2024, before which time the benefit level would have been indexed to prices and then to wage levels after that year. This proposal would cause an increase in cost of 0.12% of taxable payroll (from 12.40% to 12.52%) in the 75-year projection. In 2011, Representative Jason Chaffetz proposed another variation to set the minimum PIA for workers with 30 years of coverage equal to 100% of the poverty level. This option with a limit of five childcare years cost an additional 0.10% of taxable payroll in the long-range estimate. In 2013, the Social Security Enhancement and Protection Act ( H.R. 1374 , 113 th Congress) also proposed a minimum PIA for workers with 30 years of coverage equal to 100% of the poverty level, setting a reduction of 3 1/3 percentage points for each year less than 30 years of work until 11 years of coverage, allowing a limit of five childcare years, and indexing benefits as the current law. The proposal, starting in 2020, would cause an increase in the actuarial deficit of 0.2% of taxable payroll in the long run. The provision proposed by the S.O.S. Act of 2016 ( H.R. 5747 , 114 th Congress) increased the number of years of coverage with full benefits to 40, setting the minimum PIA at 125% of the poverty level, which will linearly decrease to 100% of the poverty level with 20 years of coverage and then to 0% with 10 years or less. The budgetary effect of this proposal was a 0.14% increase in taxable payroll. In addition, the Rivlin-Domenici task force (2010) proposed defining a year of coverage as a year in which a worker either earned 20% of the old-law maximum or had a child in care, setting the minimum PIA for 30 years of coverage equal to 133% of the poverty level, indexing benefits to wages, and limiting benefits to workers with more than 19 years of coverage. This proposal would cost an additional 0.5% of taxable payroll compared with current law. ", "A variation on this approach would be a minimum benefit that depended both on the number of years of work and a worker's average earnings, as measured by the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). For example, an option proposed by Representative Paul Ryan in 2010 as part of H.R. 4529 (111 th Congress) would have set a minimum benefit equal to 120% of the federal poverty level for a worker whose AIME was below that of a lifelong, full-time minimum-wage worker and who had 30 or more years of earnings. As with the Special Minimum PIA, the minimum benefit would decline for workers with fewer years of earnings; those with fewer than 20 years would be ineligible. But in addition, the benefit would decline as average earnings increased, and a worker whose AIME exceeded twice that of a lifelong, full-time minimum-wage worker would also be ineligible for the minimum benefit. The budgetary effect of the provision would be relatively small. The actuarial deficit was estimated to be no more than 0.03% of taxable payroll in any year, according to SSA. A similar proposal analyzed by CBO estimates that benefits for low earners would increase by about 6%.", "A relatively different proposal was included in the Social Security Reform Act of 2016 ( H.R. 6489 , 114 th Congress), which reconfigured the Special Minimum benefit, phased in for newly eligible workers from 2024 through 2033, with a year of coverage equal to the federal minimum wage of a full-time worker. Workers with 35 years of coverage can get the minimum PIA equal to 35% of Average Wage Index (AWI), and the benefit would decrease nonlinearly to zero with 10 or fewer years of coverage. SSA estimated that this option would cause an increase in the actuarial deficit of 0.22% of taxable payroll in the 75-year projection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options to Enhance the Standard Social Security Benefit", "paragraphs": ["Under the Special Minimum PIA and the options described in the previous section, people receive either the standard benefit or the minimum benefit, whichever is higher. An alternative approach would be to begin with the standard benefit for everyone, but to increase it by a certain percentage for a targeted population.", "CBO analyzed an option that would increase the standard benefit for low-wage workers by up to 40%. Workers with at least 35 years of work and whose AIME was less than that of a 30-year, full-time minimum-wage worker would receive a 40% increase. Benefits would be increased by a smaller percentage for workers with at least 20 years of work and below-average lifetime earnings. That option would increase total benefits by about 7%. Median benefits would increase for low earners by about 24%. The option would increase benefits for more than half of workers because it would help everyone whose lifetime earnings were below that of someone who worked for 35 years at the average wage in the economy.", "The Bipartisan Policy Center's Commission on Retirement Security and Personal Savings has proposed a basic minimum benefit (BMB) that supplements Social Security benefits, but is phased out based on the benefit amount, as opposed to years of work (see Figure 4 ). The BMB would be automatic, but to ensure that the BMB is not going to households with large amounts of non-Social Security income, filers with higher adjusted gross incomes ($30,000 for single filers and $45,000 for joint filers) would repay their BMB through the income-tax system. The actuarial deficit of this proposal would be 0.20% of taxable payroll in the 75-year projection, and the projected long-range shortfall of OASDI trust funds would increase by 7%. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Fixed-Dollar Benefit", "paragraphs": ["A simple but less targeted approach would be to set a minimum dollar Social Security benefit. The benefit could be paid only to people who qualify for benefits under current law, or it could be expanded to all elderly and disabled people. Such a policy would be similar to SSI, but it would not necessarily be limited to people with low income and assets. If the benefit were set at or above the poverty threshold, elderly poverty would be greatly reduced. ", "However, a universal benefit is not well-targeted: it would increase benefits for some people who already had relatively high non-Social Security income. For example, an SSA analysis based on 1996 data found that about one-sixth of Social Security beneficiaries had benefits lower than the maximum SSI benefit level, which was $470 a month for a single person in 1996 and is currently $750 a month (that share is almost certainly lower now because average Social Security benefits have increased faster than SSI benefits). However, about 80% of retired workers whose Social Security benefit was below the maximum SSI benefit level were not poor. In 1996, setting a minimum Social Security benefit equal to the SSI benefit would have increased total Social Security outlays by about 2%.

Such a change could be designed to redistribute benefits to people with lower lifetime earnings in a way similar to the way that a standard, wage-indexed minimum benefit would.", "Some proposals would address poverty among long-term, low-wage workers and their dependents by targeting benefit increases to single or divorced women or to people who live into advanced old age. For example, the length-of-marriage requirement for divorced women could be lowered from 10 years to 5 or 7 years. Caregiver credits or \"drop-out\" years could be entered into the Social Security benefit formula for workers who take career breaks to care for a child or other relative. Another proposal would increase the Social Security survivor's benefit to 75% of the couple's combined benefit; some versions of this proposal would offset costs by lowering the spousal benefit received while both members of the couple are alive. Proposals to increase benefits for aged women are generally motivated by equity and adequacy considerations rather than financing considerations and may add to system costs.", "A goal of increasing federal support for poor aged and disabled people could be implemented outside of Social Security. For example, increases in federal SSI spending would help many of the same beneficiaries affected by a minimum Social Security benefit, but people with little or no work history would also benefit. A new program could also be established. For example, the Senior Income Guarantee (SIG) would provide benefits at 75% of the poverty threshold for people at or above the full retirement age who have 10 years in covered work and 40 years of residence in the United States and lesser benefits for those with shorter work histories or fewer years of residence. Benefit and eligibility standards would be less strict than for SSI; for example, asset tests would be more generous."], "subsections": []}]}}
