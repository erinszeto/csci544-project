Limited publicly available data suggest intelligence spending, measured in constant 2014 dollars, has roughly doubled since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and, before declines over the last three years, was almost double spending at its peak at the end of the Cold War. The recent disclosure by the Washington Post of details from the Administration's FY2013 National Intelligence Program (NIP) budget request may spark further debate about intelligence spending. It is likely that Members of Congress will more closely examine intelligence programs to ensure they are both effective and affordable. Perhaps the most important questions for Members are how and to what extent intelligence spending, after a decade of sharp growth, should fall in comparison to declines in other defense spending. See the section titled \"Comparison with National Defense Spending\" for further discussion on that topic.", "Fiscal pressures today will require intelligence officials to more clearly establish priorities and to make difficult choices between different intelligence collection platforms and agencies. Such choices may not have been required during the past decade, during which additional funding could be found to address new threats and to fix organizational weaknesses. In the 1990s, during a previous round of budget cuts and prior to the establishment of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), it was argued that the intelligence community lacked a rigorous system to establish priorities and to tailor the intelligence budgets to meet those priorities. It remains unclear whether intelligence reforms after September 11, 2001, sufficiently addressed this issue.", "Intelligence spending is spread across the 17 organizations comprising the intelligence community. Over 90% of NIP funding, which focuses on strategic needs of decision makers and is notionally under DNI control, falls within the Department of Defense (DOD) budget. DOD members of the intelligence community also receive funding for tactical intelligence from the Military Intelligence Program (MIP), which is under the authority of the Secretary of Defense but which may fund intelligence collection platforms that could be used for both tactical and strategic purposes. The remaining portions of the NIP fall within several other Cabinet departments and two independent agencies. These overlaps complicate both budget formulation and the congressional appropriation process.", "The appropriations process for intelligence activities is complex and not widely understood. A number of changes have been proposed that would streamline the process or disentangle the NIP from the Department of Defense budget. Some, such as the proposal by a 9/11 Commission to combine authorization and appropriation responsibilities in a single committee, would be inconsistent with congressional practices during the past century. Other proposals to separate intelligence appropriations from defense appropriations, or to establish a separate intelligence title within defense appropriations acts, are less radical, but have met with opposition.", "As a result, the congressional intelligence appropriations process is likely to receive continued attention.

But in the new era of fiscal limits, intelligence officials and Members of Congress are addressing ways to reduce intelligence spending while ensuring continued effectiveness against al-Qaeda and while adapting to new priorities other than counterterrorism. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper Jr. recently stated that sequestration would require a 7% cut, or roughly $4 billion, to the National Intelligence Program (NIP) budget and warned of reduced global coverage and decreased human and technical intelligence collection. Mr. Clapper also warned of repercussions similar to those that occurred in the 1990s when, in concert with a one-third decrease in active duty military personnel, the intelligence community saw a 23% cut in its budget, resulting in what he characterized as a \"damaging downward spiral.\" ", "The Washington Post on August 29, 2013, published details about the Administration's FY2013 NIP budget request, based on a document provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

Nonetheless, the disclosure may drive further public debate about the size of the intelligence budget and about the effectiveness of intelligence spending.

Later sections of this report describe these programs in more detail. It is important to recognize that public comments about intelligence spending do not always distinguish between the NIP, the MIP, and the total of the two, complicating discussions on a subject about which there are already few details.", "The 9/11 Commission recommended that the amount of money spent on national intelligence be released to the public. In accordance with the Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in 2007 began to announce each year the amount of money appropriated for the NIP. The Intelligence Authorization Act of 2010 also required the President to publicly disclose the amount requested for the NIP in his budget. The Secretary of Defense began to release annual MIP appropriations figures in 2010 and specified those figures back to 2007. These actions have provided public access to previously classified budget numbers for national and military intelligence efforts.

Since peaking in 2010, total intelligence spending has fallen by at least 15%, which largely reflects a decrease in military intelligence spending.", "The NIP and MIP figures above include funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)\u2014roughly $10 billion annually for intelligence activities. It can be useful to distinguish OCO funding, including OCO funding for military intelligence, from other defense spending because that funding pays for wartime-related activities that differ from activities funded by the DOD base budget. For broader intelligence spending in the NIP, however, it is not clear what activity is supported by NIP OCO funds or to what extent that activity is qualitatively different than other intelligence operations taking place across the globe. Figure 1 breaks out OCO funds from other MIP and NIP funding. Base budget intelligence spending grew by more than $10 billion, peaking in FY2010, while OCO intelligence spending grew by about $3 billion, peaking in FY2011.", "Policy makers have remarked that intelligence spending has doubled since September 11, 2001. CRS analysis suggests that the NIP slightly more than doubled in real terms from 2001 to 2012 while the MIP grew at a slower pace. The NIP budget in 2001 (then referred to as the National Foreign Intelligence Program\u2014NFIP) was roughly $24 billion in constant 2014 dollars, or less than half of the NIP budget for FY2012. After sequestration, the NIP budget from 2001 to 2013 will have roughly doubled.

It is possible to estimate that total intelligence spending in 1980 was slightly less than $21 billion, in current dollars. Spending appears to have quadrupled between 1980 and 2010 before declining over the past three years. These estimates are based on information provided by the 1996 Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community, which described the trend in intelligence spending from 1980 to the mid-1990s and the projected spending trend from the mid-1990s to 2001. The commission specified the percentage change at key points in time but not actual spending levels. The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) also publicly disclosed the amount appropriated for intelligence for FY1997 and FY1998. Using the trends described by the commission and the figure for FY1997, CRS estimated spending in 1980 and 1989.

Using the estimates above, it is possible to separate total intelligence spending from the national defense function and to compare the growth in intelligence spending to the growth in national defense spending without intelligence. Total intelligence spending grew more sharply than other national defense spending in both the 1980s and after 2001. As noted, total intelligence spending previously peaked in 1989, at 125% above spending in 1980, before declining in the mid-1990s to 80% above spending in 1980. In comparison, national defense excluding intelligence grew by 55% from 1980 to its peak in 1985 before declining in the mid-1990s to roughly equal that in 1980. As shown in Figure 2 , total intelligence spending grew from $34.4 billion to $78.4 billion or by about 110% in real terms from 2001 to 2012. National defense excluding intelligence grew by 55% over that time period.", "As a result of these trends, when measured from 1980, total intelligence spending by 2012 had grown 274%, while national defense spending without intelligence had grown 82% over that time period (see Figure 3 ).", "Perhaps one of the most critical questions facing Congress is whether intelligence spending will fall in concert with other defense spending. Some argue that as defense spending decreases, intelligence spending should remain flat or rise because a robust intelligence apparatus would be necessary to compensate and provide forewarning to a smaller, more nimble DOD. While plausible, this argument belies the fact that, as demonstrated by Figure 3 , intelligence spending has already been decoupled from defense spending\u2014the two in recent decades have tended to move in the same direction but have changed by different degrees.", "Another argument about the relationship between defense and intelligence spending concerns the diversity and magnitude of the threats to U.S. interests. Intelligence spending might appropriately be correlated to the diversity of threats. The intelligence community has argued that, especially after September 11, 2001, the range and complexity of threats to the United States has expanded to include not only state actors, but also non-state actors involved in activities such as terrorism, cyber-attacks, and drug trafficking. To fulfill the strategic needs of decision makers, the community must to some degree dedicate resources towards those threats. In comparison, while DOD must do contingency planning to address a diversity of threats, it does not necessarily need to dedicate resources towards each of them. Further, the cost to DOD of addressing new threats may not be as large as the cost associated with challenges from traditional state actors like the Soviet Union. Defense spending might thus be understood to correlate to the total size of the threat to U.S. interests. ", "Hence, this would explain and to some extent justify the divergence of intelligence spending from other national defense spending since the end of the Cold War, when many experts agree the number of threats to U.S. interests multiplied even while the sheer magnitude of the threat may have decreased. The question remains whether, after a decade of sharp growth and after the most critical improvements to intelligence capabilities have by some accounts already been made, intelligence spending can now be pared back while preserving necessary tools and capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing and Enforcing Intelligence Spending Priorities", "paragraphs": ["DNI James R. Clapper, in March 2013 testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, stated that \"in my almost 50 years in intelligence, I do not recall a period in which we've confronted a more diverse array of threats, crises and challenges around the world.... Threats are more interconnected and viral.\" The challenge for Congress and the intelligence community in light of this assessment may be to better establish priorities and to align relevant budgets accordingly. Absent such a process, resources may not be focused on the most critical issues, making it difficult to respond effectively to the myriad threats that the intelligence community argues are in need of attention.", "During a previous round of budget cuts in the 1990s and prior to the establishment of the DNI, some critics argued that the intelligence community lacked a rigorous system to establish priorities and to shape the intelligence budgets to meet those priorities. The intelligence community at the time was overseen by the Director of Central Intelligence, who also served as the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and who many argue was too focused on the CIA, to the detriment of his broader duties. This by some accounts made it difficult to adapt to the new fiscal realities of the 1990s when spending fell in response to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. ", "A 1996 report from the Council on Foreign Relations questioned the role of intelligence community management in priority setting, stating that, \"Intelligence requirements are most often set by intelligence producers or by relatively junior officials in the policymaking departments.\" The 1996 Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence Community found that not only were requirements often set by lower level staff, but any guidance from the DCI may often have come too late in the process to affect program priorities:", "The [Director of Central intelligence] is charged by law to \"provide guidance to elements of the Intelligence Community for the preparation of their annual budgets.\" Usually, this guidance is issued by the DCI's staff or jointly with the Office of the Secretary of Defense after an overall level of funding has been decided by the Secretary of Defense and the DCI, and takes into account presidentially directed needs and priorities, statements of national security strategy, analyses of intelligence \"gaps\" and future needs, and other pertinent direction. Often, however, this guidance comes after the program and budget process has begun, and the program managers have already incorporated their own assumptions about intelligence requirements into budget estimates.", "Similarly, a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) report from 1996 referred to a problem of the \"tail trying to wag the dog,\" with respect to the intelligence budget process, meaning that community-level staff would compile the budget proposals of different agencies but exercised little oversight or control over those budgets. Thus, individual intelligence community components were able to establish their intelligence priorities and to shape their budgets to meet those priorities without effective overall rationalization of effort. Some observers believed the community-level staff under the DCI lacked sufficient authority and insight into the budget of individual agencies while others believed the DCI had significant budgetary authority that he never used effectively.", "In part because of the concerns above, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created the DNI and arguably expanded its budgetary authorities beyond those previously possessed by the DCI. While the act stated that the DNI would \"develop and determine an annual consolidated National Intelligence Budget,\" that language almost matched the budget formulation authorities granted to the DCI. However, the 2004 law also granted the DNI additional reprogramming authority and the means to monitor and execute the NIP, authorities the DCI lacked.

The DNI Chief Financial Officer is responsible for ensuring that NIP resources are allocated towards priorities identified in the NIPF. However, some have questioned the effectiveness of this process. Ambassador Robert Hutchings, the chairman of the DNI's National Intelligence Council from 2003 to 2005, stated in a 2007 hearing before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the NIPF was \"little more than diplomatic or bureaucratic busywork.\" A point to stress is that there is little publicly available information that would help corroborate or refute the Ambassador's claim.

The other problem was that there was not sufficient emphasis on intelligence matters by the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee because they had a lot of other things to do.", "Opponents argued that the proposal did not significantly change the previously existing structure: \"Rather than consolidating oversight authority into a single committee that has both authorizing and appropriating authority, it just creates a new committee that has neither, doesn't have either of those powers.\"", "In July 2008, the chairman of the panel, Representative Rush Holt, described the panel's recommendations to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, claiming that \"in the course of a year and [a] half since the creation of this Panel we have directly influenced the intelligence fund for five bills. Three of these bills were supplemental appropriations and this is the second annual appropriations bill that we have acted upon.\" He indicated that the panel forwarded recommendations higher than the previous year's levels but lower than the Administration's request. The panel's recommendations sought, he maintained, to require the ODNI to better manage the budget and enhance the role of Congress in reviewing the budget request and overseeing the DNI's performance. Rush argued: \"One of the problems of past Congressional oversight has been that the Intelligence Community was forced to cut or add programs based on the changing whims of Congress. The creation of this Panel and stronger budgetary oversight over intelligence programs will hopefully provide stability for our nation's intelligence professionals.\" Representative Holt also noted that the panel recommended changes to space programs and encouraged a robust investment in foreign language training.", "In January 2011, the 112 th Congress eliminated the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel in H.Res. 5 . In March 2011, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Representative Mike Rogers, announced a plan to permit three members of the Appropriations Committee to participate in House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearings and briefings. The goal of the initiative, according to Representative Rogers, was to \"knit together the Intelligence Committee with the Appropriators and ... allow key appropriators important insights into the intelligence committee which they fund.\" The proposal did not, however, change the responsibilities of the two committees.", "Senate Initiatives", "The Senate also recognized the need to respond to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. In January 2004, the Senate adopted S.Res. 445 to improve the effectiveness of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and for other purposes. Section 402 of the resolution, which passed by a vote of 79-6-15, established a Subcommittee on Intelligence within the Senate Appropriations Committee \"as soon as possible after the convening of the 109 th Congress.\" S.Res. 445 did not, however, actually constitute a change to the Senate Rules, and the 109 th Congress reshuffled appropriations subcommittees and jurisdictions without creating a subcommittee on intelligence. ", "In considering intelligence authorization in 2009, however, the Senate returned to the issue. The Intelligence Committee reported its version of FY2010 authorization legislation, S. 1494 , which included a provision (Section 341) to express the sense of the Senate that a Subcommittee on Intelligence should be established within the Committee on Appropriations with the responsibility for approving an annual appropriations bill for the National Intelligence Program that would be considered by the full Appropriations Committee \"without intervening review by any other subcommittee.\" The intelligence subcommittee would, however, automatically include the chairman and ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Defense. This provision was the subject of conversations between the chair of the Intelligence Committee and the ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee, and Section 341 was dropped from the bill before it passed the Senate by unanimous consent on September 16, 2009. (The provision was not included in the final version of the FY2010 Intelligence Authorization Act, P.L. 111-259 , that was eventually enacted in October 2010.)", "During consideration of S.Res. 445 and on other occasions, it was argued that it would be difficult to create a subcommittee with a classified budget. The actions taken by the Senate reflect the fact that classification has always been a key consideration in the congressional approach to intelligence appropriations. There has been little public discussion of the extent to which other factors relating to subcommittees' jurisdiction may have been important."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
