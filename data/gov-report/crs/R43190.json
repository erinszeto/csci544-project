It is anticipated that the 113th Congress may continue to work on ESEA reauthorization issues. As part of the reauthorization debate, Congress has focused on the federal role in education, particularly in the area of educational accountability, where federal efforts to hold states, local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools accountable for student achievement and teacher performance are being discussed. In these discussions, issues related to the burden that complying with the statutory and regulatory reporting requirements associated with the ESEA have put on state educational agencies (SEAs), LEAs, and schools have been considered.", "While the burden hours and annualized costs (also referred to as cost burden) associated with ESEA reporting requirements have clearly increased since the enactment of NCLB, it is important to highlight that the data collected and reported play an important role in supporting core components of the federal education policies enacted through NCLB. SEAs, LEAs, and schools use such data to gauge student performance and determine the progress schools are making in enhancing student academic achievement. Parents use these data to inform choices about their child's education, and the U.S. Department of Education (ED) uses these data to inform technical assistance efforts and monitor SEA work in a number of areas in which educational accountability is expected under the provisions of NCLB.", "This report was undertaken in response to concerns about state and local reporting burdens having increased in recent years since the enactment of NCLB. It examines the time and cost burden associated with complying with the ESEA statutory and regulatory reporting requirements associated with 16 information collection packages. For each information collection package, information is included on the purpose of the collection and data are provided on burden hours and cost burden as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act. There is also a discussion of the current annualized cost to the federal government for each of the information collection packages. Finally, a more detailed analysis is provided for the information collection package that accounts for the largest number of the burden hours and largest cost burden of all the information collection packages examined. Currently, for respondents at the state and local levels, the overall annualized estimate of burden hours per information collection package ranges from 200 hours to 4.7 million hours and the estimated annualized cost associated with the information collection packages ranges from $6,000 to $118.1 million per information collection package.", "Respondents to the 16 information collection packages include SEAs, LEAs, schools, parents, and other entities. The average number of estimated annualized burden hours and estimated annualized cost burden is generally spread across numerous respondents, and the burden placed on an individual respondent for a given information collection package varies. Within information collections there can be substantial variation in the number of underlying reporting requirements or activities that are applicable to a given type of respondent. For a given type of respondent within a single information collection package, the respondent may not have to address every item on a given information collection package, and the cost of responding to the information collection package may vary by item (e.g., the hourly cost of responding to one item may be different than the cost of responding to another item). For example, for the \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" (accountability issues) information collection package, there are three types of activities or information that schools may need to address. On average, the annualized burden for each of these requirements ranges from 4.8 to 960 burden hours and from $120 to $24,000 per school. While some schools will not need to address any of the requirements, others may need to address one or two requirements.", "Of the information collection packages examined in this report, the \"State Educational Agency, Local Education Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA, Title I, Part A\" information collection package, which focuses on Title I-A accountability requirements that are a core component of the federal education policy incorporated in NCLB, has the largest number of estimated annualized burden hours (4.7 million) and greatest estimated annualized costs ($118.1 million). The burden associated with this information collection package has increased substantially since the enactment of NCLB. For example, the overall number of estimated annualized burden hours for the information collection package prior to the enactment of NCLB was about 564,000 hours. Following the enactment of NCLB, the number of estimated annualized burden hours increased by over 350% to about 2.6 million hours. The number of estimated annualized burden hours associated with this package peaked at 7.9 million burden hours. The most recent version of the information collection package, however, includes an expected decline of about 3.2 million (40%) burden hours from the peak level. The changes over time in the estimated annualized cost associated with this package mirror those for the changes in burden hours, peaking at an estimated $169.4 million. The most recent version of the information collection package expects the estimated annualized cost to decrease $51.4 million (30.3%) from the peak level. ED indicated that the decline in burden hours and cost burden is directly related to 43 SEAs having requested or indicated that they will request the ESEA flexibility package being offered to states by the Administration, which provides waivers of several of the Title I-A accountability requirements included in current law. It is unknown whether the reductions in burden hours and cost burden attributed to the ESEA flexibility package will be realized. As of August 21, 2013, ED had approved ESEA flexibility packages for 41 states and the District of Columbia, as well as for a consortium of eight LEAs in California."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress has been actively engaged in efforts to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), most recently amended by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; P.L. 107-110 ).

On June 12, 2013, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee considered and ordered reported the Strengthening America's Schools Act ( S. 1094 ) by a strictly partisan vote of 12-10. The House Education and Workforce Committee also considered and ordered reported a bill that would reauthorize the ESEA. On June 19, 2013, on a strictly partisan vote of 23-16, the Success for All Students Act ( H.R. 5 ) was ordered reported. H.R. 5 was subsequently considered and amended on the House floor. The amended version of H.R. 5 was passed on July 19, 2013, by a vote of 221-207.

In these discussions, issues related to the burden that complying with the statutory and regulatory reporting requirements associated with the ESEA have put on state educational agencies (SEAs), LEAs, and schools have been considered. For example, the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education of the House Education and the Workforce Committee held a hearing in 2011 specifically focused on these issues. In addition, in response to a congressional request, the Government Accountability Office found that states and LEAs cited data collection and reporting as being among the most burdensome of elementary and secondary education requirements.", "The NCLB included a set of accountability based reforms that are inherently reliant on testing, data collection, and data reporting. For example, without the data collection and reporting associated with Title I-A, Education for the Disadvantaged, it would not be possible to determine how well schools, LEAs, or SEAs were performing with respect to improving student achievement for all students, including minority students, English language learners, students from low-income families, and students with disabilities. In addition, it would not be possible to implement the outcome based accountability requirements that are associated with schools and LEAs failing to make adequate yearly progress for a certain number of years if various data collection and reporting requirements were not in place. As many of these accountability based requirements were either implemented for the first time or enhanced through the enactment of NCLB, it may be no surprise that the burden associated with ESEA data collection and reporting, particularly with respect to Title I-A, has increased over time. In other instances, burden is created when states and other entities must apply to receive federal funding or report on the use of federal education funds received. Without this information, however, it could be difficult for the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to award funds to grantees or for ED or Congress to perform oversight functions related to the provision of federal education funds.", "This report was undertaken in response to concerns about state and local reporting burden having increased in recent years since the enactment of NCLB. It examines the hour and cost burden associated with complying with the ESEA statutory and regulatory reporting requirements associated with 16 information collection packages. In general, there are two ways to measure the burden associated with an information collection package. Federal paperwork is frequently measured in terms of burden hours, which measure in hours the estimated amount of time that would be required to complete the paperwork. Agencies also measure paperwork in terms of dollars (cost burden), which include the annualized costs associated with the hour burden.", "The first part of the report includes key findings and discusses the methodology used to conduct the analysis and the scope of the analysis.

The next part of the report analyzes the number of respondents, burden hours, and cost burden associated with each of the information collection packages. This discussion is followed by an examination of the federal costs associated with each information collection package. The last part of the report provides a detailed analysis of the burden hours and cost burden associated with the \"State Educational Agency, Local Education Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA, Title I, Part A (accountability issues)\" information collection package, including an analysis of this package both pre- and post-NCLB enactment.

Appendix B provides a copy of the \"Supporting Statement for Paperwork Reduction Act Submission,\" which is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) when a federal agency makes an information collection request (ICR) (e.g., new collection, revision, extension, no substantial change) for OMB approval. Appendix C provides a description of the statutory and regulatory requirements associated with the \"State Educational Agency, Local Education Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA, Title I, Part A (accountability issues)\" information collection package."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Findings in Brief", "paragraphs": ["Below is a summary of key findings from the analysis of the 16 information collection packages included in this report. ", "Across all respondents (i.e., SEAs, LEAs, schools, and other entities), the estimated annualized state and local aggregate annual burden hours associated with responding to each of the 16 information collection packages examined ranged from 200 hours to 4.7 million hours, while the estimated annualized cost of responding ranged from $6,000 to $118.1 million. One information collection package, \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" (accountability issues), had both the highest number of estimated annualized burden hours and highest annualized cost burden. Respondents to the 16 information collection packages include SEAs, LEAs, schools, parents, and other entities. The average number of estimated annualized burden hours and estimated annualized cost burden is generally spread across numerous respondents, and the burden placed on an individual respondent for a given information collection package varies. Within information collections there can be substantial variation in the number of underlying reporting requirements or activities that are applicable to a given type of respondent. For a given type of respondent within a single information collection package, the respondent may not have to address every item on a given information collection package, and the cost of responding to the information collection package may vary by item (e.g., the hourly cost of responding to one item may be different than the cost of responding to another item). For example, for the \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" (accountability issues) information collection package, there are three types of activities or information that schools may need to address. On average, the annualized burden for each of these activities ranges from 4.8 to 960 burden hours and from $120 to $24,000 per school. While some schools will not need to address any of the requirements, others may need to address one or two requirements. Federal agencies are required to provide an estimate of the annualized cost to the federal government. This estimate must include expenses that would not have been incurred without the collection of information, such as agency review of applications, peer review, monitoring and oversight, collection and analysis of data, and guidance development. Estimated annualized federal costs for each of the 16 collections ranged from $0 to $3.1 million. The information collection package with the largest estimated aggregate burden hours and cost burden is \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" (accountability issues) with an estimated 4,710,525 burden hours and an estimated cost of $118,075,705. The purpose of this information collection package, in part, is to meet the Title I-A requirements that SEAs, LEAs, and schools collect and disseminate information to document progress and inform parents and the public about school, LEA, and state educational performance. This information is used to hold schools, LEAs, and states accountable for student performance in accordance with the underlying policies incorporated into the NCLB. For example, identifying achievement and graduation rate gaps between groups of students and then implementing a series of outcome based accountability requirements based on these results necessitates the collection of numerous pieces of data. For the information collection package with the largest estimated aggregate burden hours and cost burden, \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" (accountability issues), a more detailed analysis was completed to examine how the burden has changed over time with the enactment of NCLB. The overall number of estimated annualized burden hours for the information collection package prior to the enactment of the NCLB was about 564,000. Following the enactment of the NCLB, the estimated annualized burden hours associated with this information collection package peaked at 7.9 million hours (an increase in burden hours of almost 1,300%). In the most recently approved version of the information collection package, ED estimates that the annualized burden hours will decline by about 3.2 million hours (40%) due primarily to new flexibility being offered to SEAs by the Administration with respect to Title I-A accountability requirements. Mirroring the increase in burden hours, the estimated annualized cost burden associated with the \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" (accountability issues) information collection package also increased as the NCLB requirements were implemented, peaking at $169.4 million. As with the burden hours, ED estimates that the annualized cost burden will decline by $51.4 million (30%) as a result of new Title I-A flexibility.", "While the hour and cost burdens associated with ESEA reporting requirements have clearly increased since the enactment of NCLB, it is important to highlight that the data collected and reported play an important role in supporting core components of the federal education policies enacted through NCLB.

The aggregate burden hours for the Migrant Education package also includes contractor hours, but the costs associated with these hours are apparently included in the federal costs for the information collection (see Table 6 ).

However, on an average per respondent basis, SEAs may have higher estimated annualized burden hours and cost burden than other types of respondents to the same information collection package. This is due to the fact that there are generally only 52 LEAs (or fewer) responding to a given information collection package, while there may be thousands of other entities (e.g., schools, LEAs, parents) also responding, so the larger overall estimates of annualized burden hours and cost burden for these respondents are divided among a larger group of respondents.

The performance standards were required to establish three performance levels for all students\u2014advanced, proficient, and partially proficient.

The assessment system had to be capable of producing results for each state, LEA, and school that could be disaggregated by gender, major racial and ethnic groups, English proficiency status, migrant status, disability status, and economically disadvantaged status. These data were to be included in annual school profiles. Effectiveness was based on whether schools and LEAs were making \"adequate yearly progress\" (AYP) toward meeting the content and performance standards.

Beginning with the 2007-2008 school year, such assessments were also required to be administered to students in each of three grade levels (3-5, 6-9, and 10-12) in science. The results of the required reading and math assessments are used to make annual AYP determinations. AYP standards must be applied to all public schools, LEAs, and to states overall and reported on annual public report cards. AYP is defined primarily on the basis of the percentage of students scoring at a proficient or higher level of achievement. AYP standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator; in the case of high schools, this must be the graduation rate.

When Title I-A schools do not make AYP for two or more consecutive years, they become subject to a range of increasingly severe performance-based accountability requirements, which are coupled with technical assistance provided by the LEA. For example, the ESEA requires states to identify LEAs and schools that fail to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years for improvement. Students attending these schools must be provided with options to attend other public schools that make AYP. If a Title I-A school fails to meet AYP standards for a third year, students from low-income families must be offered the opportunity to receive instruction from a supplemental educational services (SES) provider of their choice. Title I-A schools that fail to meet AYP for a fourth year must take one or more additional \"corrective actions,\" such as implementing a new curriculum. Those that fail to meet AYP standards for a fifth year must develop a \"restructuring\" plan, involving such actions as reopening as a charter school. If a school fails to make AYP for a sixth year, the school must implement its restructuring plan. Procedures analogous to those for schools apply to LEAs that receive Title I-A grants and fail to meet AYP requirements.

That is, schools in states with approved applications for the ESEA flexibility package no longer have to determine whether a school should be identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring, and they are no longer required to implement the specific actions that are associated with each of these levels of identification. Thus, for example, schools are no longer identified for improvement and, therefore, do not have to write school improvement plans, states no longer have to identify SES providers, and parents no longer need to be notified whether their child is eligible for SES or public school choice.", "However, in return for receiving the waivers of existing accountability requirements, states are required to comply with the aforementioned principles established by ED. For example, states, LEAs, and schools must comply with prescribed interventions for the lowest performing 5% of schools (referred to as \"priority schools\" for the purposes of the ESEA flexibility package) and must implement some type of intervention in the next lowest performing 10% of schools (referred to as \"focus schools\" for purposes of the ESEA flexibility package). The outcome accountability requirements that currently apply to all Title I-A schools that fail to meet AYP are replaced by more prescriptive requirements for priority schools and a requirement for non-specified interventions to be implemented in focus schools.

For example, data must still be reported on the achievement of student subgroups. However, if an SEA created a \"super subgroup\" (e.g., a subgroup comprised of the 25% lowest performing students in a school), data on that subgroup must also be reported on SEA and LEA report cards, unless the number of students in the subgroup is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student. In addition, SEAs that receive the ESEA flexibility package must also report data on college-going (e.g., number of students who enroll in an institution of higher education within 16 months of earning a regular high school diploma) and college credit accumulation data.

The latter change was due primarily to updated estimates of the time needed for the implementation of statutory requirements related to school improvement and notification of public school choice and SES, as well as to comply with regulatory requirements related to limited English proficient students and requirements related to the preparation of SEA and LEA report cards. For the information collection expiring October 31, 2011, the increase in burden hours was attributed to agency discretion. It was estimated that SEAs and LEAs would need more time to address amended regulations, which included additional data for report cards and cohort documentation related to high school graduation rates. The last increase in estimated annualized burden hours (information collection package expiring April 30, 2012) was also attributed to agency discretion to move hours attributed to a different data collection focused on flexibility to this information collection package.

As previously discussed, under the ESEA flexibility package, LEAs and schools no longer have to be identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. Thus, fewer SEAs, LEAs, and schools will be required to implement the outcome accountability actions that correspond to each of these levels of identification. For example, LEAs in states that receive the ESEA flexibility package will no longer have to notify parents about the opportunity for public school choice or SES, and SEAs will no longer have to identify and evaluate SES providers (unless the SEA opted to continue these practices).

Moreover, many of the innovations and reforms currently underway in many States and districts were not anticipated when NCLB was enacted nearly a decade ago. While NCLB helped SEAs and LEAs shine a bright light on the achievement gap and increased accountability for groups of high-need students, it inadvertently encouraged some States to set low academic standards, failed to recognize or reward growth in student learning, and did little to elevate the teaching profession or recognize the most effective teachers. Instead of fostering progress and accelerating academic improvement, many NCLB requirements have unintentionally become barriers to State and local implementation of forward-looking reforms designed to raise academic achievement.

After the agency develops an information collection that it wishes to implement, it publishes a Federal Register notice about the proposed information collection and provides the public with 60 days to provide comment on the proposed collection. The agency then considers the public's comments, makes changes as appropriate to address concerns raised by the public, submits the ICR to OMB for review, and publishes a second Federal Register notice announcing the start of OMB's review. The second notice provides the public with an additional 30 days to provide comments. After reviewing the ICR and considering public comments, OIRA concludes its review by approving the collection or taking other actions. The designations that OIRA can assign to a collection are approval, improperly submitted, withdrawn, and disapproval. Once an information collection is approved, OIRA assigns it an OMB Control Number. Using the OMB Control Number, one can locate and examine information collection packages in OIRA's Inventory of Currently Approved Collections.

This justification should include the reasons why the agency considers the questions necessary, the specific uses to be made of the information, the explanation to be given to persons from whom the information is requested, and any steps to be taken to obtain their consent.", "Q12. Provide estimates of the hour burden of the collection of information. The statement should :", "Indicate the number of respondents, frequency of response, annual hour burden, and an explanation of how the burden was estimated. Unless directed to do so, agencies should not conduct special surveys to obtain information on which to base hour burden estimates. Consultation with a sample (fewer than 10) of potential respondents is desirable. If the hour burden on respondents is expected to vary widely because of differences in activity, size, or complexity, show the range of estimated hour burden, and explain the reasons for the variance. Generally, estimates should not include burden hours for customary and usual business practices. If this request for approval covers more than one form, provide separate hour burden estimates for each form and aggregate the hour burdens in Item 13 of OMB Form 83-I. Provide estimates of annualized cost to respondents of the hour burdens for collections of information, identifying and using appropriate wage rate categories. The cost of contracting out or paying outside parties for information collection activities should not be included here. Instead, this cost should be included in Item 14.", "Q13. Provide an estimate of the total annual cost burden to respondents or record keepers resulting from the collection of information. (Do not include the cost of any hour burden shown in Items 12 and 14.)", "The cost estimate should be split into two components: (a) a total capital and start-up cost component (annualized over its expected useful life); and (b) a total operation and maintenance and purchase of services component. The estimates should take into account costs associated with generating, maintaining, and disclosing or providing the information. Include descriptions of methods used to estimate major cost factors including system and technology acquisition, expected useful life of capital equipment, the discount rate(s), and the time period over which costs will be incurred. Capital and start-up costs include, among other items, preparations for collecting information such as purchasing computers and software; monitoring, sampling, drilling and testing equipment; and record storage facilities. If cost estimates are expected to vary widely, agencies should present ranges of cost burdens and explain the reasons for the variance. The cost of contracting out information collection services should be a part of this cost burden estimate. In developing cost burden estimates, agencies may consult with a sample of respondents (fewer than 10), utilize the 60-day pre-OMB submission public comment process and use existing economic or regulatory impact analysis associated with the rulemaking containing the information collection, as appropriate. Generally, estimates should not include purchases of equipment or services, or portions thereof, made: (1) prior to October 1, 1995, (2) to achieve regulatory compliance with requirements not associated with the information collection, (3) for reasons other than to provide information or keep records for the government, or (4) as part of customary and usual business or private practices.", "Q14. Provide estimates of annualized cost to the Federal government. Also, provide a description of the method used to estimate cost, which should include quantification of hours, operational expenses (such as equipment, overhead, printing, and support staff), and any other expense that would not have been incurred without this collection of information. Agencies also may aggregate cost estimates from Items 12, 13, and 14 in a single table .", "Q15. Explain the reasons for any program changes or adjustments reported in Items 13 or 14 of the OMB Form 83-I.", "Q16. For collections of information whose results will be published, outline plans for tabulation and publication. Address any complex analytical techniques that will be used. Provide the time schedule for the entire project, including beginning and ending dates of the collection of information, completion of report, publication dates, and other actions.", "Q17. If seeking approval to not display the expiration date for OMB approval of the information collection, explain the reasons that display would be inappropriate.", "Q18. Explain each exception to the certification statement identified in Item 20, \"Certification for Paperwork Reduction Act Submissions,\" of OMB Form 83-I.", "Appendix C. Description of Statutory and Regulatory Requirements Associated with the Title\u00a0I-A Accountability Issues Information Collection Package", "In the Supporting Statement accompanying the State Educational Agency and Local Educational Agency and School Data Collection and Reporting under ESEA, Title I, Part A (accountability issues) information collection package, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) provides an accounting of the statutory and regulatory requirements associated with the information collection package and the related burden on state educational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools. The specific statutory and regulatory requirements and ED's description of these requirements is included in Table C-1 ."], "subsections": []}]}}
