The application of veterans' preference depends on the assessment procedure being used. When applicants are assessed using category rating, a process that assigns applicants to quality categories (e.g., minimally qualified, well qualified, and highest qualified), preference is applied by moving an eligible veteran to the top of the category for which he or she qualifies or, in some cases, to the top of the highest quality category. When applicants are assessed using numerical rating, preference is applied by adding extra points to a veteran candidate's assessed score.", "Veterans' preference also has a role in the selection process. In cases where a preference eligible is among the highest-ranked candidates and therefore eligible for selection, the selecting official must either (1) select the preference eligible or (2) pass over the preference eligible by disqualifying the preference eligible.", "In FY2016, the most recent year for which data are available, veterans with preference made up 28% of nonseasonal, full-time, permanent federal employees.
