Since 1922, U.S. law and foreign policy have favored applying tariffs and duties equally to all trading partners. This principle, known as most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment, has been central to the rules-based global trading system since 1947.", "One of the most frequently invoked exceptions to MFN treatment are three \"trade remedy\" laws. These laws are enforced primarily through administrative investigations of two U.S. government agencies: the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce (ITA) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). Trade remedy laws enable the United States to impose additional duties aimed at specific producers or countries to remedy unfair trade practices and to help domestic industries adjust to sudden surges of fairly traded goods. The three types of laws traditionally classified as \"trade remedies\" are:", "Antidumping (AD) laws provide relief to domestic industries that have been, or are threatened with, material injury caused by imported goods sold in the U.S. market at prices that are shown to be less than fair market value. The relief provided is an additional import duty placed on the dumped imports based upon calculations made by the ITA. Antidumping orders are the most frequently used and the most controversial trade remedy.", "Countervailing duty (CVD) laws give a similar kind of relief to domestic industries that have been, or are threatened with, material injury caused by imported goods that have been found to have received WTO-inconsistent government subsidies, and can therefore be sold at lower prices than similar goods produced in the United States. The relief provided is an additional import duty placed on the subsidized imports.", "Safeguard (also referred to as escape clause) laws give domestic industries relief from surges of imported goods that are fairly traded if serious injury is found or is threatened to the domestic industry. The most frequently applied safeguard law, Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, is designed to give domestic industry the opportunity to adjust to the new competition and remain competitive. The relief provided is generally an additional temporary import duty, a temporary import quota, or a combination of both. Safeguard laws also require presidential action in order for relief to be put into effect.", "Economists have generally seen antidumping laws and policies as economically inefficient. Some, however, have acknowledged the role that these economically inefficient policies have played in making trade liberalization more politically feasible by providing protection for industries that might otherwise oppose such measures. In recent years, U.S. exports have increasingly become a target of AD measures by several major emerging economies, including India and China. Antidumping laws and policies have also been at the center of dozens of trade disputes between the United States and its trading partners in the WTO. Reports issued by the WTO's Appellate Body (AB) on the subject have been one of the primary targets of the U.S. Trade Representative's criticisms of the AB mechanism in the broader WTO dispute settlement system. If Congress wishes to maintain a functional dispute settlement system at the WTO it may consider either directing the President to seek amendments to underlying WTO agreements such that U.S. practices are internationally compliant or direct the ITA to bring its AD policies into conformity with the AB's interpretation of the WTO's Antidumping Agreement."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In general, the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which the United States is a member, require each member to apply tariffs and duties equally to all other members.

The controlling international agreement in the World Trade Organization (WTO) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Antidumping Agreement (ADA) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 defines dumping as the introduction of a product \"into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value, if the export price of the product exported from one country to another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country.\" U.S. law similarly defines dumping as the \"sale or likely sale of goods [in the United States] at less than fair value,\" with the fair value defined as \"the price at which the foreign like product is first sold \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for consumption in the exporting country.\" Simply put, dumping is the sale of goods abroad for less than the price the goods would have commanded in the home market. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Origins of Dumping and Antidumping", "paragraphs": ["Economists have long written about the practice of selling exports for a lower price than in the home market. In 1776, Adam Smith noted the practice by manufacturers to export some of their surplus goods for sale at a loss for the purpose of \"[doubling] the price of their goods in the home market.\" Several years later, Alexander Hamilton expressed concern with the practice and its potential to stymie the development of domestic industry. However, such mentions were sporadic and generally isolated to economic treatises. ", "As more countries industrialized in the late-nineteenth century, exporting goods for a price below the price that could be commanded in the domestic market (whether at a loss or not) became an economic strategy used to maintain domestic prices while establishing footholds in foreign markets. The expansion of these practices resulted in more sustained scholarly and political attention\u00e2\u0080\u0094not all negative. In 1880, for example, the U.S. Secretary of State encouraged cotton manufacturers to \"sacrifice profits for a time, if necessary, to secure trade-standing in \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 several markets.\" Twenty-five years later, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor was still dispensing similar advice to manufacturers. ", "Because of this strategic deployment of dumping, and the reemergence of state-directed trade policies at the turn of the twentieth century, politicians and the public (if not always the economists) began to argue that the practice was unfair. Accusations of using foreign markets as \"dumping-grounds\" became frequent and the term \"dumping\" to describe the practice of selling surplus goods abroad at a lower price began to be used more frequently. British industrialists protested dumping from German and French manufacturers, while Canadian millers grumbled about the dumping of American steel. While accusations of dumping were common, the actual prevalence of the practice is hard to calculate, in part because there was no administrative apparatus to investigate such complaints. Nevertheless, experts generally agree that there was, in fact, at least a modest increase in the practice.", "There were several possible causes for whatever dumping existed at the time. First, higher tariffs in general encouraged the practice. As a leading scholar of antidumping has argued, \"These tariffs provided national firms the opportunity to price monopolistically at home and at the same time protected them from reimports of goods they sold competitively abroad.\" Other observers have noted that dumping was, in some respects, a natural development of trade in industrially advanced countries as large manufacturers attempted to offset changes in domestic demand by selling large surpluses abroad.", "During the first decades of the twentieth century, countries began to take action to prevent dumping or, at least, protect their domestic industries from dumping. In 1904, Canada enacted the world's first modern antidumping (AD) law. By 1921, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, France, Japan, the United States, and Britain had proposed or enacted AD statutes or other legislation giving administrative officials discretion to alter tariffs in response to influxes of goods at abnormally low prices. Many of the statutes, including the American, were modeled on the Canadian law. The Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations Secretariat (the precursor to the United Nations) also commissioned studies on the issue to survey AD legislation and see if there was a need for international regulation.", "U.S. AD law had precursors in late-nineteenth-century antitrust legislation. Some early observers argued that dumping was a strategy used to injure or hinder development and maintain monopolistic dominance over foreign countries. In 1916, Congress passed the Antidumping Act, which imposed criminal and civil penalties on any person importing and selling articles in the United States \"at a price substantially less than the actual market value or wholesale price of such articles\" so long as they had the intent of injuring or preventing the establishment of an industry in the United States. The law was rarely applied, in part because it was difficult to prove such an intent.", "U.S. antidumping law took its modern form with the passage of the Antidumping Act of 1921, which adopted a more globally common administrative (rather than judicial) procedure that enabled the imposition of additional duties on imports rather than civil or criminal penalties (as the antitrust branch of legislation had). ", "The Antidumping Act of 1921 became the textual basis for Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, the multilateral trade agreement that established the post-World War II rules-based trading system and which was later incorporated into the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements. As such, the U.S. model of antidumping has become the global standard.", "Since 1921, Congress has amended and adjusted U.S. antidumping law many times, but has maintained the basic administrative framework and Article VI was clarified and amended by the ADA as part of the establishment of the WTO in 1995.

The ITA will aggregate hundreds or even thousands of individual transactions together in this process. The amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price of a given product is the dumping margin. However, if the export price exceeds the normal value (that is, if the price in the United States is greater than the domestic price) and thus produces a negative result, the United States, in certain circumstances, will adjust the negative values to zero. As an economist at the Department of Justice put it, \"The use of 'zeroing' will almost always increase the level of any antidumping duty, and will sometimes create a duty where none would have been imposed, had the methodology not been used.\"", "Consider the following simplified example: the average home market price and export price for a product for the entire month were both $100. As such, the dumping margin and weighted average dumping margin when averaged without zeroing were both zero because the transaction on September 7, for example, was offset by the transaction on September 25. However, when zeroing is applied, the September 25 transaction is set to zero. When this is applied across all values, the aggregate dumping margin is $55 leading to a weighted average dumping margin of 7.85%. One pair of economists determined in 2010 that if the United States were to stop zeroing, \"then perhaps as much as half of all U.S. AD measures would be removed and the duties in the other cases would fall significantly.\"", "The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) asserts that this method allows the United States to \"focus on those transactions in which dumping occurs.\" Under the relevant WTO agreements, the USTR argues, \"Members may calculate a margin of dumping on a transaction-by-transaction basis, and, thus, collect duties only on dumped imports, while collecting no duties on non-dumped imports. There is no requirement to offset dumped transactions with transactions in which dumping did not occur.\" The U.S. Trade Representative has asserted that this is a common-sense method of calculating the extent of dumping that is injuring a domestic industry\" and that the elimination of zeroing \"artificially reduces the margin of dumping,\"", "Opponents of zeroing argue that its effect is to artificially increase dumping margins and increase the likelihood that AD measures will be imposed. Specific concerns include that \"zeroing makes it extremely difficult for a firm to avoid dumping\" because the reasons for price variation, such as seasonality, exchange rates, and variations in shipping costs, are not taken into account. As a result, products subject to greater price variation will be more frequently subject to AD duties. As the United States is the only country to actively zero, it seems unlikely that zeroing is strictly necessary to ensure that AD policy is effective at preventing dumping. One economist estimated in 2008 that \"zeroing could add perhaps 3-4 % to the typical U.S. antidumping duty with a cost to the U.S. of around $150 million per year when all existing U.S. antidumping orders were determined by zeroing.\"", "Since 1995, more than 30 Panel and Appellate Body (AB) decisions have found the use of zeroing in specific AD investigations to be inconsistent with the ADA; the AB has held more than a dozen times that zeroing in one form or another cannot be used. In all but two cases involving zeroing, the United States has been the respondent. In two early cases, the EU was the respondent, but it changed its practices after the AB found its implementation of the practice to be inconsistent with the terms of the ADA. ", "The United States has been a respondent in more than 150 disputes before the WTO. Fifty-six of those involved the ADA and many of those cases involved zeroing. In all the finalized cases, the United States lost or settled. Indeed, CRS analysis has found that nearly half of all cases where the WTO found a U.S. practice to not be in compliance with WTO obligations involved dumping.", "Much of the U.S. criticism levied at the WTO's AB over the past decade, some have argued, has been primarily the result of cases involving U.S. implementation of the ADA. In a recent report listing U.S. concerns about the AB, the USTR identified six areas of \"Appellate Body errors in interpreting WTO agreements\" that it argues have \"raised substantive concerns and undermine the WTO.\" Five of the six concerned trade remedies, including dumping. Indeed, \"dump\" was the most common trade-related verb in the report. With respect to zeroing, the USTR argues, \"The Appellate Body's invention of a prohibition on the use of \"zeroing\" to determine dumping margins has diminished the ability of WTO members to address dumped imports that cause or threaten injury to a domestic industry.\"", "The WTO AB's approach to trade remedies in general, and antidumping in particular, have been central in USTR's critique of the AB and thus has likely played a significant role in its decision to block appointments to the AB. However, WTO DSB debates are not over. The USTR has approvingly cited a recent DSB decision that upheld the use of zeroing in certain limited circumstances.", "As Congress considers the future U.S. relationship with the WTO and the multilateral rules-based trading order, it might address the role that antidumping has played in straining that relationship. For example, Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expires in 2021. Should Congress decide to reauthorize TPA, it may choose to direct the President to seek revisions to the WTO's DSU of the ADA to address some of these issues. Alternatively, Congress could encourage or direct Commerce to address some of the WTO members' and Appellate Body's concerns. For example, the EU and Canada once employed zeroing in antidumping investigations, but no longer do so."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
