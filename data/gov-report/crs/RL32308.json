Instead, it provided $101.7 million for FY2005. Of this amount, $51.7million was made available from the airport and airway trust fund, with $14 millionto come from prior year carry over funds, and the remaining $36 million to comefrom other funds available to the FAA.

The House began toconsider the measure on September 14, 2004 and passed it eight days later by a voteof 397-12.", "In its report on H.R. 5025 , the Appropriations Committee issued what might be construed as a stern rebuke to the department for creating a new officefor combating terrorist financing and other financial crimes (OTFI). The Committeecharged that \"this action is completely contrary to the direction of the 2004appropriation\" and noted that it has received neither \"adequate information on anynew terrorism office\" nor an \"official budget amendment from the administration.\"", "Under H.R. 5025 , as passed by the House, Treasury would receive $11.247 billion in funding in FY2005, or $147.1 million more than FY2004 but$362.9 million less than the amount requested by the Bush Administration forFY2005. The IRS would receive the vast majority of the appropriated funds: $10.292 billion, or 92% of recommended appropriations for Treasury in FY2005. While such a budget was $107.3 million above the amount appropriated for the IRSin FY2004, it is $382.5 million below what the Administration requested forFY2005. (More details on the budget for IRS in FY2004 and FY2005 can be foundin the next section.) H.R. 5025 would also provide $177.0 million infunding for Treasury's departmental offices (or $1.9 million more than FY2004 but$8.0 million less than the amount the Bush Administration requested for FY2005),of which $21.8 million was designated for the operations of OFAC; $36.1 million forthe Treasury's systems and capital investments program (or $113,000 less thanFY2004 but identical to the amount requested for FY2005); $16.5 million forTreasury's Office of Inspector General (or $3.6 million more than FY2004 and $2.3million more than the amount requested for FY2005); $129.1 million for Treasury'sInspector General for Tax Administration (or $1.8 million more than FY2004 butidentical to the amount requested for FY2005); $2.0 million for the AirTransportation Stabilization Program (or $523,000 less than FY2004 and $800,000less than the amount requested for FY2005); $20.3 million for Treasury's buildingand annex repair and restoration program (or $4.5 million less than FY2004 butidentical to the amount requested for FY2005); $90.0 million for the FinancialCrimes Enforcement Network (after a House floor amendment added $25.5 million;the $90 million is $32.7 million more than FY2004 and $25.5 million more thanrequested for FY2005); $230.9 million for the Financial Management Service (or$3.7 million more than FY2004 but identical to the amount requested for FY2005);$82.5 million for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (or $3.0 millionmore than FY2004 and $600,000 more than the amount requested for FY2005); and$175.2 million for the Bureau of the Public Debt (or $2.5 million more than FY2004and identical to the amount requested for FY2005). In addition, H.R. 5025supported the Administration's request to eliminate two current programs --expanded access to financial services and violent crime reduction -- by cancelingtheir unobligated balances from previous fiscal years. ", "During the floor debate in the House on H.R. 5025 , several contentious amendments were considered. A provision (Section 216 of Title II) inthe version of H.R. 5025 reported by the Appropriations Committee wouldhave prohibited the Treasury Department from issuing or implementing regulationsto allow financial institutions to accept matricula consular cards as a legitimate formof identification for opening new accounts at financial institutions; it was struck byamendment on the House floor. Another amendment approved during the debatespecified that the Treasury Department may use none of the funds appropriated forFY2005 to plan, enter into, or implement contracts for collection of delinquent taxdebt between the IRS and private debt collectors. The House also approvedamendments to prevent any funds appropriated for FY2005 from being used toimplement a directive from the Office of Management and Budget known as CircularA-76 that requires federal agencies to open up to competition from the private sectorany functions or activities that are not \"inherently governmental,\" and to prohibit theTreasury Department from using appropriated funds for FY2005 to attempt tooverturn a 2003 decision by a U.S. district court that certain cash-balance pensionsplans violate federal laws barring age discrimination.", "The Senate formally joined the deliberations in Congress over funding Treasury operations in FY2005 when the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee onTransportation, Treasury, and General Government approved an appropriationsmeasure ( S. 2806 ) by voice vote on September 9, 2004. Five days later,the Senate Appropriations Committee favorably reported the bill ( S.Rept. 108-342 )by a vote of 29-0. For a variety of reasons, the full Senate never voted on the bill.", "Under S. 2806 , as reported by the Appropriations Committee, Treasury's FY2005 budget would be set at $11.329 billion, or $228.9 million morethan FY2004 but $286.1 million less than the amount requested by the BushAdministration for FY2005. Nearly 90% of this amount, or $10.253 billion -- whichwas $68.8 million more than FY2004 but $421.1 million less than the amountrequested for FY2005 -- would go to the IRS. The measure would also appropriate$161.3 million (or $13.7 million less than FY2004 and $23.7 million less thanFY2005 budget request) for departmental offices; $30.3 million (or $5.9 million lessthan FY2004 and $5.8 million less than the FY2005 budget request) for thedepartment's systems and capital investments program; $16.1 million (or $3.2million more than FY2004 and $2.0 million more than the FY2005 budget request)for the Office of the Inspector General; $129.1 million for the Treasury InspectorGeneral for Tax Administration ($1.8 million more than FY2004 but identical to theFY2005 budget request); $2.0 million (or $523,000 less than FY2004 and $800,000less than the budget request for FY2005) for the Air Transportation StabilizationProgram; $12.3 million (or $12.5 million less than FY2004 and $8.0 million less thanthe budget request for FY2005) for Treasury's Building and Annex Repair andRestoration Program; $72.5 million (or $15.3 million more than FY2004 and $8.0million more than the budget request for FY2005) for FinCen; $230.9 million (or$3.7 million more than FY2004 and identical to the budget request for FY2005) forthe Financial Management Service; $83.0 million (or $3.5 million more than FY2004and $1.0 million more than the budget request for FY2005) for the Alcohol andTobacco Tax and Trade Bureau; and $175.2 million (or $2.5 million more thanFY2004 but identical to the budget request for FY2005) for the Bureau of the PublicDebt. ", "Contrary to the wishes of the Bush Administration, S. 2806 would also establish a separate appropriation account for OFAC and set aside $22.3 millionfor its operations in FY2005. (In FY2004, funding for OFAC was folded into theappropriation for departmental offices.) Like H.R. 5025 , S.2806 supported the Administration's request to eliminate the initiative toexpand access to financial services and the violent crime reduction program bycanceling unobligated balances from previous fiscal years. But unlike H.R.5025, the bill endorsed the creation of OTFI and recommended that itreceive $12.7 million in appropriated funds in FY2005 and that the TreasurySecretary be given the authority to transfer up to $2.0 million in unobligated balancesto the new office from the funds for departmental offices.", "The House and Senate finally agreed on a budget for the Treasury Department in FY2005, in separate votes cast on November 20, 2004. It was included in abroader appropriations measure ( H.R. 4818 , P.L. 108-447 ) known as theConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, which covered nine of the 13 regularappropriations bills. Funding for Treasury is set forth in Title II of Division H of theAct. To keep total spending under H.R. 4818 within a discretionaryspending limit of $821.9 billion set by President Bush, the bill incorporates a 0.83percent across-the-board cut in all spending unrelated to national defense andhomeland security. President Bush signed the measure into law on December 8th.", "A controversial provision (Section 222 of Title II, Division H) added to H.R. 4818 late in the conference negotiations that would permit thechairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees or designatedmembers of their staff to have access to \"Internal Revenue Service facilities and anytax returns or return information contained therein\" delayed the signing of the bill. The provision did not explicitly include criminal penalties for violating existingstatutory protections of taxpayer privacy for committee chairmen or their aides. Under current law, members of the House Ways and Means Committee, SenateFinance Committee, and Joint Committee on Taxation have the authority to examinetax return information, as well as designated members of their staff. They facecriminal and civil penalties if they improperly disclose personal tax informationobtained from their research or carelessly lose tax return documents. Republicanleaders in both houses agreed to pass an enrolling resolution( H.Con.Res. 528 ) to delete the provision. The Senate passed theresolution on November 21st, and the House followed suit on December 6th. ", "Under H.R. 4818 , Treasury is to receive $11.248 billion in appropriated funds, an amount that does not reflect the mandatory 0.83%across-the-board reduction in spending. This total is $147.6 million more than thetotal enacted for FY2004 but $362.0 million less than the amount requested by theBush Administration. Virtually all of this gain (91%) and this shortfall (98%) aretied to approved funding for the IRS, which is set at $10.318 billion in FY2005, or$134.1 million above its funding for FY2004. Other Treasury accounts receivingbudgetary increases in FY2005 are the Office of Inspector General ($16.5 million,or $3.6 million above FY2004), the Treasury Inspector General for TaxAdministration ($129.1 million, or $1.8 million above FY2004), FinCen ($72.5million, or $15.3 million above FY2004), the Financial Management Service ($230.9million, or $3.7 million above FY2004), the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and TradeBureau ($83.0 million, or $3.5 million above FY2004), and the Bureau of the PublicDebt ($175.2 million, or $2.5 million above FY2004). Three Treasury accounts arereceiving less money than they did in FY2004: Department-Wide Systems andCapital Investments Program ($32.3 million, or $3.9 million below FY2004), the AirTransportation Stabilization Program ($2.0 million, or $0.5 million below FY2004),and Treasury Building and Annex Repair and Restoration ($12.3 million, or $12.5million below FY2004). Contrary to the wishes of the Bush Administration, H.R.4818 creates a separate appropriations account for OFAC and gives it abudget of $22.3 million in FY2005, with the caveat that the funds be used to establishthe equivalent of 138 full-time staff positions. The bill also appropriates $157.6million for Treasury departmental offices in FY2005 and eliminates programs toexpand access to financial services among low-income households and reduce violentcrime by rescinding their unobligated balances.", "Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In order to help finance its operations and programs, the federal government leviesindividual and corporate income taxes, social insurance taxes, excise taxes, estate andgift taxes, customs duties, and miscellaneous taxes and fees. The federal agencyresponsible for administering all these taxes and fees, except customs duties, is theIRS. In discharging this duty, the IRS receives and processes tax returns and otherrelated documents, processes payments and refunds, enforces compliance throughaudits and other methods, collects delinquent taxes, and provides a variety of servicesto taxpayers to help them understand their rights and responsibilities and resolveproblems. In FY2003, the IRS collected $1,969 billion before refunds, the largestcomponent of which was individual income tax revenue of $987 billion.", "In FY2004, the IRS received $10.184 billion in appropriated funds. Of this amount, $4.009 billion was used for processing, assistance, and management; $4.171billion for tax law enforcement; $1.582 billion for information systems management;$388 million for the business systems modernization program; and $35 million toadminister the health insurance tax credit established by the Trade Act of 2002. Ofthe funds allocated to processing, assistance, and management, $4.1 million wasmandated for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program and $7.5 million was setaside to pay for grants for low-income taxpayer clinics. None of the fundsappropriated for the business systems modernization program could be spent withoutthe prior approval of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The IRSwas also barred from using appropriated funds from FY2004 to issue finalregulations lifting a moratorium on the conversion of corporate pension plans fromtraditional defined-benefit plans to cash-balance plans imposed in 1999.", "The Bush Administration requested that the IRS receive $10.674 billion in funding for FY2005, or $490 million more than in FY2004. This amount was to beallocated in the following manner: $4.148 billion for processing, assistance, andmanagement (an increase of $138 million over FY2004); $4.564 billion for tax lawenforcement (+$393 million over FY2004); $1.642 billion for information systemsmanagement (+$60 million over FY2004); $285 million for the business systemsmodernization program (-$103 million from FY2004); and $35 million for theadministration of the health insurance tax credit (virtually the same amount asFY2004). According to budget documents issued by the IRS, this proposal wasintended to achieve three strategic goals: (1) continued improvement of taxpayerservice; (2) strengthened enforcement of the tax laws; and (3) continuedimprovement of the IRS's information infrastructure. ", "The budget proposal suggested that the Administration assigned a high priority to improving compliance with tax laws. Public disclosures about illegal corporatetax shelters and sharp declines in audit rates for high-income taxpayers and largecorporations in recent years have sparked heightened congressional scrutiny ofagency performance and strategic goals and calls inside and outside of Congress forsubstantial increases in funding for tax law enforcement. The IRS estimates that theoverall gross tax gap in the 2001 tax year, the most recent year for which data areavailable, amounted to $310.6 billion. (14)", "A key player in the annual budget cycle for the IRS is the IRS Oversight Board. Under the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the Board is required toreview the agency's annual budget request, submit its own budget recommendationto the Treasury Department, and determine whether the budget submitted by thePresident to Congress is adequate to support the annual and long-term strategic plansof the IRS. (15) The Board recommended a budgetof $11.204 billion for the IRS inFY2005, an amount that would be 10% above the amount enacted for FY2004 and5% above the amount requested by the Bush Administration for FY2005. It foundfault with the administration's request on the grounds that it would produce a $230million shortfall in light of the administration's stated objectives of adding nearly2,000 full-time employees to bolster IRS's resources for tax law enforcement. In theBoard's judgment, if Congress were to enact its recommended budget, the IRS wouldbe able to hire another 3,315 individuals in FY2005 to boost enforcement efforts andeventually collect an additional $5 billion per year in revenue once the newemployees received proper training. (16)", "Under H.R. 5025 , as passed by the House in September 2004, the IRS would receive $10.291 billion in funding in FY2005, or $107.3 million morethan in FY2004 but $382.5 million less than the amount requested by the BushAdministration. The measure would funnel $4.072 billion into processing,assistance, and management; $4.278 billion into tax law enforcement; $1.622 billioninto information systems; $285 million into business systems modernization; and$34.8 million into administering the health insurance tax credit. About 75% of thedifference between the budget recommended in the bill and the Administration'srequested budget was due to lower recommended funding for tax law enforcement. In addition, H.R. 5025 would require the IRS to spend $7.5 million of theappropriated funds for processing, assistance, and management on low-incometaxpayer clinics and $4.1 million on the Tax Counseling Program for the Elderly.", "Some of the amendments to H.R. 5025 approved during the floor debate in the House would affect IRS operations in FY2005. One would prevent theIRS from using any appropriated funds to plan, enter into, or implement contracts forcollection of delinquent individual income tax debt involving the IRS and privatedebt collectors. As a result of the recently enacted American jobs Creation Act of2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ), the IRS has the authority to hire private debt collectors undercertain conditions for the purpose of collecting overdue taxes. Another amendmentwould prohibit the IRS from using any appropriated funds to attempt to overturn a2003 decision by a U.S. district court that certain cash-balance pension plans violatefederal laws barring age discrimination.", "Under S. 2806 as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee (but not considered by the full Senate), IRS operations would be funded at $10.253billion in FY2005, or $68.8 million more than the FY2004 budget but $38 millionless than the amount recommended in H.R. 5025 and $421.1 million lessthan the amount requested by the Bush Administration. The bill would allocate$4.107 billion for processing, assistance, and management (of which $4.1 millionwould go to the Tax Counseling Program for the Elderly and $7.0 million tolow-income taxpayer clinics), $4.519 billion for tax law enforcement, $1.606 billionfor information systems, $125 million for business systems modernization, and $34.8million for administering the health insurance tax credit. In addition, the bill wouldrescind $140 million in unobligated balances in the account for business systemsmodernization. In its report on S. 2806, the Appropriations Committeeexpressed the concern that the IRS \"has consistently used the majority of its newcompliance funding for purposes other than those that Congress intended.\" In orderto insure that the agency uses most of the funding it receives for tax law enforcementin FY2005 for programs intended to improve compliance among high-incomeindividuals and large corporations, the bill would restrict the IRS's ability to transferfunds from the tax law enforcement account to 3% of the appropriated amount;transfers at higher levels would require the prior consent of the House and SenateAppropriations Committees.", "The House and Senate agreed on a budget for the IRS for FY2005 by passing an omnibus appropriations bill ( H.R. 4818 ) in separate votes onNovember 20, 2004. Under the measure, the IRS would receive a total of $10.319billion, or $134.1 million more than in FY2004 but $355.8 million less than theamount requested by the Bush Administration. More than 46% of this latterdifference is due to reduced levels of spending on tax law enforcement. The measureappropriates $4.089 billion for processing, assistance and management ($80.3 millionabove FY2004), $4.399 billion for tax law enforcement ($227.5 million aboveFY2004), $1.590 billion for information systems ($8.9 million above FY2004),$205.0 million for business systems modernization ($182.7 million below FY2004),and $34.8 million for administering the health insurance tax credit ($47 millionabove FY2004). In addition, H.R. 4818 specifies that the IRS spend $4.1million of the funds appropriated for processing, assistance and management on taxcounseling for the elderly and $8.0 million on low-income taxpayer clinics, and thatthe IRS Commissioner submit quarterly reports to the House and SenateAppropriations Committees on the agency's compliance activities.

The funding guarantees were set upin a way that makes it difficult for funding levels to be altered as part of the annualbudget/appropriations process. Additional highway funds can be provided annuallyby a mechanism called \"Revenue Aligned Budget Authority\" (RABA); RABA fundsaccrue to the trust fund as a result of increased trust fund revenues. For FY2003,however, the RABA adjustment, if it had been applied during the appropriationsprocess, would have led to a significant and unexpected drop in the availability ofhighway obligational funding. Congress set the RABA adjustment for FY2003 to $0(in a provision in P.L. 107-206 ) and appropriators ultimately provided FY2003highway funding at the same level as provided for FY2002 (which was $4 billionhigher than the FY2003 authorized level). RABA was not included in the FY2004appropriations calculations.", "TEA-21 changed the role of the House and Senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs.The appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting anannual level of obligations. These were established by TEA-21 and are adjusted byan annual RABA computation. In addition, it appears that TEA-21 precludes, at leastin part, the House and Senate appropriations committees from exercising what someMembers view as their once traditional option of changing spending levels forspecific core programs or projects. In the FY2000 appropriations act, theappropriators took some tentative steps to regain some of their discretion overhighway spending. The FY2000 Act called for the redistribution of some fundsamong programs and added two significant spending projects. In the FY2001appropriations act, the appropriators continued in this vein by adding funds for largenumbers of earmarked projects. Further, the FY2001 Act called for redirection of alimited amount of funding between programs and includes significant additionalfunding for some TEA-21 programs. This trend continued, and even accelerated, inthe FY2002 Act as appropriators made major redistributions of RABA funds and, insome instances, transferred RABA funds to agencies that are not eligible for RABAfunding under TEA-21."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix 3: Transportation Budget Terminology", "paragraphs": ["Transportation budgeting uses a confusing lexicon (for those unfamiliar with theprocess) of budget authority and contract authority -- the latter, a form ofbudgetauthority. Contract authority provides obligational authority for the funding of trustfund-financed programs, such as the federal-aid highway program. Prior to TEA-21,changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had beenachieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budget/contractauthority and placing limitations on obligations . The principal function of thelimitation on obligations is to control outlays in a manner that corresponds tocongressional budget agreements. ", "Contract authority is tantamount to, but does not actually involve, entering into a contract to pay for a project at some future date. Under this arrangement, specifiedin Title 23 U.S.C., which TEA-21 amended, authorized funds are automatically madeavailable to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligatedwithout appropriations legislation. Appropriations are required to make outlays atsome future date to cover these obligations. TEA-21 greatly limited the role of theappropriations process in core highway and transit programs because the actenumerated the limitation on obligations level for the period FY1999 throughFY2003 in the Statute.", "Highway and transit grant programs work on a reimbursable basis : states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work iscompleted and vouchers are presented, months or even years after the project hasbegun. Work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligated funds andalthough they are considered \"used\" and remain as commitments against the trustfund balances , they are not subtracted from balances. Trust fund balances,therefore, appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expectedfuture commitments must remain available.", "Both the highway and transit accounts have substantial short- and long-term commitments. These include payments that will be made in the current fiscal yearas projects are completed and, to a much greater extent, outstanding obligations tobe made at some unspecified future date. Additionally, there are unobligatedamounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects, but have not beencommitted to specific projects.", "Two terms are associated with the distribution of contract authority funds to the states and to particular programs. The first of these, apportionments, refers to fundsdistributed to the states for formula driven programs. For example, all nationalhighway system (NHS) funds are apportioned to the states. Allocated funds, arefunds distributed on an administrative basis, typically to programs under directfederal control. For example, federal lands highway program monies are allocated;the allocation can be to another federal agency, to a state, to an Indian tribe, or tosome other governmental entity. These terms do not refer to the federal budgetprocess, but often provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients, whomay assume, albeit incorrectly, that a state apportionment is part of the federal budgetper se."], "subsections": []}]}}
