High-containment laboratories play a critical role in the biodefense effort, offering the hope of better responses to an attack and a better understanding of the threat posed by bioterrorism. However, they also could increase the risk of a biological attack by serving as a potential source of materials or training. Indeed, the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommends tightening government oversight of high-containment laboratories.", "Policymakers have become increasingly interested in the oversight of these facilities following reports of accidents, regulatory noncompliance, and community resistance. The increase in high-containment laboratory capacity has raised new policy questions and emphasized existing ones. How much laboratory capacity is enough? What is the necessary federal investment? Should laboratories be consolidated or dispersed? What plans exist to coordinate multiple agency efforts to expand high-containment laboratory capacity? Does increasing laboratory capacity increase the risk of accidents and the opportunity for purposeful misuse? What is an acceptable balance between the benefits these laboratories provide and the risks they pose?", "Interested Members of Congress might take action to address some or all of these concerns. Alternatively, they might defer action until efforts currently under way assess and make recommendations regarding the existing regulatory structure. If Congress chooses to enhance oversight, it might require a survey of existing facilities and their use and a national needs assessment, perhaps barring further construction until these are complete. Stakeholders could focus on enhancing self-regulatory activities such as improving or standardizing laboratory worker training or building a mechanism for sharing lessons learned. Rather than relying on self-regulation, policymakers might enhance oversight through additional regulation of high-containment facilities, requiring laboratory or personnel certification, or by broadening the Select Agent Program. Which agencies should implement any new mandates remains an open question.", "Biocontainment technologies are widely used by scientists around the world. Efforts to increase control of U.S. high-containment laboratories may put domestic industry at a competitive disadvantage and inhibit international academic collaboration. Absent international harmonization, the United States can only partially address the threat of a high-containment laboratory being the source of a bioterror weapon.", "A key task for policymakers is to define their goals for enhancing oversight of high-containment laboratories. The focus of the oversight effort may affect which policy issues are addressed. For example, focusing on a registry of existing high-containment laboratory capacity may improve planning, coordination, and efficiency of use but provide relatively limited security benefits. Similarly, a rigorous oversight program including facility and personnel licensure, mandatory training, and restricted construction of new facilities may provide security benefits at the cost of regulatory burden, increased federal expenditures, and impeded scientific progress in countermeasure research, bioforensics, and public health. When weighing options to address these complex policy issues, policymakers may have to reconcile many competing and potentially conflicting national needs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The federal government responded to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the subsequent anthrax attacks with increased focus on and funding for biodefense.

Because stringent protocols and engineering are used to contain the most dangerous pathogens, these facilities are often referred to as high-containment laboratories. High-containment laboratories play a critical role in the biodefense effort, offering the hope of better responses to a biological attack and a better understanding of the bioterrorism threat. However, they could also increase the risk of a biological attack by being a source of materials or training. ", "In addition to increasing laboratory capacity, the federal government invested in research to develop countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for dangerous pathogens potentially usable in a terrorist attack. One group has calculated that congressionally appropriated funding for civilian biodefense increased from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008. Much of this funding supports academic and industrial researchers and laboratories that handle these dangerous pathogens. The influx of funds and researchers has exacerbated existing concerns about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited research and diagnostic laboratory capacity. ", "Non-federal entities have also expanded or constructed additional high-containment laboratories. In addition to the threat of bioterrorism, an increasing awareness of the threat posed by emerging and re-emerging diseases has led to the proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally, as the technologies used are widely available.", "The increase in high-containment laboratory capacity has raised new policy questions and increased focus on existing ones.

", "The Select Agent Program was first established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-132 ). This law required HHS to identify a list of organisms and toxins that could potentially be used for bioterrorist attacks and to regulate their transfer, though not their possession. These pathogens and toxins were to be known as select agents. ", "The 2001 anthrax mailings increased the federal government's interest in the threat of bioterrorism. Congress enacted the USA PATRIOT Act ( P.L. 107-56 ) and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-188 ) which increased restrictions on the possession of pathogens and toxins that have been identified as possessing the greatest potential for malevolent use. Entities possessing select agents were required to develop explicit security and biosafety plans and procedures to be reviewed and certified by the federal government. The Select Agent Program oversees regulation of select agents possession, transfer, and use. It focuses mainly on two areas: people who have access to select agents and facilities where select agents are used and stored.", "Scientists who want access to select agents must register with the federal government. Applicants provide information to the Department of Justice (DOJ), which performs background checks to determine whether the applicant may be permitted to handle select agents. Such permits are nontransferable and are valid for five years.", "Facilities that possess or use select agents must develop and implement a security plan to protect the select agents from theft or improper access. These plans are submitted either to HHS, through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or to USDA, through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). These agencies review them for regulatory compliance and audit their security plan implementation. The CDC performs announced inspections of each regulated facility at least once every three years.", "Failure to comply with the regulations of the Select Agent Program is punishable by fines.

As part of efforts to develop robust testing and response capabilities following a biological attack, the federal government has developed a Laboratory Response Network that links many of these state or local public health laboratories. One of the goals in establishing the Laboratory Response Network was to create a laboratory in each state capable of handling dangerous pathogens.", "Additionally, the large number of academic entities, and presumably researchers, has increased tensions over the Select Agent Program in academia.

It also found that none of the eight representative state, local, private, or commercial laboratories investigated were in full compliance. Three of these entities chose to withdraw their select agent licenses following the investigation. The USDA IG found similarly that APHIS controls over registered entities and registered entities' compliance with select agent regulations were not complete. In 2007, the CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University, reportedly because of failure to report occupational exposures in a timely fashion and because laboratory workers lacking a security risk assessment were allowed access to select agents.

In general, the more dangerous the pathogen is to human health, the higher its recommended biosafety level. Each successive biosafety level consists of the protective measures of the lower biosafety levels, augmented with additional protective measures. Generally, the term \"high-containment laboratory\" refers to BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories.", "The current BMBL guidelines grew out of earlier efforts by the DOD, HHS, and USDA. These best practices were developed to protect laboratory workers based on the various specific risks posed by different pathogens. The guidelines present criteria to define the different biosafety levels, best practices for safe laboratory operation at these biosafety levels, and mechanisms for identifying the appropriate biosafety level for a given organism and procedure. Because the biosafety level may vary depending on the procedure, some experts recommend that biosafety levels be thought of as linked to a combination of pathogen and experiment, not as accompanying particular pathogens.", "The BMBL describes primary and secondary barriers to infection, as well as standard and special laboratory practices for each biosafety level. Unlike previous editions, the most recent edition of the BMBL also contains some security guidelines for the different biosafety levels. According to federal grant policy and standard contract language, researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds are to be trained in the procedures described in the BMBL before they gain access to the laboratory. ", "The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its potential for transmission and treatment, and the research procedure or activity being conducted. Procedures deemed unlikely to produce disease in healthy humans should be conducted at BSL-1. Those that may cause disease in healthy humans, but for which immunization or antibiotic treatment is available, should be conducted at BSL-2. Procedures that may cause serious or potentially lethal diseases as a result of pathogen inhalation should be conducted at BSL-3. Procedures that pose a high individual risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infections and life-threatening disease should be conducted at BSL-4. ", "Because the recommended biosafety level for a particular activity is determined by considering both the pathogen and procedure, it is possible to safely handle potentially deadly pathogens at lower biosafety levels when performing certain types of experiments or activities. Several pathogens thought to pose the greatest health threat, as defined by their inclusion on the select agent list, may be handled outside high-containment facilities. See Table 3 . For example, the BMBL recommends the bacteria that causes the disease anthrax be handled at BSL-2 for \"activities using clinical materials and diagnostic quantities of infectious cultures\" and at BSL-3 for \"work involving production quantities or high concentrations of cultures, screening environmental samples (especially powders) from anthrax-contaminated locations, and for activities with a high potential for aerosol production.\" Of the 73 human and animal select agents and toxins, 13 warrant BSL-4 containment for any procedure. However, 30 others may be studied at BSL-2 containment depending on the circumstances. ", "Some of the work performed in BSL-4 facilities is on pathogens that are not select agents. All of the BSL-4 facilities in the United States perform at least some work with select agents and therefore are regulated under the Select Agent Program. Only some of the work in BSL-3 facilities uses select agents, so many BSL-3 facilities are not subject to select agent regulations.

Some federal agencies have promulgated management directives requiring compliance with the BMBL in agency laboratories. Industrial, academic, and non-profit laboratories generally establish health and safety officials or other responsible persons whose responsibilities include verifying the good operation of protective equipment installed in laboratories and thus continued compliance with the guidelines.

Conversely, entities registered to work with select agents may or may not use high-containment laboratories (see Table 3 ).

Previous efforts by a single agency to determine the number of extant laboratories have failed. Congress may consider whether such a survey should be performed at the agency level or through a higher or external coordinating body.", "The continued construction of high-containment facilities raises questions about capacity utilization. Fully utilizing additional capacity will likely require increased funding for research, operations, and management. This increase in funding may be particularly difficult for those agencies that are undergoing a large increase in capacity. For example, an agency increasing its high containment laboratory capacity four-fold will have concomitant increases in operations and maintenance costs for the larger facility regardless of whether the agency fully uses the new capacity. Individual agencies may feel pressure to request larger research budgets to justify their increased operations and maintenance costs. Interagency federal planning efforts may help alleviate overcapacity costs, but would require agreement among agencies regarding prioritization and shared use of different agency facilities.", "Planning efforts arising from individual agency initiatives may have difficulty influencing synergies or redundancies between agencies. For example, DHS, through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, has attempted to coordinate homeland security research and development, but this activity was not prescriptive and did not address use of other agency laboratory assets.

Despite such planning, accidents do occur and can overwhelm the safety controls and barriers designed to mitigate their consequences. The GAO has testified that each high-containment facility has an inherent associated risk. As additional facilities are constructed, the total risk increases.", "The magnitude of this incremental risk is difficult to measure and may vary depending on each laboratory's compliance with best practices and regulation. Factors that might contribute to the risk include the rate of accidental or other releases, the rate of subsequent illness from any releases, and the total number of laboratories. Because this information is not generally available, policymakers may perform an approximate cost/benefit analysis relying on estimates of the potential benefits provided by research in high-containment laboratories and the potential costs resulting from an infectious release from a high-containment laboratory. For example, breakthroughs in biodefense research, such as vaccines against pathogens requiring high-containment, might be considered as a benefit while the loss of infected animals or infection of laboratory workers might be used as an example of a cost. Subtle and institutional effects, which may be hard to measure, such as the development of a national sampling laboratory network and the proliferation of high-containment laboratory technique, may be overlooked by federal policymakers. As a result, policy may be driven by response to high profile incidents rather than by judging the actual risk, or the full costs and benefits, of the increased number of facilities. ", "Another concern is personnel surety or the \"insider threat.\" The expansion of high-containment laboratories requires additional trained technicians, scientists, and other employees to utilize this capacity.
