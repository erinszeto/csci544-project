Manufacturers must report all serious and unexpected adverse reactions to FDA and clinicians and patients may do so.", "The law gives FDA authority to take limited action if it finds a drug's post-approval use presents an increased risk of an adverse event. However, many suggest that not only does FDA need a broader range of enforcement tools, but that FDA also is not taking full advantage of the authority it does have.", "While critics of FDA differ in their assessment of what is wrong with FDA's approach to postmarket safety activities, there is broad agreement that it needs significant change. Discussion of the problems and possible solutions revolves around six areas: FDA organization, FDA budget, role of industry, opportunities to use the drug approval process to enhance postmarket activities, insufficient postmarket information, and lack of public access to available data. Some of the proposed changes lie within the power of FDA to implement.

A few weeks before, Merck had notified the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it was withdrawing Vioxx from the market in response to recent study results indicating an increased risk of heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths among the millions of patients who had been using Vioxx since its introduction in 1999. Senators wanted to find out what had gone wrong and what could be done to prevent it from happening again.", "This was not the first time that this Congress had reacted to news about dangers posed by drugs that had already reached the market. Earlier that year, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations had held hearings because of controversy over the safety of antidepressants when prescribed to children. In both cases, Members were worried that neither the public nor FDA were sufficiently informed by manufacturers\u2014or, in the case of FDA, sufficiently forthcoming\u2014about risks occurring after the drugs had been first approved.", "At the Finance Committee hearing, David Graham, Associate Director for Science and Medicine in FDA's Office of Drug Safety, was asked whether these concerns were warranted in the case of Vioxx. He stated, \"I would argue that the FDA, as currently configured, is incapable of protecting America against another Vioxx. We are virtually defenseless.\" Pressed to name other marketed drugs he thought troublesome, Graham named five.", "The February 2005 meeting of two FDA advisory committees\u2014coming three months after Dr. Graham's testimony to the Senate Finance Committee and five months after Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market\u2014also drew intense public attention.

Illustrating the complexity of decisions that FDA faces, a majority of the committee members, noting that the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks for certain groups of people, therefore, recommended to FDA that the agency permit the sale of these drugs\u2014with, however, several severe limitations on advertising and strong warnings in consumer and clinician labeling about cardiovascular risk that is likely associated with dose and duration of use.", "The furor surrounding Dr. Graham's testimony reawakened interest in a variety of regulatory issues that have surfaced periodically ever since the storm of protest over \"filthy, decomposed or putrid\" food and \"worthless\" medicines resulted in FDA's creation during Theodore Roosevelt's presidency.", "Concerns about regulatory agencies' abilities to protect the public are not unique to FDA or public health. The life-and-death issues of medicine, however, strike most closely to home for many Americans. There has not been a decade since FDA's creation without a highly publicized incident involving drug safety that has led to legislation expanding and strengthening FDA's authority to protect the public. Examples include the scores of children killed by an untested antibiotic (elixir of sulfanilamide) marketed by a company in Tennessee in 1937; the mistakes at a plant manufacturing polio vaccine in 1954 that actually caused 260 cases of polio and 11 deaths; and, in 1962, thalidomide, the sleeping pill that eventually resulted in the birth of at least 8,000 severely deformed babies and thousands of prenatal deaths, mostly in Europe.", "Today, as the 110 th Congress prepares to consider a variety of health issues, Members still share concerns over drug safety and efficacy. The agency most responsible for such issues is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In FY2006, FDA operated on a budget of $1.88 billion ($1.49 billion in appropriated funds and $382 million from user fees), more than $6 per U.S. citizen. With that money, FDA was expected to oversee about $1 trillion of goods, which make up about one-quarter of all U.S. consumer spending.", "Congressional funding for FDA has increased at about half the rate as that of industry user fees, established by Congress as a way to defray the costs of hiring additional agency personnel so that drug approval review could be quicker.

The report then moves on to a discussion of the problems in identifying and resolving the postmarketing safety and effectiveness issues that are raised most frequently in the debate.

It passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) in 1938, requiring that drugs be proven safe before they could be sold in interstate commerce. Then, in 1962, in the wake of the thalidomide tragedy, Congress amended the law to require that drugmakers prove the effectiveness of their products as well.", "The process has not remained the same since 1962. The 1983 Orphan Drug Act began a series of additional laws passed by Congress in recent decades to boost pharmaceutical research and development, speed the approval of new medicines, or, in some cases, both.

The pressure for quicker approvals came from two directions. First, manufacturers wanted it. Because the 20-year patent protection begins with NDA submission, manufacturers see the time from NDA submission to FDA approval decision as lost income. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) argues that because of the long approval process and the Hatch-Waxman Act, encouraging generics, \"the average effective patent life for prescription medicines ... is 11-12 years, compared to an average of 18.5 years for other products.\" Meanwhile, consumer groups also wanted quicker approvals to speed their access to promising drugs.", "Congress reacted by looking for legislative ways to speed up the drug review process without lowering approval standards, especially those whose weakening might compromise patient safety. In 1992, it passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and five years later, in 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA). These laws created a system in which congressional appropriations only partially fund new drug review; those monies are supplemented with \"user fees\" paid by pharmaceutical companies. A third of the user fee money comes from an application fee; the remaining two-thirds is unlinked to the application process, based instead on the type of manufacturing facility and product submitted for review. User fees are paid at the start of the fiscal year. Following the introduction of user fees, FDA quickly reduced its median approval time for priority new drugs from the 16.3 months of 1993. By 1995, it had fallen by half, where it generally remained until 2002 when it jumped to 13.8 months, coming down to 7.7 months in 2003. Beginning with its data for 2004, FDA includes Biologics License Application (BLA) approvals along with New Drug Applications (NDAs); for 2004, the median approval time was six months.

The Vioxx controversy brought into sharp relief the potential value of comparing one drug against other drugs used to treat the same illness.

FDA accepts as evidence of safety and effectiveness data from trials that do not include what some critics see as a reasonable range of patient, disease, and care characteristics. That is, clinical trials often limit study to people without problems other than the one being studied.

Second, the system relies on a physician or consumer making the connection between an adverse event with a drug.

After a drug has been used long enough or by enough people, FDA could require formal assessment (with controlled clinical trials and well-designed observational studies) of safety and effectiveness for those off-label uses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remove postmarket study responsibility from both manufacturers and FDA", "paragraphs": ["Avorn suggests that HMOs, academics, insurers, contract research organizations, and other private groups could carry out postmarket studies under government or industry contracts. He gives as examples a 10-cent fee for every filled prescription, or user fees from payers on a per person-covered basis. If the funding came from a line-item in the federal budget or from industry contributions, a mechanism could be imposed to guarantee that the studies were managed independently, without input from the government or industry. That way, the data would not be owned by entities potentially reluctant to release them to the public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Require clinical trial registration", "paragraphs": ["Congress acted in 1997 to require sponsors to publicly list any clinical trial at its outset to enable individuals to participate. This public notice had a collateral effect: the public could follow-up, years later, what the sponsor had found. Discussion in Congress has focused on registration as a way to compel this openness. Incentives suggested to increase compliance included linking registration either to permission to begin clinical studies in humans or to publication of studies' results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Make data public", "paragraphs": ["This would avoid the potentially dangerous withholding of data. It would present the opportunity to others to validate findings and conclusions or to analyze the data differently. Making data public could cause problems, too. If a proposed study might yield findings that would hurt a drug's sales, the manufacturer might choose not to pursue the research. If data were widely disseminated before they were replicated, understood, or rejected, they could prematurely form the basis of ill-informed treatment decisions. The enormity of data collected would be unwieldy and difficult to analyze (or analyze within a useful timeframe) without sophisticated statistical knowledge and computer software."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Give FDA enhanced authority to regulate DTC advertisements", "paragraphs": ["Much of the information about drugs available to physicians and the public comes directly from the pharmaceutical industry. Although the law and regulations require that material include description of risks as well as benefits, DTC advertisements are designed to sell a product, and some think that the balance of information is distorted in favor of the product. Currently FDA reviews a DTC advertisement if it becomes aware of a problem. Some would prefer a total ban on DTC advertising; others urge stronger controls. One would require that FDA review and approve advertising copy before it is published. This may require budget action; according to Angell, in 2001 FDA had 30 reviewers for 34,000 DTC advertisements submitted. Other proposals would prohibit DTC advertising in the few years immediately following a new drug's approval."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Give FDA ability to institute penalties for misleading ads", "paragraphs": ["This may require coordination with Federal Trade Commission regulations."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["No drug is completely safe. In fact, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act even defines a prescription drug as one with \"toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its use, is not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug.\"", "Physicians have a responsibility to weigh benefits against risks when prescribing drugs. To do so requires, in addition to their training and experience, available information. Many ethicists say that the public, too, must have enough information about risks to make up their own minds. However, in-depth analysis is often required to assess a drug's full effects. Some question whether individuals or even their physicians can meaningfully interpret all relevant information.", "The FDA's task involves providing that in-depth analysis as it weighs benefits against risks. For example, codeine provides pain relief but is addictive; Tamoxifen keeps breast cancer at bay for those who have had a single mastectomy, but can cause uterine cancer and blood clots; ibuprofen relieves inflammation but can cause gastrointestinal distress; and statins lower cholesterol but may weaken muscle fibers. Manufacturers and researchers should find new ways to diminish or mitigate risk. Furthermore, if a drug is not effective, there is no potential benefit to counterbalance even the smallest risk.", "FDA's advisory committees routinely tackle these tasks. But the February 2005 joint advisory committee meeting made clear how hard it is to assess the unique and intertwined qualities of safety , benefit , and risk. The committees heard patients testify that they would rather die than live without the COX-2 inhibitor that allows them to function. They heard highly trained researchers present analyses of a drug's risk and come up with different conclusions. Finally, they sat for three days surrounded by conversation and press releases carrying often sharply divergent views from drug companies, consumers, academic researchers, the media, Members of Congress, and the FDA itself.", "While few question that FDA applies the necessary statutory, regulatory, and procedural requirements for premarket approval, there is broad criticism of its postmarket enforcement activities. Many observers maintain that the law does not provide sufficiently strong authority for FDA to act.", "In this 100 th year of the Food and Drug Administration, Congress is clearly poised to examine whether FDA needs more legal authority to regulate the safety and effectiveness of drugs. It could also examine how FDA can better use the legal\u2014and moral\u2014authority it already has (1) to encourage and participate in developing, gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information; (2) to act on that information when necessary; and (3) by its powers to both offer incentives and enforce penalties\u2014and by its own example\u2014to encourage industry cooperation.", "There is broad agreement about what problems hamper postmarket activity. This paper has summarized what observers point to as possible solutions. Congress now has a much tougher job\u2014picking the approaches that work best."], "subsections": []}]}}
