These reserves include identified, undeveloped resources in the ground that are both technically and economically recoverable under existing economic and operating conditions. This definition implies that reserve totals can increase over time because of new discoveries, but may also increase because of technological innovation or higher prices, which allow higher-cost projects to be profitable. Conversely, oil resource extraction, government regulations that limit (or prohibit) the use of certain production technologies, and low oil prices may reduce proved reserves. Some governments have also been accused of manipulating proved reserve values to enhance their importance within the world oil market. Therefore, crude oil reserve estimates are useful only as rough approximations of a country's resource base at any particular point in time. Nonetheless, proved reserves are the conventional measure of available resources in the oil industry and are the metric used in this report.", "As Figure 2 shows, according to Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, North American crude oil reserves are dominated by Canada, with an estimated 173 billion barrels at the end of 2015, most of it in the form of bitumen in the Alberta oil sands. Reserves in the United States and Mexico are much smaller by comparison, at around 35 billion barrels and 10 billion barrels, respectively. However, reserves in the United States doubled between 2008 and 2014, primarily due to new technologies allowing economic production of shale oil in North Dakota, Texas, and Montana and from other shale oil deposits.", "An alternative source of global crude oil reserve estimates places world reserves at 1,698 billion barrels at the end of 2015. This total represents a decline of 2 billion barrels from the end of 2014, but an increase of 323 billion barrels from the end of 2005. The North American portion of the 2015 world total was 238 billion barrels\u2014of which the United States held 23%, Canada held 72%, and Mexico held 5%. (The comparable resource shares in 2005 were 10% for the United States, 81% for Canada, and approximately 7% for Mexico). ", "To put the above values in perspective, a measure called the reserve to production ratio (R/P) measures how long proved reserves would last at current rates of production. For the United States the R/P at the end of 2015 was 11.9 years, for Canada the R/P was 108 years, and for Mexico the R/P was 11.5 years. (The world as a whole currently has an R/P of about 51 years.) These ratios compare favorably to those in 2006, when the U.S. R/P was 11.9 years, the Canadian R/P was 14.9 years, and the Mexican R/P was 9.6 years (while the world as a whole had an R/P of 40.5 years). The data suggest that\u2014even after 10 years of cumulative oil production\u2014the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the rest of the world as a whole are at least as well off, and in most cases better off, than they were 10 years ago with respect to oil reserves.

U.S. oil reserves were adjusted downward by approximately 12% at the end of 2015, likely as a result of low oil prices, which have slowed capital expenditures on discovery and development. On the other hand, new, undeveloped reserves will likely be discovered, pushing estimates higher. For example, in November 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey announced a new assessment of shale oil resources (20 billion barrels) in the Texas Permian basin, which is nearly three times larger than its 2013 Bakken assessment. The newly identified oil resources may be factored into future proven reserve estimates.", "While U.S. proved crude reserves have risen since 2008, Canada's and Mexico's have declined modestly during this period. Neither country has benefited from growth in shale oil production the way the United States has, and neither is expected to experience a similarly rapid growth in reserves due to shale resources. These expectations are heavily influenced by global oil prices, however. Higher prices lead to more exploration and lower prices lead to less exploration. The price of oil is statistically non-forecastable and subject to large, sudden upward or downward movement due to a wide variety of political, military, and economic variables. In addition, it is not possible to forecast the emergence of cost-reducing new technologies or entirely new technological processes and innovations. ", "While it is not possible to forecast increases in proved crude oil reserves, agencies may make estimates of undiscovered, technically recoverable, resources. Undiscovered, technically recoverable resources are highly uncertain, in that they are undiscovered, not economically recoverable today, even if the technology is thought to exist to recover them, and could not appear on the market in the near term.

The price of oil is the key determinant of crude oil production growth, but usually with a time lag reflecting the nature of oil field development and production. For example, although Figure 2 does not appear to show declining U.S. production related to the price declines beginning in 2014, incomplete data for 2016 show a different pattern.

However, Mexican production, as discussed above, has declined even faster than consumption, leading to the declining crude export potential in that country ( Figure 4 ). Canada's \"excess\" crude production has increased by more than five times over this period, despite growth in domestic consumption. In the United States, growth in shale oil crude production reduced its production deficit by 5.5 mmb/d (35%) between 2006 and 2015. As Figure 4 shows, however, the United States' need for imports to supplement domestic crude oil production still far exceeds available excess supplies from Canada and Mexico.", "Because of limited consumption growth and a production greater than consumption balance, Canada will continue to use extra production for the export market. Depending on demand and the availability of transportation facilities, more Canadian oil will either come to the United States or enter the world market, likely finding its way to Asia. Future net production in Mexico is highly uncertain, depending upon the rate of growth in domestic demand as its domestic economy develops, and potential changes in crude oil production in the wake of oil sector restructuring.

During this time several cross-border pipelines were constructed and others were rebuilt or significantly expanded to provide increased takeaway capacity from the growing crude oil production in the Canadian oil sands. At present, six pipeline systems with approximately 4.22 mmb/d of combined capacity ( Table 3 ) link the petroleum-producing regions in western Canada to markets in the United States. Three of these systems (Enbridge, Express, and Keystone) have been the primary conduits of expanded cross-border crude oil movements in recent years ( Figure 7 ).", "In addition to the existing cross-border capacity, two proposed pipeline projects have the potential to increase that capacity by another 1.2 mmb/d ( Table 3 ). The larger of these projects, the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, was approved by Canada but was denied a Presidential Permit for its border-crossing segment by the Obama Administration in 2015. However, on January 24, 2017, the Trump Administration invited the developer to resubmit its permit application for the pipeline and directed the relevant federal agencies to expedite their review of the application if resubmitted. TransCanada reportedly intends to accept the invitation and pursue development of the pipeline. The smaller proposed capacity expansion involves the restoration of Enbridge Line 3, currently de-rated, to its original operating capacity. The Line 3 project has been approved by Canadian regulators and is under review in the United States. Unlike Keystone XL, however, it does not need a new or amended Presidential Permit, because it would remain within the capacity limits of its existing permit.", "As Table 3 shows, existing cross-border pipeline capacity between the United States and Canada is currently 4.22 mmb/d and could rise to 5.42 mm/d if the planned additions are completed. Canada actually supplied the United States 2.8 mmb/d on average in 2015, although preliminary data show average monthly volumes reaching nearly 3.3 mmb/d in 2016. Even at these levels, it appears that large increases in Canadian crude oil trade could ultimately be possible via pipeline, if there were sufficient available Canadian crude production. However, actual U.S. import capacity via pipeline may be significantly lower than the figures in Table 3 due to bottlenecks, service outages, and other constraints within the U.S. crude oil pipeline system away from the border. Due to such constraints, Canadian crude supplies have exceeded available pipeline takeaway at key points in the system. Pipeline projects are being pursued within the United States to further increase movements of Canadian crude to key U.S. market hubs, including refineries in the Midwest and on the Gulf Coast that employ complex technology in order to process \"heavy\" crude oils like those from Canada (as well as Mexico and Venezuela).", "The recent expansion of crude oil pipelines from Canada has generated considerable controversy in both the United States and Canada. Proponents of these pipelines, including Canadian government agencies, petroleum industry stakeholders, and pipeline construction workers, have based their support primarily on increasing the diversity of the U.S. petroleum supply and on expected economic benefits to the United States, including near-term job creation associated with pipeline construction and operation. Opponents, primarily environmental groups and affected communities along pipeline routes, have objected to these projects principally on the grounds that Canadian oil sands development has negative environmental impacts and that it promotes continued U.S. dependency on fossil fuels. These issues have come into particular focus in the context of the Keystone XL pipeline proposal, which originally applied for a Presidential Permit in 2008 and has been the subject of ongoing public interest and debate in Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Canadian Pipelines for Overseas Exports", "paragraphs": ["Canadian developers are also pursuing two major export pipelines entirely within Canada to ship crude oil out of marine terminals on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts ( Figure 7 ).

The expansion would add 0.59 mmb/d of takeaway capacity for Canadian crude oil, most likely destined for Asian markets. The second proposed project, TransCanada's Energy East pipeline, would add 1.1 mmb/d of crude oil export capacity via Canada's Atlantic Coast, although this project is still under Canadian federal review and faces significant development challenges due to its route through Quebec and competition with the other expansions.

However, in 2016, crude-by-rail volumes have decreased by about a third from their peak in 2014. This decrease is largely attributable to pipeline projects coming online as well as changes in oil prices.

Rail car loadings of all commodities in 2016 are trailing their peak in 2014 by about 10% due to a drop in coal and international container shipments. Thus, over the immediate horizon, it would appear railroads have spare capacity if crude oil loadings were to pick up again. Much of the North American freight rail network, especially in low population areas in the West, is single tracked and lacking a signal system of the type used in more active rail corridors. This provides railroads ample opportunity to increase capacity over their rights-of-way by adding additional sidings for trains to pass, adding parallel tracks, and upgrading signal systems that reduce the required spacing between trains. Pinch-points can still occur at bridges, tunnels, and in canyons where sidings/double tracking can be more difficult.

Canada's resource base has attracted increased investment in recent years, especially to utilize the advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that spurred U.S. production. Additionally, if oil prices rise, making Canadian oil sands production more viable, Canada may need more of its natural gas for oil sands production, where it is used as heating fuel in oil sands processing. Most of Canada's natural gas resources are located in relatively close proximity to oil sands production, particularly the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.", "Mexico's energy reforms, which were enacted in 2013, are intended in part to boost production by opening up the country to foreign investment. In December 2016, Mexico completed the fourth phase of its first round of auctions of blocks for oil and natural gas exploration.

Likewise, shale gas production has hurt prospects for Arctic natural gas development in both Alaska and Arctic Canada. On the other hand, low natural gas prices benefit the production of petroleum from oil sands, which requires large volumes of natural gas for extraction and processing. It remains to be seen how the development of additional North American natural gas reserves will turn out over time, as Canada seeks to develop its own resources (with the help of U.S. companies) in response to U.S. shale gas developments.
