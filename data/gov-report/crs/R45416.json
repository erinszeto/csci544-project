An analysis by GAO in July 2018 projected that operational crewed flights will start in late 2019 or 2020.", "Past congressional debates about these activities illustrate some issues that may arise for other agency programs seeking to use commercial space capabilities. First is the potential for competition. In the early debate over whether NASA should take a commercial approach to ISS resupply, advocates argued that competition between providers had the potential to reduce costs and drive innovation, while opponents expressed doubt that the demand would support enough providers to ensure effective competition. During the period when NASA was funding potential providers to help develop their capabilities, some in Congress saw funding multiple providers as necessary to enable future cost savings through competition, while others saw it as adding to NASA's costs in the near term.", "Second, taking a commercial approach may require agencies to use less familiar contracting models. The traditional model has been for an agency to pay a contractor to develop and supply a spacecraft, which the agency then owns and operates. Typically this model uses a cost-plus contract, that is, the agency reimburses the contractor's costs plus a performance-based fee. For the development phases of its commercial ISS cargo and crew programs, NASA initially used Space Act Agreements\u2014a type of \"other transaction\"\u2014with fixed payments for achieving certain milestones. Other transactions can increase flexibility; can be funded partly, or in some cases entirely, by the company; and avoid accounting and other requirements that companies may see as expensive and cumbersome. On the other hand, they may limit an agency's ability to dictate specific system concepts or mandate compliance with agency requirements. For procurement of actual ISS transportation services, NASA is using fixed-price contracts under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). While fixed-price contracts reduce an agency's financial risk (because the contractor takes on the risk of cost overruns) they may provide for less government insight into the contractor's management of the program.", "Third, agencies using commercial space capabilities may face challenges in ensuring that their requirements will be met. NASA's processes for safety certification of ISS crew transportation providers illustrate these challenges. NASA's plans for certification have been a focus of attention for Congress, NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, and other stakeholders.

Congressional attention to this question has focused, in large part, on the process for interagency consultation on commercial remote sensing licenses. The challenge for that process is balancing industry's need for timeliness and transparency with the government's need to meet national security and foreign policy objectives. The rapidly advancing capabilities of foreign government and commercial satellites make identifying the appropriate balance more difficult, because if sensitive imagery can be obtained elsewhere, prohibiting U.S. companies from providing it may have few security benefits.", "How should federal regulatory policies be adjusted as the commercial space industry develops new capabilities and applications? For commercial human spaceflight, the limitation on FAA safety regulation was instituted to avoid burdening a nascent industry. At some point, Congress may judge that the industry's development is ready for the limitation to be lifted or allowed to expire. For new applications, Congress and the Administration have proposed additional mechanisms for authorization and supervision under the Outer Space Treaty, but other issues may arise in particular cases.
