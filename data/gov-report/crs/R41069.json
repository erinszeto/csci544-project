Such groups are generally formed for some purpose other than obtaining insurance, like employment. When insurance is provided to a group, it is referred to as \"group coverage\" or \"group insurance.\" A common distinction made between private health coverage offered to groups is how such coverage is funded. That is, the plan sponsor may either purchase group health insurance from a state-licensed insurance carrier, or fund the health benefits directly. The former refers to fully insured plans; the latter, self-insured plans.", "Self-insurance refers to coverage that is provided by the organization seeking coverage for its members. Such organizations set aside funds and pay for health benefits directly. (Enrollees may still be charged a premium.) Under self-insurance, the organization itself bears the risk for covering medical expenses. Because self-insured plans are not purchased from an insurance carrier licensed by the state, they are exempt from state requirements and subject only to federal regulation. With fully insured plans, the insurance carrier charges the plan sponsor a fee for providing coverage for the benefits specified in the insurance contract. The fee typically is in the form of a monthly premium. (In turn, the sponsor may decide that each person or family who wishes to enroll must pay part of the premium cost.) Under the fully insured scenario, the private insurer bears the insurance risk; that is, the insurer is responsible for covering the applicable costs associated with covered benefits. Insurance purchased from a state-licensed insurer is subject to both federal and state regulation.", "A majority of individuals with private health insurance coverage are enrolled in self-insured plans. In 2008, 55% of private-sector enrollees were in such plans. This proportion differs when comparing small firms and large firms. In 2008, of the private-sector workers who were employed at small firms with health coverage, 12% were enrolled in self-insured health plans. In contrast, of private-sector workers employed at large firms, 65% were enrolled in self-insured plans. Consistent with these findings is the share of private-sector firms that offer at least one self-insured plan. In 2008, while 34% of all private-sector firms that offered insurance had at least one self-insured plan, only 13% of small firms had such a plan, compared with 63% of large firms.", "To assist individuals, families, and employers in obtaining health coverage, the 111th Congress passed major health reform legislation.

PPACA imposes new requirements on individuals, employers, and health plans; restructures the private health insurance market; sets minimum standards for health coverage; and provides financial assistance to certain individuals and, in some cases, small employers.

The distinction between self-insured and fully insured plans is significant with respect to applicable law and regulation, which, in turn, affects an enrollee's access to certain health services, applicability of consumer protections, and ability to receive financial compensation in a court of law, among many other issues.

The former refers to fully insured plans; the latter, self-insured plans. ", "Organizations that self-insure (or self-fund) do not purchase health insurance from an insurance carrier. Self-insurance refers to coverage that is provided by the organization seeking coverage for its members (e.g., an employer offering health benefits to his employees). Such organizations set aside funds and pay for health benefits directly. (Enrollees may still be charged a premium.) Under self-insurance, the organization itself bears the risk for covering medical expenses. Firms that self-fund health benefits typically contract with third-party administrators (TPAs) to handle administrative duties such as enrollment, premium collection, customer service, and utilization review. Because self-insured plans are not purchased from a carrier licensed by the state, they are exempt from state requirements and subject only to federal statutes and regulation. This exemption from state law allows employers who self-fund health benefits to offer the same health plans in multiple states. ", "With fully insured plans, the insurance carrier charges the plan sponsor a fee for providing coverage for the benefits specified in the insurance contract. The fee typically is in the form of a monthly premium. (In turn, the sponsor may decide that each person or family who wishes to enroll must pay part of the premium cost.) Under the fully insured scenario, the private insurer bears the insurance risk; that is, the insurer is responsible for covering the applicable costs associated with covered benefits. From a commercial insurer's perspective, the total amount of premiums collected ideally will cover the costs of any insurance claims generated by the enrollees plus administrative and other plan costs, and still leave funds leftover for profit. Insurance purchased from a state-licensed insurer is subject to both federal and state rules. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulation of Health Plans", "paragraphs": ["The regulation of insurance traditionally has been a state responsibility, and tremendous variety exists in health insurance regulation among the states. Individual states have established standards applicable to the business of insurance; requirements imposed on insurance carriers range from rating rules and consumer protections to licensing requirements, solvency standards, and premium taxation. For example, all states require state-licensed carriers to offer coverage for specified health care services; these requirements are known as benefit mandates. Some states have many benefit mandates; other states have relatively few. Even if multiple states have mandates concerning the same type of benefit (e.g., mental health services), such mandates may still vary in scope or specificity. Because fully insured plans are subject to state law, those plans must offer benefits that are mandated. On the other hand, self-insured plans are not subject to state insurance rules, so they are exempt from such mandates.", "Regardless of whether health plans are fully insured or self-funded, they are subject to a number of federal standards, albeit fewer than state health insurance requirements. Two federal laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA, P.L. 93-406 ) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, P.L. 104-191 ), have significant impact on how health insurance is provided. ERISA outlines minimum federal standards for private-sector employer-sponsored benefits, including health benefits. (Governmental plans and plans sponsored by churches are exempt from ERISA.) In general, ERISA requires that plan fiduciaries act prudently and in the best interest of beneficiaries, participants be informed of their rights, and there be disclosure of a plan's financial activities. It preempts state laws that \"relate to\" employee benefit plans, but provides an exception for state laws that \"regulate insurance.\" The delineation of issues attributable to the phrases \"relate to\" and \"regulates insurance\" is not clear, and has led to long-standing debates and active litigation over the scope of ERISA preemption. ", "Under \u00a7514(b)(2)(A) of ERISA, a state law that relates to an ERISA plan may avoid preemption if it regulates insurance within the meaning of ERISA's \"saving clause.\" This section \"saves\" from preemption \"any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.\" Thus, the savings clause permits states to regulate health insurance without running afoul of ERISA's preemptive scheme, and states may therefore impose requirements on health insurers that are more comprehensive than the requirements set forth under ERISA. However, under \u00a7514(b)(2)(B) of ERISA, commonly referred to as the \"deemer clause,\" a state law that \"purport[s] to regulate insurance\" cannot deem an employee benefit plan to be an insurance company for purposes of regulation. In interpreting this provision, the Supreme Court has found that a self-insured health plan cannot be \"deemed\" an insured plan for the purpose of state regulation. Accordingly, a plan that provides health benefits through an insurance company can, in effect, be regulated by state insurance law, as well as by ERISA. On the other hand, a plan that is self-insured is only subject to ERISA's requirements, and is immune from state law.", "While ERISA provides for general regulation of employee benefit plans, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) specifically regulates health benefits. The core motivation behind HIPAA is to address the concern that insured persons have about losing their coverage if they switch jobs or change health plans (\"portability\" of health coverage). HIPAA contains health insurance provisions which amended ERISA, the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in an effort to apply broadly to different types of health plans. HIPAA established federal requirements on private coverage and issuers of such coverage, including the availability and renewability of coverage for certain individuals under specified circumstances, limitations on the amount of time that coverage for pre-existing medical conditions may be excluded, and prohibition of discrimination on the basis of health factors. It also includes tax provisions designed to encourage the expansion of health coverage through several mechanisms. Another set of HIPAA provisions addresses the electronic transmission of health information and the privacy of personally identifiable medical information (administrative simplification and privacy provisions, respectively)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Related to Self-Insured Plans", "paragraphs": ["A majority of individuals with private health insurance coverage are enrolled in self-insured plans.

A large firm typically is able to spread risk across a large pool of enrollees, which means it is better able to deal with large health care expenses should they occur, compared to a small firm. Also a large firm is more likely than its small counterpart to have a human resources department that has the expertise and resources to self-fund health benefits. ", "While the ability to avoid state health insurance regulations may appear to be the primary reason for self-insuring, economic analyses do not support this assumption, at least not uniformly. For example, one study from 1993 found that benefit mandates and premium taxation were not associated with the decision to self-insure, but small group health reforms were. Another study concluded that while avoidance of state regulation motivated employers' decisions to self-insure in the early 1980s, by the mid-1980s \"regulatory considerations played only a minor role.\" Such conclusions are borne out, for example, in more recent comparisons of benefits provided in self-insured plans to those in fully insured plans. Researchers have observed that self-insured plans typically include benefits offered in fully insured plans, despite the exemption from state benefit mandates for self-insured plans.
