It also details the House and Senate committee policies for considering such legislation and the U.S. Postal Service's procedures for implementing post office naming acts.", "Unanimity of a state's congressional delegation is required for the movement of naming bills to the floor of the House or Senate. Additionally, the Senate committee of jurisdiction has adopted the rule that it \"will not consider any legislation that would name a postal facility for a living person with the exception of bills naming facilities after former Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States, former Members of Congress over 70 years of age, former state or local elected officials over 70 years of age, former judges over 70 years of age, or wounded veterans.\"", "The cost of dedicating a post office in the name of an individual is modest. Renaming a post office through legislation does not change either the U.S. Postal Service's or the public's identification of the facility by its geographic location. Rather, a small plaque is installed within the post office.", "In the 111th Congress, H.R. 3137 was introduced to amend current postal law to clarify that the U.S. Postal Service may accept financial donations toward the cost of providing a commemorative plaque.

Until then, the names of post offices were derived from a number of sources, including the name of the town or township in which the post office was located, certain neighborhoods, crossroads, local landmarks, and even the postmaster's name or place of residence. On February 18, 1891, Postmaster Miscellaneous Order 87 instructed the clerks of post offices nationwide to utilize the post office names published in the bulletins of the United States Board on Geographic Names when naming post offices. The next year, Postmaster Miscellaneous Order 48 instructed the fourth assistant Postmaster General not to \"establish any post office whose proposed name differed from that of the town or village in which it was to be located.\" The goal of this policy was to facilitate the expeditious and efficient delivery of mail by avoiding confusion over the location of a post office.", "Congress first honored an individual by naming a post office through freestanding legislation in 1967. It named a combined post office and federal office building in Bronx, NY, as the \"Charles A. Buckley Post Office and Federal Office Building\" in honor of the late Representative Charles A. Buckley (P.L. 90-232; 81 Stat. 751). Courthouses and federal buildings, some no doubt containing postal facilities, had been named before that. ", "The United States Postal Service (USPS) came into being in 1971 with its own separate real estate authority (39 U.S.C. 401(5)). All legislation to name USPS facilities then was referred to the House and Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committees, and when these committees were abolished, to the House Oversight and Government Reform and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees.

For example, the 110 th Congress named a Kansas City, MO, post office for the Reverend Earl Abel ( P.L. 110-353 ; 122 Stat. 3983). ", "Other honorees, though, were nationally recognized persons, such as Gerald R. Ford, Jr. (twice), Ronald Reagan (three times), Bob Hope, Cesar Chavez, Nat King Cole, Mickey Mantle, and Buck Owens.

Most congressional districts contain many postal facilities. A few factors might be examined in selecting a post office, such as the proposed honoree's ties to the area served by the post office and the condition of the building to ensure that it is aesthetically adequate. Another factor is whether the facility is owned by the USPS or is leased from a private owner. In the latter case, the building's owner might be consulted. Finally, a search might be done to determine whether a proposed post office already has been named for someone. The USPS has compiled a comprehensive list of all the statutes enacted since 1967 to name post offices, including the addresses, name of the honoree, and reason(s) for the post office dedication. During this process, it can be helpful to work with the USPS's designated government relations person for a Member's home state. ", "Once a post office has been selected, two pieces of information are needed to draft the legislation. One is the precise address of the facility, and a second is the precise form and spelling of the name of the person who is to be honored.

Rather, committee staff keep a list of naming bills and other measures appropriate for consideration under suspension of the rules, or by unanimous consent, to be taken up when opportunities appear. Negotiations between the majority and minority leaders determine when and how the bills are to be considered on the floor.", "Passage by the House has almost always been routine, commonly by voice vote or on a roll call vote that is unanimous. An exception occurred on the House floor on September 27, 2005, when the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 438 was defeated on a 190 to 215 roll call vote. The bill, which would have designated a post office in Berkeley, CA, as the Maudelle Shirek Post Office Building, was intended to recognize a community activist and long-time member of the Berkeley City Council.
