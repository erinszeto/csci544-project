For FY2016, overall non-humanitarian bilateral aid requested for Middle East and North Africa countries amounts to $7.14 billion, or about 13% of the State Department's International Affairs budget request. The State Department estimates that the Middle East stands to receive 35% of the geographically-specific assistance in the budget request, more than any other region.

Likewise, some nations receive assistance from U.S. agencies such as the Department of Defense, which is touched upon briefly below.

U.S. foreign assistance continues to support the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt and the continued stability of the Kingdom of Jordan, which signed its own peace treaty with Israel in 1994. U.S. funding also has sought to promote a diplomatic \"two-state\" solution between the Palestinians and Israel, with legislative conditions aimed at preventing the diversion of U.S. aid for the West Bank and Gaza Strip to terrorist groups such as Hamas. The United States also provides military assistance to Iraq and Lebanon that seeks to counter Iranian influence in parts of the Arab world. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continuity and Change in U.S. Foreign Aid to the Region", "paragraphs": ["While core interests endure, new policy challenges have arisen during the period of upheaval that began across the Arab world in 2011. Since that wave of unrest started a number of governments have fallen or come under severe strain, political conflict and sectarian violence have spread, and economies across the region have weakened. At present, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen face civil wars and terrorist/insurgent violence that are eroding central governance in each country and threatening neighboring states. Across the region, local affiliates of either Al Qaeda or the Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIL, ISIS, or Daesh) are fighting security forces and/or tribal militias in battles that may reshape the map of the modern Middle East. To date, only Tunisia appears to have made continuing strides toward a stable democratic political system, and even Tunisia's gains are considered fragile due to its weak economy and continued terrorist violence.", "Questions over the type and amount of resources the United States should devote to tackling the region's problems continue to be debated by Congress. On the one hand, U.S. bilateral assistance to the region has remained relatively unchanged since before 2011. The leading recipients of bilateral foreign aid appropriations in FY2010 \u2014Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians, and Iraq\u2014remain, with the exception of Iraq, the same leading bilateral aid recipients in FY2015. This continuity reflects, among other things, strong Congressional support for Israel and for peace between Israel and its neighbors. ", "On the other hand, violence in Syria and Iraq has led to some significant changes in U.S. foreign assistance to the region, as the Administration and Congress have used new sources of funding beyond traditional bilateral or State Department/USAID-controlled accounts to address challenges created by these conflicts. Since FY2012, Congress has appropriated and the Administration has allocated or reprogrammed a total of more than $4 billion for the multilateral humanitarian response to the Syrian refugee crisis. Moreover, to cope with the challenge posed by the Islamic State, Congress has authorized and appropriated new funding to the region through Defense Department-administered security assistance accounts. In the 113 th Congress, lawmakers provided the Defense Department with three new train and equip (T&E) authorities to counter the Islamic State: (1) the global Counter-Terrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF); (2) Iraq T&E authority; and (3) Vetted Syrians T&E authority. Funding for these new accounts has come from either new appropriations or authorized reprogramming from Defense Department accounts. Overall, the conflicts in Syria and Iraq account for a greater share of regional foreign assistance due to increases in humanitarian spending, military assistance to Iraq, aid to the Syrian opposition, and aid to neighboring states such as Lebanon and Jordan. For FY2016, the Administration is seeking $3.45 billion in combined State Department and Defense Department funding (military and economic) to cope with the conflicts in Syria and Iraq (See \" Syria, Iraq, and the Islamic State ,\" below).", "Amid this continuity and change in U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East, future appropriations may be affected by two broader considerations:", "Domestic-Budgetary . Due to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the overall foreign operations budget increased significantly during the Bush Administration. For the seven-year duration of the Obama Administration, total State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs funding has been fairly flat, averaging $51 billion a year (enduring + OCO) since FY2009. In order to respond to myriad regional crises within a relatively static budgetary environment, officials have relied on foreign aid funds from accounts designated as Overseas Contingency Operations or OCO. These accounts are not subject to the budget caps applicable to most other accounts that were established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ). In recent years, new bilateral aid to Iraq, the Syrian opposition, and Jordan has been designated as OCO, as has a significant portion of funding for multilateral accounts (IDA, MRA, and ERMA) used in response to humanitarian crises, such as the Syrian refugee crisis. As lawmakers consider FY2016 funding and the possible impact of the BCA on discretionary spending, the House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill ( H.R. 2772 ) would provide $47.8 billion in total funding (enduring + OCO). Global-Financial . As the financial needs of the region's non-oil producers have dramatically increased in recent years (due to the 2008 global financial crisis and the Arab Spring), lawmakers have provided grant assistance and/or loan guarantees to complement other loan packages provided by multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF has provided loans to Morocco ($5 billion in 2014), Tunisia ($1.75 billion in 2013), Jordan ($2.1 billion in 2012), and Yemen ($550 million in 2014). These funds have been provided on the condition of economic reforms. Although these loans, totaling over $9 billion, are disbursed over multiple years, they represent a far larger commitment of economic resources to the region than annual U.S. bilateral aid. The oil-rich Arab Gulf states also have dramatically increased their aid to the Middle East region, largely with the political goal of countering Islamist influence in regional politics and ensuring regime continuity in places such as Egypt. Gulf countries have given an estimated $30 billion to Egypt since the military ousted the country's then-president Muhammad Morsi, of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated party, in July 2013. Iran also provides a range of assistance to its allies in the region, including Syria and Lebanese Hezbollah.

A State Department-managed program funded through ESF, NERD promotes democracy and human rights in Iran (though there is no legal requirement to focus exclusively on Iran). NERD programming for Iranian activists takes place outside the country due to the clerical regime's resistance to opposition activities supported by foreign donors.

A USAID-managed program funded through ESF, MERC supports research and development cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, including the West Bank/Gaza. First established in an amendment to the Foreign Operations bill in 1979, MERC was designed to encourage cooperation between Egyptian and Israeli scientists. Today, MERC is an open-topic, peer-reviewed competitive grants program that funds joint Arab-Israeli research covering the water, agriculture, environment, and health sectors.

The other is that it could undermine political stability if it is seen as indirectly perpetuating the control of society by the military-guided state. ", "On March 31, 2015, the White House announced that, although the Administration was releasing the deliveries of selected weapons systems to Egypt that had been on hold since October 2013 (and although it pledged to continue seeking $1.3 billion in aid from Congress), beginning in FY2018, the United States would stop providing cash flow financing (CFF) to Egypt. Cash flow financing is the financial mechanism that can enable foreign governments to pay for U.S. defense equipment in partial installments over time rather than all at once; successive Administrations have authorized CFF for Egypt since 1979.", "In recent years, as public scrutiny of U.S. military aid to Egypt has increased, some observers have criticized the provision of CFF to Egypt. Critics argue that the financing of expensive conventional weapons systems is based on an assumption of future appropriations from Congress, thus undermining congressional independence and co-equality with the executive. Supporters argue that as the Egyptian military combats terrorism in the Sinai Peninsula and elsewhere, U.S. military aid to Egypt should not be altered.", "The Administration's proposed policy change comes after its lengthy review of U.S. foreign assistance policy toward Egypt, a process that began immediately following the Egyptian military's 2013 ouster of former president Mohammed Morsi, a leading figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. The President's decision to phase out CFF to Egypt is perhaps part of a broader policy approach that may seek to balance national security interests and the promotion of democratic principles in dealing with the post-Morsi, military-backed Egyptian government. The March 31 White House announcement contemplates maintaining a modicum of security cooperation (e.g., ending weapons suspension, continuing $1.3 billion in aid) while moving the relationship away from some of the aspects of its traditional military-to-military foundation (e.g., ending CFF, limiting future arms sales to specific defense categories). ", "To date, public discussion of the President's proposed policy changes has been relatively muted. The House committee-approved FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill ( H.R. 2772 ) specifies that the Secretary of State shall consult with the Committees on Appropriations on any plans to restructure military assistance for Egypt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restrictions on Aid to the Palestinians37", "paragraphs": ["Annual appropriations legislation makes aid to Palestinians subject to a number of conditions, restrictions, and audit and reporting requirements.

Aid for a future Palestinian state; or for a PA government that might in the future include Hamas as a member, or that might result from an agreement with Hamas and over which Hamas exercises \"undue influence,\" would only be permitted if these potential recipients make commitments toward peaceful coexistence with Israel.", "International initiatives pursued by Palestinian officials since 2011 in attempts to gain greater recognition of Palestinian statehood and/or to pressure Israel have periodically led to informal congressional holds that delayed obligation and disbursement of already-appropriated aid. Congress also has enacted conditions that could reduce U.S. aid to the Palestinians, depending on the initiatives taken and their outcomes. Per Section 7041(i)(2) of P.L. 113-235 , the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, ESF aid for the PA is prohibited if the Palestinians \"initiate an International Criminal Court (ICC) judicially authorized investigation, or actively support such an investigation, that subjects Israeli nationals to an investigation for alleged crimes against Palestinians.\" In the past year, the Palestinians have taken a number of actions with respect to the ICC, and the ICC opened a preliminary examination of the \"situation in Palestine\" in January 2015. In response, some lawmakers have called for the suspension of ESF aid to the Palestinians, per Section 7041(i)(2). However, the State Department has stated that \"We evaluate all planned assistance to the PA to ensure we are in full compliance with relevant legislation. We do not consider the relevant restrictions on assistance to the Palestinians to have been triggered.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supporting Tunisia's Ongoing Democratic Transition43", "paragraphs": ["Some observers assert that, amidst the violent upheaval spreading across the Middle East and North Africa, U.S. support for Tunisia's nascent transition to democracy is vital for the promotion of stability across the region.
