Contributions to Roth IRAs are not tax-deductible and eligibility is limited to those with incomes under specified limits.", "The tax treatment of distributions from traditional and Roth IRAs differs. Distributions from traditional IRAs are generally included in taxable income whereas distributions from Roth IRAs are not included in taxable income.
