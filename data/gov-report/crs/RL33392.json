The goal of the Report was to elicit public comment and evaluate the extent of real or perceived problems that content users encounter in their efforts to use these works. The Report defines the problems it identified, and concludes that the problem is indeed real and should be addressed legislatively. It analyzes stakeholders' views on the issue and constraints on solutions imposed by the structure of U.S. copyright law and international copyright obligations. The Report sets forth a proposal to amend the Copyright Act by adding a provision that would limit liability for infringing use of orphan works when, prior to use, a user performs a reasonably diligent search for the copyright owner and provides attribution to the author and copyright owner, if possible. In some instances, when copyright infringement is made without commercial advantage and the user ceases infringement promptly after receiving notice thereof, no monetary relief would be available.", "Adopting many of the suggestions of the Copyright Office, the Orphan Works Act of 2006 was introduced in the 109th Congress, second session (H.R. 5439). This bill was later incorporated into an omnibus copyright bill, appearing as Title II of The Copyright Modernization Act of 2006 (H.R. 6052). However, the bill was not addressed by the end of that Congress's adjournment. The bill would have implemented a limitation on monetary damage liability for specified infringement of orphan works, but took a more detailed approach than the Report's original proposals in establishing requirements for such liability limitations, such as articulating standards for a \"reasonably diligent search.\" The bill would also have directed the Copyright Office to study and report on the implementation of the new orphan works amendment, and to study and make recommendations for a \"small claims\" procedure to address copyright infringement.", "Legislation addressing the orphan works issue was reintroduced in the 110th Congress: the Orphan Works Act of 2008 (H.R. 5889) and the Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008 (S. 2913). The two bills resembled the Orphan Works Act of 2006, although there were substantial differences from that earlier legislation and even between themselves. These additional or revised provisions were added in part to address concerns raised by photographers, illustrators, and other visual artists, as well as textile and home furnishing manufacturers. While S. 2913 passed the Senate, H.R. 5889 did not make it out of the House Judiciary Committee.", "This report surveys the findings and conclusions in the U.S. Copyright Office's Report on Orphan Works and analyzes the orphan works bills that were considered by the 109th and 110th Congresses.

Determining whether a work is protected and identifying the actual owner of the copyright (who may or may not be the creator) is the responsibility of the prospective user. But the identification process can be extremely complicated, difficult, and in many cases, prohibitively costly. There are many components to the determination of whether something is likely to be covered by copyright . The prospective user must first make a preliminary determination as to whether a work is indeed copyrighted or has passed into the public domain. Changes to the term of copyright effected by repeal of the 1909 law and adoption of the 1976 Act, subsequent extensions to the term, and the abandonment of \"formalities\" (discussed infra ), all work to complicate calculations of the likely subsistence of copyright, particularly with respect to works created prior to 1978."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Universal Registry of Copyright Owners", "paragraphs": ["Although registration with the U.S. Copyright Office is most authoritative, there is no universal copyright registry.

At the expiration of the first 28-year term of copyright, a renewal had to be filed to extend protection for another 28-year term. Observing formalities as a prerequisite to creating a valid copyright was abandoned under the 1976 Copyright Act. Under current law, a copyright is created automatically when the creative expression is fixed in tangible form. Copyright formalities were rejected in the 1976 law for several reasons. The legislative history notes the concern that rigid formalities put an undue burden on creators, who could lose copyright protection in its entirety for failure to comply with a formality requirement. A primary goal, however, was to harmonize U.S. copyright law with international treaties and practice, where formalities are not a requirement for copyright protection.", "Nevertheless, changes to U.S. law significantly complicated the process of identifying copyright holders.

A work must be registered prior to the rights' holder bringing suit for infringement; registration is also necessary in order for a owner to seek statutory damages for infringement.", "In the event that a court finds copyright infringement, it may issue an injunction to prevent or stop it, and award monetary damages. Damages may be the actual value of lost profits, or damages set by statute, known as \"statutory damages.\" Statutory damages prescribe amounts that may be significantly higher than actual damages for lost profits\u2014from $750 to $150,000. The amount of statutory damages may be increased in cases where a court finds that infringement was willful or, correspondingly, reduced when it finds the infringement was \"innocent,\" i.e., the infringer was \"not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement,\" or the infringer had reasonable grounds to believe that the use was a fair use under \u00a7 107. A court may also award court costs and attorneys' fees. In other words, registration, with its effect of creating a searchable record and thereby providing public notice of ownership, is not legally required to create a copyright, but to enforce it.

For example, one approach might be that utilized by the Canadian Copyright Board, which reviews applications for use of orphan works and approves them prior to use.

In all other cases, the court may impose injunctive relief to prevent the continuing infringement, but would be directed to consider the harm that relief would cause the infringer who has complied with orphan works requirements in making the infringing use.", "The proposed language specifies that nothing in its provisions would affect other rights, limitations or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use.

Likewise, different users have different goals, such as nonprofit versus commercial usage.", "The approach suggested is in many ways comparable to copyright's well-known \"fair use\" exemption in its breadth and flexibility. Like fair use, the orphan work exemption would be a defense to copyright infringement. The proposal takes a case-by-case approach that would give a court discretion to consider behavior by both the user and claimant. Did the user perform a \"reasonably diligent search\" with proper attribution? Did the claimant decline to accept \"reasonable compensation\" for the identified infringement, which, under the proposal, becomes, in effect, a statutory cap on relief available?

If a visual representation contains identifying information, it may be, and often is, easily removed. Verbal registries cannot adequately describe visual representations, e.g., \"nine abstract dogs in an abstract garden.\" Visual registries may contain prohibitively voluminous entries and be too difficult to search.

In addition, Google would be responsible for funding the creation and initial operations of a not-for-profit entity, called the Registry, which would represent rights holders in negotiating future uses of their content with Google. However, some commentators are concerned that, with respect to books that may be orphan works, the absence of known or identifiable rights holders effectively means that these particular books digitized by Google could not be further used without the agreement of the Registry and/or Google. Others have criticized the settlement for, in their opinion, \"unilaterally giving all digital rights to orphan works to Google.\" ", "Supporters of the settlement noted that many alleged orphan works are not, in fact, orphans, and that the settlement will prompt their owners to identify themselves, or reveal that the works are in the public domain, thus helping to resolve the orphan works problem. Others argue that orphan works concerns are far less for books compared to other copyrightable subject matter:", "First, finding the rights owner of a book is not as daunting as many seem to believe. Books do not present the classic orphan works problem, photographs do. Photographs, both in the physical world and online, often become separated from their identifying information. This makes finding the rights owner a near impossibility. Books, however, always contain author and publisher information, and there's often a copyright registration record to help locate the rights owner. Second, although a copyright-protected book may have been published as long ago as 1923, the vast majority copyright-protected books in our libraries are far more recent.", "In a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee in September 2009, the Register of Copyrights offered her views about the proposed settlement's impact on future orphan works legislation:", "Congress should be particularly concerned about the settlement since it would interfere with the longstanding efforts of Congress and many other parties to address the issue of orphan works. The broad scope of the out-of-print provisions and the large class of copyright owners they would affect will dramatically impinge on the exclusive rights of authors, publishers, their heirs and successors. Such alteration should be undertaken by Congress if it is undertaken at all. Indeed, this Committee has already invested significant time in evaluating the orphan works problem and weighing possible solutions. That process is not over. The Google Book Settlement would frustrate the Committee's efforts and make it exceedingly difficult for Congress to move forward. A much more productive path would be for Google to engage with this Committee and with other stakeholders to discuss whether and to what degree a diligent search for the rights holder should be a precondition of a user receiving the benefits of orphan works legislation, or whether a solution that is more like a compulsory license may make sense for those engaged in mass scanning. Whatever the outcome, Congress is much better situated than the judiciary to consider such important and far-reaching changes to the copyright system.", "In defending the settlement, a representative of Google asserted that the settlement \"is a strong complement to, and not a substitute for, orphan works legislation.\" He disagreed with the Register's claim that the settlement would change copyright law:", "The settlement represents the resolution of a long and hard-fought litigation among multiple parties with divergent interests. The suggestion that the settlement usurps the role of Congress to set copyright policy because the suit took the form of a class action is flatly wrong. The settlement does not establish new copyright law; it is not even a determination on the merits of copyright law. All the settlement represents is the means by which the class of rightsholders decided to resolve the lawsuit.", "It remains to be seen whether the court's consideration of the settlement agreement in the Google Library Project litigation affects the course of potential orphan works legislation in the 111 th Congress. The court granted preliminary approval of the revised agreement on November 19, 2009, and scheduled a final fairness hearing on it for February 18, 2010. The court will consider any objections from class members, as well as conduct an independent review of the proposed agreement, in determining whether to grant final approval."], "subsections": []}]}}
