Since most renewable forms of energy available substitute for conventionally generated electric power (including hydropower), federal agencies will likely meet the 7.5% goal through purchases of wind and solar photovoltaic generated power; an equivalent of 4.3 million megawatt-hours based on FY2007 consumption.

Congress has enacted various laws, since the 1970s, to reduce federal agencies' energy consumption by mandating improved energy efficiency. The 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPAct) included provisions to reduce energy and water use in congressional buildings, install advanced meters to reduce electricity use in federal buildings, enact performance standards to improve federal buildings, and allow for the creation of renewable energy offsets to reduce the federal government's electric energy consumption. The 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) mandated further energy savings measures in government operations, including energy upgrades to the Capitol complex, permanent authority to use \"energy savings performance contracts,\" and federal procurement of energy efficient products and renewable fuels. ", "Federal agencies can take advantage of private financing through ESPCs and UESCs to make energy efficiency improvements without increasing their annual operating budgets. In some cases, agencies may share in the savings gained from reduced energy costs made through the improvements. New authority to combine appropriated funds with ESPCs could further energy efficiency improvements, but the lack of definitive federal regulations delays implementation. ", "In meeting past goals for using renewable-generated electricity, federal agencies were able to purchase RECs without purchasing the associated power. Merchant renewable energy generators in some jurisdictions can usually sell RECs in one megawatt-hour blocks, and may be able to sell them separately from the physical electricity with which they are associated. This provides customers with the flexibility to offset a percentage of their annual energy use with RECs generated elsewhere (but not necessarily transmitted through the grid to them). In 2008, GAO reported that federal agencies continued to rely on RECs rather than site-generated renewable energy to meet EPAct goals. Given the need for firm uninterruptable power, it might be argued that agencies may have been better served buying RECs than taking physical delivery of an intermittent and variable power supply. ", "The DOE Renewable Energy Working Group developed guidance for federal agencies on meeting EPAct goals as modified by EO 13423. Specifically, ", "To comply with the wording of EPAct, agencies must consume renewable energy to count it toward the goal. Simply producing renewable energy on a federal site does not count as use. Purchasing renewable energy certificates (RECs) is equivalent to purchasing and consuming renewable electricity and does count toward the goal (until 2012).", "After 2012, federal agencies will be no longer be able to count RECs toward meeting EPAct energy-intensity reduction goals, as the REC credits will be phased out. To take credit toward meeting the goal, agencies must take direct delivery of renewable generated electricity. To take double credit, for new renewable small generators, the federal facility must host the generator (provide land) and directly purchase the power (with the additional burden of providing backup power). Federal agencies may find themselves reluctant to make underutilized land available for new renewable generation projects if not permitted to credit the projects toward meeting EPAct goals (as in the case of Nellis Air Force Base, which must buy the electricity from Nevada Power). Roof-top photovoltaic generation would meet the double credit criteria, with the advantage of acquisition through an ESPC (paid through annual operation and maintenance budgets). Alternatively, installations may be able to take credit for purchasing power from new small or merchant generators, if their local utility service provides the necessary grid-connection and power purchase agreements with the generator, notwithstanding the additional cost of providing the grid-connection. ", "Utilities may be reluctant to sign up new small and merchant renewable generators in states lacking a renewable portfolio, however. States with renewable portfolio standards (RPS) play a significant role in influencing wind power development, in particular. As of June 2011, 29 states and Washington, DC, had instituted mandatory RPS programs. In 2010, U.S. wind generated capacity exceeded 40,000 megawatts. (For comparison, coal-fired generating plants range may average 500 megawatts in capacity, and nuclear power plants upwards of 1,000 megawatts.) In aggregate, these states are estimated to require roughly 100,000 megawatts of new renewable capacity by 2035, representing 7% of total U.S. retail electricity sales. U.S. solar photovoltaic generated power reached 1,100 megawatts in 2008, with nearly 64% made up by rooftop installations. Most of DOD's solar photovoltaic projects have been rooftop installations in the United States. ", "Even in states with renewable portfolio standards, the opportunities for new small and merchant generators may be decreasing. New wind energy projects dropped off in 2010 due to a variety of factors including limited availability of investment capital and the slumping overall demand for energy. Relatively low natural gas and wholesale electricity prices have contributed to utilities' reduced demand for wind-energy power purchase agreements. A major challenge facing the wind industry is the time it takes to build transmission lines needed to send power to customers. A wind farm can take a year to build compared to five years to build the transmission lines (not including any permitting delays). The lack of transmission line access to markets or willing buyers may also delay wind project expansion. ", "One solution proposed to incentivize new small renewable generators is the offer of a long-term or multi-year contract with a commitment for full contract funding upfront (through a one-time appropriation). Multi-year contracts are currently limited to five years and are contingent upon the annual appropriation of funds. If Congress does not appropriate funds to support the succeeding years' requirements, the agency must cancel the contract. Contracts for public utility services have terms up to 10 years, funded through annual appropriations. Energy Savings Performance Contracts cannot be less than 25 years, but funding depends upon annual appropriation. DOD can enter into 30-year contracts to operate facilities that generate electricity on military facilities, also funded through annual appropriation. In all cases, the contractor understands the risk that the federal government may terminate a contract for convenience. ", "Agencies pursuing long-term contracts with new small or merchant renewable energy generators face certain barriers imposed by PAYGO rules. Annually appropriated operation and maintenance budgets pay for utility spending. Commitments for long-term spending must come from a different account, fully authorized and appropriated in advance. The 1990 Budget Enforcement Act (BEA, P.L. 101-508 ) created the \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) rules, later amended by the 2010 Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act (Title I of P.L. 111-139 ). Under PAYGO rules, any increases in mandatory spending as scored by the Congressional Budget Office must be offset by mandatory spending cuts or increased revenues. In addition, the BEA imposed limits on discretionary spending, that is, on funds provided through the annual appropriations process. Long-term contracts proposed for purchasing power from renewable energy projects potentially represent future unfunded commitments if funded through annual appropriations (much the same way that ESPCs do). Nevertheless, the DOE Renewable Energy Working Group encourages federal agencies to enter into contracts for periods of 10 years or longer (with the caveat \"where not prohibited by law\"), but offers no further guidance on obtaining full upfront funding in advance of the contract commitment that renewable generators would prefer. In the House Report to the 2012 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, the committee reminded DOE of the constitutional provision that \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of Appropriation made by law.\"", "Finally, the federal PMAs already market renewable power in the form of hydropower (as defined in 42 U.S.C. 7372) at a wholesale cost basis. Bonneville Power has already integrated wind-generated power and projects a future annual capacity of 17 million megawatt-hours (6,000 megawatts at 33% availability), which would far exceed the EPAct renewable goal of 4.3 million megawatt-hours. Although PURPA established an opportunity for small renewable generators to sell power and required utilities to purchase the power, the cost to utilities sometimes exceeds the avoided cost. Federal customers could request a PMA to apply to FERC to purchase new renewable power and resell it through their local utility, notwithstanding the additional cost of interconnection. Applying wholesale power rates to offset the cost of interconnection and above- avoided-cost renewable power could provide some federal customers an alternative to upfront multi-year contracting. ", "In considering whether renewable energy goals are sufficient reason to amend contract laws and authorize federal agencies to commit scarce budget resources up front, Congress may also wish to consider whether expanding the role for the federal PMAs might offer federal agencies an alternative to direct contracting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
