Burmese pythons are multiplying in south Florida, becoming a top carnivore and killing large numbers of native species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Zebra and quagga mussels from Eastern Europe are clogging intakes for urban water supplies and nuclear power plants in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basin.

Activities at the Department of Homeland Security, comprised of mostly border protection and security activities, accounted for about $0.8 billion (33% of total funding). The remainder of federal funding, about $0.3 billion (about 14% of total funding) covers activities across a range of agencies at the Departments of Interior, Commerce, and Defense, and other independent agencies.", "Despite efforts to achieve high-level interdepartmental coordination, comprehensive legislation on the treatment of invasive species has never been enacted, and no single law provides coordination among federal agencies.

Some laws, though they do not directly address invasive non-native species control or prevention, have effects that may limit such introductions. Below is a brief digest of existing laws that affect non-native species introduction, prevention, and control. However, control of invasive species is not often the major purpose of the law in some cases, and agencies have little authority to eradicate invasive species, except where they occur on federally managed lands, thus undermining the effectiveness of these programs.

Moreover, grounds for excluding such imports or shipments go beyond the traditional harm to agriculture, horticulture, and forestry interests to include harm to \"wildlife or the wildlife resources of the United States.\" The act's broad definition of harm could mean that nearly any non-native vertebrate, crustacean, or mollusk could be considered for exclusion, because most and perhaps all ecologists would hold that the proliferation of any non-native species in an ecosystem risks harm to the nation's wildlife or wildlife resources.

Permits may be issued to import banned species for scientific, zoological, educational, or medical purposes.

The 1949 amendments of the Lacey Act transformed the injurious species provision into a purely black list law, such that only listed species were banned. As a result of the black list approach, a species that might merit exclusion is not covered under the Lacey Act until a potentially lengthy review process is completed, thus limiting the usefulness of this statute when a new potential invader is first discovered.

If someone enters the United States, or crosses between states, unaware that the plant or animal has stowed away in a hubcap, on a wheel well, or beneath a shoe, and that plant or animal furthermore is not already on a black list, the injurious species provision of the Lacey Act has little or no bearing on the act.
