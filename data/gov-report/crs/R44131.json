At the same time, the Air Force and DARPA jointly undertook a separate UCAV project.", "The Navy's UCAV (referred to variously as N-UCAV and UCAV-N) was designed to fit a relatively small niche. The Navy planned to continue using manned aircraft to suppress enemy air defenses (SEAD) and perform electronic attack. N-UCAV was thus intended \"for reconnaissance missions, penetrating protected airspace to identify targets for the attack waves\" consisting of manned aircraft.", "Although the program focused mostly on system studies, Northrop Grumman independently built a single X-47A air vehicle, which was tested under the N-UCAV program.

The Defense Department recognized the potential for significant synergy by combining the programs, and in 2003 \"directed that the programs be consolidated into a joint demonstration program supporting both Navy and Air Force needs.\"", "The resulting Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program was a DARPA-Air Force-Navy effort to demonstrate the technical feasibility, military utility, and operational value of a networked system of high-performance, weaponized unmanned air vehicles. Missions included SEAD, electronic attack, precision strike, penetrating surveillance/reconnaissance, and persistent global attack. \"The operational focus of this system is on those combat situations and environments that involve deep, denied enemy territory and the requirement for a survivable, persisting combat presence ... operating and surviving in denied airspace.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "N-UCAS", "paragraphs": ["Three years later, the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review called for the J-UCAS to be terminated. Instead, the Air Force was to begin developing a new bomber, while the Navy was mandated to ", "develop an unmanned longer-range carrier-based aircraft capable of being air-refueled to provide greater standoff capability, to expand payload and launch options, and to increase naval reach and persistence.", "That follow-on effort became the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS). Given the baseline of being able to operate from aircraft carriers, N-UCAS's other requirements looked much like J-UCAS, with the desired ability to provide \"persistent, penetrating surveillance, and penetrating strike capability in high threat areas\" \"or suppress enemy air defenses.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "UCAS-D", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, as part of the N-UCAS program, the Navy initiated the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS-D) program, intended to demonstrate the technical feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier. In 2013, the Navy successfully launched and landed a UCAS-D on an aircraft carrier. However, as UCAS-D was a subset of N-UCAS, it did not have a separate set of requirements.", "In total, the Navy invested more than $1.4 billion in UCAS-D.

DOD has decided to conduct a review of its airborne surveillance systems and the future of the carrier air wing, and has as a result adjusted the program's schedule. The Navy's fiscal year 2016 budget documents reflect these changes, with award of the air system contract now expected to occur in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years.
