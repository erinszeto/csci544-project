These statutory frameworks, while overlapping, differ in scope and in their application to students with disabilities. As a result, when students with disabilities transition between levels of schooling, the accommodations and services they must be provided under federal law may change. For example, while the IDEA, the ADA, and Section 504 potentially apply to children with disabilities from preschool through 12th grade (P-12), only the ADA and Section 504 apply to students in an institution of higher education. More generally, application of the IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA to students with disabilities is determined by (1) the definition of \"disability\" employed by each framework; (2) the mechanisms employed under each law to determine whether a student has a qualifying disability; and (3) the adaptations, accommodations, and services that must be provided to students with disabilities under each law.", "Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)", "The IDEA, as amended, authorizes federal grants to states to support the education of children with disabilities. The act requires that states, as a condition for receiving funds, provide students with disabilities a range of substantive and procedural protections. For example, states and local education agencies (LEAs) must (1) identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities residing in the state, regardless of the severity of their disability, to determine which children are eligible for special education and related services; (2) convene a team, which includes the parents of each eligible child with a disability, to develop an individual education program (IEP) spelling out the specific special education and related services to be provided to that child to ensure a \"free appropriate public education\" (FAPE); and (3) provide procedural safeguards to children with disabilities and their parents, including a right to an administrative hearing to challenge determinations and placements, with the ability to appeal the ruling to federal district court. Of the three legal frameworks discussed in this report, only the IDEA is focused squarely on educational matters, and its statutory provisions and implementing regulations specifically detail the rights of children with disabilities and their families in U.S. public schools. Of the three laws examined here, the IDEA is also the only one that fixes an age limit, with its substantive and procedural guarantees applying to persons with disabilities from birth until they reach 21 years or exit high school, if earlier.", "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973", "Section 504 is an antidiscrimination provision within a broader federal law providing rehabilitation services to people with disabilities. Section 504 protects individuals from disability discrimination in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance, including elementary and secondary schools, as well as many colleges and universities. While Section 504 is terse in describing covered entities' obligations, the statute's implementing regulations, including those promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) applicable in the educational context, are extensive. For example, Section 504 and its implementing regulations require all schools receiving federal funds to make their application forms and course materials accessible to people with disabilities.", "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)", "Enacted in 1990, the ADA provides broad nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities across a range of institutional contexts, both public and private, including employment, public services, transportation, telecommunications, public accommodations, and services operated by private entities. In an educational context, the ADA and implementing regulations effectively require both public schools and many P-12 private schools to ensure that students with disabilities are not excluded, denied services, segregated, or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of their disability, unless the school can demonstrate that taking those steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the school's program or cause an undue financial burden. The ADA's statutory provisions and implementing regulations outline the types of modifications that must be made for individuals with disabilities, including the removal of barriers, alterations to new and existing buildings, accessible seating in assembly areas, and accessible examinations and course materials."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Several federal laws address the services and protections received by students with disabilities.

Often the biggest transition for students with disabilities and their families is from the supports and services provided in the preschool-12th grade (P-12) public education system to a college or university.", "At the P-12 level, three main federal laws impact students with disabilities: the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). For students receiving special education under the IDEA or receiving accommodations and services under Section 504, transitioning from the P-12 public education system to an institution of higher education (IHE) may affect how the school assesses their disability, their eligibility for receiving accommodations or services, and the supports, services, and accommodations available to them.

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provided a statutory basis for the Rehabilitation Services Administration and funding for projects and studies supporting the employment of people with disabilities. Section 504 was the last section of the Act and the only section concerned with the civil rights of people with disabilities. That provision accordingly provides broad antidiscrimination protections for the disabled, prohibiting any \"program or activity\" that receives federal financial assistance from excluding \"otherwise qualified individual[s] with a disability\" from participating in, or benefiting from, those programs. Given the reach of federal funding, Section 504's guarantee of nondiscrimination stretches quite far, covering not just the P-12 public schools but also postsecondary education, employment, and access to public facilities as well. And because of that breadth, the act remains a key legal protection for students with disabilities today.", "Students who receive accommodations under Section 504 in high school may have an easier time transitioning to a postsecondary educational environment because the basic protections under Section 504 remain the same regardless of the age or education level of the person with a disability. As explained later in this report, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has developed separate Section 504 regulations covering these different levels of education, including Preschool, Elementary, and Secondary Education (Subpart D) and Postsecondary Education (Subpart E).", "ED's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has a primary role in enforcing Section 504 in the education context, affecting a significant number of students. In the 2013-2014 school year (SY), OCR reported that nearly 1 million public school students received some sort of service under Section 504. And at the postsecondary level, where students with disabilities receive protection under both Section 504 and the ADA, in SY 2015-2016, approximately 19.5% of undergraduates and 12.0% of post-baccalaureate students reported having a disability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act", "paragraphs": ["Two years after enactment of the Rehabilitation Act, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, later renamed the IDEA, which focused directly on children with disabilities' access to education. At the time of the IDEA's adoption, Congress found that more than half of all children with disabilities were not receiving appropriate educational services and that 1 million children with disabilities were excluded entirely from the public school system. Congress determined, in addition, that many children participating in public school programs had undiagnosed disabilities that harmed their educational progress. To address these findings, Congress laid down a clear mandate to any state seeking funds under the act: in order to receive those funds, the state must \"identify and evaluate\" all children with disabilities residing \"within [their] borders\" to ensure those children receive a free appropriate public education.", "The IDEA has been comprehensively reauthorized five times since its original enactment in 1975, most recently in 2004. ED's Office of Special Education Programs in the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services administers the act, and it remains the main federal statute governing special education for children from birth through age 21. The IDEA does so by supplementing state and local funding to pay for some of the additional or excess costs of educating children with disabilities. Of particular importance is Part B of the act, which protects the right of individuals with disabilities, from age 3 through 21, to a \"free appropriate public education\" (FAPE). In SY2017-2018, approximately 7 million children ages 3 through 21 received special education and related services under Part B of the IDEA .

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 12.7% of the civilian noninstitutionalized population were reported to have a disability in 2017 (about 40.7 million people), including 4.2% of all children under age 18 (roughly 3.1 million) and 6.4% of all adults ages 18 to 34 (about 4.7 million).

Thus, to qualify for services under the IDEA a student of qualifying age must satisfy two requirements. First, the student must have a documented disability that falls in one of the categories enumerated in the IDEA, as further specified by ED's implementing regulation. And second, as a result of that disability the student must require \"special education and related services\" in order to benefit from public education. Only if the student meets both criteria will he or she be eligible to receive the principal benefit of the act: specially designed instruction or special education in which the content or the delivery of the instruction is adapted to the child's individual needs, detailed in a plan known as an individualized education program (IEP). Consequently, a child who has a disability not recognized under the act, or has a disability that may require related services but not special education, has no right under the IDEA to the special education and related services provided through an IEP.", "Each IDEA disability category is broadly defined in ED's regulations implementing the act. And that breadth has given states some room to adopt more specific requirements for these categories, so long as those further requirements do not exclude children otherwise eligible for services under the act. Thus, for example, while the IDEA expressly covers a child suffering from some \"other health impairments\" (OHI), the act itself does not specify the sort of disorders that might count as such. In its IDEA regulations, ED has provided a complex definition of that statutory OHI category, listing a series of examples of disorders that may qualify under it. And some states, in their own implementing regulations, have further elaborated on ED's definition, particularly its condition that, to qualify under the IDEA, an OHI must \"adversely affect[] a child's educational performance.\" Delaware, for instance, lists five broad requirements under \"Eligibility Criteria for Other Health Impairment,\" one of which specifically outlines criteria for determining whether children with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have an OHI. When a child's eligibility under the IDEA is due to ADD or ADHD, Delaware's regulation requires evaluators to examine the child according to an additional six factors, and within those six factors 18 symptoms, to determine whether the child's ADD or ADHD qualifies as an OHI.

And also unlike the definition used in IDEA, the definition found in Section 504 and the ADA is broadly functional, protecting individuals with any \"impairment\" affecting a bodily or intellectual function\u2014like seeing, hearing, walking, or thinking. The conditions covered by Section 504 and the ADA are therefore not confined to a particular list of \"disability\" categories\u2014\"autism,\" for example, or \"specific learning disability\"\u2014as they are under the IDEA. As a result, an impairment qualifying as a \"disability\" under the IDEA will generally also be covered by Section 504 and the ADA, though not the reverse.", "Although the ADA Amendments Act maintains essentially the same statutory language as the original ADA, the subsequent act introduced several new \"rules of construction\" clarifying Congress's intent for the ADA's crucial term\u2014\"disability\" \u2014to be construed broadly.

The IDEA emphasizes the importance of using multiple measures of assessing whether children are eligible for services under the statute, requiring LEAs to \"use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic information, including information provided by the parent.\" The IDEA also requires that LEAs use multiple measures or assessments to determine whether a child is \"a child with a disability\" under the act, as well as to determine whether an educational program is appropriate. The Section 504 regulations, for their part, also require LEAs \"to draw upon information from a variety of sources\" when interpreting evaluation data, \"including aptitude and achievement tests, teacher recommendations, and adaptive behavior.\" And the Section 504 regulations likewise \"establish procedures to ensure that information obtained from all relevant sources is documented and carefully considered.\"", "Assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child under the IDEA must be selected and administered to avoid discriminating on a racial or cultural basis. They must also be provided and administered in the language and form most likely to yield accurate information about what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally, and functionally.

Different IHEs developed their own requirements for the evaluation/reevaluation materials students needed to submit to establish a disability warranting accommodations and services. Some universities required students to produce \"recent\" documentation of an evaluation or reevaluation for a disability, while other schools, looking to the IDEA as a guide, instead required comprehensive evaluations that were no more than three years old. Requirements for \"recent\" documentation may apply to returning postsecondary students; students who had been served under Section 504 in high school; students who attended private schools that did not require or provide evaluations to determine students' disability status; and any postsecondary student with a disability whose disability had last been comprehensively evaluated in the ninth grade or earlier. Such students would need to be reevaluated at their own expense to prove that they were still a student with a disability, if they wanted to receive accommodations or supports at the postsecondary level.", "Prior to the passage of the ADA Amendments Act, several courts struck down triennial evaluation requirements used by colleges and universities, as well as requirements that students be regularly reevaluated for the presence of a disability even when they were permanently disabled and had sufficient (but not recent) proof of their disability status.

Consistent with the ADA Amendments Act's purpose of reinstating a broad scope of protection under the ADA, the definition of \"disability\" in this part shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of \"disability.\" The question of whether an individual meets the definition of \"disability\" under this part should not demand extensive analysis.", "Also since the passage of the ADA Amendments Act, IHEs and professional organizations have prepared their own informal guidance for disability support services staff, professors, and anyone else responsible for confirming a student's disability and request for accommodations.

However, as with many other aspects of P-12 education for children with disabilities discussed in this report, there are more specific provisions on placement decisions in the IDEA than in Section 504. For example, the IDEA requires that a placement decision for a child with a disability be determined at least annually; be based on the child's IEP; and be made by a group of people who are knowledgeable about the child, the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options, including the child's parents. In comparison, Section 504 does not require placement decisions to be determined at any particular time interval.

For example, like the IDEA, Section 504 regulation requires that a child with a disability be placed in the regular educational environment to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the child. Under the IDEA and its implementing regulations, when determining a child's placement, states must have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that LEAs are providing a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment (LRE)\u2014that children with disabilities, in other words, receive their education alongside children who do not have disabilities, to the maximum extent appropriate. Section 504's regulations do not use the same terminology as the IDEA\u2014there is no express mention of an LRE, for instance\u2014but both require, in academic and nonacademic settings (e.g., lunch, recess), that children with disabilities be educated with their nondisabled peers \"to the maximum extent appropriate to [their] needs.\"", "Under the IDEA, LEAs \"must ensure that a continuum of alternative placements [are] available to meet children's needs for special education and related services.\" This includes \"instruction in regular classes,\" with the provision of supplementary services when appropriate, as well as \"special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions.\" In contrast to IDEA's focus on a continuum of services to enable an appropriate placement for each child with a disability, Section 504's main concern, as a civil-rights law, is to ensure that children with disabilities are not discriminated against in their placements, so that children with disabilities can participate whenever possible in academic and nonacademic activities alongside their peers without disabilities. In cases where a child with a disability does need to attend a facility specifically for children with disabilities, the LEA must ensure that the facility and the services and activities it provides are \"comparable to the LEA's other facilities, services, and activities.\"", "Unlike the IDEA, the Section 504 regulations do not mandate the use of an IEP, though an IEP that satisfies the IDEA will also satisfy Section 504.

For example, ED has determined that denying students with disabilities access to accelerated programs such as Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes violates Section 504 regulations as well as the regulations implementing the IDEA.

Those provisions range from funding conditions to LEAs' and State Education Agencies' (SEAs') responsibilities under Child Find to the procedural safeguards protecting families of children with disabilities in private schools. Most of the IDEA's provisions on private school placements, however, fall into two broad categories: those related to children placed in or referred to private schools by public agencies, and those related to children enrolled in private schools by their parents. Together, these provisions outline the various procedural, financial, and educational responsibilities of SEAs, LEAs, private schools, and parents of children with disabilities in private schools, depending on who decided to place the child in private school.", "In contrast, the Section 504 regulations addressing students with disabilities in private schools do not address SEAs, LEAs, or parents of children with disabilities.

ADA regulations also prohibit public accommodations, including IHEs, from imposing or applying eligibility criteria that screen out individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations they offer. Section 504 regulations likewise prohibit discrimination in admissions policies, including admissions testing. And the ADA regulations extend those prohibitions to private entities that \"offer[] examinations or courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes,\" requiring them to provide those examinations or courses \"in a place and manner accessible to persons with disabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Free Appropriate Public Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAPE in Preschool, Elementary and Secondary Education", "paragraphs": ["At the P-12 level, the IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA all guarantee students with disabilities a free appropriate public education. Those provisions, while similar, are not identical. Their differences largely have to do with details, but they generally can be traced to a more basic difference in statutory design: \"the IDEA guarantees individually tailored educational services, while Title II [of the ADA] and [Section] 504 promise nondiscriminatory access to public institutions.\" The IDEA's provisions addressing a FAPE are consequently much more detailed than their counterparts in Section 504, the same that apply, according to ED, under Title II of the ADA.", "These differences among the three statutory schemes have also led to some judicial disagreement about how to relate their violations: specifically, whether denying an eligible child the IDEA's procedural or substantive guarantees also amounts to disability discrimination, in violation of Section 504 (and, by extension, Title II of the ADA). At least some of the lower courts have found these violations to overlap, so that a valid claim under the IDEA will \"almost always\" support one under Section 504. Other courts, however, have taken the opposite view: for them, \"something more than a mere failure to provide the 'free appropriate education' required by [IDEA] must be shown\" before those courts will draw the discriminatory inference required for a violation of Section 504. What that something is also appears to vary somewhat by court, but several have insisted on a showing of at least \"bad faith or gross misjudgment . . . before a [Section]\u00a0504 violation [will] be made out\" in this context.", "Whatever its differences with Section 504, Part B of the IDEA nevertheless mandates that every recipient state provide a FAPE to all disabled children between the ages of 3 and 21 residing \"within its borders.\" \"An eligible child [therefore] acquires a 'substantive right' to such an education once a State accepts the IDEA's financial assistance,\" and the state's denial of that education therefore entitles eligible students to legal relief, whether in the form of an injunction for the improperly denied services or money damages.", "What a FAPE entails, and what demands it puts on a school district, will therefore vary from student to student. At a minimum, however, a FAPE consists of \"special education and related services\"\u2014\"specially designed instruction,\" in other words, that \"meets the unique needs of a child with a disability. And for that instruction to qualify as a FAPE, it must also be \"provided at public expense, under public supervision, and without charge; meet[] the standards of the [SEA];\" encompass preschool through secondary school; and conform to the student's IEP. A child's IEP accordingly \"serves as the 'primary vehicle' for providing [him or her] with the promised FAPE,\" by specifying the particular special education and related services that the LEA will provide to meet the child's needs.", "Apart from these procedural minimums, the substantive guarantee of a FAPE remains highly general. And that generality has provoked one of the most commonly litigated questions under the act: What does an \"appropriate\" public education require of an IEP? In an early decision under the act\u2014 Board of Education v. Rowley \u2014the U.S. Supreme Court appeared to set the bar fairly low. There the Court concluded that a school district could satisfy its responsibility of providing a FAPE so long as it had met two basic conditions. The school district had to have observed all of the IDEA's procedural rules, and it had to have provided an IEP \"reasonably calculated\" to \"confer some educational benefit\" on the child.", "But that latter condition\u2014requiring an IEP that conferred \"some educational benefit\"\u2014did little to resolve the basic ambiguity in the IDEA's guarantee of a FAPE: How much benefit would make an IEP \"appropriate\"? The lower federal courts were therefore left to fashion for themselves a more concrete standard for deciding whether an IEP had provided an eligible child with enough of a benefit to satisfy Rowley . On this point some courts took a minimalist view, requiring an IEP to provide at least some educational benefit \u2014a benefit, in other words, that is \"barely more than de minimis .\" Other courts, however, read Rowley as calling for much more, demanding evidence that an IEP had provided \"meaningful benefit to the child.\"", "Faced with this circuit split, in 2017, the Supreme Court took the opportunity in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District to clarify just how much of a benefit an eligible child must receive through an IEP. The Court did so by returning to its Rowley standard: to provide an eligible child a FAPE under the IDEA, the Court explained, a school must \"offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstance.\" \u00a0Thus, \"for a child fully integrated in the regular classroom, an IEP typically should . . . be 'reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.'\" The Court cautioned, however, that an appropriate measure of \"progress\" would depend on the child's circumstances\u2014and especially on the child's integration into the regular classroom. For children with disabilities not integrated into the regular classroom, an \"appropriate\" IEP therefore \"need not aim for grade-level advancement.\"", "Endrew F. clearly rejected, then, the more minimalist view of a FAPE. \"[T]he IDEA demands more\" from an IEP than the \"barely more than de minimis progress\" that the lower court upheld there. A child's IEP must instead be \"appropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances,\" so that that child, like every other, \"ha[s] the chance to meet challenging objectives\" despite his differing goals. Although the Court did not explicitly compare its refined standard in Endrew F. with the view from the other side of the circuit split\u2014that an appropriate IEP needed to confer a meaningful benefit on a child\u2014several lower courts have taken Endrew F. to vindicate that meaningful-benefit standard nonetheless. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit explained, Endrew F. appears to call for an IEP of exactly the same quality that that circuit had expected all along under Rowley . Thus, \"[a]t a bare minimum,\" that standard demands an IEP that includes \"the child's present level of educational attainment, the short-and long-term goals for his or her education, objective criteria with which to measure progress toward these goals, and the specific services to be offered.\" Whether the other circuits will also agree on that \"bare minimum\" remains to be seen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Education and a FAPE", "paragraphs": ["The right of students with disabilities to a FAPE under the IDEA has a still more definite limit: it does not extend to students in colleges, universities, or any other postsecondary education or training programs. Instead, the IDEA requires only that LEAs provide qualifying students with disabilities a FAPE until they exit high school\u2014whether by graduating, dropping out\u2014or until they surpass the maximum age for IDEA services, 21 years old. Section 504 and the ADA, on the other hand, have no such limit. They instead protect students of all ages from discrimination based on their disability, both during the admissions process and while enrolled as a student.

It may include instruction conducted in both academic and nonacademic settings, including in the classroom, in the home, and in hospitals and institutions, as well as instruction in physical education. In comparison, \"related services\" are intended to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education\u2014such as nursing services during the school day for a student who relies on a ventilator. Among the related services provided by the IDEA are speech-language pathology and audiology services; interpreting services, psychological services; physical and occupational therapy; recreation, including therapeutic recreation; social work services; counseling services; and, certain medical and school nurse services. ", "Besides special education and related services, under the IDEA and implementing regulations children with disabilities may receive supplementary aids and services and other supports in regular education classes, and in extracurricular and nonacademic settings, to enable them to be educated with nondisabled children to the maximum extent appropriate. The combination of special education, related services, and other supplementary aids and services a child receives is determined by the child's IEP team, taking into consideration the child's academic, developmental, and functional needs.", "As discussed, the IDEA defines a FAPE as special education and related services that are provided at public expense, meet the standards of the SEA, and conform to the student's IEP. As part of their right to a FAPE, each child receiving services under the IDEA must have an IEP stating the specific special education and related services the LEA will provide to meet his or her needs. Unlike the IDEA, an \"appropriate education\" under Section 504 regulation is defined as the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services designed to meet individual educational needs of children with disabilities as adequately as the needs of children without disabilities are met and that comply with procedural requirements. Note, however, that the IDEA specifically requires the provision of special education and related services, while Section 504 requires the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services. Thus, a child with a Section 504 plan may be served by a \"regular\" education with related aids and services, while under the IDEA a qualifying child must be provided \"special education.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Education: Adaptations and Accommodations", "paragraphs": ["To receive accommodations or services under the ADA or Section 504 at the postsecondary level, students with disabilities must seek out the person or office at their IHEs responsible for arranging accommodations for students with disabilities, request the accommodations they need, and provide the documentation and/or personal history necessary to support their request.
