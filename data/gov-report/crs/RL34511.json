Congress has demonstrated continuing support for nanotechnology and has directed its attention particularly to three topics that may affect the realization of this hoped for potential: federal research and development (R&D) in nanotechnology; U.S. competitiveness in the field; and environmental, health, and safety (EHS) concerns. This report provides an overview of these topics and two others: nanomanufacturing and public attitudes toward nanotechnology.", "The development of nanotechnology has been fostered by significant and sustained public investments in R&D. Nanotechnology R&D is directed toward the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nanometers. (One nanometer is equal to a billionth of a meter. A human hair is 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.) At this size, the properties of matter can differ in fundamental and potentially useful ways from the properties both of individual atoms and molecules, on the one hand, and of bulk matter, on the other. Since the launch of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in 2000, Congress has appropriated approximately $21.8 billion for nanotechnology R&D through FY2016. President Obama has requested $1.443 billion in NNI funding for FY2017, little changed from the FY2016 level of $1.435 billion, but down $478.2 million (25.0%) from its regular appropriation peak of $1.913 billion in FY2010.", "According to one estimate, worldwide public sector investment in nanotechnology R&D in 2014 was $7.9 billion and private sector investment was an estimated $9.8 billion. The United States is estimated to account for approximately one-third of total global nanotechnology R&D funding. Data on economic outputs used to assess competitiveness in mature technologies and industries, such as revenues and market share, are also not broadly available for nanotechnology. As an alternative, data on inputs (e.g., R&D expenditures) and non-economic outputs (e.g., scientific papers or patents) may provide insight into the current U.S. position and serve as bellwethers of future competitiveness. By these criteria, the United States appears to be the overall global leader in nanotechnology, though some believe the U.S. lead may not be as large as it was for previous emerging technologies. In recent years, China and the countries of the European Union have surpassed the United States in the publication of nanotechnology papers.", "Some research has raised concerns about the safety of nanoscale materials. There is general agreement that more information on EHS implications is needed to assess and manage risks to the public and the environment; and to create a regulatory environment that fosters prudent investment in nanotechnology-related innovation. Nanomanufacturing\u2014the bridge between basic nanoscience and nanotechnology products\u2014may require the development of new technologies, tools, instruments, measurement science, and standards to enable safe, effective, and affordable commercial-scale production of nanotechnology products. Public attitudes may also affect the environment for R&D, regulation, and market acceptance of nanotechnology products.", "In 2003, Congress enacted the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (P.L. 108-153), providing a legislative foundation for some of the activities of the NNI, addressing concerns, establishing programs, assigning agency responsibilities, and setting authorized funding levels for some agencies. Certain provisions of this act authorizing specific appropriations have expired; other provisions have not expired. In the 114th Congress, Subtitle B of the America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1898) would reauthorize the NNI. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (S. 3084) would modify certain NNI statutory reporting requirements. Efforts to enact comprehensive NNI reauthorization legislation in the 110th Congress, 111th Congress, and 113th Congress were unsuccessful.", "The products that emerge from these efforts may bring significant economic and social benefits to the United States and to the world; however, substantial research, development, and innovation-related hurdles remain before many of these benefits might be realized. Congress may play an active role in addressing some or all of these hurdles. The issues Congress may opt to consider include budget authorization levels for the covered agencies; R&D funding levels, priorities, and balance across the program component areas; administration and management of the NNI; translation of research results and early-stage technology into commercially viable applications; environmental, health, and safety issues; ethical, legal, and societal implications; education and training for the nanotechnology workforce; metrology (the science of measurement), standards, and nomenclature; public understanding; and international dimensions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Congress continues to demonstrate interest in and support for nanotechnology due to what many believe is its extraordinary potential for delivering economic growth, high-wage jobs, and other societal benefits to the nation.

Congress first supported the NNI in FY2001 and provided increased regular appropriations for nanotechnology R&D for each year through FY2010. From FY2010 to FY2016, however, overall NNI funding has declined by $478 million (25.0%); during the same period, overall federal R&D funding fell by less than 1%. President Obama's proposed funding of $1.443 billion for nanotechnology R&D for FY2017 is little changed from the FY2016 level. ", "In 2003, Congress enacted the 21 st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act ( P.L. 108-153 ). The act provided a statutory foundation for the NNI, established programs, assigned agency responsibilities, and authorized agency funding levels for FY2005 through FY2008. Though no funding has been explicitly authorized for the NNI beyond FY2008, Congress has continued to appropriate funds to agencies for nanotechnology R&D, and the executive branch continues to operate and report on the NNI, as coordinated by the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).", "Federal R&D investments are focused on advancing understanding of fundamental nanoscale phenomena and on developing nanomaterials, nanoscale devices and systems, instrumentation, standards, measurement science, and the tools and processes needed for nanomanufacturing. NNI appropriations also fund the construction and operation of major research facilities and the acquisition of instrumentation. The NNI also supports research directed at identifying and managing potential environmental, health, and safety impacts of nanotechnology, as well as its ethical, legal, and societal implications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is Nanotechnology?", "paragraphs": ["Most current applications of nanotechnology are evolutionary in nature, offering incremental improvements to existing products and generally modest economic and societal benefits. For example, nanotechnology has been used in display screens to improve picture quality, color, and brightness, provide wider viewing angles, reduce power consumption and extend product lives; in automobile bumpers, cargo beds, and step-assists to reduce weight, increase resistance to dents and scratches, and eliminate rust; in clothes to increase resistance to staining, wrinkling, and bacterial growth and to provide lighter-weight body armor; and in sporting goods, such as baseball bats and golf clubs, to improve performance.", "Nanotechnology plays a central role in some current applications with substantial economic value. For example, nanotechnology is a fundamental enabling technology in nearly all microchips and is fundamental to improvements in chip speed, size, weight, and energy use. Similarly, nanotechnology has substantially increased the storage density of non-volatile flash memory and computer hard drives.", "In the longer term, proponents of nanotechnology believe it may deliver revolutionary advances with profound economic and societal implications. The applications they discuss involve various degrees of speculation and varying time-frames. The examples below suggest a few of the areas where revolutionary advances may emerge, and for which early R&D efforts may provide insights into how such advances might be achieved.", "Detection and treatment of disease s . A wide range of nanotechnology applications are being developed to detect and treat diseases: C ancer. Current nanotechnology disease detection efforts include the development of sensors that can identify biomarkers\u2014such as altered genes, receptor proteins that are indicative of newly-developing blood vessels associated with early tumor development, and prostate specific antigens (PSA) \u2014that may provide an early indicator of cancer. Some of these approaches are currently in clinical trials or have been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. One approach uses carbon nanotubes and nanowires to identify the unique molecular signals of cancer biomarkers. Another approach uses nanoscale cantilevers\u2014resembling a row of diving boards\u2014treated with molecules that bind only with cancer biomarkers. When these molecules bind, the additional weight alters the resonant frequency of the cantilevers indicating the presence and concentration of these biomarkers. Nanotechnology also holds promise for showing the presence, location, and/or contours of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or neurological disease. Current R&D efforts employ metallic, magnetic, and polymeric nanoparticles with strong imaging characteristics attached to an antibody or other agent that binds selectively with targeted cells. The imaging results can be used to guide surgical procedures and to monitor the effectiveness of non-surgical therapies in killing the disease or slowing its growth. Nanotechnology may also offer new cancer treatment approaches. For example, researchers have developed a chemically engineered adenovirus nanoparticle to deliver a molecule that stimulates the immune system and a nanoparticle that safely shuts down a key enzyme in cancer cells. Another approach employs nanoshells with a core of silica and an outer metallic shell that can be engineered to concentrate at cancer lesion sites. Once at the sites, a harmless energy source (such as near-infrared light) can be used to cause the nanoshells to heat, killing the cancer cells they are attached to. Yet another treatment uses a dual cancer-killing approach. A gold nanoshell containing a chemotherapy drug attaches itself to a cancer cell. The shell is then heated using a near-infrared light source, killing the cancer cells in the vicinity while also rupturing the shell, releasing the chemotherapy drug inside the tumor. Another approach would employ a nanoparticle to carry three or more different drugs and release them \"in response to three distinct triggering mechanisms.\" Ebola. In February 2015, amid the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in 2014, the Food and Drug Administration provided emergency authorization of a nanotechnology-enabled antigen test for the detection of Ebola viruses. I nfluenza. Medical researchers at the National Institutes for Health are using nanotechnology in the development of a molecule they intend to serve as a universal influenza vaccine that \"stimulates the production of antibodies to fight against the ever-changing flu virus.\" Diabetes. Diabetes is the target of a nano-enabled skin patch that painlessly delivers insulin using an array of microneedles, each of which contains more than 100 million vesicles that release insulin in response to the detection of high glucose levels. Renewable energy . A number of different nanotechnology applications may deliver important advances in renewable energy. One of the NNI's Signature Initiatives \u2014Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Collection and Conversion\u2014seeks to improve photovoltaic solar electricity generation, solar thermal energy generation and conversion, and solar-to-fuel conversions. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has developed a nanoparticle etching process that creates a texture on photovoltaic cells that gives a black appearance which can better absorb the sun's energy. These \"black silicon\" solar cells set a world record (18.2%) for energy conversion efficiency. An application developed to improve solar thermal energy conversion efficiency uses a low-cost, scalable process to produce high-performance nanostructured coatings that enable thermal conversion efficiencies of more than 90% and increases the temperature range for heat-transfer fluids to more than 1200\u00b0 Fahrenheit. In addition, bio-inspired applications seek to use nanomaterials to produce fuels or feedstocks for high-value-added chemical products directly from sunlight. Nanoscale semiconductor catalysts and additives show promise for improving the production of hydrogen from water using sunlight. The optical properties of these nanoscale catalysts allow the process to use a wider spectrum of sunlight. Similarly, nanostructured photovoltaic devices (e.g., solar cells) may improve the efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity by using a wider spectrum of sunlight. Improved hydrogen storage, a key challenge in fuel cell applications, may be achieved by tapping the chemical properties and large surface area of certain nanostructured materials. Nanotechnology offers the potential for improvements in energy storage, a key enabling technology for renewable energy, with at least one current prototype exceeding the energy storage of standard batteries by 40%. Water treatment . Nanotechnology approaches\u2014such as nanosorbents, nanocatalysts, bioactive nanoparticles, nanostructured catalytic membranes, and nanoparticle enhanced filtration\u2014may enable improved water quality in both large-scale water treatment plants and point-of-use systems. Nanotechnology water desalination and filtration systems may offer affordable, scalable, and portable water filtration systems. Filters employing nanoscale pores work by allowing water molecules to pass through, but preventing larger molecules, such as salt ions and other impurities (e.g., bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and organic material), from doing so. Some nanoscale filtration systems also employ a matrix of polymers and nanoparticles that serve to attract water molecules to the filter and to repel contaminants. Agricultural and food applications. Nanobiosensors capable of monitoring and detecting the presence of a virus or disease-infecting particle may enable early, targeted application of pesticides and herbicides increasing crop yield, lowering costs, and reducing environmental impact; similarly, other nanotechnology sensors may help to improve nutrient and water management. Reducing health-promoting bioactive compounds to nanoscale particles can improve delivery properties, solubility, targetability, and ef\ufb01cient absorption through cells. Nanotechnology can also improve the shelf life of products by incorporating antimicrobial properties into the packaging to protect food against pathogens. Nanotechnology also offers the potential for improved nutrition. Some companies are exploring the development of nanocapsules that release nutrients targeted at specific parts of the body at specific times. Self-healing materials. Nanotechnology may offer approaches that enable materials to \"self-heal\" by incorporating, for example, nanocontainers of a repair substance (e.g., an epoxy) throughout the material. When a crack or corrosion reaches a nanocontainer, the nanocontainer could be designed to open and release its repair material to fill the gap and seal the crack. Toxin and pathogen s ensors . Microfluidic and nanocantilever sensors (discussed earlier) may be engineered to detect specific pathogens (e.g., bacteria, virus) or toxins (e.g., sarin gas, hydrogen cyanide) by detecting their unique molecular signals or through selective binding with an engineered nanoparticle. Environmental remediation. The high surface-to-volume ratio, high reactivity, and small size of some nanoscale particles (e.g., nanoscale iron) may offer more effective and less costly solutions for remediation of environmental contamination. By injecting engineered nanoparticles into the ground, these characteristics can be employed to enable the particles to move more easily through a contaminated site and bond more readily with targeted contaminants. EPA notes, however, that site-specific conditions (e.g., site location and layout, geologic conditions, concentration of contaminants, types of contaminants) may limit the effectiveness of nanoparticles.", "Nanotechnology is also expected by some to make substantial contributions to federal missions such as national defense, homeland security, and space exploration and commercialization.", "Estimates of U.S. private-sector nanotechnology R&D funding range from two times the amount of U.S. public funding to more than nine times as much. In general, the private sector's efforts focus on translating fundamental knowledge and prototypes into commercial products; developing new applications incorporating nanoscale materials; and developing technologies, methods, and systems for commercial-scale manufacturing.

During this period, Japan accounted for 26.8% of U.S. patents; South Korea, 4.8%; Germany, 3.6%; France, 2.0%; Taiwan, 1.8%; the United Kingdom, 1.6%; Canada, 1.3%; Australia, 1.2%; China, 1.1%; and the Netherlands, 1.0%.", "A broader measure used by USPTO to assess global patenting activity yielded different results. USPTO examined patenting activity in more than 50 countries from 1986 to June 2015. Using this measure, the United States accounted for more nanotechnology patents than any other country (24.4%), but less than half the share it accounted for in the U.S. patent system alone (50.3%). China accounted for 17.7% of the patents; Japan, 10.3%; South Korea, 7.9%; Germany, 4.2%; Taiwan, 2.3%; Russia, 2.0%; France, 1.7%; the United Kingdom, 1.4%; and Canada, 1.0%. The share of patents attributed to China and South Korea were substantially larger using this multi-country metric than when measured using only U.S.-granted patents. Viewed over time, the U.S. share of nanotechnology patents issued by these countries peaked in 2005 at about 35%, and declined to below 25% by 2015. During the same period, China's share of nanotechnology patents grew from about 4% to nearly 18%, while South Korea's grew from about 2% to 8%. The number of patents issued to U.S. inventors grew during each of the successive time periods included in the presentation, while the U.S. share fell during this period due to a relatively faster rise in the total number of patents earned by inventors from other nations.", "A third measure used by USPTO for analysis identified nanotechnology patents issued in three or more countries. According to PCAST, this metric is a more representative indicator of patents' significance than of patents issued in only one or two countries. By this measure, between 1986 and June 2011, the United States accounted for 31.3% of patents. Japan accounted for 24.3% of such patents; Germany, 8.3%; South Korea, 7.5%; France, 5.1%; the United Kingdom, 3.1%; China, 2.0%; Netherlands, 1.8%; Canada, 1.4%; Taiwan, 1.2%; and Switzerland, 1.1% Viewed over time, the U.S. share fell from a high of about 40% in 2002 to 31% in 2014-2015.", "Analysis of the 35,431 nanotechnology patents awarded by USPTO between 1991 and 2012 shows the United States accounted for 65.1%, according to a 2013 analysis by researchers at the University of Arizona and the National Science Foundation. Japan had the second highest share with 9.4% of patents, followed by South Korea (5.4%), Taiwan (3.3%), Germany (3.0%), France (2.3%), and China (1.7%). The U.S. share of patents awarded decreased over the time periods examined in the report, but still accounted for around 60% of patents awarded during 2011 and 2012. Over the same time periods, the number of patents awarded to several Asian countries increased rapidly. Between 1991 and 2000, South Korea, China, and Taiwan together accounted for 2.0% of all nano-related patents issued to the top 20 nanotechnology-patenting countries; these countries' share grew to 18.3% in 2011 and 2012.

While nanoscale particles occur naturally and as incidental by-products of other human activities (e.g., soot from vehicles), EHS concerns have been focused primarily on nanoscale materials that are intentionally engineered and produced.", "Potential EHS health risks of nanoscale particles in humans and animals depend in part on their potential to penetrate and accumulate, especially in vital organs such as the lungs and brain. Some have also expressed concerns about the diffusion of nanoparticles in the environment. For example, several products on the market today contain nanoscale silver, an effective antibacterial agent used in wound dressings, clothing, cosmetics, and many other consumer products. However, some scientists have raised concerns that the dispersion of nanoscale silver in the environment could kill microbes that are vital to ecosystems.", "The nanoscale dimensions of some engineered materials may be used for beneficial purposes, while the size characteristics of other nanoscale materials may render them harmful. For example, some nanoscale particles have the potential to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, a structure that protects the brain from harmful substances in the blood. Currently, the barrier hinders the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. The characteristics of some nanoscale materials may allow pharmaceuticals to be developed to purposefully and beneficially cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver medicine directly to the brain to treat, for example, a brain tumor. Alternatively, other nanoscale particles might unintentionally pass through this barrier and harm humans and animals.", "Many stakeholders believe that concerns about potential detrimental effects of nanoscale materials and products on EHS\u2014both real and perceived\u2014must be addressed for a variety of reasons, including the following:", "protecting and improving human health, safety, and the environment; enabling accurate and efficient risk assessments, risk management, and cost-benefit trade-offs; creating a predictable, stable, and efficient regulatory environment that fosters investment in nanotechnology-related innovation; ensuring public confidence in the safety of nanotechnology research, engineering, manufacturing, and use; preventing the negative consequences of a problem in one application area of nanotechnology from harming the use of nanotechnology in other applications due to public fears, political interventions, or an overly broad regulatory response; and ensuring that society can enjoy the widespread economic and societal benefits that nanotechnology may offer.", "Since the initiation of the NNI, public and private research investments have sought to better characterize nanoscale particles and to better understand their interaction with, and effects on, living creatures and the environment. Researchers have sought to establish conceptual frameworks for assessing toxicity risks and informing regulatory decisionmaking given the vast number of ways that nanoscale particles might interact with biological systems. While much remains unknown and research continues in the field (e.g., the federal government is supporting $94.1 million in EHS research in FY2016), scientists, engineers, manufacturers, and regulators now have a broader body of knowledge from which they can draw to minimize potential adverse effects of nanotechnology. Increasingly precise knowledge of nanoscale characteristics and interactions in complex systems, and the accumulation of data on exposure to nanoscale materials under a variety of conditions, combined with the ability to manipulate matter at the nanoscale, may enable engineers to design around potential dangers to capture the benefits of nanotechnology while muting its risks. ", "Nevertheless, leading nanotechnology experts assert that much work remains ahead. A 2014 assessment of the NNI by PCAST criticized the status of nanotechnology EHS as:", "(i) a reliance on hazard and risk analysis on a case-by-case basis in spite of the rapid expansion of the technology; (ii) a paucity of exposure, dosimetry, and lifecycle data because of the lack of information about materials in the commercial chain, as well as slow emergence of the instrumentation required to detect [engineered nanomaterial] exposure under complex biological and environmental conditions; (iii) continued reliance on descriptive\u2026animal studies (often poorly integrated with cellular and in vitro data) for regulatory decision making; and (iv) regulations based on [engineered nano materials] as novel chemical substances which, by way of new use rules and pre-manufacturing notices, negotiate access to marketplace without a coordinated approach between Government agencies, industry, and academia.", "However, PCAST also noted positive trends that may help address current shortcomings:", "At the same time, [the current status of nanotechnology EHS] is also characterized by the emergence of mechanistic and systems-level approaches to assess engineering nanomaterial safety, instead of just relying only on outdated chemical toxicology study methods and a growing awareness of the potential utility of alternative test strategies. These strategies decrease animal use and speed up the rate of discovery and knowledge generation by relying on more quantitative, mechanistic, and systems-level approaches that involve high throughput screening, computational modeling, and a variety of decision analysis approaches to improve regulatory decision-making.", "Policy issues associated with EHS impacts of nanotechnology include the magnitude, timing, foci, and management of the federal investment in EHS research; the adequacy of the current regulatory structures to protect public health and the environment; and cooperation with other nations engaged in nanotechnology R&D to ensure all are doing so in a responsible manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nanomanufacturing", "paragraphs": ["Securing the potential economic and societal benefits of nanotechnology requires the ability to translate knowledge of nanoscience into market-ready nanotechnology products.

Generally, they are produced in a laboratory environment in limited quantities with a high degree of labor intensity, high variability, and high costs. To make their way into safe, reliable, effective, and affordable commercial-scale production in a factory environment may require the development of new and unique technologies, tools, instruments, measurement science, and standards for nanomanufacturing.", "Several federal agencies support nanomanufacturing R&D focusing on the development of scalable, reliable, cost-effective manufacturing of nanoscale materials, structures, devices, and systems. In its FY2014 budget supplement, the NNI reported nanomanufacturing R&D funding of eight agencies totaling $93.9 million in FY2013, and proposed funding of $100.3 million for FY2014. In its FY2015 budget supplement, the NNI changed its data collection and reporting taxonomy, eliminating the Nanomanufacturing program component area. Under the new PCA taxonomy, nanomanufacturing R&D funding is included in the Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives PCA under the subcategory \"Sustainable Nanomanufacturing: Creating the Industries of the Futures\" and may also be included as part of the figures reported for other PCAs, the Foundational Research PCA and Nanotechnology-Enabled Applications, Devices, and Systems PCA in particular. Since the other PCAs are not further parsed, it is not possible to identify total funding for nanomanufacturing R&D. The President's FY2017 budget proposes $37.4 million for the Sustainable Nanomanufacturing initiative in FY2017, an increase of $0.7 million above the FY2016 level. NSF ($28.4 million, 76% of total proposed funding), NIST ($4.9 million, 13%), and USDA ($2.5 million, 7%) account for the largest shares of funds requested for the Sustainable Nanomanufacturing PCA in FY2017.

In its report on the forum, GAO stated that participants identified nanomanufacturing as a technological revolution in its formative stages that many experts believe will bring disruptive innovation, job creation, and diverse societal benefits, particularly to the nations that are able to compete globally. The report describes participants views of nanomanufacturing as a megatrend, \"affecting many sectors of the economy and having widely transformative impacts\" with economic and societal impact on par with the digital revolution. Participants identified four areas for federal action: collection and dissemination of information on international R&D investments; international standards development; research efforts to address EHS issues; and efforts to advance U.S. competitiveness.

The paper also noted that among the general public, higher levels of religiosity, a more liberal political ideology, and greater perceptions of risks relative to benefits correlated to greater levels of support for the regulation of academic and commercial nanotechnology research. The paper asserted that \"media attention had a significant influence on [public] support for the regulation of commercial nanotechnology research,\" and postulated that this result may be due to increasing media attention to nanotechnology risks versus benefits in the United States in recent years:", "Growing discussions of risk in media, coupled with the increasing number of nano-based products available on the market, may lead to elevated public concerns over commercial adaptations of the technology. In turn, lay audiences may see a greater need for regulation of the industry.", "This finding stands in contrast to a 2007 survey by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) that found a strong positive correlation between nanotechnology familiarity/awareness and perceptions that benefits will outweigh risks.
