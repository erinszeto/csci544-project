For example, family members may not live in close proximity to the care recipient, they may face the competing demands of child care and elder care, and they may have to manage work with caregiving responsibilities. As a result, family caregiving can lead to emotional and physical strain and financial hardship. These effects are more likely to be felt among those caring for persons with high levels of disability or cognitive impairment. Caregiver stress has been linked to nursing home admission for the care recipient, thus interventions that can reduce stress may also reduce nursing home placement.", "Recognizing family caregivers as an important part of the nation's long-term care delivery system, the federal government has established programs and initiatives that provide direct supports to caregivers, such as respite care, education and training, tax relief, and cash assistance. These benefits are targeted at family caregivers to reduce stress and financial hardship, and to improve caregiving skills, among other things. Other federal programs and initiatives provide home and community-based long-term care services and supports to the care recipient. These programs can indirectly benefit caregivers in relieving caregiver burden by either supplementing the informal care they are providing or substituting with paid support.", "Three sets of policies that would provide direct assistance to family caregivers to older adults are briefly discussed in the last section of this report.

Although the need for long-term care affects people of all ages, the likelihood of needing long-term care assistance increases with age.", "Caregiving assistance to older persons with long-term needs can be provided in a variety of settings, including the care recipient's or caregiver's home; in a community residential setting, such as an assisted living facility; or in an institution, such as a nursing home. Formal caregiving refers to care that is provided by paid individuals who are employed by a long-term care service organization or agency, such as a nursing home or home health care agency, or who are self-employed. Informal caregiving refers to assistance provided by unpaid individuals, such as a family member, friend, or neighbor. This report focuses on family caregiving\u2014informal care provided primarily by spouses and children\u2014to the older population.", "Family caregiving activities include assistance with personal care needs, or activities of daily living (ADLs), such as eating, bathing and showering, dressing, using the toilet, walking across a small room, and transferring (getting in and out of a bed or chair). They may also include assistance with activities that are necessary for independent living, or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as shopping for groceries or personal items, performing housework or yardwork, managing money, preparing meals, using a telephone, doing laundry, getting around outside the home, and taking medications.", "Other family caregiver activities may include accessing the health care and social services systems, communicating with providers and insurers, and advocating for the care recipient. In addition to hands-on assistance, caregivers may arrange, supervise, or pay for formal care to be provided to the care recipient, either as temporary relief from the caregiver's responsibilities (i.e., respite care) or on a more permanent basis. As caregiving needs change over time, formal and informal care arrangements can also shift. Formal or paid care may supplement or substitute for the informal caregiving activities provided by a family member."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Family caregivers fulfill the majority of the need for long-term care by older persons with chronic disabilities in the United States. More than 90% of older care recipients receive informal care, either alone or in combination with formal care. Demographic trends such as increases in life expectancy, as well as advances in medical care, have enabled persons with disabilities to live longer. As a result, the demand for informal care provided to older relatives can last many years. The aging of the baby-boom generation is also likely to increase demand for family caregiving to the older population. Moreover, most older individuals prefer to remain in their own homes and live in the community for as long as possible. Finally, the difficulty of recruiting and retaining paid long-term care workers has placed increased pressure on family caregivers. The growing demand for care provided in the home has focused the attention of federal and state governments on efforts to expand programs that provide services and supports to family caregivers.", "As demand for caregiving to older persons with disabilities is likely to increase, other demographic trends, such as smaller family sizes and increased divorce rates, may limit the number of available caregivers to older individuals, as well as the capacity for caregivers to provide needed care. Increased labor force participation among women, who traditionally have assumed the role of family caregiver, may make them unavailable to take on this role. Also, family members who no longer live in close proximity may limit the direct-care assistance that families are able to provide.", "Family caregivers are diverse in terms of gender, age, relationship to the care recipient, and life circumstances. For many, caregiving is a rewarding activity; however, some may face challenges associated with their caregiving responsibilities. Adult children caring for an elder parent might experience increasing stress or financial hardship as a result of the competing demands of work or child care. Others may experience increased physical and emotional strain sometimes associated with assisting a spouse or parent who has a disability or is cognitively impaired. Research indicates that, over time, a larger proportion of family caregivers were providing assistance to persons with higher levels of disability. Moreover, technical advances in home care mean that caregivers are more likely to assist with medical equipment and medications that require more skilled forms of care in the home, including oxygen equipment, intravenous medications, and catheters. These caregivers may have little training or formal assistance in providing such care.", "The federal government has expressed an interest in directly supporting family caregivers who provide the majority of long-term care assistance to older individuals, as evidenced by the National Family Caregiver Support Program enacted under the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000 ( P.L. 106 - 501 ). Sustaining informal caregiving can offset the need for publicly financed care. However, demographic shifts that may affect the supply of family caregivers raise concerns about whether caregivers will be able to meet the potential increase in demand for long-term care assistance by older individuals in the future. A recent study projects that the disabled older population, even under the most optimistic scenario, will increase by 50% between 2000 and 2040. Over this same period, the share of older adults receiving paid long-term care is projected to increase (from about 22% to 26%), while those receiving unpaid assistance from an adult child will fall (from 28% to 24%).", "Recognizing family caregivers as an important part of the nation's long-term care delivery system, the federal government has established programs and initiatives that provide direct support to caregivers.

Eligibility for assistance through publicly and privately financed long-term care benefits typically requires people to have limitations in or need supervision with at least two or more ADLs. Of those aged 65 and older who live in the community and receive long-term care, more than half (55.6%) have three or more limitations in ADLs, 29.3% have limitations in one or two ADLs, and 15.1% have less intensive needs, requiring assistance only with IADLs (see Table 1 ).", "Among those older individuals who live in the community and receive long-term care, the vast majority receive some form of informal care. For two-thirds of this group (65.5%), informal care is the only source of care provided in the home; another quarter (25.9%) receive some combination of informal and formal care, and the remainder (8.5%) receive formal care alone. Although the presence of formal care is more likely to increase as a care recipient's level of disability increases, half of those most severely impaired with five or six ADLs (50.6%) rely on informal caregivers alone for their personal care needs (see Table 2 ).", "Other factors, such as gender and living arrangement, influence the type and amount of informal care received. Research findings indicate that women are more likely than men to receive any help, but that men receive a greater amount of care. Older men typically receive assistance from one caregiver, primarily their spouses, whereas older women are more likely to have multiple caregivers. Variation in the amount of care may be related to gender differences in the types of care received. For example, men are more likely to receive help with personal care, housekeeping, and meal preparation activities, whereas women are more likely to receive help with transportation, shopping, and home repairs. Those who live with someone else receive a substantially greater amount of informal care than those who live alone. Alternatively, research has found that those who live alone, are not married, and live in public housing are more likely to use paid care.", "Income of the care recipient may also influence the type of care received. Data from a 2002 nationally representative study of the older population found that poor and near poor older care recipients living in the community with severe disabilities (i.e., three or more ADLs) were more likely to receive paid personal care assistance than those with incomes greater than 125% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Greater reliance on paid help among the poor elderly most likely reflects assistance from Medicaid and other public support programs. The same study found that those with incomes between 125% and 400% of the FPL were more likely to rely on unpaid assistance only and received less paid support than those with lower incomes. These individuals are less likely to meet income eligibility requirements for public benefits, such as Medicaid, and may be unable to afford the costs of privately paid care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Provides Care?", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Many Caregivers Are There?", "paragraphs": ["Estimates of the number of informal caregivers range from 7 million to 54 million (see Table 3 ). There is wide variation in these estimates for several reasons, including differences in the definitions of caregiver and care recipient, the amount and intensity of care provided, and the data collection methodology. Methodological considerations include whether the respondent is asked to identify themself as a caregiver or whether the care recipient identifies those who provide care, the time frame for reporting caregiving activities (i.e., past year or no recall period), and the sample size. These differences in methods make it very difficult to compare estimates across surveys.", " Table 3 shows the range of estimates of the number of caregivers from selected national surveys, as well as a comparison of survey characteristics and methodology.

This estimate is more conservative than other survey estimates in part because a care recipient's functional status or disability is measured as receiving help with ADLs or IADLs for at least three months, a more restrictive definition that measures chronic disability, defined as ADL or IADL impairments lasting at least three months, among the older population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are Their Characteristics?", "paragraphs": ["Spouses and adult children are the most common source of informal care to the older population with long-term care needs.

In addition, family caregiving activities are highly concentrated; more than two-thirds of care recipients received informal help from one caregiver.", "Marital status plays a large role in determining the caregiver relationship (see Table 4 ). Married care recipients were more likely to receive help from one adult caregiver, primarily their spouse. Unmarried care recipients were more likely to receive help from more than one helper, most often from their adult children.", "Women are the majority of informal caregivers to older adults. Because women have longer life expectancies than men and caregiving is still viewed by many as a woman's responsibility, wives are more likely to care for their husbands and older widows are more likely to be cared for by their daughters. In the 2002 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), daughters were more than twice as likely than sons to provide care to their parents, regardless of the parent's marital status. However, the percentage of male caregivers has increased during the past few decades. Using data from the NLTCS, researchers reported a 50% increase in men reporting they were primary caregivers from 1984 to 1994. Male caregivers were more likely to be spouses and least likely to be friends or neighbors. However, women are more likely to engage in the more physically demanding aspects of caregiving. A MetLife study of working men and women caregivers found that while men were just as likely as women to provide assistance with IADLs, such as managing medications, shopping, and transportation, women reported more involvement with personal care tasks or ADLs, such as bathing, dressing, and toileting.", "Caregivers can be of any age and face particular challenges based on their own life circumstances, including the competing demands of work, child care responsibilities, and chronic illness and decline in their own personal health. Most spouses who provide care to their disabled elderly spouse are aged 65 and older, with 44% of spouse caregivers in their 70s and about one-quarter in their 80s. Because of advanced age and chronic illness, spouse caregivers may be in poor health themselves. About one-third described themselves to be in fair or poor health, more than 20% reported one or more limitations with ADLs or IADLs, and 17% reported poor mental health, measured by the presence of depressive symptoms. Only a small fraction of spouse caregivers reported they were employed full-time (6%); another 10% reported working part-time.", "Adult children providing care to their older parents are most likely to be in their 40s and 50s (68%).

Although primary caregivers may be more likely to live in close proximity to the care recipient, the same study found that a sizeable group of long-distance caregivers (23%) were the primary or only care provider. Both primary and secondary long-distance caregivers reported living an average distance of 450 miles away. The majority reported managing needed services, helping with IADLs such as shopping and managing finances, and visiting at least a few times a month. These activities were not only time consuming, with half spending the equivalent of one full day a week managing care from a distance, but added a substantial financial burden in terms of travel costs.

Approximately 3.5 million individuals, primarily women, were potentially responsible for both an aging parent and a dependent child. According to a 2004 survey of all family caregivers, including those caring for individuals under age 65 with disabilities, more than one-third reported the presence of a child under the age of 18 living at home. Adult caregivers under the age of 50 were more likely to have a child in their home, compared with caregivers aged 50 and older.

In 2002, almost one-quarter of employees reported they had access to this benefit, an increase from 11% in 1992. Federal initiatives such as the Family and Medical Leave Act provide a limited amount of job-protected unpaid leave to qualifying employees.

Those providing primary IADL assistance averaged fewer hours of care, with about 83 hours per month, or just over 19 hours on average per week. Spouses, who typically assume the role of a primary caregiver, provided the most hours of care to a disabled older spouse, followed by daughters, then sons ( Table 5 ).", " Table 5 also shows that the median hours of care per month, regardless of relationship or caregiver type, is substantially lower than the average or mean hours of care per month. The 2002 HRS data suggest that the distribution of informal caregiving hours is highly skewed. Thus, there is likely to be wide variation in the amount of hours of informal care that caregivers reported providing to an older care recipient. Indeed, the NAC/AARP 2004 survey of caregivers found that almost half of caregivers to individuals of all ages reported providing up to 8 hours of care per week (48%), whereas almost one-fifth of caregivers (17%) provided more than 40 hours of care per week. These data reflect the wide variation in amount of care and a much greater intensity of caregiving for a relatively smaller but sizeable portion of the caregiving population.", "Further research indicates that the amount of time spent caring increases substantially for older persons with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Individuals aged 70 and older with no dementia received 4.6 hours of informal care per week, compared with 13.1 hours per week for those with mild dementia, 22.0 hours per week for those with moderate dementia, and 46.1 hours per week for those with severe dementia.", "Many family caregivers devote significant time assisting older adults during the course of a year; however, caring for the long-term needs of an older frail family member can continue for many years.

They may find caregiving fulfills a sense of duty to the recipient. Also, they may find satisfaction from their personal belief that they can provide the best care to the recipient. One factor associated with caregiver stress is whether the caregiver had a choice in taking on caregiving responsibilities. Other factors associated with high caregiver stress and strain include poor caregiver health and heavy caregiving burden. One study found that those caregivers experiencing high levels of stress because of heavy caregiving burden were more likely to provide more than 20 hours of care per week, to provide care to a recipient with more than three ADLs, to have little to no backup assistance, and to experience problems providing care (e.g., sleep interruption, disruptive behavior by the care recipient).", "Most caregivers report they are in good health. However, factors such as age, gender, education, income, and whether or not the caregiver lives with the recipient are associated with the caregiver's health. Caregivers with increased caregiving responsibilities face greater levels of caregiver stress, which may place their physical health at risk. Researchers have documented several adverse health outcomes related to caregiving, including elevated blood pressure, impaired immune systems, and potential increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Older spouse caregivers who experienced caregiver-related stress had higher mortality rates than non-caregivers of the same age. Research has also linked high levels of caregiver stress to nursing home entry of the care recipient, where having a highly stressed caregiver increases the likelihood that a chronically disabled older adult will enter a nursing home by 12 percentage points within one year and 17 percentage points over a two-year follow-up period. The same study concluded that initiatives to reduce stress among caregivers would also reduce the rate of nursing home admission.", "Providing care to an older person can also affect a caregiver's mental health. Several studies have documented high levels of depressive symptoms and other mental health problems among those who provide care compared with those who do not. In particular, higher levels of depression are associated with caregivers assisting those individuals with dementia. Studies have shown that about 30% of dementia caregivers suffer from depression, and more than 40% report high levels of emotional stress as a result of caregiving.", "Research on caregiver burden indicates that caregivers need more assistance and information on where to find supportive services.

Caregivers that take time out of the work force to care for a family member not only lose wages but fail to accrue savings and benefits, which may place them at economic risk over their lifetimes. Another measure of economic cost looks at lost economic productivity resulting from caregiving activities. In a small, nonrepresentative study of family caregivers, MetLife found that as a result of caregiving, informal caregivers lost a lifetime estimated average of $566,433 in pre-taxable wage wealth, $25,494 in Social Security wealth, and $67,202 in pension wealth. Combined, the result is a loss in total pre-taxable wealth of approximately $659,000 per person over a lifetime.
