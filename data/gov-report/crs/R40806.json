This report explains the legal framework for energy leasing and permitting for onshore lands subject to the control of the federal government.", "The report first reviews the laws and regulations affecting leasing of federal lands for exploration and production of oil, natural gas, and coal, as well as the permits that lessees must obtain in order to explore for and produce these resources. This leasing process has evolved over the last century under the framework established by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA). Oil, natural gas, and coal leasing and production on federal land pursuant to this act are currently overseen by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). Federal lands identified in the area's Resource Management Plan (RMP) as amenable to oil, coal, or natural gas exploration and production may be leased by BLM, so long as such activities in that area are not prohibited by statute or regulation. Such lands are usually leased to the highest bidder as determined by competitive auction. Leaseholders are generally required to pay both rental fees and royalties (a percentage of the value of produced oil, natural gas, or coal) to the U.S. government.", "The report also addresses existing laws and regulations that govern the use of federal lands for renewable energy projects, including geothermal, wind, and solar energy. BLM oversees permitting for these projects. Geothermal projects are leased in accordance with the requirements of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. That act functions similarly to the MLA; lands that are amenable to geothermal projects are leased to the highest qualified bidder. In contrast, wind and solar projects on federal lands are not authorized by leases, but rather by obtaining a right-of-way from BLM. These rights-of-way are issued pursuant to the requirements of Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), and holders of these rights-of-way must make monthly rental payments to the U.S. government.", "This framework provides BLM and the federal government with flexibility to use federal lands to help satisfy the nation's energy needs, while generating revenue for the federal government and protecting environmentally sensitive areas."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["A variety of interrelated statutes and agency regulations govern leasing and permitting for energy exploration and production on federal lands.

Oil, natural gas, and coal exploration and production on federal lands are generally governed by the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA) as amended. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency that is part of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), administers the MLA. Generally, the lessee is authorized to explore for and ultimately produce oil, natural gas, or coal on federal lands in exchange for lease payments and royalties paid to the U.S. government on the production. BLM authorizes exploration activities and production activities for lessees only upon lessees' request for permission to engage in these activities on the leased land.", "The second category pertains to renewable energy projects. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), solar and wind projects are often undertaken pursuant to a right-of-way or similar property interest.

The enactment of the MLA in 1920 ended the private acquisition of title to onshore federal lands by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for exploration and to lease lands containing oil, coal, natural gas, and other defense-related minerals.

Because of these characteristics, BLM has been active in consideration and promotion of wind and solar energy projects on the lands that it manages.", "As with oil, gas, and geothermal leasing, not all federal lands are available for wind and solar renewable energy project rights-of-way. Lands designated as Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Study Areas, National Monuments, National Conservation Areas (with the notable exception of the California Desert Conservation Area), National Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Historic and Scenic Trails are categories of land not open to solar and wind energy development. In addition, some special management areas, such as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, may not be suitable for development.", "Title V of FLPMA authorizes BLM and the Secretary of Agriculture (managing Forest Service lands) to \"grant, issue or renew rights-of-way over, upon, under or through\" their administered lands for \"systems for generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy.\" Neither Title V of FLPMA nor the accompanying regulations address wind or solar energy projects specifically. However, because wind and solar projects on federal lands are conducted via rights-of-way, many of the provisions of FLPMA and the accompanying regulations are relevant.", "The agencies may exercise their discretion to grant rights-of-way on any lands under their jurisdiction, unless (1) prohibited by a statute, regulation or order that specifically excludes rights-of-way; (2) the lands are specifically segregated or withdrawn from the use contemplated by the right-of-way; or (3) the agency has identified the area in land use plans as inappropriate for right-of-way uses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM Rights-of-Way", "paragraphs": ["Parties applying for BLM rights-of-way for development of wind or solar energy projects must satisfy a number of requirements in their application, as set forth by the Secretary of the Interior.

Applications for rights-of-way on BLM lands must be accompanied by a processing fee as set forth in BLM regulations.", "Rights-of-way granted by BLM function differently from leases in several respects. Perhaps the most significant difference between leases and rights-of-way are the substantial rights to use of the land in question retained by the lessor, the United States.

Rights-of-way may also completely prohibit use of the land until BLM has approved a Plan of Development for the land and issued a Notice to Proceed to the right-of-way holder.
