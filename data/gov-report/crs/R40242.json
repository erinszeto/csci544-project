To some extent, a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade program would produce similar effects: Both are estimated to increase the price of fossil fuels, which would ultimately be borne by consumers, particularly households. Although there are multiple tools available to policymakers that could control GHG emissions\u2014including existing statutory authorities\u2014this report focuses on a carbon tax approach and how it compares to its more frequently discussed counterpart: cap-and-trade.", "If policymakers had perfect information regarding the market, either a price (carbon tax) or quantity control (cap-and-trade system) instrument could be designed to achieve the same outcome. Because this market ideal does not exist, preference for a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program ultimately depends on which variable one wants to control\u2014emissions or costs. Although there are several design mechanisms that could blur the distinction, the gap between price control and quantity control can never be completely overcome.", "A carbon tax has several potential advantages. With a fixed price ceiling on emissions (or their inputs\u2014for example, fossil fuels), a tax approach would not cause additional volatility in energy prices. A set price would provide industry with better information to guide investment decisions: e.g., efficiency improvements, equipment upgrades. Economists often highlight a relative economic efficiency advantage of a carbon tax, but this potential advantage rests on assumptions\u2014about the expected costs and benefits of climate change mitigation\u2014that are uncertain and controversial. Some contend that a carbon tax may provide implementation advantages: greater transparency, reduced administrative burden, and relative ease of modification.", "The primary disadvantage of a carbon tax is that it would yield uncertain emission control. Some argue that the potential for irreversible climate change impacts necessitates the emissions certainty that is only available with a quantity-based instrument (e.g., cap-and-trade). Although it may present implementation challenges, policymakers could devise a tax program that allows some short-term emission fluctuations, while progressing toward a long-term emission reduction objective. Proponents argue that short-term emission fluctuations would be preferable to the price volatility that might be expected with a cap-and-trade system.", "Although a carbon tax could possibly face more political obstacles than a cap-and-trade program, some of these obstacles may be based on misunderstandings of the differences between the two approaches or on assumptions that the tax would be set too low to be effective.

One option (of many, see text box below\u2014\"Other Policy Options for Addressing GHG Emissions\") for controlling GHG emissions is to apply a tax or fee on GHG emissions or the inputs that create them. This type of approach is commonly called (and referred to in this report as) a carbon tax, whether it would apply to CO 2 emissions alone or to multiple GHGs, including some that may have no molecular carbon. This report does not provide a comprehensive comparison and analysis of the multiple policy tools available to Congress that would address climate change. Instead, this report focuses on the policy considerations of using a carbon tax to control GHG emissions.", "Governments may impose taxes for a variety of purposes. The primary reason that governments impose taxes is to raise revenue to fund various objectives or services: e.g., national defense, public education, social security, etc. Generally, governments raise these revenue streams by placing a tax on activities that are recognized as desirable (\"economic goods\") such as income, employment, and investment. While this tax placement ensures a relatively steady flow of revenue (often the primary objective of the tax), economists generally describe such taxes as distortionary, because the taxes discourage the \"good\" activity. For example, many economists have argued that payroll and income taxes discourage employment and investment. If these taxes were reduced, the incentives to increase labor and investment would be greater.", "Economists maintain that levying a charge on pollution (sometimes referred to as a Pigouvian tax) would be an efficient way to correct an inherent failure in a particular market. A basic economics principle is that market prices may not reflect the social cost of resource use (e.g., fossil fuel combustion) when economic activities result in pollution (e.g., CO 2 emissions). If social costs are not included, the market price of the resources will not reflect their true costs. For example, in terms of climate change policy, the price of using fossil fuels, particularly coal, does not reflect the costs\u2014that is, climate change-related damages\u2014associated with CO 2 emissions.", "In economics parlance, the social cost not reflected in the market price is called an \"externality.\" A pollution tax would internalize the external costs by making the party who profits from the polluting activity include the external costs in the price of the good or service. Policymakers could place a pollution tax on GHG emissions or the inputs that create them. By attaching a price to GHG emissions, a carbon tax would stimulate GHG emission reduction. If the tax were placed on emissions, entities directly subject to the tax, such as power plants, would have an incentive to take actions\u2014for example, energy efficiency improvements or equipment upgrades\u2014to lower tax payments. If the tax were placed on emission inputs\u2014for example, fossil fuels\u2014the price of carbon-intensive energy sources, primarily coal, would increase relative to low-carbon fuels ( Table A-1 of this report\u2014located in the Appendix \u2014 includes estimates of price increases to fossil fuels and motor gasoline based on different carbon tax rates). Energy consumers\u2014for example, power plants, industry, households, etc.\u2014would be encouraged to (1) switch to less carbon-intensive fuels; (2) use less energy or use energy more efficiently; and (3) prefer products or services that are lower-priced by virtue of incorporating less emission tax. Each of these activities would reduce GHG emissions compared to a business-as-usual track.", "These expected behavioral changes mirror the activities that are forecast for a potential cap-and-trade program. Both a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade system would place a price on carbon. Both a carbon tax and cap-and-trade system are intended (and expected) to increase the price of coal, oil, and natural gas. Under either program, these price increases would ultimately be borne by energy consumers, both businesses and households. These price increases are integral to a market-based approach to GHG emission reduction, because they send more accurate information to purchasers about the full cost of their choices.", "This report begins with an overview of the fundamental choices involved between a cost (tax) and a quantity (cap) control instrument. This includes a discussion of policy tools that could be employed to bridge the gap between a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade program. Following this overview, the report analyzes the potential advantages and disadvantages of a carbon tax. In many cases, carbon tax attributes are compared with those of a cap-and-trade program.

At this point in the figure, the abatement costs equal benefits received from abatement. Per economic theory, emission abatement above or below this point would not be economically efficient. The dashed lines indicate the efficient price (tax) and quantity (cap) limits. This figure illustrates that (with perfect information) if either a tax or cap is selected, both the emission abatement level and cost of abatement would be identical. For instance, if a cap were chosen, covered sources (e.g., power plants) would abate emissions until they reach the cap of Q*, at which point the marginal cost of abatement would equal P*. If a tax were chosen, sources would abate emissions until the marginal cost of abatement reached the tax level (P*), at which point the emission abatement level equals Q*.

These benefit and cost curves are influenced by multiple variables, including uncertain future emission baselines. Baseline estimates are related to projected population levels and economic growth, factors that are also unknown and difficult to predict. Another uncertain factor, which will have a substantial influence over mitigation costs, is the development and deployment of low-carbon technology.", "Without accurate information regarding marginal costs and benefits, policymakers cannot know the efficient quantity or price from which to establish an emissions cap or carbon tax.

Borrowing: Covered sources may borrow (typically at a relatively high interest rate) emission allowances allotted to future years. The ability to borrow allowances from future years should help control price spikes. Market oversight: Congress could create a regulatory mechanism (e.g., an oversight board) to observe the allowance market and implement cost-relief measures if necessary. Obviously, the authority granted to the delegated entity would determine its ability to affect program costs. Safety valve: Generally triggered by prices in the allowance markets, safety valves may include (1) a set price alternative to making reductions or buying allowances at the market price, (2) a slowdown in tightening the emissions cap, and (3) lengthening of the time allowed for compliance. The first type would move the program closest to price control by setting a ceiling on allowance prices and limiting their volatility. Auctioning allowances: Auctions may be used to allocate some or all of the emission allowances. Like a carbon tax, auctions would raise revenues to support various objectives. In addition, auctions would support price discovery. Reserve price: A reserve price is a price below which the seller refuses to part with the item for sale.

In contrast, a relatively steep marginal cost curve suggests that each additional unit (i.e., ton of CO 2 ) of emission abatement entails a greater cost than the previous unit. Some economists argue that the slope of the marginal benefits curve is flat relative to the marginal cost curve. This notion is the subject of intense debate, but it is grounded in the scientific processes (discussed below) through which GHG emissions generate climate change impacts.", "Based on this (assumed) relationship between the expected slopes of costs and benefits, a carbon tax would be more efficient than an emissions cap. Figure 3 and Figure 4 below illustrate this concept. Figure 3 provides a scenario in which the marginal benefits curve is flatter than the marginal costs curve. Without precise information regarding marginal costs and benefits, policymakers would base a tax or cap on estimates of the marginal cost and benefit curves. These are represented in Figure 3 as the expected marginal costs and benefits of GHG emission abatement. The intersection of the expected marginal abatement cost and benefit curves would be the estimated economically efficient point of regulation. From this efficient point, policymakers could apply either an emissions cap or carbon tax\u2014at Q* or P*, respectively. Either option would produce the same outcome, if the expected marginal cost curve matches the actual marginal cost curve.", "However, the actual cost curve is unlikely to match the expected cost curve. Therefore, some level of economic inefficiency will exist with either a tax or an emissions cap. However, the policies are expected to yield different levels of inefficiencies. For example, consider a scenario ( Figure 3 ) in which actual marginal abatement costs are higher than expected . If policymakers were to apply a carbon tax (P* in the figure) directly to emissions, emission sources would abate emissions until the marginal cost of abatement equals the carbon tax. This occurs at Point A , at which time covered sources would pay the tax for any additional emissions. On the other hand, if policymakers employed an emissions cap (Q*), covered sources would abate emissions until Point B , when the cap is met.", "With a tax instrument in Figure 3 , under higher-than-expected costs, covered sources would abate less than the optimal level\u2014the intersection of benefits and actual costs; with an emissions cap, sources would abate more than the optimal level.

Many would assert this is the case, based on the process by which GHG emissions generate damages. In the context of climate change, the damages related to GHG emissions are due to their concentration (referred to as \"stock\") in the atmosphere, as opposed to their annual flow. By comparison, more traditional air pollutants (e.g., sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide) impose damages through their annual emission flows.", "With a \"stock pollutant\" like CO 2 , the processes involved in adding or removing the gas from the atmosphere are measured, not in years, but in decades (or centuries for some gases). The current stock of CO 2 in the atmosphere is approximately 3,000 gigatons; in 2004, the entire world emitted roughly 30 gigatons of CO 2 . Because emission quantities would have only a minor effect on the accumulation of CO 2 in the atmosphere, the benefits from controlling the stock (or the damages from business-as-usual activities) are thought to occur slowly and steadily. Figure A-1 in the Appendix illustrates this concept.", "However, the assertion that the benefits curve is flat assumes that there are no climatic \"tipping points.\" Some scientists maintain that at a certain stock level\u2014concentration of GHG emissions in the atmosphere\u2014particularly drastic events might occur. By definition, a tipping point implies that when it is reached, the course of climate change is abrupt and the marginal benefits curve becomes very steep. The climate changes may even be irreversible and catastrophic, at least for some populations and environments. Examples often cited include collapse of Greenland's ice sheet; and dieback of the Amazon rainforest.", "If such tipping points exist, they would dramatically alter the shape of the benefits curve, because abating emissions to avoid large adverse consequences would yield large benefits. As argued by the Stern Review: \"over the long term, as the stock of GHGs grows, marginal damages are likely to rise and \u2013 as the stock reaches critical levels \u2013 marginal damages may rise sharply. In other words, the damage function is likely to be strongly convex.\" However, the Stern Review also notes that: \"to the extent that damages may relate to the rate of climate change, the relationship is more complex, but it remains true that the damage curve is likely to respond most to cumulative emissions over several years or even decades.\" Depending on whether the tipping points are \"several years\" or \"decades\" away, an emissions cap may be preferred.", "However, scientists and policymakers have very poor information regarding the GHG concentration levels (or rates of concentration changes) at which tipping points may occur.

Thus, the static analysis is over-simplistic, because (by definition) it assumes that activities in different time periods are unrelated.
