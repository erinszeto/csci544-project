The ways in which the proposed budget would address each objective are examined below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Repair and Reform the Financial System", "paragraphs": ["Progress in meeting the first objective would hinge on how the proposed budget would affect Treasury's management of several programs (such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP) put in place in the past year and a half to stabilize financial markets, prevent a recurrence of the credit crisis that severely disrupted the functioning of those markets in 2008 and 2009, and promote a recovery in housing sales and prices.", "According to Treasury budget documents, several components of the budget proposal for FY2011 would promote the repair and reform of the financial system. One is the requested $41 million increase in funding for departmental offices. Nearly half of that amount would be used to bolster the analytical and policymaking capabilities of the Office of Domestic Finance ($17 million), the Office of Tax Policy ($2 million), and the Office of Domestic Economic Policy ($2 million), with the overriding aim of preventing another collapse in financial markets on the scale of 2008.", "Another element of the budget proposal that might foster repair and reform in the financial system is Treasury's management of TARP. Treasury's authority to manage the program expired on October 3, 2010. To strengthen oversight of the program, the budget request would more than double funding for the Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP), from $23.3 million in FY2010 to $49.6 million in FY2011. SIGTARP's top priority is to promote the effective and efficient management and operation of TARP through transparent decision making, coordinated oversight, and enforcement of statutes prohibiting waste, fraud, and abuse in the use of TARP funds. Of the requested funding for SIGTARP, $21 million would be used to conduct audits of Treasury's management of TARP, and the other $29 million would cover the cost of conducting criminal and civil investigations of persons and entities inside and outside the federal government suspected of misusing TARP funds.", "Repairing and reforming the financial system are also cited as a rationale for a proposed overhaul of the CDFI Fund. The proposed budget would boost funding for a merit-based grant program (known as the CDFI Program) by 30%, in an effort to expand the availability of affordable credit, financial services, business investment, and technical assistance in economically distressed communities. It would also create two new CDFI programs: the Bank on USA initiative and the Healthy Food Financing Initiative. To help defray the cost of the three initiatives, two current CDFI programs would be dropped: the Capital Magnet Fund and the Bank Enterprise Awards program. In FY2010, a total of $105 million was provided for both. In addition, the Obama Administration is asking Congress to grant $5 billion in allocation authority for the New Markets tax credit in 2010 and in 2011; the credit, which expired at the end of 2009, is designed to stimulate private investment in low-income communities through a competitive selection process administered by the CDFI Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improve Voluntary Tax Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Taxpayer compliance is a top priority for the Treasury Department in FY2011 largely because of the gross federal tax gap, which is the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid in full on time, before collection actions are taken.

The proposals are intended to improve the efficiency of tax collection, \"with minimum additional burden on taxpayers.\" They can be placed into four categories: expanding penalties, strengthening tax administration, improving business compliance, and expanding information reporting. Treasury officials estimate that if enacted, the proposals could boost tax collection by $26 billion over the next 10 years. ", "Most of the requested increase in appropriations for the IRS in FY2011 would be used for purposes tied directly or indirectly to the objective of improving tax compliance. Of the additional $487 million, $293 million would be channeled into enforcement activities, $123 million into the agency's business systems modernization (BSM) program, $43 million into taxpayer services, $24 million into operations support, and $3.5 million into administration of the health coverage tax credit established by the Trade Act of 2002.", "The added funds for enforcement would be used to bolster recent compliance programs aimed at reducing offshore tax evasion, underreporting of income, and tax evasion by corporations and upper-income individuals.

One widely used avenue for such assistance is the agency's toll-free telephone service. About half of the requested $43 million increase in funding for taxpayer services in FY2011 would be used to upgrade this service by raising the answer rate from a projected 71% of incoming calls in FY2010 to 75% in FY2011. The $21 million that would be spent for this purpose would come from $12 million in additional appropriated funds and a transfer of about $9 million in funding for the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS), low-income taxpayer clinic (LITC) grants, the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program, and volunteer income tax assistance (VITA) grants in FY2010.", "In addition, the entire proposed increase in funding for operations support would be used to sustain current efforts to improve the IRS.gov website infrastructure and redesign the website to meet expected growth in demand for electronic tax services and taxpayer assistance.

Much of the requested funding is intended to enable Treasury's bureaus to meet their statutory responsibilities or core missions in spite of projected sizable federal budget deficits and expanding demand for their services. In some cases, the budget request assigns a high priority to providing required services at a reduced cost to taxpayers; in others, added funding is being sought to satisfy a perceived need for expanded operations.", "For instance, the budget request would allow the Treasury Department to reap $315 million in savings from discretionary spending and added savings from mandatory programs in FY2011. Some of the savings would come from reduced operating costs. Such is the case with three bureaus whose funding would be cut: FinCEN would lose $11 million, FMS $9 million, and the BPD $6 million. FinCEN would receive less money for two reasons: a new source of funding (i.e., the Treasury Forfeiture Fund) would cover the estimated cost ($8.3 million) of continuing the bureau's information technology modernization program, and improved operating efficiencies would result in $3 million in cost savings. Requested funding for FMS is 3.6% below the amount enacted for FY2010 because a $5 million increase in employee compensation would be more than offset by $13 million in improved operating efficiencies. And requested funding for BDP is also lower because of proposed gains in operating efficiencies.", "The proposed budget would also raise funding for Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) by 59%, from $65 million in FY2010 to $103 million in FY2011. TFI develops and implements strategies to counter terrorist financing, money laundering, and other financial crimes; it also imposes and enforces trade and financial sanctions on designated countries (e.g., Burma, Iran, and North Korea) in support of foreign policy aims, such as halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons and combating terrorism. Some of the requested increase in funding would go to the Office of Intelligence Analysis under TFI to improve the collection and dissemination of intelligence in support of the department's worldwide anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing initiatives.", "In a departure from current practice, the requested budget would shift the cost of regulating the production, distribution, and sale of alcohol and tobacco products from taxpayers to private companies. Funding for ATB, the bureau that does the regulating, would come entirely from the collection of annual licensing and registration fees, which would total an estimated $106 million in FY2011. By contrast, $103 million in appropriated funds was provided to cover the cost of ATB operations during FY2010.", "In addition, the budget request calls for a cancellation (or withdrawal) of $62 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF). The fund serves as the receipt account for the deposit of assets of criminal enterprises seized by five federal agencies, including the IRS and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau at the Department of Homeland Security.

", "There were several areas of agreement between the board's recommendation and the budget request. Most notably, both budgets called for spending a total of $5.8 billion on enforcement initiatives and $387 million on the BSM program in FY2011. The board endorsed the requested increase of $247 million in funding for enforcement on the grounds that it \"allows the IRS to move forward with its enforcement programs while assimilating new enforcement staff hired during the last two years.\" The requested $122 million increase in BSM funding would boost the budget for the program to a level that the board has long recommended and, in the board's judgment, that would allow the IRS to continue the critical task of upgrading its information systems to better manage the agency's central database and taxpayer accounts, process electronic returns, and handle growing demands from taxpayers and Congress on the agency's resources.", "But there were some significant areas of disagreement as well. Specifically, the board argued that more funds should be directed at taxpayer services and operations support, if the IRS is to meet the strategic goals set forth in its current five-year strategic plan, which covers the period from FY2009 to FY2013. The board's preferred budget would provide $2.374 billion for taxpayer services (or $52 million more than the amount requested by the Administration) and $4.337 billion for operations support (or $229 million more than the request). On the matter of taxpayer services, the board recommended that the following steps be taken: spend more than the budget request to improve the level of service through IRS toll-free telephone assistance; rescind the proposed $9 million cutback in funding for the TAS, LITC grants, the TCE program, and VITA grants; and provide $21 million in funding for four new initiatives to improve taxpayer service, including $8.4 million for research on the complexity of the tax code and its implications for taxpayer compliance. Nearly half of the funding for operations support is used to operate, maintain, and develop IRS's \"legacy\" information technology (IT) systems, which fall outside the scope of the BSM program.

Still, S. 3677 would provide the requested funding for additional staff to support the department's expanded role in federal efforts to prevent future financial crises on the scale of the meltdown in financial markets in 2007 and 2008. In addition, the bill recommends that $1 million be spent on a study of the long-term economic consequences of the aging U.S. population to be undertaken by the National Academy of Sciences, and that proposed funding for the Office of Financial Education be increased by $1 million for the purpose of revising the national strategy on increasing financial literacy.", "In its report on S. 3677 , the committee directed the department to fully implement all economic sanctions and divestment measures targeted at North Korea, Burma, Iran, Sudan, and Zimbabwe, and to notify the committee promptly if a lack of resources is hampering these efforts. The committee also ordered the department to do more to reduce the flow of funds into the United States from \"corrupt politicians, terrorists, and those involved in organized crime\" through its involvement in the multinational Financial Action Task Force, and its rule-making authority under the Bank Secrecy Act and certain other statutes. To monitor the department's response to this directive, the report required it to submit a report to the Senate Committees on Appropriations and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs within 180 days of the enactment of the bill that described the steps taken to prevent the \"flow of the proceeds of corruption into the United States, specifically including activities related to identifying the beneficial ownership of corporate vehicles, where appropriate, and participation in FATF activities and initiatives.\"", "Department-wide Systems and Capital Investments Programs: S. 3677 would provide $13 million in appropriations for this account in FY2011, or $3.5 million above the amount enacted for FY2010 but $9 million below the budget request. The recommended funding would match the $5 million requested for the Enterprise Content Management program and provide $8 million for the Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT) program, or $9 million less than the request. In its report on the bill, the committee noted that while it supported the primary goal of the FIT program, which is to create government-wide solutions for processing financial transactions, it could not endorse the requested funding for the program because the budget justification gave too few details on the program's design and operation. The committee directed the department to provide a more detailed justification for the program, including the cost estimate for each project, within 60 days of the enactment of the bill.", "Office of Inspector General: S. 3677 would provide $33.3 million in appropriated funds for the OIG in FY2011, or $3.6 million above the amount enacted for FY2010 and $3 million more than the budget request. The additional funds are intended to support more audits and investigations of bank failures than current resources would allow. In its report on the bill, the committee stated categorically that OIG should give the highest priority to performing an audit of the Bank Secrecy Act Information Technology Modernization project being undertaken by FinCEN. As part of its oversight of the project, OIG would have to submit a report to the committee by March 31, 2011, (and every six months thereafter) that assessed contractor performance and the likelihood of cost overruns.

The committee's report on the bill identified certain priorities for TIGTA in the coming fiscal year. Specifically, it urged the bureau to continue its oversight of IRS's initiatives to reduce the tax gap to ensure that they strike a reasonable balance between protecting taxpayer rights and enhancing taxpayer compliance. The committee also recommended that TIGTA examine IRS's assistance program for low-income taxpayers, current law regarding the classification of independent contractors and its effect on the tax gap, various schemes to steal confidential taxpayer information for the purpose of identity theft, and the best ways to reduce threats to the security of IRS employees and IRS databases.", "Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program: S. 3677 would provide $50 million in appropriations for SIGTARP in FY2011, or $26 million above the amount enacted for FY2010 and the same as the budget request.

The difference between the amount recommended in the bill and the request reflected two committee recommendations. First, the committee opposed a proposal by the Administration to fund a portion of the Bank Secrecy Act Information Technology Modernization project using about $20 million in uncommitted money from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund and instead urged that appropriations for FinCEN be increased by the same amount so the project can be funded entirely through the bureau's account. Second, the committee recommended that appropriations be increased by another $1.5 million to expand FinCEN's analytical support to a network of more than 300 law enforcement and regulatory authorities\" at the federal, state, and local levels involved in investigating and disrupting illicit financial transactions.", "The bill would also provide $46 million for the BSA modernization project, which is intended to revamp the BSA data architecture, update antiquated or obsolete infrastructure needed to collection and distribute data, implement innovative web services and enhanced electronic filing, and provide enhanced analytical tools. Banks, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, and federal intelligence agencies use the system to report, gather, and analyze data in an effort to detect and thwart instances of money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, and other financial crimes. The existing BSA data infrastructure is considered outdated and a hindrance to federal efforts to combat those illegal activities. In its report on S. 3677 , the committee directed FinCEN to submit a semi-annual report to the committee summarizing the progress made on the modernization project; the report should address \"milestones planned and achieved, progress on cost and schedule, management of contractor oversight, strategies to involve stakeholders, and acquisition management efforts.\"", "Treasury Forfeiture Fund: S. 3677 would rescind $82 million in uncommitted balances in the fund.", "Financial Management Service: S. 3677 would provide $235 million in appropriations for FMS in FY2011, or about $9 million less than the amount enacted for FY2010 and the same as the budget request.

For the second year in a row, the committee refused to endorse an Administration proposal to cover bureau operating expenses by assessing fees on producers, distributors, and retailers of alcoholic products. The difference between recommended funding and the budget request reflects the estimated cost of implementing the proposal. In addition, the report noted that enacted funding for ATB in FY2010 included $3 million (to remain available through the end of FY2011) to hire, train, and equip special law enforcement agents to combat tobacco smuggling and other such criminal activities.", "Bureau of the Public Debt: S. 3677 would provide $176 million in appropriations for the Bureau of Public Debt in FY2011, or $6 million less than the amount enacted for FY2010 and the same as the budget request. The committee appears to have accepted the Administration's position that the bureau could deliver its required services at a lower cost by reducing issuing and paying agent fees, consolidating its facilities in Parkersburg, WV, cutting back on staff travel, streamlining procurement operations, and improving operating efficiency in all BPD programs.", "Community Development Financial Institutions Fund: S. 3677 would provide $302 million in appropriations for CDFI in FY2011, or $56 million more than the amount enacted for FY2010 and $52 million more than the budget request. The committee recommended that $52 million be used for the Bank on USA program, which seeks to improve access to affordable financial services and consumer credit for households facing high fees for check-cashing services, difficult obstacles to saving and acquiring lines of credit, and an increased risk of being the victim of fraud and theft. It also specified that $25 million be used for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative; $7.5 million for qualified community development financial institutions to back additional loans of $2,500 or less; $12 million for grants, loans, and technical assistance and training programs for native American, Alaskan, and Hawaiian communities; and $25 million for the Bank Enterprise Award program.", "Internal Revenue Service: S. 3677 would provide $12.508 billion for the IRS in FY2011, or $362 million more than the amount enacted for FY2010 and $125 million less than the budget request.

These objectives lay behind recommended increases in funding for taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, and, most notably, the BSM program. In the committee's view, the FY2011 budget should enable the IRS to pursue multiple approaches to shrinking the tax gap, including expanded information reporting, improved taxpayer services, increased research on sources of non-compliance, a strengthened partnership among the IRS, tax preparers, and practitioners, and greater use of modernized information systems.", "At the same time, with the same objectives in mind, the committee directed the IRS to provide it with detailed and timely information on planned re-organizations, job reductions, program increases, and changes in enforcement activities. Of particular concern was planned cuts in taxpayer services. The committee made it clear that it would endorse planned reductions in such services, especially face-to-face assistance, only if they are consistent with the budget justification and the current Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint, and the IRS can demonstrate to the committee that the reductions would not adversely affect taxpayer compliance.", "On the matter of funding for taxpayer services, the committee recommended matching the budget request and restoring the proposed $9.5 million reduction in combined spending on the TAS, LITC and VITA grants, and the TCE program. The report on S. 3677 specified that a minimum of $6.1 million should be set aside for the TCE program, a minimum of $10 million for LITC grants, a minimum of $14 million for VITA grants over two years, and a minimum of $213 million for the TAS. The committee backed the Administration's proposal to increase the budget for taxpayer services by $46 million in order to channel $25 million into improving the IRS website and $21 million into improving the level of assistance available through the agency's toll-free telephone service. It also directed the IRS to identify in its FY2012 budget request any proposed increases in spending to implement the new health-care mandates under PPAC and submit annual updates to Congress of its Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint, focusing on changes to its existing strategic plan for taxpayer services.", "On the matter of funding for enforcement activities, the committee expressed support for the IRS's current priorities in combating tax evasion and lowering the tax gap. These priorities include increased audits of high-income individuals and passthrough entities such as S corporations, and an intensified push to reduce offshore tax evasion by individuals and companies. In its report on S. 3677 , the committee also directed the IRS to provide it with more details on the actual costs, revenues, and return on investment of new enforcement initiatives in the years after their implementation, and to undertake more frequent studies of and collect more frequent data on the nature and size of the tax gap, particularly the portion of the gap attributable to international transactions. Section 105 of the bill would extend through FY2011 a provision in the law providing appropriations for the Treasury Department in FY2010 that bars the IRS from re-starting the private tax debt collection program it managed from early March 2006 through early March 2009.", "On the matter of funding for operations support, S. 3677 would allow up to $75 million in recommended funding for information technology to remain available until the end of FY2012. The committee expressed concern about the IRS's management and oversight of its non-BSM information technology projects and said that it expected the agency to monitor those projects more carefully to ensure that they are properly classified and managed, subject to risk management and contingency plans in case of missed deadlines for \"scheduled deliverables,\" and essential to the operations and needs of IRS business units. What is more, the report on the bill urged IRS management to make sure that contracts for the projects contain adequate penalties and repayment clauses to address shortcomings in contractor performance, and that contractors have adequate staff to \"fulfill the contract terms and deliverables.\" The committee also directed the IRS to include in its budget request for FY2012 a long-term funding plan within the operations support account to modernize its aging \"legacy information technology infrastructure.\"", "And on the matter of funding for the BSM program, the committee reiterated a long-held belief that the program should be considered the \"IRS's highest management and administrative priority.\" It also commended the agency for the progress that has been made in the program over the past few years. The replacement of the aging individual master file with a new CADE should allow for daily (rather than weekly) updating of individual taxpayer accounts, leading to better customer service, faster processing of refunds, and more effective tax law enforcement. Noting that the program is at a \"critical juncture,\" the committee endorsed a proposal by the Administration to appropriate $152 million for the accelerated development of CADE 2, with the intent of making it available for the 2012 filing season. It also recommended that the following amounts be spent on certain other key elements of the program: $40 million for completion of CADE 1, $39 million for Modernized E-file, $38.5 million for Core Infrastructure, $37 million for Architecture, Integration, and Management, $10 million for Management Reserve, and $70 million for salaries and other labor costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "House", "paragraphs": ["On July 29, 2010, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government approved a bill\u2014which was never numbered\u2014that would provide funding for FSGG agencies, including Treasury.

However, there are numerous restrictions and licensing requirements for these exports. For instance, exporters are denied access to U.S. private commercial financing or credit, and all transactions must be paid for in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. The Bush Administration tightened sanctions on Cuba in February 2005 by further restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid for their product. OFAC amended the CACR to clarify that the term \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the shipment of the goods. This differed from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods, a practice that had been utilized by many U.S. agricultural exporters to Cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001. U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress strongly objected to this \"clarification\" on the grounds that the action constituted a new sanction that violated the intent of TSRA, and could jeopardize millions of dollars in U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. Then OFAC Director Robert Werner maintained that the clarification \"conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade.\"", "Since 2002, the United States has been one of Cuba's largest suppliers of food and agricultural products. Cuba has purchased over $3.5 billion in agricultural products from the United States since late 2001. Overall U.S exports to Cuba rose from about $7 million in 2001 to $404 million in 2004 and to a high of $712 million in 2008, far higher than in previous years, in part because of the rise in food prices and because of Cuba's increased food needs in the aftermath of several hurricanes and tropical storms that severely damaged the country's agricultural sector. In 2009, however, U.S. exports to Cuba declined to $533 million, 25% lower than the previous year. The decline was largely related to Cuba's shortage of hard currency. In 2010, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba fell to $370 million, a 30% drop from 2009. Analysts again cite Cuba's shortage of hard currency as the main reason for the decline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Action", "paragraphs": ["In December 2009, Congress took action in the FY2010 omnibus appropriations measure (Section 619 of Division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, P.L. 111-117 ) to define, during FY2010, \"payment of cash in advance\" as used in TSRA as payment before the transfer of title to, and control of, the exported items to the Cuban purchaser. This overturned OFAC's February 2005 clarification that payment had to be received before vessels could leave U.S. ports. Supporters of the provision maintained that it restored congressional intent on the matter, and would make it easier for U.S. agricultural producers to export to Cuba, while opponents maintained that the provision constituted a foreign policy change included in a must-pass spending bill without appropriate congressional consideration. The Administration issued regulations implementing this provision in early March 2010.
