In the beginning, the federal government played a role in supporting the mortgage market (through establishment of the Federal Housing Administration [FHA] and the government-sponsored enterprises) and in promoting construction of low-rent public housing for lower-income families through local public housing authorities (PHAs). Over time, the federal government has shifted away from providing construction-based subsidies toward providing rental subsidies, and private developers and property owners have been playing a larger role.", "Today's federal housing assistance programs fall into three main categories: rental housing assistance, assistance to state and local governments, and assistance for homeowners. Most of these programs are administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Current housing assistance programs include Section 8 vouchers and project-based rental assistance, public housing, housing for the elderly (Section 202), housing for persons with disabilities (Section 811), rural rental assistance (the United States Department of Agriculture's Section 521 program), Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships Block Grants, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), homeless assistance programs, Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs mortgage insurance, and the mortgage interest deduction in the tax code.", "Most federal housing assistance programs are aimed at making housing affordable for low-income families. Affordability\u2014defined as housing that costs no more than 30% of a family's income\u2014is considered to be the largest housing problem today. Rental assistance programs, which are the largest source of direct housing assistance for low-income families, all allow families to pay affordable, income-based rents; however, different forms of assistance target different types of households, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, and families with children. Several trends in federal housing policy have emerged in recent decades. As the focus of federal housing assistance has shifted away from construction-based subsidies to rental assistance, block grants, and LIHTC, state and local governments have had greater access to federal resources to fund local housing and community development priorities. This shift in federal funding has also led affordable housing developers to pursue mixed financing: the use of multiple streams of federal, state, and local funding, or private financing. In the past, lagging homeownership rates among low-income and minority households have prompted several Presidents to promote homeownership-based housing policies. However, given the severe downturn in U.S. housing markets that began in 2007 and the resulting high foreclosure rate, it is unclear to what degree federal policy will continue to focus on increasing access to homeownership."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has played a role in subsidizing housing construction and providing homeownership and rental assistance for lower-income households since the 1930s. Today, Congress funds a number of programs to help meet the housing needs of poor and vulnerable populations. The programs are primarily administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), with some assistance provided to rural communities through the Department of Agriculture and some tax benefits administered through the Department of the Treasury. The modern housing assistance programs include both relatively flexible grants to state and local governments to serve homeless people, build affordable housing, provide assistance to first-time homebuyers, and promote community development; and more structured, direct assistance programs that provide low-cost apartments and rental vouchers to poor families, administered through local public, quasi-public, and private intermediaries. The federal government also makes tax credits available to states to distribute to developers of low-cost housing and provides mortgage insurance to lenders that make certain types of mortgages to eligible homebuyers or developers of multifamily housing. One of the federal government's largest housing benefits, arguably, is the mortgage interest deduction, which is not targeted to lower-income households and is available to homeowners who pay mortgage interest and itemize their deductions.", "This report begins with an overview of the history and evolution of federal housing assistance policy.

Until the early 1930s, most mortgages were written for terms of three to five years and required borrowers to make payments only on an annual basis. At the end of the three- or five-year terms, the remaining loan balance had to be repaid or the mortgage had to be renegotiated. Another feature of the mortgage market at that time was that lenders would only lend 40% to 50% of the value of the property, so borrowers had to have the cash to complete the transaction or find someone willing to finance the balance (or part of the balance) in a second mortgage. During the Great Depression, however, lenders were unable or unwilling to refinance many of the loans that became due. When borrowers could not pay the loan balances, lenders foreclosed on the loans and took possession of the properties.", "It was against this backdrop that the Housing Act of 1934 (P.L. 73-479) was enacted. The broad objectives of the act were to (1) encourage lenders to invest in housing construction, and (2) stimulate employment in the building industry. The act created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHA insured lenders against losses on home modernization and home improvement loans, created the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund to fund the operation of the newly created mortgage insurance programs, and established national mortgage associations to buy and sell mortgages.", "The creation of FHA also institutionalized a new idea: 20-year mortgages on which a loan would be completely repaid at the end of its term. If borrowers defaulted, FHA insured the lender for full repayment. Eventually, lenders began to make long-term mortgages without FHA insurance as long as borrowers made significant down payments. Over time, 15- and 30-year mortgages have become the standard mortgage products.", "As in the case of the mortgage finance market, the federal government initially became involved in providing rental housing assistance in response to the Great Depression. In the early 1930s, a housing division was added to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration (WPA) as a part of the effort to create jobs and spur economic growth. The Housing Division acquired land and built multifamily housing projects for occupancy by lower-income families across the country. However, the Housing Division's activities proved controversial with local government officials who thought that they were not consulted in the process.", "This provided the background for the enactment of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (P.L. 75-412). It replaced the WPA's Housing Division and its projects by establishing a new, federal United States Housing Agency (a precursor agency to today's Department of Housing and Urban Development) and a new Low-Rent Public Housing program. The new program required partnerships between the federal government, states, and localities. States that wished to receive assistance in building low-rent public housing were required to pass enabling legislation creating new, quasi-governmental, local public housing authorities (PHAs). These PHAs could then apply to the federal government for funding to aid in the construction and maintenance of low-rent housing developments targeted to low-income families. The act declared that it was the policy of the United States", "to promote the general welfare of the nation by employing its funds and credit, as provided in this Act, to assist the several states and their political subdivisions to alleviate present and recurring unemployment and to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low-income, in rural or urban communities, that are injurious to the health, safety, and morals of the citizens of the nation.", "Housing was a major issue in the presidential and congressional races of 1948. President Harry S. Truman's pledge to address the postwar housing shortage and the problem of urban slums played a key role in his large margin of victory. In his State of the Union Address in 1949, which unveiled the \"Fair Deal,\" President Truman observed that \"Five million families are still living in slums and firetraps. Three million families share their homes with others.\"", "He further stated", "The housing shortage continues to be acute. As an immediate step, the Congress should enact the provisions for low-rent public housing, slum clearance, farm housing, and housing research which I have repeatedly recommended. The number of low-rent public housing units provided for in the legislation should be increased to 1 million units in the next 7 years. Even this number of units will not begin to meet our need for new housing.", "The Housing Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-171) declared the goal of \"a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.\" The act (1) established a federal urban redevelopment and slum clearance program, authorizing federal loans of $1 billion over a five-year period to help local redevelopment agencies acquire slum properties and assemble sites for redevelopment; (2) reactivated the public housing program for low-income families (which had been on hold during World War II), authorizing subsidies to local housing authorities sufficient to build 810,000 units over six years; (3) expanded the FHA's mortgage insurance program to promote home building and homeownership; (4) created within the U.S. Department of Agriculture a program of financial assistance and subsidies to improve housing conditions on farms and in rural areas; and (5) authorized federal grants for research, primarily to improve the productivity of the housing industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government Subsidization of Private Rental Development", "paragraphs": ["Through the 1950s, the federal government's role in housing assistance focused largely on public housing, which served a mostly poor population. Congress recognized that there was a gap in the market\u2014few options existed for moderate-income families whose incomes were too high to qualify for public housing but too low to afford adequate market rate housing. Proposals had been made in Congress to address the shortage of housing for moderate-income households during the 1950s; however, no legislation had been enacted, in part due to the cost to the government of creating and funding a new program. To find a way to serve this segment of the population without creating another large housing program with high expenditures, Congress approved legislation at the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s that engaged the private sector in the development of affordable rental housing.", "The Housing Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-372) was the first significant instance where government incentives were used to persuade private developers to build housing that would be affordable to low- and moderate-income households. As part of P.L. 86-372, Congress created the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program. Through the Section 202 program, the federal government extended low-interest loans to private nonprofit organizations for the development of affordable housing for moderate-income residents age 62 and older. The low interest rates were meant to ensure that units would be affordable, with nonprofit developers being able to charge lower rents and still have adequate revenue to pay back the government loans.", "The Housing Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-70) further expanded the role of the private sector in providing housing to low- and moderate-income households. The act created the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) housing program, which both insured mortgages to private developers of multifamily housing and provided loans to developers at low interest rates. The BMIR program expanded the pool of eligible borrowers to private for-profit developers and government entities, as well as nonprofit developers. Eligible developers included cooperatives, limited-dividend corporations, and state or local government agencies. Like the Section 202 program, the low interest rates in the BMIR program were meant to ensure that building owners could offer affordable rents to tenants.", "The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-117) added rental assistance to the list of incentives for private multifamily housing developers that participated in the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program. The Rent Supplement Program, enacted as part of P.L. 89-117, capped the rents charged to participating tenants at 20% of their incomes and paid building owners the difference between 20% of a tenant's income and fair market rent. P.L. 89-117 also created the Section 23 leased housing program, which was the first program to provide rent subsidies for use with existing private rental market units. ", "The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-448) created the Section 236 and Section 235 programs. In the Section 236 program, the government subsidized private developers' mortgage interest payments so that they would not pay more than 1% toward interest. Some Section 236 units also received rent subsidies (referred to as Rental Assistance Payments [RAP]) to make them affordable to the lowest-income tenants. The Section 235 program instituted mortgage interest reduction payments similar to the Section 236 program, but for individual homeowners rather than multifamily housing developers. Through it, eligible borrowers could obtain FHA-insured mortgages with subsidized interest rates. As the program was originally enacted, HUD was to make subsidy payments to the lender in order to reduce the interest rate on the mortgage to as low as 1%. ", "By the end of the 1960s, subsidies to private developers had resulted in the creation of hundreds of thousands of rental housing units. Approximately 700,000 units of housing had been built through the Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) programs alone. The Section 202 program had created more than 45,000 units for elderly households. The Section 235 program and Section 23 leased-housing program provided ownership and rental subsidies for thousands more. Through 1972, the Section 235 program subsidized nearly 400,000 homeowners, while the Section 23 leased-housing program provided rent subsidies for more than 38,000 private market rental units. Despite the growth in the role of private developers, public housing was still the largest housing subsidy program, with roughly 1 million units built and subsidized by the early 1970s.", "Another development during the 1960s was an income-based rent structure. Under the public housing program, tenants generally paid rent in an amount equal to the costs of operating the assisted housing in which they lived. Over time, as operating costs rose, there was a concern that the below-market rents being charged were too high to be affordable to the poorest families. The Brooke Amendment, which was included as part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-152), limited tenant contributions toward rent in all rent assisted units (including public housing and all project-based rental assistance units) to an amount equal to 25% of tenant income (this was later raised to 30%). The Brooke Amendment is considered to be responsible for codifying an income-based rent structure in federal housing programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Housing Discrimination, the Fair Housing Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act", "paragraphs": ["In 1968, Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act (P.L. 90-284). The law prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, or financing of housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and handicap. In addition to prohibiting discrimination, the Fair Housing Act also requires HUD and other federal agencies to administer their housing and urban development programs in ways that affirmatively further fair housing. In other words, as determined by courts, HUD is to prevent segregation and ensure that housing is open to everyone.", "Leading up to the passage of the Fair Housing Act, there had been years of governmental and private discrimination in the provision of housing. For example, the Federal Housing Administration's policies and underwriting requirements often discouraged or prohibited FHA insurance for mortgages in certain areas, including non-white or racially mixed areas, and encouraged occupancy restrictions based on race for the mortgages it insured. Such policies limited minority households' opportunities to achieve homeownership and contributed to patterns of racial segregation. ", "Systematic racial discrimination was not limited to private market housing transactions, but was also prevalent in public housing. Together, a presidential order, Supreme Court cases, and civil rights legislation, including the Fair Housing Act, worked to make it illegal to deny public housing assistance to families based on their race and to segregate public housing residents systematically by race, both of which had been common practice since the inception of the program. ", "In 1977, Congress enacted the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) as part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 ( P.L. 95-128 ). The CRA affirms that federally insured depository institutions have an obligation to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they are chartered and accept deposits, consistent with financial safety and soundness considerations, and requires federal banking regulators to assess the extent to which banks are meeting those needs. The enactment of the CRA grew out of concern that banking deposits were funding lending activities across the country at the expense of providing credit in certain areas where deposits were collected, thereby contributing to neighborhood disinvestment.

Multiple series of pilot programs were launched to test the cost-effectiveness of supply-side (construction) subsidies versus demand-side (rental assistance) subsides. President Richard M. Nixon criticized the existing programs as not equitably serving families in the same circumstances, providing poor quality housing, being too costly, and placing some families in homes they could not afford. Based on these concerns, President Nixon declared a moratorium on all new activity under the major housing subsidy programs\u2014except for the Section 23 leased-housing program\u2014that began in January 1973. Assisted housing activity slowly restarted in response to lawsuits and new legislation.", "The Housing Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-383 ) was the first omnibus housing legislation since 1968 and the first such legislation following the Nixon moratorium. The act created a new low-income rental assistance program, referred to as Section 8. Although the 1960s had seen rental assistance programs like Rent Supplement and Section 23, the scale of the Section 8 program made it the first comprehensive rental assistance program. The Section 8 program combined features of the Section 236 program, which was popular with advocates of construction-based subsidies, and the Section 23 leased-housing program, which used the existing housing stock and was popular with the Nixon Administration. Through Section 8, the federal government provided private property owners monthly assistance payments for new or substantially rehabilitated rental units. In exchange for monthly rental payments, property owners agreed to rent to eligible low-income families (defined as families with incomes at or below 80% of local area median income), who would pay an income-based rent. It also provided PHAs with the authority to enter into rental assistance contracts for existing, private market units that met certain quality standards.", "Over time, the use of Section 8 in new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects was found to be more expensive than its use in existing housing. The Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 ( P.L. 98-181 ) repealed HUD's authority to enter into new Section 8 contracts tied to new construction and substantial rehabilitation, but retained HUD's authority to issue new contracts for existing properties. The act also created a new demonstration program to test a modified use of Section 8, referred to as vouchers. Vouchers were similar to the use of Section 8 rent subsidies in existing housing, but they provided more flexibility to PHAs, particularly by permitting families to pay more than 30% of their incomes in rent. The demonstration was made permanent in 1985."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Increasing Role of State and Local Governments", "paragraphs": ["By the mid-1980s, federal housing programs had gone through a number of iterations. Some programs had been scrapped as inefficient, subject to fraud and abuse, or too expensive. Shifting federal priorities\u2014toward reducing taxes and increasing military spending in response to the Cold War\u2014reduced funding available for social programs, including housing assistance. Creation of assisted housing with federal funds was on the decline, with production slowing significantly between 1982 and 1988. In addition, existing affordable rental units were being lost as use restrictions between private owners and HUD expired or as owners chose to prepay their low-interest mortgages and begin charging market-rate rent.", "As a result of reduced federal support for housing, state and local governments and private for-profit or nonprofit organizations began to take the initiative in developing innovative ways of providing housing in their communities. Policymakers acknowledged that, in some cases, local communities had better knowledge about how to provide housing than the federal government, and might be able to provide housing more efficiently than HUD. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, Congress acknowledged the value of local control and gave more decisionmaking authority over housing policy to state and local governments through the creation of block grants and tax credits.", "In 1986, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was created as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ). The LIHTC was not initially part of the bill that became the Tax Reform Act ( H.R. 3838 ). However, because portions of H.R. 3838 eliminated the favorable treatment of real estate investment income, Members added the LIHTC program to the bill to ensure that developers would have an incentive to continue to construct low- and moderate-income housing. The LIHTC, intentionally or not, was one of the first major programs to give a good deal of control over federal funding for housing to states. Tax credits are allocated to states based on population, and states have discretion in setting priorities as to how the credits will be used. While states must prioritize projects that serve the lowest-income tenants for the longest period of time, they may choose to allocate credits based on criteria such as the tenant populations served (e.g., those with special needs, families with children, or those on public housing waiting lists).", "Just one year after enactment of the LIHTC, Congress passed the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act ( P.L. 100-77 ), which included funding for several grants that states and localities could use to assist people experiencing homelessness. Grants were available for permanent and transitional housing, as well as supportive services, with the idea that localities are in a better position to know how to serve the people living in their communities. ", "In 1990, Congress created another large, flexible block grant to states and localities. The National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (NAHA, P.L. 101-625 ) authorized the HOME Investment Partnerships program. HOME was modeled after an earlier block grant, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), which was created as part of the Housing Act of 1974 to consolidate several special purpose grants funding many activities other than housing, such as neighborhood revitalization, open space, and water and sewer grants. NAHA directed that HOME funds be allocated to states and localities based on a formula and that funds be targeted to assist families with incomes at or below 80% of area median income (or lower in some cases). Recipient jurisdictions were permitted to use funds to assist homebuyers and homeowners, construct rental housing, and provide rental assistance, and they were required to establish plans for spending their funds, meet matching requirements, and partner with local nonprofits.", "The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA, P.L. 104-330 ) reorganized the system of federal housing assistance to Native Americans by eliminating several separate programs of assistance and replacing them with a single block grant program. In addition to simplifying the process of providing housing assistance, a purpose of NAHASDA was to provide federal assistance for Indian tribes in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reforming Rental Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the 1990s, concern about the state of public housing grew. The public perceived public housing to be mismanaged, of poor quality, and dangerous.

Concern over the condition of public housing\u2014and the influence of the 1996 welfare reform debate and legislation\u2014led to proposals for major public and assisted housing reforms. Several years of debate in Congress culminated with the enactment of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA; P.L. 105-276 ).", "The purposes of QHWRA, as defined in the act, were to deregulate PHAs, provide PHAs with more flexibility in their use of federal assistance, facilitate mixed income communities, decrease concentrations of poverty in public housing, increase accountability and reward effective management of PHAs, create incentives and economic opportunities for residents assisted by PHAs to work and become self-sufficient, consolidate the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs into a single market-driven program, remedy the problems of troubled PHAs, and replace or revitalize severely distressed public housing projects.", "Specific reforms in QHWRA included increased income targeting in the voucher program, removal of federal preference categories for housing assistance, enactment of a limited community service requirement in public housing, creation of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program (a hybrid of the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs), authorization of the HOPE VI program, consolidation and reform of funding for public housing, and modifications to the assessment systems for PHAs.

The pace of decline in the overall number of public housing units increased again with the introduction of the Rental Assistance Demonstration in 2012 ( P.L. 112-55 ). RAD allows PHAs to remove their properties from the public housing program and instead receive a form of Section 8 rental assistance. As the program is currently authorized, HUD is authorized to approve the conversion of nearly half of the remaining public housing stock to Section 8 rent assistance.", "Another important development in housing policy in more recent years was the 2007 financial crisis and its aftermath. The financial crisis itself was precipitated in large part by mortgage lending practices and its aftermath was felt heavily in housing markets as home prices fell, foreclosures rose, and the homeownership rate dropped significantly. This led to a variety of policy responses addressing both the perceived causes and the effects of the housing and financial market turmoil. For example, major reforms enacted in 2008 resulted in federal conservatorship for two housing government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) that continues today. Congress and both the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations created several temporary programs to address rising foreclosure rates. The recession that accompanied the financial market turmoil prompted Congress and President Obama to enact an economic stimulus package in 2009 that included a significant one-time increase in resources for, among other things, several federal housing programs (including public housing, CDBG, and grants for LIHTC projects). In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 111-203 ) instituted new rules related to mortgages intended to protect consumers and the financial system from some of the lending practices that preceded the financial crisis, among other reforms.

Generally, an eligible family with a voucher lives in the housing of its choice in the private market (assuming the unit meets program standards and the landlord is willing to participate in the program) and the voucher pays the difference between the family's contribution toward rent and the actual rent for the unit. Specifically, a family pays 30% of its adjusted income toward rent (although it can choose to pay more) and the PHA, which receives funding from HUD, makes payments to the landlord based on a maximum subsidy set by the PHA (based on the local fair market rent established by HUD), less the tenant's contribution. Families are eligible to receive vouchers if they are very low-income (earning 50% or less of the local area median income) or low-income (earning 80% or less of the local area median income) and meet other special criteria (for example, are elderly or have disabilities). However, PHAs must provide 75% of all vouchers available in a year to extremely low-income families (earning 30% or less of the greater of area median income or the poverty guidelines). Vouchers are nationally portable; once a family receives a voucher, it can take that voucher and move to any part of the country where a voucher program is being administered.", "There are several special forms of Section 8 vouchers. Tenant protection vouchers are provided to families who are being displaced from other HUD programs. Some tenant protection vouchers, called enhanced vouchers, can have higher values than regular vouchers. PHAs also have the discretion to \"project-base\" some of their vouchers. Project-based vouchers are attached to specific housing units rather than given to families to use in homes of their choosing. Another special form is the homeownership voucher; PHAs have the discretion to allow eligible first-time homebuyers to use their vouchers to make monthly mortgage payments.

Congress has generally renewed all existing vouchers each year; in some years, Congress also creates new vouchers to serve additional families, referred to as incremental vouchers. The current distribution of vouchers across PHAs results from a variety of allocation methods used in the past: formula-based, competitive, and other methods.

The Housing Act of 1937 identified an \"acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings.\" Thanks in part to stricter building codes and standards, most housing in the United States today is decent, safe, and sanitary. Although some units are still considered substandard, the greatest housing problem today is perceived to be affordability. Housing is considered \"affordable\" if it costs no more than 30% of a household's income. Households that pay half or more of their income toward their housing costs are considered severely cost burdened; households that pay between 30% and 50% are considered moderately cost burdened. According to data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 18.5 million households were severely cost burdened and 19.6 million households were moderately cost burdened in 2016. ", "Public policy is generally most concerned with the housing affordability problems of the lowest-income families, because high housing costs may prevent these families from meeting their other basic needs. The American Community Survey data show that in 2016, 70% of households with annual income below $15,000 were severely cost burdened (compared to 64% in 2001), and 33% of households with annual income between $15,000 and $29,999 were severely cost burdened (compared to 25% in 2001). ", "HUD must report to Congress periodically on the incidence of \"worst case\" housing needs, which are defined as occurring when unassisted renters with very low incomes (at or below 50% of area median income) pay more than half of their income for housing costs or live in severely substandard housing. In a 2017 report, HUD found that roughly 8.3 million renter households (7% of all households) had worst case housing needs in 2015. This represented an increase compared to 2013, when 7.7 million renter households (6.7% of all households) had worst case housing needs; a decrease from 2011, when 8.5 million renter households had worst case needs; and a nearly 41% increase since 2007, when 5.9 million renter households had worst case needs. Prior to 2005, the percentage of households with worst case housing needs had remained relatively steady\u2014roughly 5% of all households\u2014since HUD began reporting on worst case needs in 1991. ", "The vast majority of households with worst case housing needs are severely cost burdened but live in standard housing. For example, in 2015 about 95.6% of households with worst case housing needs experienced cost burdens only. About 1.8% of households had worst case housing needs solely because they lived in substandard housing, while another 2.6% experienced both conditions.

These three forms of assistance are similar in many ways. They all target assistance to extremely low-income families, require families to pay 30% of their incomes toward rent, and generally have long waiting lists for assistance. However, they vary in terms of their evolution, the structure of their benefit (a portable voucher versus a housing unit), and their administration (PHA versus private owner).", "The similarities and differences in the programs themselves result in similarities and differences in the characteristics of the households they serve. Table 14 provides household characteristics data for participants in the tenant-based Section 8 voucher program, the public housing program, and the project-based Section 8 rental assistance program.", "The tenant-based Section 8 voucher program serves more single, female-headed households with children than do the public housing program or project-based programs, although they are not a majority of those served by the program. Based on 2017 HUD data, 40% of voucher households were households with children headed by females, compared to 34% of public housing households and 25% of project-based households. The project-based Section 8 program primarily serves families headed by persons who are elderly or disabled, which account for over three-fourths (81%) of all households served in the program. This is not surprising given that owners of project-based housing may designate entire properties for elderly or disabled households. In addition, units of Section 202 housing for the elderly that were developed during the 1970s and 1980s were subsidized with project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Public housing and the Section 8 voucher program each also have a large majority of households (71% and 61%, respectively) where the head or spouse is elderly or disabled. ", "HUD reports the race and ethnicity of the head of household as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic Native American. In the Section 8 voucher program and public housing, households headed by non-Hispanic blacks make up the largest share (48% and 43%, respectively). In the project-based Section 8 program, households headed by non-Hispanic whites are the largest share (42%), with households headed by non-Hispanic blacks making up 34% of the total. Between 15% and 21% of households served across the three programs have heads of household who identify their ethnicity as Hispanic, with public housing having the largest share. ", "The rules governing the three main housing assistance programs require that they serve households that are low-income (income at or below 80% of area median income). However, with the targeting required in these programs, many households that are served have very low or extremely low incomes (at or below 50% or 30% of area median income, respectively). As an example, in 2018 the national median income was $71,900, meaning that low income would be considered to be at or below $57,500; very low income, $35,950; and extremely low income, $21,550. The majority of households served in each of the three programs have incomes at or below $14,999. The percentage of households with incomes at or below this level is 63% in the Section 8 voucher program, 65% in public housing, and 70% in project-based Section 8 rental assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government's Role in Directly Subsidizing Affordable Rental Housing", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in the 1980s, the federal government decreased its role in the creation of assisted housing. This occurred in several ways. Congress ceased funding new construction under the project-based Section 8 program, which from its enactment in 1974 had subsidized hundreds of thousands of units of assisted housing. This left very few active programs in which HUD supported the development of physical housing units. Between 1976 and 1982, the federal housing programs produced more than 1 million units of subsidized housing. In the following years, however, annual production was around 25,000 new subsidized units. Around the time that federal housing production was declining, Congress created two programs\u2014the Treasury Department's Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program and HUD's HOME Investment Partnerships program\u2014that gave a good deal of control over decisions regarding housing policy and development to state and local governments. These programs, particularly the LIHTC, have been used by states and localities to create hundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing.", "The federal government's decision to take a lesser role in the development of housing has had several consequences. First, state and local governments have taken on an increased role in providing affordable housing and establishing priorities in their communities. Second, due to a reduction in the number of new affordable housing units that are created each year, the need to preserve existing affordable housing units has taken on a new importance. A third consequence is the need for multiple streams of funding other than federal grants in order both to support the creation of new affordable housing units and to preserve existing units. These three consequences are discussed more fully below.", "First, with the advent of both the LIHTC program and the HOME program, states and localities were able to prioritize and develop housing using a larger and more flexible pool of federal funds. Until that point, states helped finance mortgage loans and affordable rental housing through their Housing Finance Agencies, but the states' roles were limited by the amount of funds available.", "In the LIHTC program, states develop plans in which they may set aside a certain percentage of tax credits for populations such as homeless individuals or persons with disabilities. They may also decide to use tax credits to preserve existing housing and/or build new housing. Funds that states receive from the HOME program may be used for the construction of new rental housing and rental assistance for low-income households. A potential drawback of these programs is their inability, on their own, broadly to reach the neediest households. For example, in an LIHTC development, at least 20% of units must be affordable to households at or below 50% of area median income, or 40% of units must be affordable to households at or below 60% of area median income. More recently, properties have been allowed to adopt an \"income-averaging\" approach that allows them to serve a mix of higher-income families if they also serve lower-income families, as long as it results in an average of 40% of units being occupied by households with incomes that average 60% or below of area median income. Many of the older HUD programs constructed housing that was affordable to households at or below 30% of area median income\u2014those considered extremely low-income. Often these households cannot afford units in LIHTC properties without rental subsidies, such as Section 8 vouchers.", "Another way some states and local governments support affordable housing is through establishment of their own housing trust funds. These trust funds use dedicated funding sources such as document recording fees or real estate transfer taxes to create a pool of funds for affordable housing. By using a dedicated source of financing, trust funds may not be as subject to the vicissitudes of state budgets as are other means of funding housing development. States and local communities also support affordable housing through inclusionary zoning. Through this method, housing developers are expected to dedicate a percentage of units they build as affordable housing. In exchange, states or local communities give developers incentives that allow them to expand or speed up the pace of development. Some of the incentives include density bonuses or zoning variances that allow developers to build larger facilities than they would be able to under existing zoning regulations, as well as expedited approval of building permits.", "A second consequence of the decreased role of the federal government in the production of affordable housing units is the increased pressure to maintain the affordability of existing units. Many HUD subsidized units that were developed in the 1960s and 1970s through programs such as Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3), as well as those units that received project-based Section 8 rental assistance, are no longer available to low-income households. At the time the properties were developed, building owners entered into contracts with HUD in which they agreed to maintain affordability for a certain number of years. The duration of these contracts varied; depending on the federal program, these contracts, or \"use restrictions,\" may last between 15 years (the LIHTC program, although states may adopt longer use restrictions) and 50 years (early Section 202 developments). Over time, these contracts have begun to expire, property owners have chosen to pay off their mortgages early and end the use restrictions, or mortgages have matured and their accompanying use restrictions have ended. When any of these events occur, owners may have the option to charge market-rate rents for the units, potentially making them unaffordable for current tenants. The term used to refer to efforts to maintain the affordability of these housing units is \"affordable housing preservation.\" ", "Congress has attempted to enact laws that would preserve affordable housing units; however, due to the temporary nature of some of the measures, preservation remains a concern. Congress first enacted legislation to help preserve affordable rental housing in 1987. The Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act (ELIHPA), enacted as part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 ( P.L. 100-242 ), was a temporary measure that prevented owners of Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) properties from prepaying their mortgages unless certain conditions were met, including permission from HUD. In 1990, the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act (LIHPRHA), enacted as part of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act ( P.L. 101-625 ), continued the ELIHPA conditions required for prepayment, and also offered incentives to owners to maintain affordability. However, six years after LIHPRHA was enacted, Congress reinstated the right of owners to prepay their mortgages without prior HUD permission (see P.L. 104-134 ). Two years later, in FY1998, Congress stopped providing funding to HUD for preservation incentives to owners under LIHPRHA, effectively ending the LIHPRHA program (see H.Rept. 105-175 ). Another effort to preserve affordable housing was enacted as part of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Accountability Act (MAHRA, P.L. 105-65 ). Through this effort, HUD restructures the debt of building owners while at the same time renegotiating their rental assistance contracts. Unlike ELIHPA and LIHPRHA, MAHRA is still in effect.", "A third consequence of the decreased federal role in the production of affordable housing is the need for low-income housing developers to bring together multiple funding streams in order to build a development. When the federal government first began to subsidize the production of affordable housing, in many cases the funds appropriated for housing programs were sufficient to construct or rehabilitate the affordable units without the need for funds from the private financial markets. Over the years, however, federal programs that provide grants for the construction of multifamily housing for low-income households have become a smaller portion of the government's housing portfolio. At the same time, the grants themselves have become a smaller portion of the total amount needed to support the development of affordable housing. As a result, it has become necessary for developers to turn to multiple sources of financing, including LIHTCs, tax exempt bonds, and state or local housing trust funds. In addition, it is often necessary for building owners to seek rent subsidies through programs like Section 8 and HOME to make renting to very low- or extremely low-income households feasible. The interactions among these various financing streams can be complex, and putting together a development plan may require the expertise of housing finance professionals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Shift to Tenant-Based Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Over time, the number of Section 8 vouchers provided and funded by the federal government has grown, while the number housing units it directly subsidizes\u2014through project-based Section 8 rental assistance and public housing\u2014has declined. This change from project-based assistance to tenant-based assistance is due, in part, to Congress's decision to expand the voucher program by creating new vouchers after new construction in the project-based Section 8 program and public housing program had been halted. Some of these were general purpose vouchers, available to any eligible family, and some were special purpose vouchers, targeted to special populations such as families transitioning from welfare to work and homeless veterans.", "This shift is also due, in part, to declines in the number of project-based assistance and public housing units. As previously noted in this report, the project-based rental assistance contracts between private landlords and HUD began expiring in the 1980s. When these contracts expire, private property owners can either renew their contracts with HUD (typically on an annual or five-year basis) or leave the program. When property owners leave the program, their tenants typically receive Section 8 vouchers\u2014referred to as tenant protection vouchers. Since the mid-1990s, when public housing units are demolished or sold, PHAs are not required to replace each lost unit with a new public housing unit. Instead, displaced families who are not relocated to other public housing units are provided with tenant-protection vouchers.", "Also contributing to the decline in public housing units is the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, enacted as part of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-55 ). Through RAD, PHAs may, with HUD's approval, remove their public housing properties from the public housing program and convert the funds they receive through the public housing operating and capital funds to either project-based Section 8 rental assistance or project-based vouchers. As noted earlier, HUD is currently authorized to transition up to nearly half of the current stock of public housing to a form of Section 8 via RAD.", "The shift from project-based assistance to tenant-based assistance has several implications for families. Vouchers offer portability, which, for some residents of public or other assisted housing, may mean the ability to move out of a troubled community to a community with new opportunities. However, there is debate over whether voucher portability leads to economic or social mobility. Early research on mobility showed promise that families\u2014particularly, low-income black families\u2014that moved from heavily poverty- and minority-concentrated public housing neighborhoods to more economically and racially integrated neighborhoods using vouchers could see improved employment and child outcomes. Subsequent mobility research showed mixed results, although the most recent research has further supported the idea that neighborhood effects can be powerful for young children. There is also some evidence that, for families accustomed to living in public housing, the transition to the private rental market with a voucher can be difficult without counseling and other supports, which may not be provided consistently. Finally, there is evidence that the portability option offered by vouchers is not utilized fully by families to access areas of opportunity. This may be due in part to families' preferences, but it also may be due to structural barriers in the program and/or in local rental markets, such as the maximum value of the voucher relative to rents in opportunity areas and landlord willingness to participate in the program.

The specific types of support provided, and the policy rationales for that support, have evolved over the decades. Currently, the federal government provides support for homeownership through a variety of programs and activities, many of which are described in this report. Some of these programs and activities benefit a broad range of homebuyers (e.g., the favorable tax treatment of homeownership, secondary market institutions that support the mortgage market) while others focus specifically on homebuyers who face certain barriers to homeownership (e.g., federal mortgage insurance and guaranty programs, grant programs that can be used for down payment or closing cost assistance). While not all of these existing programs and initiatives were established specifically with the intention of promoting homeownership, many policymakers have come to view the programs and activities as important for helping households access affordable financing to purchase a home.", "In recent decades, federal efforts related to homeownership have also included a focus on reducing disparities in homeownership rates. Homeownership rates vary based on a number of demographic and geographic factors, but large and long-standing gaps in homeownership rates by race and ethnicity have been a particular area of concern, in part out of recognition of federal policies that explicitly contributed to these disparities. Many Presidents in recent decades have expressed support for the concept of specifically increasing homeownership rates, particularly among minority groups who have traditionally been less likely to be homeowners. Generally, these proposals involved little new federal funding, but sought to rally the private sector to use existing programs to reach some specified target. ", "The severe downturn in U.S. housing and mortgage markets that began around 2007 resulted in increased mortgage foreclosure rates and steep declines in home equity in many parts of the country. It also led to a pronounced drop in the overall homeownership rate and further widened the gap in homeownership rates between white and black householders, in particular. As of 2017, the Census Bureau reported a homeownership rate of 63.9%, down from a peak of 69% in 2004. The homeownership rate for non-Hispanic white householders (72.3%) is 30 percentage points higher than it is for black householders (42.3%). (In comparison, in 2001 the homeownership rate for non-Hispanic white householders was about 27 percentage points higher than it was for black householders: 74.3% compared to 47.7%.) Hispanics, who can be of any race, had a homeownership rate of 46.2% in 2017, about 26 percentage points lower than the rate for non-Hispanic white households. ", "The housing market turmoil and its aftermath have raised a variety of questions about the appropriate role of the federal government in supporting homeownership going forward, including how best to balance the perceived benefits of homeownership with its possible risks. Many policymakers believe that federal policy should continue to support activities that help provide access to homeownership, especially for creditworthy households who may otherwise have difficulty becoming homeowners. However, recent experience has reduced the focus on specifically attempting to increase homeownership rates to a particular target and underscored the importance of ensuring that homeownership is not just attainable, but also sustainable over the long term.

For many of those units, once the family leaves the program, it receives a voucher.
