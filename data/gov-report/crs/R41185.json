Proliferation of donors in recent decades, and fragmentation of aid among an increasing number of countries and projects, has increased calls for coordination. More than 45 countries and 21 multilateral organizations reported providing official development assistance (ODA) in 2010. An estimated 150 countries received this assistance in 2010, with the United States alone providing aid to 139 countries. Many developing countries host officials from dozens of bilateral and multilateral aid agencies each year. This diffuse aid structure, reformer advocates argue, leads to redundancy, policy incoherence, inefficient use of resources, and unnecessary administrative burdens on host countries.", "While some observers argue that there are benefits to pluralism in foreign assistance, donors and recipients alike have expressed support for improved donor coordination and consolidation of aid activities. A series of high-level forums sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Party on Aid Effectiveness, between 2002 and 2011, established widely accepted goals for key aspects of coordination, or harmonization, as well as mechanisms for evaluating progress toward those goals. The United States has supported these donor coordination efforts, both in international forums and within the U.S. foreign assistance structure. Channeling aid through multilateral institutions, posting coordination officers to act as liaisons between U.S. and foreign development agencies, and increasing transparency about U.S. aid flows and objectives are part of this effort. Donor coordination provisions are incorporated into the founding legislation of relatively new U.S. aid entities, such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Furthermore, the 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) established donor coordination and reduced fragmentation as foreign aid priorities.", "Despite the global attention paid to the issue of aid effectiveness, monitoring surveys indicate that limited progress has been made toward coordination goals by the United States or donors in general. Persistent obstacles to increased donor coordination remain. Division of labor problems, political concerns about direct budget support, lack of inter-agency coordination, and personnel disincentives all play a role. Perhaps most important, the goals of official donor coordination efforts are not always consistent with the diverse objectives of U.S. foreign assistance policy or those of other bilateral donors. Nevertheless, traditional donors renewed their commitments at the Busan High Level Forum in November 2011, while at the same time expanding the scope of coordination efforts to include emerging donors, such as China and Brazil, and civil society organizations. A new entity conceived at the Busan forum, the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, was established in 2012, with the support of the United States, to embody this new, broader framework for cooperation.", "Related CRS reports include CRS Report R40213, Foreign Aid: An Introduction to U.S. Programs and Policy, by [author name scrubbed] and Marian Leonardo Lawson, and CRS Report R42621, State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs: FY2013 Budget and Appropriations, by [author name scrubbed], Marian Leonardo Lawson, and [author name scrubbed]."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Development assistance, which comprises on average less than 1% of the annual federal budget of the United States, serves simultaneously as a component of national security strategy, a tool to promote U.S. commercial interests, and a global expression of American values. As with other aspects of foreign policy, U.S. development assistance programs and policies are implemented in a complex global environment. The United States is one of dozens of countries and multilateral financial institutions providing such aid, together with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and foundations, and alongside private financial flows to developing countries from investors, international corporations, and diaspora communities. Donors and investors work in overlapping spheres in the developing world, each with their own practices and agenda. Improved coordination of these efforts, many experts argue, would result in greater efficiency and effectiveness in meeting global development objectives. ", "Donor coordination, sometimes called harmonization, is a major theme of international development cooperation agreements of the last decade, including the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, to which the United States and most other major donors have committed themselves. It is also a stated goal of U.S. foreign policy. The December 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) report includes specific strategies to improve coordination with other aid donors, public and private. Nevertheless, donors on average, and the United States in particular, have had limited success in meeting the coordination goals they established for themselves. Some experts have begun to question whether donor coordination is an achievable or even appropriate goal. Others assert that coordination of foreign aid is now more important than ever, as official donors face increasing budgetary pressures at home and the number and diversity of development actors increases. The 113 th Congress will have the opportunity to address foreign aid funding and policy issues when considering annual State-Foreign Operations appropriations legislation, and perhaps foreign aid reauthorization or reform legislation. The benefits and drawbacks of greater U.S. coordination with the foreign aid efforts of other countries and institutions may be a consideration in that debate.

There are only 34 OECD member states. Annual reporting of ODA to the DAC has expanded in recent years to include many non-OECD countries, but the non-OECD reporting is voluntary and irregular. Furthermore, it does not include several increasingly important donors, such as Brazil, China, Russia, India, and South Africa. These nations have been invited to participate in the DAC reporting process but choose not to for political and technical reasons, as discussed in the \"Nontraditional Donors\" section of this report.", "ODA data also exclude private aid resources, which are a rapidly growing, though inconsistent, portion of capital flows to developing countries in recent decades. While comprehensive data on private flows are elusive, private philanthropic donations from DAC countries to developing countries have been estimated at about $56 billion for 2010, and total private capital flows to developing countries that year, including remittances and private investment, are estimated at $329 billion.

Some development professionals believe donor coordination is the responsibility of recipient governments, not donors, and that while it may be frustrating to donors when host government officials do not act in concert, failure to coordinate often reflects political and policy differences that must be worked out by the host officials through internal political processes. Others see potential benefits of coordination, but question whether they warrant the time consuming task of donor coordination, particularly in countries for which aid is not a major component of the national budget.

For the most part, early coordination efforts involved tracking how much aid was provided, and to which countries. Over the last decade, however, attention has focused on coordinating the efforts of bilateral and multilateral aid donors for the purpose of improving aid efficiency and effectiveness. The DAC created a Working Party on Aid Effectiveness (WPAE), in 2003, to establish an international development cooperation framework. Since its creation, the WPAE has sponsored four international high-level forums on aid effectiveness, which established common goals, principles and commitments related to development assistance.

More than 100 countries and aid agencies, including the United States, endorsed the Declaration's five partnership principles: country ownership, harmonization, alignment, results, and mutual accountability. The United States, through a multi-agency delegation led by then-USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios, was active in crafting the Declaration, and advocated for a results-oriented approach focused on mutual accountability.", "Unlike the Rome Declaration, the Paris Declaration included specific goals and a strong monitoring component. Indicators of progress by which to evaluate aid effectiveness, and target results for 2010, were established for each principle.

For example, the JAS Nigeria involves only World Bank and the British Department for International Development, while the JAS in Tanzania involves 45 donors and discusses not only the role of the Tanzanian government and donors, but of the media, private sector, and academic institutions as well. ", "A USAID document on aid effectiveness case studies mentions that USAID encourages participation in JAS, but U.S. aid officials in the field may find themselves in a position where they support the JAS concept but face obstacles to formal participation (as discussed in the \" Division of Labor \" section of this report).

While the process of developing each JAS is different, other common difficulties include maintaining involvement of donors whose pre-exiting cooperative arrangements have been disrupted by division of labor decisions, garnering sufficient donor mission staff and other resources for what is often a two- to three-year process, and finding an acceptable balance between host government leadership and donors maintaining control over their own assistance policies and agenda.

Often, but not always, SWAp funding is pooled and flows through the host government budget mechanisms. SWAps are intended to promote both donor coordination and host country ownership while allowing more conditionality than direct budget support (discussed further on below). USAID has participated in SWAps, primarily in the health sector. However, SWAps can be difficult or impossible in instances where donors have different views on the best approach to development. In the agriculture sector, for example, differences in U.S. and European donor agency views on agricultural producers (the Europeans generally favor support to smallholders while the U.S. supports large producers) can be an obstacle to effectively implementing a SWAp. Accountability concerns related to pooled funding, together with congressional directives and legislative restrictions on aid by sector, can also make U.S. agency participation in SWAps challenging. In some instances, donors work around these obstacles by participating in SWAps on a limited basis, consistent with their domestic policy requirements. In Nepal's current health sector SWAp, for example, the Australian and British aid agencies, along with the GAVI alliance and the World Bank, pool their funds in a government-managed account, while USAID and several U.N. agencies participate as \"non-pooling\" partners. SWAps have become less common over the last decade as country-wide strategies have gained prominence, in part because many current development priorities, such as climate change and food security, cut across traditional aid sectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Sharing", "paragraphs": ["\"Transparency\", or public availability of detailed aid data, is an issue that was mentioned in the Paris Declaration, gained momentum at the Accra HLF, and became a pillar of the Busan commitments.

Global aid transparency, enabled by information technology, should allow donors to take the work of others into account when developing their assistance plans and allow recipients to both hold donors accountable and plan their own development programs with greater foresight. ", "While Internet-based sites have supported aid data sharing in certain countries for years, many aid experts believe that ad hoc information sharing mechanisms are insufficient. Responding to this concern, an International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) was launched at the Accra HLF in 2008, with the stated purpose of establishing a mechanism that allows all stakeholders and the general public access to consistent and comparable data on how much aid is being provided, what it is being spent on, and what it aims to achieve. Such information, supporters of the initiative argue, should lead to better decision making and accountability for aid effectiveness, while reducing corruption. Together with the OECD Working Party on Aid Effectiveness, IATI developed a framework for common aid data reporting standards in 2012, and aims to fully implement the standard by 2015, in keeping with Busan commitments. The Global Partnership structure that emerged from Busan is expected to provide a forum to monitor IATI progress and draw in more participants.

Donors may choose to play a larger role in fewer countries, concentrate on fewer sectors within countries, or delegate implementation of their assistance to certain countries or sectors.

Countries may be reluctant to discontinue a direct role in a certain country or sector where they have established relationships and aid infrastructure, may not accept the leadership of another donor, or may feel uneasy about the responsibilities and resources associated with being a lead donor. While the Accra Agenda for Action calls for aid recipients to take the lead in determining the role of various donors in their countries, recipients may be reluctant to identify which aid they find most effective for diplomatic reasons or fear that overall aid may be reduced. Donors also tend to all want to be involved in the regions and sectors in which short-term success seems most likely, and wary of turning their focus to \"aid orphan\" countries or sectors which are often avoided because the risk of poor outcomes is relatively high.

As an early evaluation of progress on the Paris Declaration goals noted, \"although budget support is not specifically promoted in the Declaration, a clear majority of development partner evaluations report that a major preoccupation in political and public understanding of the Declaration, and in managing their programs, is whether and under what conditions such support is appropriate.\" The United States has been notably reluctant to embrace budget support. The U.S. Action Plan on Harmonization (though it predates the Paris Declaration) states, in bold text, that \"the call for harmonization is not a call for increasing reliance on budget support.\"", "In 2010, donors reported giving an average of 2.7% of ODA in the form of general budget support, and the U.S. percentage is even lower. Most donors prefer project-based aid, in which they plan and implement specific projects, and maintain control of project finances and management outside the host country budget. Project-based aid gives donors more control over project planning and design decisions, allowing them to source supplies and implementing partners from their own country, more readily demonstrate the results of their specific investments, and more easily track funds. However, some aid officials have expressed concern that U.S. reluctance to use budget support as an aid modality makes it difficult to work with other donors, many of which provide assistance through budget support much more frequently, in SWAps and other coordination mechanisms. Officials have also noted that in some countries, donors providing budget support assistance appear to be more influential in regard to host country policy-making than project-only donors, even when the value of the project aid is much higher than the budget support. ", "In recent years, USAID has sought to increase the use of host country systems while limiting the associated risks. The ongoing USAID Forward initiative aims to triple, to about 30%, the portion of aid flows directed to host country entities rather than U.S. contractors. While this includes aid to local private sector and civil society implementers, aid channeled through host governments may increase as well. Moreover, the United States is using an approach in Afghanistan called \"host-country contracting,\" whereby funds are given directly to specific ministries that have been vetted and trained to responsibly administer the funds. However, these funds are then channeled to pre-designated NGOs for program implementation, a safeguard against corruption which some may argue undermines many potential benefits of direct budget support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Personnel Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Some observers assert that there are disincentives for donor coordination at every level of foreign assistance policy making and implementation. For example, donors may be reluctant to coordinate efforts for fear of diluting their influence or \"brand\" in a country or sector. Legislators may not want to give up control over the direction of assistance programs, which allows them to respond to their constituencies. Aid agencies may fear that increased collaboration will mean less independence and that more efficiency will mean downsizing. They may also be concerned about the difficulty in attributing outcomes to particular contributions, or find it harder to demonstrate the value of their contribution on a project in which they do not have full control. Moreover, several aid officials have suggested that aid workers are too busy to devote time and attention to coordination, a task that most are not evaluated on as part of their individual performance reviews.", "These issues apply equally to bilateral and multilateral donors. As one World Bank report noted, \"harmonization and alignment commitments ... represent a clear break from past patterns of compartmentalization, when the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the regional development banks, bilateral agencies, and the UN group all worked largely on their own and emphasized the distinctiveness of their institutional identities.\" Countries and agencies continue to give priority to maintaining their unique donor identity and long-established relationships. Recipient countries, too, have attachments to their long-standing relationships with donor countries. A report published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark notes that \"government, ministries, sub-national authorities and NGOs have become familiar with and dependent on certain program and project arrangements with certain individual donors, and are reluctant to plunge into new arrangements that could detach them from traditional supporters.\" Host government officials have developed relationships with certain donors, and may not be eager to deal with a single donor-selected representative, or to cede their own authority to work directly with donors to a coordinating committee or agency. While there is no clear evidence of the impact of these incentives on coordination efforts, it is a recurring theme in discussions with aid experts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Inter-agency Coordination", "paragraphs": ["It has long been recognized by analysts and other aid professionals that lack of coordination between the two dozen or so U.S. departments and agencies involved in foreign assistance is an obstacle to coordination with other donors, in addition to a source of inefficiency and incoherency within the U.S. aid structure. Other donors may not always know whom to approach when they want to coordinate with U.S. efforts. While USAID is well recognized as the voice of the United States at multilateral development meetings, leadership in-country can be less clear. One USAID official recounts an international donor coordination meeting in South Africa at which a South African minister had to introduce all of the representatives of U.S. agencies working in South Africa to each other, as each worked with the Minister individually and none had ever met. ", "The 2010 QDDR, a broad assessment of U.S. diplomacy and development programs intended to identify how such programs could be more efficient and effective in meeting national security objectives, addressed many inter-agency coordination issues, at least between the State Department and USAID. One offshoot of QDDR coordination provisions is the use of Country Development Cooperation Strategies (CDCS). These documents summarize U.S. government policies and strategies for a country over a five year period, showing how each agency's activities are synchronized. The CDCS for Guatemala, for examples, notes USAID coordination with the activities of eight other U.S. departments and agencies, as well as detailing the sector priorities of other top bilateral donors. CDCS documents also detail how U.S. efforts align with host country plans and priorities, reflecting the post-Busan emphasis on host governments taking responsibility for coordination. As of October 2012, CDCSs for 15 countries had been approved, and an additional 73 were scheduled for completion by October 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordination Costs", "paragraphs": ["While it is anticipated that greater donor coordination may eventually lead to more efficient implementation and lower administrative costs associated with foreign assistance, many would argue that additional resources are generally needed to establish coordination mechanisms, sometimes for extended periods. Joint assistance strategies, for example, have typically taken two to three years to draft, using significant donor staff time to produce a product that, if successful, may reduce administrative burdens in the future. According to a Paris Declaration evaluation report, \"a majority of donor evaluations state prominently that increased demands on time and staff resources, particularly in the field, are significant disincentives to further harmonization measures.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conflicting Strategic Interests", "paragraphs": ["The goal that drives most efforts to improve donor coordination\u2014more efficient and effective development assistance\u2014is only one of many U.S. foreign assistance objectives, some of which conflict with the donor coordination agenda. One such priority, support for U.S. commercial interests, manifests itself through \"buy America\" procurement regulations that have been an obstacle to full U.S. commitment to the Paris Declaration. Geo-political and security interests dominate U.S. aid policy in many countries as well. There are countries where the United States remains an active donor for reasons related more to strategic security advantages than to development outcomes. Strategic objectives make it difficult for U.S. officials, and those from many donor countries, to delegate their authority to other donors for fear of losing the access and influence that are often a perceived trade-off for aid. For example, if one objective of a USAID school reconstruction project in Afghanistan is to make the local population more accepting of the U.S. military presence in their community, delegating responsibility to another donor, even if that lead donor has a comparative advantage with respect to educational objectives, would result in failure to meet the U.S. strategic objective. ", "Some aid experts contend that donors cannot improve, or even measure, the effectiveness of aid given the multiple and sometimes conflicting effects that are desired. It is hard to measure success when objectives are not clearly stated. Many hope that recent foreign aid reform efforts in Congress and the Administration will lead to improved U.S. policy coherence and greater differentiation between the short- and long-term objectives associated with various foreign assistance accounts. Such clarity may facilitate coordination with other donors in instances where common goals can be identified, and lead to a more straightforward recognition of instances in which greater coordination among donors is simply not in the best interests of the United States."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coordinating with Non-traditional Donors", "paragraphs": ["Researchers have estimated that less than half of all aid that reaches developing countries is now subject to Paris Declaration commitments. Aid from private foundations and NGOs, as well as increasing aid from emerging donors who have not participated in the DAC reporting process, and do not necessarily ascribe to DAC goals on aid effectiveness and transparency, has changed the development landscape. In addition to the much-talked about \"BRICS\" economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, other non-OECD countries such as South Korea, Indonesia, Turkey and Venezuela have become notable aid donors, even as they remain aid recipients. The role of \"South-South cooperation,\" as aid from one developing country to another is often called, and \"triangular cooperation\" efforts, involving cooperation between both emerging and traditional donors, is seen as increasingly significant to effective coordination efforts.", "As ODA becomes an increasingly smaller part of financial flows to developing countries, Paris Declaration indicators and the OECD DAC framework become less relevant. The shift at the Busan HLF away from the OECD DAC partnership structure to the Global Partnership is intended to address this issue by including a broader range of stakeholders. However, expanding the current donor coordination regime to include private actors and a broader range of donor states is challenging. This tension was at the heart of negotiations on the Busan outcome document. Many traditional donor countries felt that bringing emerging donors into the partnership was essential to the ongoing relevance of the aid effectiveness process. Others felt that the concessions necessary to attract a broader base of partners would result in watered down commitments that were meaningless. ", "The former view prevailed, and the Busan document established a two-tiered commitment in which developing country donors and non-governmental entities accept the provisions of the agreement as voluntary guidance, while traditional donors accept them as commitments. While many hope that this is a first step toward full integration of emerging donors with the established norms and best practices of DAC donors, many are skeptical.", "Like traditional donors, developing country donors provide aid for a variety of reasons. Because these donors still face significant poverty at home, provide aid primarily to their neighbors, and place few or no conditions on the aid, South-South aid is often viewed as more political and commercial than development oriented. Emerging donors, like traditional donors before them, may use aid to establish themselves as regional leaders, or to boost their standing in international forums. Access to markets and natural resources are also frequently ascribed motives of South-South cooperation, particularly Chinese aid in Africa. As with traditional donors, these strategic goals may mean that improved efficiency of development assistance is insufficient incentive to overcome the political and technical obstacles to improved coordination. For many non-OECD donors, participation in the OECD DAC reporting process does not provide any particular advantage and may not be worth the associated responsibilities. For those who do see advantages to participating in the ODA reporting (perhaps they aspire to be OECD members and wish to demonstrate their support), there are technical and political obstacles. Reporting detailed and reliable aid data of the quality expected by the DAC requires resources that many smaller donors simply do not have. Donors ineligible for OECD membership because of political and economic requirements may not want to cooperate with an organization that denies them this status. Smaller donors may resist reporting ODA data for fear that their assistance will look insignificant compared to larger donors or to their official rhetoric. Others may be reluctant to reveal information about development partners or business models that can be gleaned from ODA data and may be politically or commercially sensitive. In addition, South-South donors do not generally place governance or human rights conditions on their aid, as DAC donors often do, demonstrating a sensitivity to the view that such conditions are inappropriate interference in the recipient country's internal affairs. A fuller integration into the traditional coordination and effectiveness framework may come with pressure to change this approach. ", "Non-governmental donors, such as foundations and faith-based organizations, also face obstacles to full participation on coordination efforts. According to the OECD, development assistance grants from private voluntary organizations totaled $30.8 billion in 2010, with the bulk of those flows ($22.8 billion) coming from U.S.-based organizations. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation alone provided nearly $2.0 billion in 2010 for global health and development programs. These entities share many of the OECD reporting concerns faced by emerging official donors. They may not have the resources to devote to DAC-quality data collection, and may feel they will not compare favorably to other reporting NGOs. Unlike official donors, they may also have concerns about the impact of such reporting on their fundraising efforts. Furthermore, as noted in the report on the civil society conference that ran parallel to the Accra HLF in 2008, many NGOs involved in international development see their role as much broader than that of official donors, and are wary of the potential negative connotations of the donor label."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["While foreign aid donors for decades have coordinated their efforts by meeting regularly and sharing information on the aid they provide, under the umbrella of the OECD DAC, recent efforts to focus on aid quality rather than quantity, and to include a broader range of development actors in coordination efforts, have significantly changed the development cooperation landscape. Commitments made by the United States and other donors at a series of high-level global forums have not been met. While donors reaffirmed these commitments in Busan in 2011, a variety of challenges, from strategic foreign policy objectives to accountability concerns, make collaborative aid efforts difficult. The growing role of non-traditional donors, as well as private sector investments and philanthropic financial flows to developing countries, present additional coordination challenges, but may as well become opportunities for a new type of collaboration. Participants at the Busan HLF attempted to strengthen the aid effectiveness agenda by incorporating these non-traditional donors and establishing a new Global Partnership to include civil society organizations and emerging donors, though on a voluntary basis. As the Global Partnership settles in to the task of overseeing implementation of this bifurcated agreement, new insights may emerge as to the effectiveness of this broader scope of development cooperation. In the meantime, the United States may continue efforts to improve aid effectiveness and efficiency through maintaining strong relationships with bilateral donors that share U.S. interests and objectives in the developing world, building on the significant progress that has been made with respect to aid transparency, and considering how best to use multilateral development entities and partnerships to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. foreign assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
