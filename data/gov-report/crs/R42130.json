Medical device regulation is complex, in part, because of the wide variety of items that are categorized as medical devices; examples range from a simple tongue depressor to a life-sustaining heart valve. The regulation of medical devices can affect their cost, quality, and availability in the health care system.", "In order to be legally marketed in the United States, many medical devices must be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency responsible for protecting the public health by overseeing medical products. FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is primarily responsible for medical device review. CDRH activities are funded by congressional appropriations and user fees collected from device manufacturers, which together comprise the program level budget. User fees account for 43% of FDA's total FY2016 program level and 28% of CDRH's FY2016 program level. The CDRH program level budget in FY2016 is $450 million, including $127 million in user fees. FDA's authority to collect medical device user fees, originally authorized in 2002 (P.L. 107-250), has been reauthorized in five-year increments and was reauthorized through FY2017 in the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, P.L. 112-144).", "Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), all medical device manufacturers must register their facilities and list their devices with FDA and follow general controls requirements. FDA classifies devices according to the risk they pose to consumers. The FFDCA requires premarket review for moderate- and high-risk devices. There are two main paths that manufacturers can use to bring such devices to market. One path consists of conducting clinical studies and submitting a premarket approval (PMA) application that includes evidence providing reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. The other path involves submitting a 510(k) notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device already on the market (a predicate device) that does not require a PMA. The 510(k) process results in FDA clearance and tends to be much less expensive and less time-consuming than seeking FDA approval via PMA. Substantial equivalence is determined by comparing the performance characteristics of a new device with those of a predicate device. Demonstrating substantial equivalence does not usually require submitting clinical data demonstrating safety and effectiveness. Once its device is approved or cleared for marketing, a manufacturer must comply with regulations on manufacturing, labeling, surveillance, device tracking, and adverse event reporting. In 2015, FDA approved 98% of PMAs accepted for review and 85% of 510(k)s accepted for review were determined to be substantially equivalent.", "Problems related to medical devices can have serious consequences for consumers.

Investment has slowed somewhat to $2.5 billion in 2012, $2.3 billion in 2013, $2.7 billion in 2014, and $2.8 billion in 2015. According to one report, the U.S. medical technology industry generated $336 billion in revenue in 2013 and employed almost 671,000 workers. The \"medical technology industry\" includes \"medical device, diagnostic, drug delivery and analytic/life science tool companies\" but does not include \"distributors and service providers\" such as contract research or contract manufacturing organizations. A 2011 analysis found that \"32 of the 46 medical technology companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue are based in the United States.\" Although the largest companies dominate the market for devices in terms of sales, some believe it is often the small device companies that make a significant contribution to early innovation. Small companies may partner with larger companies to bring products to market if they lack access to the capital and resources to conduct clinical trials and navigate regulatory and reimbursement hurdles.", "Manufacturers make decisions about pursuing new devices based in part on the cost of their development. Additional regulatory requirements may escalate these costs, while other incentives, such as tax breaks or market exclusivity extensions, may diminish them. If the device development cost is too high, the eventual result may be that consumers are denied access to new devices because new products are not developed or brought to market. Access problems have led to proposals for, and the enactment of, incentives to develop medical devices for rare diseases and pediatric populations. However, if the regulation and oversight of device development are not adequate, unsafe or ineffective products may reach the market and cause harm to consumers.", "Problems related to medical devices can have serious consequences for consumers. Relatively recent examples in the media that have caused severe patient injuries and deaths include metal-on-metal hip implants; pacemakers, defibrillators, and associated leads (wires); stents; endoscopes; surgical mesh; and, power morcellators. The metal-on-metal hip has \"been implanted in millions of patients [worldwide], many of whom suffered serious harm and, as a result, needed additional procedures to replace the device.\" An estimated 500,000 patients in the United States have received this type of hip replacement.", "These device problems have raised questions as to whether adequate enforcement tools, resources, and processes are in place at FDA to ensure that marketed devices are safe and effective.

FDA classifies devices according to the risk they pose to consumers. Many medical devices, such as plastic bandages and ice bags, present only minimal risk and can be legally marketed upon registration alone. These low-risk devices are deemed exempt from premarket review and manufacturers need not submit an application to FDA prior to marketing. In contrast, most moderate- and high-risk devices must obtain the agency's permission prior to marketing. FDA grants this permission when a manufacturer meets regulatory premarket requirements and agrees to any necessary postmarket requirements which vary according to the risk that a device presents. ", "There are two main paths that manufacturers can use to bring moderate- and high-risk devices to market with FDA's permission. One path consists of conducting clinical studies, submitting a premarket approval (PMA) application, and requires evidence providing reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. The PMA process is generally used for novel and high-risk devices and results in a type of FDA permission called approval. ", "The other path is shorter and less costly. It involves submitting a 510(k) notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device already on the market (a predicate device ) that does not require a PMA. The 510(k) process is unique to medical devices and results in FDA clearance . Substantial equivalence is determined by comparing the performance characteristics of a new device with those of a predicate device. To be considered substantially equivalent, the new device must have the same intended use and technological characteristics as the predicate; clinical data demonstrating safety and effectiveness are usually not required. The manufacturer selects the predicate device to compare with its new device. However, FDA has the ultimate discretion in determining whether a comparison is appropriate.", "Of the unique devices that are listed by manufacturers with FDA in FY2016, as shown in Figure 1 , about 63% were exempt from premarket review; the remainder entered the market via the 510(k) process (35%), the PMA process (1%), or other means (such as the \" Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) ]\")."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Device Classification", "paragraphs": ["Under the terms of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA, P.L. 94-295 ), FDA classified all medical devices that were on the market at the time of enactment\u2014the preamendment devices\u2014into one of three classes. Congress provided definitions for the three classes\u2014Class I, Class II, and Class III\u2014based on the risk (low-, moderate-, and high-risk respectively) to patients posed by the devices. Examples of each class are listed in Table 1 . ", "Device classification determines the type of regulatory requirements that a manufacturer must follow. Regulatory requirements for each class are described below in more detail. General controls apply to all three classes of FDA-regulated medical devices, unless exempted by regulation, and are the only level of controls that apply to Class I devices. Examples of general controls include establishment registration, device listing, premarket notification, and good manufacturing practice requirements.", "Class I devices are those under current law for which general controls \"are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.\" Many Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification and/or the Quality System (QS) regulation requirements, though they still have to comply with the other general controls. A device is exempt if FDA determines that it presents a low risk of illness or injury to patients. ", "Class II devices are those under current law \"which cannot be classified as class I because the general controls by themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device.\" Class II includes devices that pose a moderate risk to patients, and may include new devices for which information or special controls are available to reduce or mitigate risk. Special controls are usually device specific and may include special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, and postmarket surveillance. Currently \"15% of all device types classified in Class II are subject to special controls.\" Although most Class II devices require premarket notification via the 510(k) process, a few are exempt by regulation.", "Class III devices are those under current law which \"cannot be classified as a class I device because insufficient information exists to determine that the application of general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device,\" and \"cannot be classified as a class II device because insufficient information exists to determine that the special controls ... would provide reasonable assurance of [their] safety and effectiveness,\" and are \"purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health,\" or present \"a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, [are] to be subject ... to premarket approval to provide reasonable assurance of [their] safety and effectiveness.\" ", "In other words, general and/or special controls are not sufficient to assure safe and effective use of a Class III device. Class III includes devices which are life-supporting or life-sustaining, and devices which present a high or potentially unreasonable risk of illness or injury to a patient. New devices that are not Class I or II are automatically designated as Class III unless the manufacturer files a request or petition for reclassification. ", "Although most Class III devices require premarket approval (PMA), some Class III devices may have been cleared via the 510(k) process. In fact, during the first 10 years following enactment of MDA, over 80% of postamendment Class III devices entered the market on the basis of 510(k) submissions showing substantial equivalence to preamendment devices. These are Class III devices that entered the market prior to regulation calling for a PMA application. FDA explains the situation as follows:", "When FDA's medical device regulation program began in the late 1970s, FDA regulated over 170 Class III device types through the 510(k) program, and those devices were never required to submit PMAs, like a typical Class III device. The intent was that FDA's regulation would be temporary and that, over time, the FDA would reclassify those device types into Class I or II, or sustain the classification in Class III and call for PMA applications. This reclassification process is described in Section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Over the years, the FDA made significant progress on the original list of 170 devices; however, as of 2009, 26 medical device regulations still required final action.", "At the time that the MDA of 1976 was drafted, \"relatively few medical devices were permanently implanted or intended to sustain life. The 510(k) process was specifically intended for devices with less need for scientific scrutiny, such as surgical gloves and hearing aids.\" Over time, FDA's 510(k) review process was \"challenged as new devices changed more dramatically and became more complex.\" ", "In late 2009, FDA implemented the 515 Program Initiative \"to facilitate action on these remaining Class III device types.\" Examples of Class III devices that were still regulated via the 510(k) program include the metal-on-metal hip implant, certain dental implants, automated external defibrillator, electroconvulsive therapy device, pedicle screw spinal system, intra-aortic balloon and control system, and several device types related to pacemakers. In 2012, FDASIA changed the process for the reclassification of a device from rulemaking to an administrative order. As a result, since 2013 FDA has published a number of final orders in the Federal Register to reclassify many of these remaining Class III device types.

", "The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA; P.L. 105-115 ) gave FDA the authority to establish procedures for meeting with manufacturers prior to preparing a submission. The procedures aim to speed the review process by giving FDA and a manufacturer the opportunity to address questions and concerns about the device and/or the planned studies that will be used to support the marketing application before the studies are initiated and the application is submitted.

In FY2016, the user fee for FDA review of a PMA submission is $261,388 or $65,347 for a small business; the user fee for FDA review of a 510(k) submission is $5,228 or $2,614 for a small business. GAO found that in 2005, the average cost for FDA to review a PMA was $870,000 and the average cost to review a 510(k) submission was $18,200.

In contrast to a 510(k), PMAs generally require some clinical data prior to FDA making an approval decision. ", "All clinical evaluations of investigational devices (unless exempt) must have an investigational device exemption (IDE) before the clinical study is initiated. An IDE allows an unapproved device (most commonly an invasive or life-sustaining device) to be used in a clinical study to collect the data required to support a PMA submission. The IDE permits a device to be shipped lawfully for investigation of the device without requiring that the manufacturer comply with other requirements of the FFDCA, such as registration and listing. In August and in November 2011, FDA released draft guidance intended to ensure the quality of clinical trials and streamline the IDE process by clarifying the criteria for approving clinical trials. Final guidance on these topics was issued in 2013 and 2014. All clinical studies must also receive prior approval by an institutional review board (IRB).", "A PMA must contain (among other things) the following information: ", "summaries of nonclinical and clinical data supporting the application and conclusions drawn from the studies; a device description including significant physical and performance characteristics; indications for use, description of the patient population and disease or condition that the device will diagnose, treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate; a description of the foreign and U.S. marketing history, including if the device has been withdrawn from marketing for any reason related to the safety or effectiveness of the device; proposed labeling; and a description of the manufacturing process.", "Approval is based not only on the strength of the scientific data, but also on inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure that the facility and the manufacturing process are in compliance with the quality system (QS) regulation. FDAMA made it easier for manufacturers to submit the required sections of a PMA in a serial fashion as data are available (\"modular PMA\").", "When a PMA is first received by FDA, it has 45 days to make sure the application is administratively complete. If not, the application is returned. If the application is complete, it is formally filed by FDA. The agency then has 75 days to complete the initial review and determine whether an advisory committee meeting will be necessary.", "Advisory committees may be convened to make recommendations on any scientific or policy matter before FDA. They are composed of scientific, medical, and statistical experts, and industry and consumer representatives. An advisory committee meeting allows interested persons to present information and views at a public hearing. FDA typically accepts advisory committee recommendations for an application (approvable, approvable with conditions, or nonapprovable). However, there have been cases where FDA's decision has not been consistent with the committee's recommendation. CDRH will hold joint advisory committee meetings with other FDA centers when necessary. Though FDA regulations allow 180 days to review the PMA and make a determination, total review time can be much longer. MDUFA performance goals have been established to reduce the review time for PMAs.", "As a condition of approval for a PMA device, FDA may order a post-approval study to obtain information on device safety, effectiveness, and/or reliability over long-term use of the device in real world populations (as opposed to clinical studies). A report published in November 2014 by JAMA Internal Medicine analyzed 223 post-approval studies of 158 medical devices ordered to be conducted by FDA between 2005 and 2011. The report found that delays in launching and completing such studies were common. The report found limited information on the causes of study delays and variable detail provided on the reason a post-approval study (PAS) was ordered. According to the authors, \"the FDA has never issued a warning letter to a manufacturer for failing to start or complete a mandated PAS, which may undermine its authority in ordering these studies. The most common effect of a PAS was a change to device labeling. The influence of such label changes is unknown.\"", "In 2015, 98% of PMAs accepted for filing were approved by FDA.

The authors found that 65% of the PMA applications were based on a single study that often was not a high-quality randomized controlled clinical trial. This is in contrast to drug applications, which require two randomized well-controlled trials. For a comparison of FDA premarket review processes for drugs and devices, see Table A-1 . The JAMA report found that only 27% of all cardiovascular PMAs were based on a randomized trial and only 14% of the trials of cardiovascular devices used a blinded design.", "In addition, the 2009 JAMA report also found that a majority (88%) of the cardiovascular studies used surrogate end points, \"which may not be reliable predictors of actual patient benefit.\" A surrogate end point of a clinical trial \"is a laboratory measurement or a physical sign used as a substitute for a clinically meaningful end point that measures directly how a patient feels, functions, or survives.\" An example of a surrogate is measurement of cholesterol level that is used as a surrogate marker for the clinical end point, death from heart disease. A drug that lowers cholesterol, however, may not lengthen life.", "The authors of the 2009 JAMA study chose to examine cardiovascular devices \"because it was expected they would undergo the most stringent approval process given their far-reaching impact on morbidity and mortality and their increasing use.\" The authors stated that their findings \"raise questions about the quality of data on which some cardiovascular device approvals are based.\" They argue that in comparison with drug approval, \"the bar for evidence of benefit should be higher for devices because they are implanted and cannot simply be discontinued, as drugs can.\" The importance of FDA device approval versus clearance is significant, as it may preempt consumer lawsuits on device safety leaving injured patients no avenue of legal recourse or redress.", "Decisions by physicians and patients could be more informed regarding the use of high-risk devices, such as cardiovascular devices, if the clinical trial data that FDA reviews to support approval were more accessible. A June 2015 BMJ (British Medical Journal) report found selective reporting problems in the medical literature regarding the published trials of high-risk cardiovascular medical devices. Reporting bias is a well-documented problem in the drug-related medical literature. Those who have analyzed clinical trial information in FDA new drug applications and compared it with the corresponding publications in the medical literature have found the selective reporting of favorable results in the literature. \"Results favoring the new drug over the comparator were significantly more likely to be reported in the literature than unfavorable results. The selective publication of favorable results for drugs includes several types of reporting bias,\" including failure to publish entire studies and failure to publish unfavorable outcomes. ", "The June 2015 BMJ report, the first of its kind, found that \"half (51%) of clinical studies of novel high risk cardiovascular devices remain unpublished over two years after FDA approval.... When these studies are published, there are often clinically relevant discrepancies between FDA documents and corresponding publications.\" According to the authors, these findings \"point to the importance of mandatory registration on a public clinical trials platform. Clinicaltrials.gov is an important step in this direction, but recent data show that published trials often have discrepant findings between clinicaltrial.gov and publications.\" The authors state that \"the accessibility and user friendliness of FDA reports needs to be considerably improved. As clinicians can use devices immediately after FDA approval, it is in the public interest that all of the data be available to clinicians at that time.\"", "A January 2014 JAMA report examined FDA approval of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs)\u2014such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), and other cardiac devices\u2014via the PMA process and the PMA supplement process. CIEDs were chosen as \"a useful case study because they have been the subject of substantial evolution over the past 30 years,\" and the authors sought to \"characterize the nature of the changes in each supplement and understand the data supporting these changes.\" The first CIED was approved by FDA via the PMA process in 1979. The report found that from 1979 to 2012, FDA approved 77 CIED PMAs and 5829 PMA supplements based on those 77 original CIED PMAs. That represents a median of 50 supplements per original PMA. The authors warn clinicians and patients that \"clinical data are rarely collected as part of PMA supplement applications prior to marketing.\" Of the 5829 PMA supplements, almost half (2,754, 47%) were allowed onto the market via the 30-day notice supplement, about a quarter were 180-day supplements (1,538, 26%), and another quarter were real-time supplements (1,312, 23%) and special supplements (108, 2%); only a small fraction used the more rigorous panel-track supplement (15, 0.3%).", "Two medical device recalls that were widely reported in the media\u2014the Medtronic Sprint Fidelis and St Jude Medical Riata ICD leads\u2014both entered the market via the PMA supplement process. The Medtronic Sprint Fidelis was a 180-day supplement, and the St Jude Medical Riata was a real-time supplement; neither was studied in human trials prior to FDA approval. According to the authors of the January 2014 JAMA report, the \"FDA's approval of many supplements without new human trials, as in the case of these recent ICD changes, highlights the importance of collecting rigorous postapproval performance data.\" Yet the January 2014 JAMA report states that postapproval studies for devices on the market via a PMA supplement are uncommon. PMA supplements \"allow patients to benefit from incremental innovation in device technology by providing efficient and inexpensive FDA review pathways for smaller device changes.\" However, many such minor design changes may add up to a substantial difference from the device approved in the original PMA application. Therefore, the authors of the January 2014 JAMA study recommend \"more widespread implementation of rigorous postmarket studies to evaluate device performance once approved for clinical use.\" ", "As stated previously in this section, others might also argue that because such devices are implanted within the patient, and cannot be easily removed without the risk of causing major complications, the evidence of benefit should be higher for devices during the FDA premarket review process in comparison with the evidence for drugs. Allowing innovative but potentially defective devices to quickly enter the market may leave large numbers of patients and their physicians with very difficult decisions. ", "For example, the failure rate for the Sprint Fidelis lead was 2.8% per year. When the lead fails, it can deliver a painful and unnecessary shock (750 volts) to the patient's heart. According to one cardiologist, \"[m]ost patients can tolerate one shock, as the pain is over almost before the brain has time to process the magnitude of the insult. But almost no one can tolerate multiple shocks. The first shock starts the fear cycle. First is extreme anxiety, but after a second or third shock, anxiety from the possibility of more shocks progresses quickly to near terror.\" ", "The risk of major complications in replacing the lead is 15.3%. The leads \"run a long course through the veins into the heart. The body's natural healing process forms scar tissue at multiple sites along the lead that can create strong attachments to the wall of a blood vessel or a heart chamber. Freeing a lead from these attachments requires considerable skill and experience and is more difficult and risky than implanting the leads in the first place.\" Therefore, if a lead does not show signs of malfunction, most patients would be closely watched rather than receive prophylactic surgery to remove the lead.", "In two announcements, dated October 2015 and February 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) stated that over 500 hospitals in 43 states had been fined more than $280 million for implanting ICDs in \"Medicare patients in violation of Medicare coverage requirements.... In terms of the number of defendants, this is one of the largest whistleblower lawsuits in the United States.\" The DOJ announcement provides further details about the settlement:", "Medicare coverage for the device, which costs approximately $25,000, is governed by a National Coverage Determination (NCD). [CMS] implemented the NCD based on clinical trials and the guidance and testimony of cardiologists and other health care providers, professional cardiology societies, cardiac device manufacturers and patient advocates. The NCD provides that ICDs generally should not be implanted in patients who have recently suffered a heart attack or recently had heart bypass surgery or angioplasty. The medical purpose of a waiting period\u201440 days for a heart attack and 90 days for bypass/angioplasty\u2014is to give the heart an opportunity to improve function on its own to the point that an ICD may not be necessary.

New developments in the electronic, plastic, metallurgy, and ceramics industries, coupled with progress in design engineering, led to invention of the heart pacemaker, the kidney dialysis machine, defibrillators, cardiac and renal catheters, surgical implants, artificial vessels and heart valves, intensive care monitoring units, and a wide spectrum of other diagnostic and therapeutic devices. Although many lives have been saved or improved by the new discoveries, the potential for harm to consumers has been heightened by the critical medical conditions in which sophisticated modern devices are used and by the complicated technology involved in their manufacture and use. In the search to expand medical knowledge, new experimental approaches have sometimes been tried without adequate premarket clinical testing, quality control in materials selected, or patient consent.", "The Dalkon Shield, a contraceptive device introduced in November 1970, is \"an example of a legitimate device which was marketed without adequate premarket testing.\" Other examples include defective cardiac pacemakers and intraocular lenses which, following implantation, caused unusual eye infections resulting in serious vision impairment or the need for removal of the eye. ", "Congress amended the FFDCA in 1962 to require FDA approval of a new drug application prior to marketing and to require that a new drug be shown to be effective as well as safe. Following these changes, FDA began \"to impose rigorous premarket approval of some products that today would be deemed devices.\" Court decisions in the late 1960s upheld FDA's authority to regulate some medical devices as drugs due in part to the overlapping definitions of drug and device in the 1938 law. FDA classified a number of devices as drugs (contact lenses, injectable silicone, pregnancy-test kits, bone cement), and only such devices were subject to premarket review (prior to 1976). However the approach of classifying devices as a drug was unsuccessful in other court decisions and the need for more comprehensive authority to regulate devices was recognized by the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon Administrations.", "The Medical Device Amendments of 1976", "The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA; P.L. 94-295 ) was the first major legislation passed to address the review of medical devices. The MDA provided a definition for the term device. It established a number of requirements referred to as general controls that applied to all devices. Examples include provisions on adulteration and misbranding, prohibitions on false or misleading advertising, and a requirement to register all medical device manufacturers with FDA. One such provision required manufacturers to notify FDA 90 days prior to the marketing of any new device; if the agency failed to act, marketing could begin. Because this provision is outlined in section 510(k) of the FFDCA, it is often referred to as a \"510(k) notification.\" ", "The MDA directed FDA to classify, into one of three classes, all medical devices that were on the market at the time of enactment; these are the preamendment devices. Congress provided definitions for the three classes\u2014Class I, Class II, Class III\u2014based on the risks to patients posed by the devices. In contrast to the approach taken with pharmaceuticals (all, except generic agents, undergo rigorous premarket review and approval), Congress limited premarket approval to only a small number of devices. \"Only the highest-risk category [Class III] would require agency review and approval as a precondition for commercial sale and routine medical use. The other two categories would be subject not to a rigorous review but merely a requirement [510(k)] that the manufacturer of a device notify FDA, at least 90 days before commencing marketing, of its intent to distribute the product commercially.\" For Class I devices, no additional review was needed once the status of Class I was confirmed; general controls were considered to be sufficient to protect public health. For Class II devices, limited supplemental review would be needed to verify conformity with performance standards if such standards had been established by the agency.", "Under MDA, all devices coming to market after enactment were automatically placed in Class III until reclassified; these are the postamendment devices. As stated above, Class III medical devices receive more intense scrutiny and require an application for premarket approval (PMA) before the device can be marketed. However, the MDA allowed for the reclassification of a device from one class to another. According to a 2011 IOM report on medical devices:", "The classification and reclassification process did not include any evaluation of the safety or effectiveness of the device types being categorized. Once a device type was assigned to Class III, the FDA was directed to promulgate a regulation calling for manufacturers of devices of that type to submit a [PMA] application. The agency would then (and only then) undertake a review of the safety and effectiveness of the devices. For device types placed into Class I or Class II, there was no mechanism for the systematic review of safety and effectiveness. Congress envisioned instead that the agency would use its postmarketing tools to identify and address issues of lack of safety or lack of effectiveness case by case. Thus, preamendment devices in Class I and II were never subjected to a comprehensive FDA evaluation for safety or effectiveness. The classification process was not completed until 1988.", "For postamendment devices, which were automatically placed into Class III, there were two important exceptions:", "The primary exception involved a postamendment device that was substantially equivalent to another device of the same type that either as a preamendment device that had not been classified into any class or was not a preamendment device but had already been classified into Class I or Class II. The FDA permitted manufacturers of postamendment devices to demonstrate substantial equivalence to a preamendment device in Class I or II as part of the 510(k) submission. An alternative exception provided that the postamendment device would not be in Class III if the FDA, in response to a petition, classified it into Class I or Class II.", "The MDA did not provide a definition for the term substantially equivalent. The MDA also did not itemize the required contents of a 510(k).

FDA had not promulgated performance standards for most Class II devices. The new law authorized the use of alternative restrictions, called special controls, at the agency's discretion and simplified the process of establishing performance standards for Class II devices. Examples of special controls include special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, patient registries and postmarket surveillance. ", "FDA also had experienced difficulty in promulgating regulations needed to require submission of PMA applications for Class III devices. SMDA authorized FDA to reconsider all the preamendment devices that had been placed in Class III and reclassify some of these devices into Class I or Class II. The purpose was \"to reduce the number of device types that needed PMA review.\" For those devices remaining in Class III, the agency was directed to establish a schedule for promulgation of regulations calling for PMAs of devices that still used the 510(k) notification as an entry to the marketplace. ", "Under SMDA, FDA must issue a response to a 510(k) submission before marketing of a new device can begin. SMDA allowed for the evaluation of safety and effectiveness data in 510(k) notifications, but only in certain situations. These were limited to cases in which a new device offered different technologic characteristics from the already marketed pre a mendment or postamendment (predicate) device. \"Because the assessment of substantial equivalence generally did not require evidence of safety or effectiveness of a device and because a preamendment device to which equivalence was established was not itself reviewed for safety or effectiveness, the FDA made clear from the outset that clearance of a 510(k) notification was not a determination that the cleared device was safe or effective. That position was reiterated by the agency numerous times. The US Supreme Court accepted this interpretation in a 1996 opinion.\"", "SMDA established postmarket requirements for medical devices. SMDA required facilities that use medical devices to report to FDA any incident that suggested that a medical device could have caused or contributed to the death, serious illness, or injury of a patient. Manufacturers of certain permanently implanted devices were required to establish methods for tracking the patients who received them and to conduct postmarket surveillance to identify adverse events.

It authorized the creation of a third-party review system of 510(k) submissions for Class I and most Class II devices that still required 510(k) review. It allowed certain new devices (those not substantially equivalent to another device and automatically placed in Class III) to be evaluated for immediate placement in Class I or Class II. This process, called the de novo 510(k), avoids PMA review, must be completed in 60 days, and may be requested by the sponsor. ", "For substantial equivalence determinations in which the new device has a different technological characteristic, FDAMA requires that FDA \"consider the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial equivalence and request information accordingly.\" For a medical device using an important breakthrough technology, or which does not have an approved alternative device, priority review of the PMA must be provided by FDA.", "FDAMA limited the use of some postmarket controls (device tracking and postmarket surveillance) to Class II and Class III devices, eased reporting requirements of adverse events for device user facilities, eliminated mandatory reporting of adverse events by medical device distributors, and directed FDA to establish a sentinel reporting system to collect information on deaths and serious injuries or illnesses associated with the use of a medical device.", "Medical Device User Fee Acts", "The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250 ) established a user fee program for premarket reviews of 510(k) submissions and PMA applications; user fees may not be used for other FDA or CDRH activities. MDUFMA also made targeted changes that would reduce regulatory burdens and agency workload, such as allowing establishment inspections to be conducted by accredited persons (third parties).
