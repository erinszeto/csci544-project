These disruptions have produced an immediate and very strong demand shock on the U.S. food supply chain that has sent many commodity prices sharply lower.", "The food supply chain refers to the path that raw agricultural commodities take from the farm where they are produced, through the food processing and distribution network to the consumer where they are used. Supply chain disruptions have been primarily due to two factors: widespread shutdowns of all but essential businesses; and uncertainty about the availability of labor for the food distribution network\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether from illness, fear of illness, or immigration status. The food supply chain has been deemed essential; however, many institutional purchasers (including restaurants, hotels, schools, and entertainment venues) have been closed. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. consumers normally spend 54% of their food and drink dollars on away-from-home food purchases. Thus, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic a large share of U.S. food products traveling through the food supply chain was going to institutional buyers, often in bulk or vendor-ready form, for away-from-home consumption. In order to redirect this food product flow towards retail outlets and at-home consumption, much of this food would require processing into more consumer-usable forms, repackaging, and relabeling. This requires some level of retooling by food packagers and processors. In addition, several plants in the food processing industry, including meat processing plants, have experienced severe COVID infection outbreaks among workers and been forced to shut (at least temporarily).", "Several industry groups from the U.S. agricultural sector have released estimates of the economic damage experienced by producers and ranchers. Most of these early assessments are limited to evaluating the effect of the price decline on any unsold production of crops or livestock remaining under farmer's control, and the unexpected marketing costs of unsold products due to the shutdown of most institutional buying of agricultural products. Cumulatively, industry estimates of COVID-related losses approach $40 billion (this would represent over 10% of annual cash receipts). The effect on farm net income is expected to be similarly negative.", "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress has passed and the President has signed four supplemental appropriations acts ( P.L. 116-123 , P.L. 116-127 , P.L. 116-136 , and P.L. 116-139 ) that have included both direct and indirect funding for the U.S. agricultural sector. On April 17, 2020, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP), valued at $19 billion, to provide immediate financial relief to farmers, ranchers, and consumers in response to the COVID-19 national emergency. According to Secretary Perdue, CFAP will include $16 billion in direct payments to producers that have been impacted by the sudden drop in commodity prices and the disruption in food supply chains that has occurred since the outbreak, and $3 billion in commodity purchases for distribution through food banks, faith-based organizations, and other nonprofit organizations.", "CFAP direct payments are intended to partially offset the loss of market revenue from the price decline, and the unexpected carry-cost of unsold commodities for producers and ranchers of products that have been negatively affected by COVID-19. USDA has released limited information on the specifics of how CFAP's direct payment program will be implemented. Many of the program specifics are expected to be delineated in an expedited rulemaking process. CFAP direct payments are expected to go out to producers by the end of May or early June.", "CFAP's commodity purchase and distribution program serves the dual roles of supporting commodity market prices by temporarily increasing demand, and of expanding the availability of food distribution to consumers that have lost their jobs or have limited resources. Expectations are that it will be operated differently than, and separate from, existing USDA commodity purchase programs such as Section 32 or Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) food distribution programs in two major ways. First, USDA plans to purchase about $100 million per month of fresh produce, $100 million per month of dairy products, and $100 million per month of meat products (chicken and pork). Second, the CFAP purchase program intends for vendors to deliver household-ready boxes\u00e2\u0080\u0094potentially a diversified mix of the previously mentioned produce, meat and dairy products\u00e2\u0080\u0094which are ready for more convenient and immediate distribution (\"off the truck and into the trunk\") that is consistent with social distancing. Initial program delivery may be as early as May 15. The program is expected to operate through the end of 2020. Potential congressional concerns include how to channel assistance to industries affected by COVID-19, long-term effects of the pandemic, and the capacity of rural banks to help with recovery.

Supplies for most commodities remain relatively abundant; however, inflexibilities in the food supply chain (from food product specialization targeting food service and institutional markets that have closed, to pandemic outbreaks at processing plants) have resulted in bottlenecks that have left many farmers with unmarketable surpluses, while some retail outlets have experienced temporary shortages of various food and agricultural products. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Temporarily Empty Grocery Store Shelves", "paragraphs": ["During the early weeks of shutdown in March and April, many grocery stores had empty shelves for basic staples such as pasta, rice, sugar, and flour, as well as frozen ready-to-eat foods, household cleaning products, and toilet paper. This was the result of a temporary surge in consumer food stockpiling\u00e2\u0080\u0094much of it in the form of panic buying and potential hoarding\u00e2\u0080\u0094that occurred in March when consumers worried that they might be locked down in their houses for weeks or months. This type of shortage is temporary. Eventually the existing supplies of foodstuffs and other household products work their way through the food supply chain and restock the grocery store shelves. ", "The temporary shortage occurred due to two primary factors. First, consumers had been getting a significant share (54%) of their food from restaurants and other away-from-home venues. All of this demand was suddenly diverted to grocery stores and retail outlets almost overnight. This switch is not simply a matter of redirecting truckloads of products away from institutional buyers towards retail outlets, but also of transforming many products from bulk or vendor-ready forms to consumer-ready forms in smaller packages with new product labelling. Furthermore, truckers would now be making many stops for smaller deliveries to retail outlets along their routes, rather than a few stops to large buyers. All of this would require re-engineering of the food supply networks that ultimately may be temporary once the pandemic eases.", "Second, much of the food supply chain operates on a \"just-in-time\" principle to minimize costs associated with storage and waste of products. Under this principle, many processing plants and transportation routes are designed to operate near full capacity on a routine basis in expectation of slow, steady demand and to avoid the cost of idled resources\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is particularly true for food products and other items like toilet paper that normally do not experience large fluctuations in demand over time. ", "Thus, not all production processes can ramp up on short notice to meet unexpected surges in demand for their products, or to suddenly alter the product form, packaging, labeling, and shipping methods. As a result, shortages due to consumer stockpiling create bulges in the supply chain that may take weeks or months to eliminate as the food supply chain re-engineers itself in response.

The surplus supply situation has been compounded by the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China, which disrupted traditional trade patterns and contributed to lower trade levels (and greater than expected U.S. stock levels) for several major commodities in the second half of 2018 and 2019. ", "Globally, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations reports that stocks for many major agricultural commodities\u00e2\u0080\u0094including wheat, rice, corn, barley, coffee, sugar, butter, cheese, palm oil, soybean oil, poultry, and pork\u00e2\u0080\u0094are at or near 20-year highs. A similar situation exists within the United States. On April 9, 2020, USDA reported that the major U.S. grain and oilseed crops, as well as upland cotton, all had relatively large end-of-year stocks levels last fall (2019) to carry into this year. On April 22, 2020, USDA reported abundant supplies of meat, dairy, fruit, vegetable, and tree nut products in cold storage. Similarly, USDA reports that hog and poultry populations in the United States are historically large, while the cattle population has rebounded from its low point in 2014. In addition, USDA reported that for 2020, U.S. farmers intended to increase corn and soybean planted acres by 8% and 10%, respectively, while adjusting wheat (1%) and cotton acres (<1%) down slightly from 2019. If such large planted acres are realized, under normal weather conditions, they could produce bumper crops and further expand domestic supplies.", "According to news reports, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has said that consumers should not worry about a shortage of food, saying the supply chain is just mismatched.

This left many agricultural producers with excess supplies of perishable products\u00e2\u0080\u0094including fruit, vegetables, milk, and market-ready livestock\u00e2\u0080\u0094that are not easily diverted to alternate uses or retail outlets.

In addition, the U.S. agricultural sector relies on a large workforce to operate the production lines in food processing plants, including meat packing plants, as well as fruit and vegetable wholesale and distribution networks. This labor force performs supply chain activities including production, transportation, processing, warehousing, packaging, and retailing. Many of these supply chain activities cannot be automated or done remotely, but rely on workers being on site. For example, USDA reports that more than 1.5 million people worked in food processing in the United States in 2016. Meat processing, which tends to be more labor intensive than other parts of the food sector, accounted for 500,000 of those employees. Workers that are still planting and harvesting crops, or standing on an assembly line in a meat packing plant, during the coronavirus outbreak have a high risk of being infected with the disease given that they live, work, and travel in crowded conditions, and most do not have health care or paid sick leave. ", "Another labor-intensive component of the food supply chain is federal safety inspection, which is undertaken by about 8,000 USDA safety inspectors stationed at every agricultural manufacturing facility throughout the country, as well as about 3,800 safety inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

As evidence of this, USDA has reported a widening price gap between farm and wholesale prices for beef.

Low oil prices contribute to lower agricultural prices via a strong biofuels link between the two sectors. Corn is both the world's foremost livestock feed grain and the principal feedstock in the production of the biofuel ethanol. Ethanol is blended with gasoline in the United States (at about a 10% share) for use in automobiles and light trucks.

By April 25, the Renewable Fuels Association reported that about 46% of ethanol production capacity was idled. Furthermore, the prices of nearly all feed grains and oilseeds produced in the United States move in tandem with corn prices since they all compete for the same feed markets in consumption and farmland in production.

Macro factors include an inflation-adjusted 5% decline in consumer expenditures from FAPRI's January pre-COVID baseline projections, and a 10% decline in gasoline use.", "Under these assumptions, FAPRI projects substantial price declines for all major grain, oilseed, and livestock commodities in 2019/20 and 2020/21, which result in large declines in farm revenue\u00e2\u0080\u0094including -$11.9 billion in crop and -$20.2 billion in livestock cash receipts ( Table A-1 ). The revenue declines are partially offset by declines in production expenses (-$11.3 billion) and an increase in farm program payments (+$2.3 billion) under the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs. However, the sum of the projected changes is for a large decline in U.S. net farm income of -$20 billion for 2020 (down from FAPRI's January forecast of $99 billion in 2020 net farm income, and compared to $95.3 billion in 2019). FAPRI does not include any payments under USDA's proposed CFAP. Although preliminary, FAPRI's early projections are indicative of the potentially large impact that COVID-19 may have on the U.S. agricultural sector.

Such considerations may include an evaluation of whether there is a need to facilitate less reliance by the private sector on low-cost, just-in-time supply chains. This model has proven to be inflexible in responding to the COVID-19 emergency, which requires rapid product transition from bulk institutional buyers to consumer-ready retail outlets, and greater regional storage capacity to hold temporary surges in unsold product. The potential costs to taxpayers of supporting a more flexible supply chain could include expanded regional warehousing, cold storage, food bank storage, etc. Expediting the food assistance supply chain is also being proposed through \"farm-to-food bank\" programs ( S. 3605 ).
