Established under Title VII of the Older Americans Act (OAA), the Administration on Aging (AoA) within the Administration for Community Living in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the nationwide program. As of 2013, there were 53 state LTC Ombudsman Programs operating in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico, and 575 local programs. Title VII programs received about $20.7 million in FY2015. Total 2013 funding for ombudsman activities from all sources combined (federal and nonfederal) was $92.5 million, the most recent year for which data on funding from all sources are available.

In 2013, ombudsmen reported just over 16,500 nursing facilities and about 53,400 other residential LTC facilities operating nationwide. This translated to a nationwide ratio of one paid ombudsman for every 57 facilities and one paid ombudsman for every 2,400 resident beds. With respect to staffing, the program receives significant support from volunteers. In 2013, over 1,200 paid staff and about 8,300 certified volunteers investigated more than 190,000 resident complaints. Issues regarding residents' rights were the chief complaint in nursing homes, followed by residents' care issues in 2013.

The most recent amendments to the OAA, in 2006 ( P.L. 109-365 ), made no major changes to the program. Finally, the Elder Justice Act (enacted as part of the ACA) included two elder justice-related activities that would directly assist state LTC Ombudsman Programs.

Another four state Ombudsman Programs are located in another government agency outside the SUA, and three states have state Ombudsman Programs that exist inside state governments but operate as independent agencies. Another eight states and the District of Columbia have Ombudsman Programs that are located outside of state government in other organizations, such as a legal services agency or protection and advocacy agency. Variation in the organizational placement of Ombudsman Programs exists partly because the OAA gives each state discretion in determining many aspects of the Ombudsman Program. For example, states can decide", "where Ombudsman Programs may be located organizationally within the state, whether enabling legislation should be passed at the state level, and whether additional funding will be made available through state and local sources. ", "These differences mean that the structure, operation, and effectiveness of Ombudsman Programs vary from state to state. Moreover, certain characteristics and features of state LTC Ombudsman Programs, by design, make the program different than other OAA programs and services, such as the Ombudsman Program's independence, strict disclosure requirements, and the responsibility to designate staff and volunteers to serve as representatives. While these unique features and state variation exist, there has been concern among policymakers and other stakeholders that these features have led to inconsistent interpretation of OAA provisions and ultimately issues of compliance.
