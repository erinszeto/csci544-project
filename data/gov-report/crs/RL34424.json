Essentially all spending on federal wages and salaries is discretionary. Spending can be measured by budget authority (BA; what agencies can legally obligate the government to pay) or outlays (disbursements from the U.S. Treasury). This report mostly discusses trends in outlays.", "Federal spending in fiscal year (FY) 2014 was just over a fifth (20.3%) of the U.S. economy, as measured as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), which is close to its average share since FY1962. Discretionary spending accounted for 33% of total outlays in FY2014 ($3,504 billion), well below mandatory spending's share (60% of outlays in FY2014). Weak economic conditions in recent years as well as demographic trends have increased spending on mandatory income support and retirement programs, while policy makers have acted to constrain the growth of discretionary spending. As interest rates return to more normal levels as the recovery proceeds, net interest costs\u20146.6% of federal outlays in FY2014\u2014are projected to rise.", "Discretionary spending's share of total federal spending has fallen over time largely due to rapid growth of mandatory outlays. In FY1962, discretionary spending accounted for 67% of total outlays and was the largest component of federal spending until the mid-1970s. Since then, discretionary spending as a share of federal outlays and as a share of GDP has fallen. Under current law projections, discretionary spending's share of GDP will fall to 5.2% in FY2024. Discretionary spending can be split into various categories to reflect broad national priorities or how federal spending decisions are made. In FY1962, discretionary spending was 12.7% of GDP, with defense spending making up 9.3% of GDP. In FY2014, discretionary spending was 6.8% of GDP, with defense spending (including war) totaling 3.5% of GDP. Defense spending can be divided between base budget and war expenditures, both of which grew sharply from FY2002 through FY2011. On average, defense outlays grew 6.8% per year in real terms from 2000 to 2010, while real non-defense discretionary outlays grew 5.6% per year. Discretionary spending has also been divided into security and non-security categories. Non-defense security spending rose sharply after 2001 and was 1.0% of GDP in FY2013, nearly twice its level before 2001.", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) reintroduced statutory limits on spending by imposing a series of caps on discretionary BA from FY2012 through FY2021. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) modified limits for FY2013 and FY2014. The FY2013 full-year funding bill (H.R. 933; P.L. 113-6) enacted March 26, 2013, conformed to those limits. The Bipartisan Budget Act (H.J.Res. 59; P.L. 113-67) also modified BCA limits for FY2014 and FY2015. On January 17, 2014, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (H.R. 3547; P.L. 113-76) was enacted to provide funding within those limits for the rest of FY2014. On September 19, 2014, a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 124; P.L. 113-164) was enacted to provide funding for the government until December 11, 2014.", "The direction of fiscal policy has been the focus of contention among macroeconomists. Some contend that more spending would help reduce high unemployment levels, while others call for imposing greater budgetary stringency.

Discretionary spending also funds grants, purchases of equipment and other assets, and contractor services that support various federal programs and activities.", "Congress provides and controls discretionary funding through annual appropriations acts, which grant federal agencies the legal authority to obligate the U.S. government to make payments.

Appropriations legislation controls discretionary funding and provides budget authority to fund specific programs. Congress exercises its constitutional power of the purse by deciding what funds federal agencies can obligate on behalf of the U.S. government, for what purposes and for specified time periods. While budget authority is available for just a single year (such as for most personnel compensation costs), some appropriations (such as for many military construction projects) provide budget authority for multiple years, or indefinitely. Agencies obligate funds by signing contracts or hiring employees or contractors or in other ways. Budget authority has been compared to funds deposited into a checking account, which then can be used for specified federal purposes.", "Outlays are disbursed federal funds. Outlays are recorded when the U.S. Treasury disburses appropriated funds to purchase goods and services, pay employees, issue benefits, or make interest payments. Agencies typically do not spend all of their budget authority in the year it becomes available, which implies that outlays will lag behind budget authority. ", "Outlay data are used to assess the macroeconomic effects of the federal budget, whereas budget analysis of specific federal programs is often based on budget authority, because that is what Congress controls directly.

", "Different types of mandatory programs are set up in diverse ways, reflecting historical influences, technical demands, and specific legislative authorities. While the term \"entitlement\" can be defined to coincide with the mandatory programs, many would distinguish programs providing benefits to large populations meeting set eligibility requirements from more special payments, such as salaries of judges covered by Article III of the Constitution.", "In some cases, mandatory and discretionary spending support similar activities. For example, Medicare health care benefits are classified as mandatory spending, while most health care benefits for veterans and military personnel are classified as discretionary spending.", "Legislative procedures for funding discretionary programs differ from those for mandatory programs. Congress provides discretionary funds (BA) each year through the annual appropriations process. Other types of legislation, such as authorization measures, control mandatory spending. Some mandatory programs, such as Social Security, are financed outside the annual appropriations process. Other mandatory programs, such as Medicaid, are funded through appropriations measures, while the level of spending reflects eligibility requirements and other provisions set in authorizing legislation, as well as the pool of potential beneficiaries and program participation rates.", " Table 1 provides a simple division of federal spending (i.e., mandatory and discretionary spending) by contrasting the type of budget authority needed for specific purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Fiscal Policy and Discretionary Spending", "paragraphs": ["Policy disagreements about fiscal policy challenges continue to influence trends in discretionary spending.

Some features of mandatory programs have often been changed to respond to economic conditions. For example, the period of eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits has often been changed during recessions. Tax policy changes have also been used to respond to macroeconomic conditions. In addition, as incomes fall during recessions, tax revenues fall and more families become eligible for means-tested mandatory programs; deficits rise, which helps dampen economic shocks. When economic growth resumes, those changes run in the opposite direction. Those changes are therefore known as automatic stabilizers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fiscal Policy Complicated by Slow Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Addressing short-term and long-term challenges simultaneously is difficult because additional government outlays, according to most economic research, would boost economic recovery, while reducing spending could help enhance fiscal sustainability\u2014as would increases in federal revenues.

Some policy makers have called for expansion or continuation of programs intended to alleviate economic vulnerabilities of households and businesses, while other policy makers have argued that discretionary spending should revert to pre-crisis levels. Whether the federal government should take immediate steps to close the gap between spending and receipts or wait until the economy is more fully recovered has been subject to debate among economists. ", "While much of the funds made available by measures responding to the financial crisis or the subsequent recession were classified as mandatory or revenue reductions, discretionary spending also rose sharply. Most notably, Congress in early 2009 responded to weak economic conditions and dramatic job losses that sharply increased unemployment rates by passing a major fiscal stimulus package. The resulting measure, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; H.R. 1 , P.L. 111-5 ), enacted on February 17, 2009, included stimulus spending and tax cuts estimated at the time to total $787.2 billion, including about $300 billion in discretionary spending. ARRA included funds for discretionary spending on education initiatives, support for state governments, public housing, infrastructure, and health care. In 2012, CBO estimated the total budgetary effect of ARRA at $831 billion between 2009 and 2019.", "The recovery that followed the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession has been relatively slow. Economic growth in the United States, however, has been faster in recent years than in many other advanced economies. Economic recoveries following major financial crises can be much less robust than recoveries following more cyclical downturns. Some continue to call for a more expansionary fiscal policy to respond to high unemployment levels, which would entail larger budget deficits in the short run. Other economists are skeptical that such fiscal policies would ameliorate deeper problems caused by high personal and federal debt levels, and therefore call for fiscal restraint as a first step towards addressing longer-term fiscal challenges, or at least a transition to a less expansionary fiscal policy.

", "The BCA set limits on discretionary spending that were initially estimated to save about $900 billion over the next decade relative to a pre-BCA baseline. The BCA also established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (JSC), known as the \"Super Committee,\" to develop and present a plan to Congress and the President that would achieve an additional $1.2 trillion or more in savings. The BCA, in return, allowed a set of increases to the debt limit, subject to congressional disapproval, enabling the government to borrow through February 2013.

The cap enforcement sequester was modified by ATRA to apply to security/non-security categories, rather than the defense/non-defense categories previously in effect. Because the full-year funding measure ( H.R. 933 ; P.L. 113-6 ) was designed to conform to these modified discretionary spending limits, the cap sequester was avoided. The discretionary spending limits enforced by that sequester, however, effectively set top-line totals for the FY2013 full-year funding measure.", "The change in the FY2013 discretionary limits from defense/non-defense to security/non-security may have shifted the allocation of spending reductions. Because the security category is broader than the defense category, cap enforcement sequester reductions would have applied to a larger pool of programs.
