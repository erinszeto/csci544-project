In some circumstances, a lack of data can lead analysts and decisionmakers to draw incorrect or misleading conclusions. The result may be policies that squander resources, waste taxpayer dollars, and/or undermine the effectiveness of government programs or military operations.

A 2014 Inspector General report found that the Army's audit readiness was at risk \"because of unreliable data in the appropriations status report.\" A 2013 GAO report found that due to a lack of data to support better decisions, DOD did not effectively manage its supply chain in Afghanistan. This mismanagement had the effect of \"hampering the distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter\" and affecting operations in Afghanistan. According to a 2011 report, after almost 10 years of war, DOD possessed neither a consolidated theater-wide database capable of tracking the amount of money spent on reconstruction nor a database tracking the amount of money spent on contracting in Afghanistan.", "Despite the importance of data, general consensus exists among government officials and analysts that DOD does not sufficiently incorporate data into decisionmaking. Many major policy decisions\u2014from economic development programs in Afghanistan to choosing the weapon systems of the future\u2014are made without the benefit of substantive data. These policies are sometimes based on assumptions, and some have argued that program reviews do not always sufficiently incorporate relevant data against which to measure success.

According to GAO, the Joint Staff lacked a database for gathering the information necessary to manage weapon system portfolios. The consequence of not having sound systems is that managers of multibillion dollar programs might manage and oversee activities using manual, paper-based processes. As an article in Defense AT&L magazine argued, such a manual process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and more likely to introduce unintended errors during the process. Such a process can also prevent leaders from fully exploiting \"valuable troves of program information because the process creates innumerable separate and often conflicting data sources, rather than authoritative and searchable information sources.\" ", "If a system does exist, it needs to be capable of effectively performing the required functions.

In some cases, DOD has multiple information technology (IT) systems and databases containing the same or similar information. There may be sound reasons to have the same data stored in more than one system. However, the multiplicity of systems can become a concern when the data in the various systems conflict\u2014and it is not always clear which, if any, system is the agreed source for given data.

Congress, legislative and executive branch agencies, analysts, and the public all rely on FPDS as a primary source of information for understanding how and where the federal government spends contracting dollars. Congress and the executive branch rely on the information to help make and oversee informed policy and spending decisions. Analysts and the public rely on the data to conduct analysis and gain visibility into government operations. ", "The FPDS database plays an important role in decisionmaking, and a number of observers have raised concerns over the accuracy, limitations, and reliability of the data contained therein. According to GAO, FPDS often contains data with limited \"utility, accuracy, and completeness.\" The Office of Management and Budget has also released guidance requiring executive branch agencies to implement GAO recommendations seeking to improve FPDS data quality. Continued concerns raised over the reliability of FPDS data have prompted many analysts to rely on it only for identifying broad trends and making rough estimations. ", "According to the General Services Administration (GSA), a number of data systems, including FPDS, are undergoing a significant overhaul. This overhaul is a multiyear process that is expected to improve the reliability and usefulness of the information contained in the data systems. Part of the effort includes focus groups with stakeholders, including agency decisionmakers and congressional staff, to solicit feedback on how to improve the reliability, usability, and relevance of the data stored in the systems being updated. While no date has been set for completing this effort, officials believe that the upgrades will be rolled out sometime in 2017 or 2018. ", "Tracking Operations and Support (O&S) costs is another case in point. In 2012, GAO found that DOD reports to Congress on weapon system O&S costs were \"often inconsistent and sometimes unreliable, limiting the visibility needed for effective oversight of these costs.\" As a result of having insufficiently comprehensive and reliable data, GAO also found that DOD officials did not have the information necessary to analyze operations and support cost growth for major systems, identify cost drivers, or develop plans for managing and controlling such costs. Not only were O&S data incomplete, sometimes the data were inconsistently reported. According to DOD, \"nothing prevented a program office from reporting unit O&S cost estimates on a per item basis (e.g., per airplane) in one year and on a per usage basis (e.g., per flying hour) in the next year.\" Nor have DOD components consistently tracked O&S costs against final estimates after the systems were fielded. ", "The office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) is now requiring more consistent use of units for calculating O&S, but it will take years to build a bank of data for conducting analysis.

There are times when the need to protect information argues against sharing data. However, in some circumstances, there are barriers to sharing data that are not grounded in such security concerns. According to a recent RAND report", "there are institutional and cultural barriers to sharing. For example, interviewees pointed to a stovepiped structure of DoD and how it limits visibility and the sharing of information. Institutional structure and bureaucratic incentives to restrict data access are exacerbated by policy and guidance to protect information. The result is a strong conservative bias in labeling and a reluctance to share. ", "Another challenge is getting decisionmakers to use existing data effectively. Some observers argue that DOD does not have sufficient numbers of people capable of conducting complex data analyses and providing the results of the analyses to decisionmakers. Some analysts and government personnel believe that there are senior leaders within DOD who do not understand how to use data effectively to inform decisions.

Another common trap cited by some observers is the tendency to just start collecting data and then asking what the data can do for you. Without a well-thought-out understanding of what data is needed\u2014and why\u2014 the quest for data could end up being an end in itself, with very limited usefulness. Some DOD officials believe that too much time is already spent responding to data calls and following reporting requirements that are not connected to a useful analytical purpose, diverting the attention of acquisition personnel from managing their programs. ", "Another caution raised by some observers is the need to ensure that the benefit of data analyses outweighs the cost of collecting and analyzing data (in terms of dollars, time, and other resources). For example, spending two years and $100 million dollars to build an IT system to inform a decision of whether to invest $75 million dollars in a one-time project is likely to be considered by most people as a poor use of resources. ", "Some observers have argued that striving for more and better data can sometimes be an elusive goal that can actually get in the way of effective data analysis. These observers note that data do not need to be perfect to be useful. Rather, decisionmakers should focus on whether sufficient data exist from which to draw reasonable conclusions. One official in DOD with experience in the insurance industry suggested that when working with data, critical questions to ask include: ", "1. What useful analysis can be developed now? 2. How can we model correctly? 3. What are the uncertainty bounds of the data (as an effort to understand the usefulness of the data)?", "Just as imperfect data can be useful, even perfect data is unlikely to yield perfect analysis. As one senior official stated (paraphrasing famed statistician George Box), all models are wrong, but some are useful. Cost estimating is a case in point. Even under the best of circumstances, cost estimates for large programs are imprecise. But a good cost estimate can aid in understanding the potential probability and consequence of various risks, which in turn can help decisionmakers craft budgets, allocate resources, and develop test plans.
