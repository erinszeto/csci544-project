The original act was intended to change attitudes toward domestic violence, foster awareness of domestic violence, improve services and provisions for victims, and revise the manner in which the criminal justice system responds to domestic violence and sex crimes. The legislation created new programs within the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS) that aimed to reduce domestic violence and improve response to and recovery from domestic violence incidents. VAWA primarily addresses certain types of violent crime through grant programs to state, tribal, and local governments; nonprofit organizations; and universities. VAWA programs target the crimes of intimate partner violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.", "In 1995, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) was created administratively within DOJ to administer federal grants authorized under VAWA. In 2002, Congress codified the OVW as a separate office within DOJ. Since its creation, the OVW has awarded more than $6 billion in grants. While the OVW administers the majority of VAWA authorized grants, other federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in HHS) and the Office of Justice Programs (in DOJ), also manage VAWA grants.", "Since its passage in 1994, VAWA has been modified and reauthorized several times. In 2000, Congress reauthorized the programs under VAWA, enhanced federal domestic violence and stalking penalties, added protections for abused foreign nationals, and created programs for elderly and disabled women. In 2005, Congress again reauthorized VAWA. In addition to reauthorizing the programs under VAWA, the legislation enhanced penalties for repeat stalking offenders; added additional protections for battered and/or trafficked foreign nationals; created programs for sexual assault victims and American Indian victims of domestic violence and related crimes; and created programs designed to improve the public health response to domestic violence.", "In February 2013, Congress passed legislation (Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013; P.L. 113-4) that reauthorized most of the programs under VAWA, among other things. The VAWA reauthorization also amended and authorized appropriations for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, enhanced measures to combat trafficking in persons, and amended some VAWA grant purpose areas to include sex trafficking. Moreover, VAWA 2013 gave Indian tribes authority to enforce domestic violence laws and related crimes against non-Indian individuals, and established a nondiscrimination provision for VAWA grant programs.

This act addressed congressional concerns about violent crime, and violence against women in particular, in several ways. Among other things, it enhanced investigations and prosecutions of sex offenses by allowing for enhanced sentencing of repeat federal sex offenders; mandating restitution to victims of specified federal sex offenses; and authorizing grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women. ", "Congressional passage of VAWA was ultimately spurred on by decades of growing unease over the rising violent crime rate and a focus on women as crime victims. Beginning in the 1960s, the violent crime rate rose steadily, igniting concern from both the public and the federal government. Supplementing the concern for the nation's rising violent crime rate was the concern for violence against women. In the 1970s, grassroots organizations began to stress the need for attitudinal change regarding violence against women. These organizations sought a change in attitude among both the public as well as the law enforcement community. ", "In the 1980s, researchers began to address the violence against women issue as well. For instance, Straus and Gelles collected data on family violence and attributed declines in spousal assault to heightened awareness of the issue by both men and the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system and the public were beginning to view family violence as a crime rather than a private family matter. ", "In 1984, Congress enacted the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA, P.L. 98-457 ) to assist states in preventing incidents of family violence and to provide shelter and related assistance to victims of family violence and their dependents. While FVPSA authorized programs similar to those discussed in this report and has reauthorized programs that were originally created by VAWA, such as the National Domestic Violence Hotline, it is a separate piece of legislation and beyond the scope of this report.", "In 1994, Congress passed a major crime bill, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-322 ). Among other things, the bill created an unprecedented number of programs geared toward helping local law enforcement fight violent crime and providing services to victims of violent crime. In their introduction to the Violence Against Women Act, then-Senator Joseph Biden and Senator Barbara Boxer highlighted the weak response to violence against women by police and prosecutors. The shortfalls of legal response and the need for a change in attitudes toward violence against women were primary reasons cited for the passage of VAWA. ", "Since it was enacted in 1994, Congress has reauthorized VAWA three times. Most recently, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-4 ) that reauthorized most of the programs under VAWA, among other things. The VAWA reauthorization also amended and authorized appropriations for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, enhanced measures to combat trafficking in persons, and amended VAWA grant purpose areas to include sex trafficking. Moreover, P.L. 113-4 gave Indian tribes authority to enforce domestic violence laws and related crimes against non-Indian individuals, and established a nondiscrimination provision for VAWA grant programs.

For instance, most intimate partner homicides involve married couples; as such, some researchers have suggested the decline in marriage rates among young adults as a contributing factor in the decline in intimate partner homicide rates. Additionally, divorce and separation rates have increased. Fewer marriages may result in less exposure to abusive partners and fewer marriages may suggest that those who do marry are more selective in choosing a partner.", "Overall, homicide is committed largely by males, mostly victimizing other males.
