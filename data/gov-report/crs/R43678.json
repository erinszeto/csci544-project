On July 23, 2014, the House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5171. The bill provided $1.40 billion for FWS, down 2.0% from the FY2014 level of $1.43 billion contained in P.L. 113-76. The President requested $1.48 billion, an increase of 3.4% over the FY2014 level. In addition, the Administration proposed a number of significant accounting changes. As the committee noted, some of these changes make comparisons with funding in prior years impossible for some accounts. The House committee accepted a few of the Administration's changes, while rejecting others. The committee further made its own changes in accounting, in order to emphasize certain priorities. In combination, the many changes affect a number of comparisons.", "Other highlights of H.R. 5171 include the following:", "A 9.3% increase in funding for hatcheries and aquatic resources.

Elimination of funding for Cooperative Landscape Conservation and Adaptive Science.", "There were also several funding restrictions or directives. Among these were the following:", "A prohibition on expansion or creation of national wildlife refuges using moneys from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Migratory Bird Conservation Account, or any other sources without specific congressional approval.

The Administration proposed to collapse all funding under Endangered Species, Habitat Conservation, and Environmental Contaminants and their various subaccounts into new Ecological Services and Habitat Conservation accounts, with the subaccounts divided differently among them compared to previous years. However, none of the Administration's proposed changes removed subaccounts (such as Candidate Conservation, Consultation, and Recovery) from the overarching Resource Management account. Comparison of funding levels between years for such traditional accounts for ESA could not be made as there were no longer any accounts with those labels.

Due to the proposed restructuring, the Administration request cannot be compared to the FY2104 levels. The committee retained the old structure, so its proposal can be compared with the FY2014 levels. ", "The committee reduced some subaccounts, with the listing program showing the largest drop at 13%. Other subaccounts showed modest increases. FWS has long argued that responding to listing petitions uses agency resources that would be better spent on listing species that the agency itself judges to be more in need of protection. In contrast, critics argue that FWS has proposed and listed very few domestic species on its own initiative and that without petitions many listings would not occur, especially for domestic species.", "The committee bill for FY2015 continued specific ceilings on the maximum spending for listing species in response to petitions, for listing foreign species, and for designation of critical habitat; similarly structured limits were contained in FY2014 appropriations. Such limitations on critical habitat designation have been a feature of appropriations bills for over 15 years and have been supported by each Administration, while limits on funding for petitions are somewhat newer, but still supported over many years. In committee, language was added to the report ( H.Rept. 113-551 ) commending FWS for its delay in listing the long-eared bat under ESA, and directing FWS, if it does list the species as threatened, to consider a special rule that would allow \"activities minimally affecting the species to continue.\" ", "The House committee approved $62.6 million (+1.6%) for consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Under Section 7, federal agencies are obliged to consult with FWS on their actions which may affect listed species, and to obtain a biological opinion (BiOp) from FWS on whether the action might jeopardize the species. If jeopardy is found, the BiOp may include reasonable and prudent alternatives for the agency action that would avoid jeopardy. FWS consultation may be critical to timely actions by federal agencies, which might otherwise hesitate to act in the face of potential citizen suits under the ESA.", "The committee report contained language to encourage FWS to proceed with efforts to delist remaining populations of gray wolves. Within the amounts for recovery, the committee directed that $1 million be used for a program to compensate ranchers for livestock losses due to wolf depredation; the committee also urged the Administration \"to seek funding for this program through the Department of Agriculture in future years.\"", "The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund (CESCF) also benefits species that are listed or proposed for listing under ESA, through grants to states and territories. The House committee approved $49.2 million for the CESCF, down 1.7% from the FY2014 level of $50.1 million. The Administration requested $50.0 million. The program assists states with, among other things, the preparation of habitat conservation plans (HCPs). HCPs are developed for non-federal actions by state, local, business, or private entities as a requirement for obtaining an incidental take permit for actions that may affect listed species. For HCPs involving many actors, states may use their funds from this program to coordinate the HCPs, to develop a single umbrella plan on behalf of a region, or to acquire land to mitigate effects of a project.

The FWS science programs have supported work with partners at federal, state, tribal, and local levels to develop strategies to address climate and other impacts on wildlife at local and regional scales. This research has supported and worked especially through a network of Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) to understand and ameliorate threats to wildlife, including the effects of climate change. The LCCs are an amalgam of research institutions, federal resource managers and scientists, and lands managed by agencies at various levels of government. The committee eliminated funding for LCCs, while providing $5.10 million in science support in an existing program under Conservation and Enforcement. This level represents a 70.4% reduction in that program as well. While lauding the science programs within the National Fish Hatchery System, the committee noted that the Administration's proposed restructuring of FWS science programs was the third such effort in three budget cycles.
