It also analyzes state-reported data that could potentially be used to calculate these grants. Differences in LEP and immigrant student counts based on the different data sources are compared, revealing substantial differences in student counts for some states depending on the data source used. FY2007 grants are calculated using both the ACS and state-reported data to examine the potential differences in state grant amounts depending on the data source used. The differences in student counts that exist between the ACS and state-reported data are reflected in the differences in estimated state grant amounts, as some states would receive substantially more or less funding if state-reported data were used to calculate grants rather than the ACS data. Consideration is also given to the drawbacks of using either the ACS or state-reported data and possible alternative strategies for determining state grant awards (e.g., averaging the student counts from the ACS and state-reported data) are discussed.", "This report will be updated as warranted by legislative action."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The number of limited English proficient (LEP) students enrolled in K-12 education increased by 60.8% from the 1994-1995 school year to the 2004-2005 school year; total student enrollment increased by 2.6% over the same time period.

After reserving the required funds, grants to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico are determined based on the state's proportional share of LEP students and immigrant students relative to the U.S. population of LEP students and immigrant students. These shares are then weighted, with a higher weight (0.8) being assigned to the state's population of LEP students and a lower weight (0.2) being assigned to the state's population of recent immigrant students.

In practice, ED has been using the ACS data to make state allocations since FY2005. Title III grants for a specific fiscal year have been based on ACS data from two years prior. For example, FY2007 grants are based on the 2005 ACS data. According to testimony provided by Cornelia Ashby, Director of Education, Workforce, and Income Security Issues at the Government Accountability Office (GAO), ED has not used state data because it believes the state data are incomplete.

For example, for the 2005 ACS, individuals entering the country in 2003 or later were counted as recent immigrant students. According to GAO, these questions were developed for the 1980 census to \"obtain information needed about current language use and limited English language proficiency as a result of legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Bilingual Education Act, and the Voting Rights Act.\" These questions have not been modified since their inception. Thus, they were not designed specifically for Title III purposes.", "Tables 1 and 2 provide the ACS counts for LEP and immigrant students, respectively, used by ED in determining state grant amounts for FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007. Few states had relatively stable LEP student counts from 2002 to 2003 and 2003 to 2004 ( Table 1 ). It was more common for states to experience substantial increases or decreases in their number or percentage of LEP students across the various ACS administrations. For example, the number of LEP students in Arizona declined by over 16,000 students from 2002 to 2003 but increased by nearly 21,000 students from 2004 to 2005, while the number of LEP students in Texas decreased by almost 58,000 students from 2002 to 2003 and increased by almost 25,000 students from 2003 to 2004. In other states, the change in the estimated number of LEP students may have been relatively small, but because some states serve small numbers of LEP students, changes in their student counts can result in large percentage changes. For example, the number of LEP students in Arkansas increased by about 8,000 students from 2002 to 2003 and decreased by about 5,000 students from 2003 to 2004, resulting in percentage changes in student counts of 59.9% and 21.6%, respectively. Although the number of immigrant students identified through the ACS is smaller then the number of LEP students, similar patterns were found in the immigrant student counts across years ( Table 2 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State-Reported LEP Student Counts", "paragraphs": ["There are several potential sources of state-reported data and three types of state LEP student counts: (1) total number of LEP students, (2) number of LEP students receiving services (Title III or non-Title III), and (3) number of LEP students being served in Title III. The National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition and Language Instruction Educational Programs (NCELA) uses data provided by states to ED in their Consolidated State Performance Reports (CSPRs) to produce an annual state-by-state count of the number of LEP students enrolled. The CSPRs collect data on the total number of students identified as LEP. The most recent data available are for the 2004-2005 school year. Missing data and data discrepancies were resolved by NCELA through telephone calls to the relevant states.", "The Common Core of Data (CCD) collects data on the total number of students receiving LEP services. This is not limited to Title III services only. Rather, it includes students served in appropriate programs of language assistance. This is somewhat different than the data available from NCELA, as the CCD count does not include students who are identified as LEP but are not receiving services. The most recent data available from the CCD are for the 2004-2005 school year.", "A third source of data is the biennial report on Title III performance. The first report was published by ED in 2005 and covered 2002-2004. It included data on the number of LEP students served in Title III programs during the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years. It did not, however, report on the total number of LEP students in the state or the total number of LEP students receiving Title III and non-Title III services. According to staff at NCELA, the second biennial report, expected later this year, will include counts of both the number of LEP students served in Title III programs and the total number of LEP students in the state. They also indicated that much of the data included in the forthcoming second biennial report has been drawn from the annual CSPRs.", "LEP student counts from the NCELA data and CCD data are compared for the 2002-2003, 2003-2004, and 2004-2005 school years ( Table 3 ). The NCELA data produced using the CSPRs are more complete than the data available from the CCD, as state data are missing for several states in the CCD data. As the NCELA LEP student count is, in theory, a more comprehensive count than the CCD LEP student count, it would be expected that the NCELA counts would be higher than the CCD counts but not substantially higher, as it is not expected that many parents would choose for their children not to receive services. The data on Table 3 do not consistently support these theories. For example, for the 2004-2005 school year, the NCELA count is actually lower than the CCD count in 18 states. For Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West Virginia, the NCELA count is at least 20% lower than the CCD count. Although it was expected that the NCELA count might be somewhat higher than the CCD count, in Florida, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin, the NCELA count is at least 20% higher than the CCD count. Similar issues exist with the data from the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years. It is the exception, rather than the rule, that the NCELA data and the CCD data match or differ by a relatively small number of students. In addition, differences between the NCELA data and the CCD data change for some states from year to year with the NCELA count being higher in some years, the CCD count being higher in other years, and the magnitude of the differences between the counts changing from year to year. This raises questions about how states are conducting LEP student counts, whether these counts are being conducted consistently within a state and from year to year, and which students are actually being included in the counts.", "Although not shown in Table 3 , data from the NCELA and CCD from 2003-2004 were compared with data reported in the biennial report for 2003-2004. As previously discussed, the NCELA data, in theory, provide the most comprehensive count of LEP students, including all identified LEP students. The CCD data, in theory, provide the second most comprehensive count of LEP students by including all students receiving LEP services. The biennial report data, in theory, are the least comprehensive of the three sources of data as they include only the number of LEP students receiving Title III services. A brief examination of data for Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, and California revealed that the biennial LEP student count was higher than the CCD count in Alabama and Arizona. It was also higher than the NCELA count in Arizona.

As the LEP student count accounts for 80% of a state's total grant amount, it was important to have the most recent data available and, if possible, to be using a school year comparable to the year in which the ACS data were collected. The LEP student counts produced by NCELA for the 2004-2005 school year met both these criteria. And, unlike the CCD data for the same school year, they presumably include a more nearly complete count of total LEP student enrollment, as the data were confirmed with state officials as needed. Although one of the primary purposes of this request was to compare the ACS data with state data, it should be noted that the NCELA and ACS data are collected from different respondents using different questions. Again, the NCELA data include the population of students identified as LEP, while the ACS is a sample survey conducted with native and non-native English speaking individuals.", "As previously mentioned, data sources for immigrant student counts are more limited, so the latest available data were from the 2003-2004 school year.

With respect to LEP student counts, for example, the state data indicate that there are almost 500,000 more LEP students in California than indicated by the ACS data. Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah each reported at least 25,000 more LEP students than accounted for by the 2005 ACS.

ED also noted that states did not necessarily assess all LEP students, which could result in the number of students identified as being LEP exceeding the number of students assessed annually for English language proficiency (as required by Title I of the ESEA). In addition, ED noted that states may have provided inconsistent data because the instructions to states for providing this information did not include definitions of the data to be included. GAO found that the aforementioned instructions were sufficiently vague as to allow multiple interpretations of the instructions, and reported that ED had indicated that it would clarify the instructions for the 2006-2007 Consolidated State Performance Report (due in December 2007). ED was also in the process of providing feedback to states on the data provided on the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 CSPRs and expected that this would lead to improved state data for subsequent school years. Until these data are reported by states, however, it is not possible to know how complete these data will be and whether additional followup, such as the efforts conducted by NCELA regarding the 2004-2005 data, will be needed to produce final counts that could be used as the basis for determining state grants.", "These issues are further complicated due to the different methodologies used to identify which students are LEP students, as there is no standard methodology by which students with limited English proficiency are identified. Screening instruments used to identify LEP students vary by state and even within states. Even among states using similar methods, the states may differ in their interpretation of the results. States may also differ in how they determine which students to screen for LEP. Although most states use home language surveys to determine what language is spoken at home, some states may also use strategies such as classroom observations to identify students for screening.", "There are also problems with immigrant student counts reported by states. GAO found that state officials question the reliability of the data they collect, as schools and school districts may not be permitted to ask students directly whether they are immigrant students. Rather, some states and districts rely on information about a student's place of birth and date of entry into the school system to determine whether a student is a recent immigrant. These determinations may be further complicated if a student has no prior school documentation, so there is no way to determine based on student records whether the student previously attended another school in the United States and for how long.", "It should be noted, however, that if grants are determined on the basis of state-reported data, possibly through the CSPRs, a perverse incentive may be created for states to over-report the number of LEP and immigrant students to gain additional federal funds.
