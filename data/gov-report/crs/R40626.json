In some cities, delivery occurred more than once per day until 1950. In other, more remote rural areas, deliveries continue to occur fewer than six days per week. Today, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to \"150 million homes and businesses, six days a week.\" Throughout the service's history there have been discussions about reducing the number of delivery days to conserve fuel and reduce costs.", "After running modest profits from FY2004 through FY2006, USPS lost $25.4 billion between FY2007 and FY2011.

Conversely, if Congress maintains the mandate for 6-day delivery, Congress and USPS would need to find other ways to achieve equivalent financial savings, so that the package is sufficient to restore USPS's financial viability.

That study, according to Corcoran, was completed, but a formal proposal stemming from the study was not drafted. Instead, in 1977, the congressionally-created Commission on Postal Service (created in 1975) submitted to Congress and the President a report that discussed the possibility of transitioning to five-day delivery. The members of the congressional commission were divided on whether to recommend eliminating a day of Postal Service delivery. The commission's final report said that five of the seven commissioners reluctantly recommended the reduction in delivery, but did not say which day of the week would be the optimal day off.", "While the Commission would prefer not to recommend a reduction in delivery standards, the alternative of increased postal costs and rates causing volume declines is less acceptable.", "The other alternative is to increase the public service appropriation to provide six-day delivery.

According to Representative Patricia Schroeder, who opened the hearings, USPS prompted the hearings by proposing a cut back in delivery service. Although USPS made no formal indication that it supported the elimination of one service day, one Member of Congress said that \"statements made by postal officials indicate[d] they [were] leaning toward making such a recommendation.\"", "In all, Congress held 12 hearings in as many cities with more than 500 testimonies offered between November and March. Those who testified included Members of Congress, union representatives, editors and publishers, the general public, and representatives of the aging.

At a March 26, 1980, hearing before the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, then-Postmaster General William F. Bolger stated that eliminating Saturday delivery was one option the Postal Service was considering to ensure its economic stability in the face of the budget cuts. Mr. Bolger estimated the service reduction could result in the elimination of 15,000 to 20,000 Postal Service jobs, but would save the service about $588 million.", "The Washington Post quoted Mr. Bolger as saying the service cuts could be the \"only one workable alternative\" for the service as a result of anticipated cuts in federal subsidies.

Another possible interpretation is that the same percentage of customers that received 6-day delivery in 1983 should continue to receive 6-day delivery today. As a result of demographic changes, under either interpretation, the actual addresses receiving 6-day delivery service could be substantially different today than it was in 1983.", "In 2008, the ambiguity of the delivery provision led the PRC to conclude that \"the Postal Service exercises considerable flexibility in determining how it delivers the mail.\" USPS stated in its own 2008 report on its service obligations that it would like Congress to remove the six-day service provision requirement to allow \"flexibility to meet future needs for delivery frequency, in accordance with a careful balancing of various considerations.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USPS Requests Five-Day Delivery", "paragraphs": ["On March 18, 2010, then-Postmaster General John Potter testified before the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government.

The overview document included new estimates for anticipated overall savings if Saturday delivery were eliminated, which was $3 billion per year. The $3 billion savings estimate is $0.5 billion less per year than the savings estimate offered by USPS in its 2008 study discussed earlier in this report. In the new estimate, savings would largely \"come from carrier labor and fuel costs. Other savings will be gained from processing, transportation, maintenance, and a reduction in future employee benefit obligations.\" Unlike the previous USPS savings estimate on five-day delivery, this newer study includes an anticipated $0.2 billion loss \"due to a slight\" impact in sales volume prompted by the eliminated delivery day.
