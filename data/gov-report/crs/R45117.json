Commodity prices are under pressure from a record soybean and near-record corn harvest and from diminished export prospects due to an ongoing trade dispute with China. U.S. farm income experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports. Most crops and livestock product prices remain significantly below the average for 2011-2014, when prices for many major commodities attained record or near-record highs. Net farm income is projected down 46% since its record high of $123.7 billion in 2013. Net cash income is projected down 31% from its 2013 high of $135.6 billion. Farm-sector production expenses have risen 2.5% over that same period, thus contributing to lower aggregate income totals.", "Government payments are projected up nearly 18% from 2017 at $13.6 billion\u2014the highest total since 2006 and due largely to market facilitation payments by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) of approximately $4.6 billion in response to the U.S.-China trade dispute. Ad hoc disaster assistance and crop insurance indemnity payments were also larger in 2018.", "Since 2008, U.S. agricultural exports have accounted for a 20% share of U.S. farm and manufactured or processed agricultural sales. In 2018 total agricultural exports are forecast up 2% at $143.4 billion. However, abundant supplies in international markets, strong competition from major foreign competitors, and the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute are expected to shift trade patterns and diminish U.S. export prospects in 2019.", "In spite of the lower farm income outlook, farm wealth is projected up 1.4% from 2017 to $3.0 trillion. Farm asset values reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long-term profitability of farm sector investments. Farmland values are projected up 1.9% in 2018 following a 2.3% rise in 2017. Because they comprise such a significant portion of the U.S. farm sector's asset base (81%), change in farmland values is a critical barometer of the farm sector's financial performance. At the farm household level, average farm household incomes have been well above average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s. However, that advantage has narrowed in recent years. In 2014, the average farm household income (including off-farm income sources) was about 77% higher than the average U.S. household income. In 2017 (the last year with comparable data), that advantage is expected to decline to 27%.", "The outlook for lower net farm income and relatively weak prices for most major program crops signals the likelihood of continued relatively lean times ahead. The U.S. agricultural sector's well-being remains dependent on continued growth in domestic and foreign demand to sustain prices at current modest levels. In addition to commodity prices, the financial picture for the agricultural sector as a whole heading into 2019 will hinge on both domestic and international macroeconomic factors, including interest rates, economic growth, and consumer demand.

U.S. soybean plantings have been steadily expanding out of the traditional Corn Belt\u2014the fertile zone stretching from Ohio westward through Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, southern Minnesota, and northern Missouri to the eastern half of Nebraska and Kansas\u2014and into the Central and Northern Plains. ", "Heading into the 2018 spring planting period, USDA weather reports in early February indicated increasingly dry conditions across the southern tier of the United States and the northern plains ( Figure 3 ). Those dry conditions persisted through much of the early growing season. Such dry conditions generated considerable concerns for producers with no or little access to irrigation. They were also of significant concern to the U.S. cattle sector, which depends on spring and early summer grazing across the Northern and Southern Plains and on cheap and abundant feed grains through the remainder of the year. In contrast to the Plains states, the major growing zones of the Corn Belt and Southeast received favorable weather through the growing season, contributing to USDA's forecast for large harvests of corn, soybeans, rice, and cotton in 2018.", "Through the summer months, abundant rainfall occurred throughout the primary temperate crop growing zone stretching from the Dakotas and Kansas eastward to Ohio.

For the past several years, U.S. corn and soybean crops have experienced remarkable growth in both productivity and output, thus helping to build stockpiles at the end of the marketing year. This has been particularly true for soybeans, which have seen rapid growth in yield, acres planted, and stocks ( Figure 6 ). This pattern continued into 2018 when, for the first time in history, U.S. soybean plantings (at 89.145 million acres) narrowly exceeded corn plantings (89.140 million acres). The record soybean plantings, coupled with record yield (52.1 bushels/acres), are expected to produce a record U.S. soybean harvest of 4.6 billion bushels and record ending stocks in 2018. The record harvest and abundant supply are expected to pressure soybean farm prices lower (-8%) to a projected $8.60 per bushel for the 2018/2019 marketing year\u2014the lowest farm price since 2006. ", "For corn, USDA forecasts a record national average yield of 178.9 bushels/acre (up 1.3% from the previous year's record yield). As a result, the United States is expected to produce the second-largest corn harvest on record at 14.6 billion bushels. Despite the near-record production, USDA predicts that record large domestic usage (including for livestock feed, ethanol production, other industrial processing, and seed) plus record exports (2.45 billion bushels) will result in a reduction in corn ending stocks, a decline in the ending stocks-to-use ratio to 11.5% (down from 14.5%), and a slightly higher season average farm price of $3.60/bushel ( Figure 5 ).", "The corn and soybean crops provide important inputs for the domestic livestock, poultry, and biofuels sectors. In addition, the United States is traditionally one of the world's leading exporters of corn, soybeans, and soybean products\u2014vegetable oil and meal. During the recent five-year period from 2013/2014 to 2017/2018, the United States exported 49% of its soybean production and 15% of its corn crop. As a result, the outlook for these two crops is critical to both farm sector profitability and regional economic activity across large swaths of the United States as well as in international markets. However, a tariff-related trade dispute between the United States and several major trading partners (in particular, China) has cast considerable uncertainty over the corn and soybean markets. ", "The trade dispute has resulted in sharply lower purchases of U.S. agricultural products by China in 2018, with continued diminished prospects for 2019. China was the top export market for U.S. agricultural products in 2017 with $25.9 billion in purchases. With the realization of diminished Chinese purchases, USDA has revised downward its expected export value to China for 2018 to $20.5 billion and for 2019 to $13.6 billion. Similarly, USDA has lowered its U.S. soybean export forecast from its initial estimate of 2.3 billion bushels in May 2018 to 1.9 billion bushels in its December 2018 WASDE report. The marketing year extends through August 2019.

Reduced beef supplies led to higher producer and consumer prices, which in turn triggered the slow rebuilding phase in the cattle cycle that started in 2014 (see the price-to-feed ratio for steers and heifers, Figure 8 ). The resulting continued expansion of beef supplies pressured market prices lower in 2016. The lower price outlook is expected to persist through 2019, despite strong domestic and international demand across all meat categories\u2014beef, pork, and poultry ( Table A-4 ).

Production is projected to continue to grow at strong rates in 2019: beef (+3.3%), pork (+5.3%), broilers (+1.7%), and eggs (+1.5%). Fortunately for producers, USDA projects that combined domestic and export demand will continue to grow for red meat (+4.2%) and poultry (+1.8%), thus helping to support prices and profit margins into 2019.", "The changing conditions for the U.S. livestock sector may be tracked by the evolution of the ratios of livestock output prices to feed costs ( Figure 8 ). A higher ratio suggests greater profitability for producers. The cattle-, hog-, and broiler-to-feed margins all moved upward in during 2014 but have exhibited substantial volatility during the 2015-2018 period. The hog, cattle, and broiler sectors remain profitable. However, continued production growth of between 2% and 3% for red meat and poultry suggests that prices are vulnerable to weakness in demand. Milk prices and the milk-to-feed ratio fell sharply during 2018, suggesting eroding profitability. While this result varies widely across the United States, many small or marginally profitable producers face continued financial difficulties. In addition, both U.S. and global milk production are projected to continue growing in 2018. As a result, milk prices could come under further pressure in 2019, although USDA is currently projecting milk prices up slightly in 2019.", "With respect to the federal milk margin protection program (MPP) instituted by the 2014 farm bill (Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. 113-79 ), the formula-based milk-to-feed margin used to determine government payments fell below the $8.00 per hundredweight (cwt.) threshold needed to trigger payments in early 2018.

Total farm debt is forecast to rise to $409.5 billion in 2018 (+4.8%) ( Table A-3 ). Farm equity (or net worth, defined as asset value minus debt) is projected to be up slightly (+1.0%) at $2.6 trillion in 2018 ( Table A-3 ). The farm debt-to-asset ratio is forecast up in 2018 at 13.5%, the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( Figure 26 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Average Farm Household Income", "paragraphs": ["Farm household wealth is derived from a variety of sources.
