Included are data on land and water boundaries for the northern Canadian border and the southern Mexican border, as well as the international boundaries for the U.S. states that border these countries. Coastline figures for the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, the Great Lakes, and extraterritorial areas are also included.

The length of the Alaska-Canada border alone is 1,538 miles.

The figures for Alaska reflect a 1961 remeasurement.", "It is important to note that boundary and coastline distances can differ significantly based on the scale used on the maps or charts. The Canadian and Mexican international borders are less problematic than the coastline measures because there are long stretches that are straight, such as the nearly 900-mile section of the U.S.-Canadian border along the 49 th parallel.", "Coastline measurements are more difficult because of the effects of tides and the necessarily arbitrary decisions that must be made about measuring bays, coves, islands, and inlets leading to streams and rivers. The \"general coastline\" data in this report are based on large scale nautical charts, resulting in a coastline measure for the 50 states totaling12,383 miles. Another measure using smaller scale nautical charts more than doubles this measurement to 29,093 miles, while the figures used by the NOAA in administering the Coastal Zone Management program (16 U.S.C. \u00a71451) come to 88,612 miles (not including the Great Lakes).", " Table 3 provides figures for the areas of the U.S. coastline bordering international waters.
