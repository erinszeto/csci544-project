Congressional interest in these courts has been heightened by the January 17, 2007, letter from Attorney General Gonzales to Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter advising them that a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge had \"issued orders authorizing the Government to target for collection international communications into or out of the United States where there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is a member or agent of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization,\" stating that all surveillance previously occurring under the TSP will now be conducted subject to the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and noting that the President has determined not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires.

It also provides a statutory structure for the installation and use of pen registers and trap and trace devices for use in federal investigations to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. Such an investigation of a U.S. person may not be conducted solely on the basis of activities protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.", "In addition, FISA provides statutory authority for the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or his designee to seek a U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) order authorizing the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. Again, such an investigation of a U.S. person may not conducted solely on the basis of First Amendment-protected activities. A production order for tangible things may be accompanied by a nondisclosure order. Under Section 501(d) of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861(d), no person shall disclose to any other person that the FBI has sought or obtained tangible things pursuant to an order under this section, other than to those persons to whom disclosure is necessary to comply with such order, an attorney to obtain legal advice or assistance with respect to the production of things in response to the order, or other persons as permitted by the Director of the FBI or the designee of the Director. A person to whom a disclosure is made is also subject to the nondisclosure requirements. Any person making or intending to make a disclosure to a person to whom disclosure is necessary to comply with the order or to whom disclosure is permitted by the Director of the FBI or his designee must, at the request of the Director or his designee, identify the person to whom disclosure is to be or has been made.", "With limited exceptions, electronic surveillance and physical searches may be conducted under FISA pursuant to court orders issued by a judge of the FISC, and pen registers and trap and trace devices may be installed and used pursuant to the order of a FISC judge or a U.S. Magistrate Judge authorized to act in that judge's behalf. In all instances in which the production of any tangible thing is required under FISA, an order from a FISC judge or a U.S. Magistrate Judge authorized to act in the judge's behalf must be obtained. Appeals from the denial of applications for FISC orders approving electronic surveillance, physical search, or production of tangible things may be made by the U.S. government to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Court of Review (Court of Review).
