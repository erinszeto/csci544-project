Its mission is to enhance the well-being of children by helping custodial parents and children obtain financial support from the noncustodial parents. Although states were always required to provide CSE services to members of Indian tribes and tribal organizations who were part of their CSE caseloads, tribes were not specifically included in the CSE statute until the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). The 1996 law allowed any state that has Indian country within its borders to enter into a cooperative agreement with an Indian tribe if the tribe demonstrated that it had an established tribal court system with the authority to establish paternity, and establish, modify, and enforce child support orders. In addition, P.L. 104-193 gave the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the authority to make direct payments to Indian tribes that have approved CSE programs.", "There are currently 61 tribal CSE programs, 57 comprehensive tribal CSE programs and 4 start-up tribal CSE programs (as of April 2016). In contrast to the federal matching rate of 66% for CSE programs run by the states or territories, the tribal CSE program provides direct federal funding equal to 100% of approved and allowable CSE expenditures during the start-up period, provides 90% federal funding for approved CSE programs operated by tribes or tribal organizations during the first three years of full program operation, and provides 80% federal funding thereafter. In FY2014, the 57 tribes or tribal organizations with comprehensive tribal CSE programs had an aggregate of 50,892 cases and collected over $36 million in total child support collections.", "Tribal CSE program services include parent location, paternity establishment, establishment of child support orders, review and modification of child support orders, enforcement/collection of child support payments, and distribution of child support. Indian tribes and tribal organizations that choose to operate a tribal CSE program must run programs that conform to the objectives of the state CSE program and that are in compliance with the tribal CSE program regulations. However, federal regulations provide some flexibility that allows tribes and tribal organizations to develop and administer tribal CSE programs that are consistent with the tribe's law and tradition.", "In 2010, about 52% of the nearly 1 million American Indian and Alaska Native children were living with only one of their parents.

All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands operate Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs. Historically, states were required to provide CSE services to members of Indian tribes and tribal organizations who were part of their CSE caseloads. Although tribes were not specifically included in the CSE statute until the 1996 welfare reform law, several tribes had negotiated agreements (e.g., informal, cooperative, intergovernmental, and joint powers) with some states in a mutual effort to serve Native American children. The 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ) allowed direct federal funding of approved tribal CSE programs.", "As of April 20, 2016, there were 61 tribal CSE programs.

As of March 2016, there are 566 federally recognized Indian tribes. Although tribal CSE programs do not have to have a court system per se, they are required to have either a judicial or administrative system to hear, establish, and enforce child support orders. Moreover, tribal CSE programs are required to ensure that the due process rights of participants are protected. According to the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), it may be necessary to make adjustments to an existing court system or to develop an administrative process under a start-up tribal CSE program. However, according to OCSE, when a tribe applies for funding to operate a comprehensive tribal CSE program, it must demonstrate that the judicial or administrative process is sufficient to establish and enforce child support orders. Thus, the universe of tribes that are potentially eligible to operate a tribal CSE program may not be as high as 566 because the tribe must have a court system (which about 298 tribes have) or an administrative system. The number of potentially eligible tribes is further reduced because tribes must have at least 100 children under their jurisdiction, and many tribes do not meet this requirement.", "Because sufficient demographic and social statistics on Indian tribal members are not collected by federal or other entities, it is difficult to estimate how many children under tribal jurisdiction are not covered by tribal CSE programs. Most estimates are derived from Census counts, which are based on race, not tribal membership. (See the discussion under \" Data \" below.) One estimate based on American Community Survey (ACS) racial data found that, in 2014, about 53% of the 631,831 American Indian and Alaska Native children (i.e., roughly 335,000 children) were living with only one of their parents. In 2014, about 66% of American Indian and Alaska Native children were born to unmarried women (again, according to race).", "This report provides a brief legislative history of CSE provisions related to tribes, presents basic information on tribal CSE programs, describes the information that tribal CSE programs must contain in order to be approved for federal funding, displays data on current tribal CSE programs, and discusses issues related to ensuring that Native American children receive the child support to which they are entitled.

The mission of the CSE program has shifted and expanded over the years. It has evolved from being a program primarily focused on welfare cost recovery to a program that focuses more on enhancing the well-being of children by obtaining child support from noncustodial parents and by emphasizing the personal responsibility of both parents to their children. Child support payments enable parents who do not live with their children to fulfill their financial responsibility to their children by contributing to the payment of childrearing costs.", "The CSE program currently provides seven major services on behalf of children: (1) parent location, (2) paternity establishment, (3) establishment of child support orders, (4) review and modification of child support orders, (5) enforcement/collection of child support payments, (6) distribution of child support payments, and (7) establishment and enforcement of medical support. The CSE program serves both families that receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits and those who do not. All 50 states and four jurisdictions (the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) operate CSE programs. In addition, 61 tribes or tribal organizations have CSE programs. The CSE program is administered by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), which is in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "In the early days of child support enforcement, states were required to cooperate in interstate CSE cases, but problems arose stemming from the autonomy of local courts. Family law traditionally had been under the jurisdiction of state and local governments, and citizens fell under the jurisdiction of the courts where they lived. Thus, when parents lived in different states, conflicts arose with regard to which state's rules applied to the case in question. During the 1930s and 1940s, domestic/family law under the jurisdiction of state and local courts was used to establish and enforce child support obligations when the noncustodial parent, custodial parent, and child lived in the same state. But when noncustodial parents lived out of state, enforcing child support was cumbersome and ineffective. Often, the only option in those cases was to extradite the noncustodial parent and, when successful, jail the person for nonpayment of child support. This procedure, which was rarely used, generally punished the delinquent noncustodial parent, but it left the abandoned family without financial support. Even up until the late 1990s, many commentators and CSE staff said that interstate cases were the most difficult child support orders to enforce. Others, however, noted that when a child support case involved a Native American child, the case moved to another level of complexity.", "Before enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ), the CSE statute placed the authority to administer the delivery of CSE services solely with the states. However, within much of Indian country, the authority of state and local governments was very limited or nonexistent. Thus, states were limited in their ability to provide CSE services on tribal lands and, vice versa, Indian families had difficulty obtaining CSE services from the state CSE programs. Pursuant to the Constitution, numerous court decisions, and federal law, Indian tribes have the authority to make and enforce laws, to adjudicate civil and criminal disputes (including domestic relations cases), to tax, and to license, regarding members and other Indians within their jurisdictions. State power is limited unless Congress has authorized it. Therefore, prior to the 1996 welfare reform legislation, states that attempted to provide CSE services on tribal lands were restricted in their authority to establish paternity and to establish and enforce child support orders. During the pre-1996 period, cooperative agreements between Indian tribes and states were the primary method by which Indian children (especially those living on reservations) received CSE services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CSE Provisions Related to Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations", "paragraphs": ["This section describes federal laws relating to child support that specifically mention Indian tribes and tribal organizations.", "In 1994, P.L. 103-383 (the Federal Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act) was enacted.

First, it allowed states to enter into cooperative agreements with Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and second, it authorized the HHS Secretary to provide direct federal funding to Indian tribes. The 1996 law allowed any state that has Indian country (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151) within its borders to enter into a cooperative agreement with an Indian tribe or tribal organization if the tribe demonstrated that it had an established tribal court system with the authority to establish paternity, and establish, modify, and enforce child support orders.

The 1997 act also clarified that direct federal funding could be given to an Indian tribe or tribal organization that demonstrates the capacity to operate a tribal CSE program that meets the objectives of the CSE program, \"including the establishment of paternity, establishment, modification, and enforcement of support orders, and location of absent parents.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Tribal CSE Programs", "paragraphs": ["Part of the mission of the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) is to provide direction, guidance, technical assistance, and oversight to state and tribal CSE program offices.

All Census Bureau data on American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN) are based on race, not tribal membership. The Census Bureau's decennial census and other surveys ask respondents to identify themselves by race, not by confirmed membership in a federally recognized tribe. Not all persons self-identifying as AIAN are members of federally recognized tribes, and it may be that not all tribal members identify themselves as AIAN on the Census form. The decennial census does collect information by Indian reservation or other Census-developed statistical area, for almost all federally recognized tribes, so it can report AIAN race data (even if it cannot report membership) for a tribe's reservation or other statistical area. These reservation-specific AIAN decennial data may serve as proxies for actual tribal data. However, Census Bureau data collected through non -decennial sample surveys, such as the American Community Survey (ACS) or the Current Population Survey (CPS), cannot yet be used for the great majority of Indian areas because the Indian areas' populations are too small.

The BIA report also lists tribal enrollment totals, as reported by the tribes, but the BIA does not conduct censuses to confirm these figures. The report does not provide tribal enrollees' geographic, demographic, or socioeconomic data, so it cannot show where enrollees are living or their age or other characteristics. (See Table C -1 in Appendix C for population figures from differing Census and BIA sources for CSE tribes and the nation.)", "Another problem is that the tribal CSE program data include missing data related to implementation issues.

This means that tribal CSE program data do not include state CSE data or information on cases connected with the other 505 federally recognized tribal governments.", " Table 2 presents a summary of tribal CSE program data for the seven-year period from FY2004 through FY2011 and for FY2014. The table only provides information on comprehensive tribal CSE programs. During the years FY2001-FY2006, there were nine comprehensive tribal CSE programs; in FY2007, there were 12 comprehensive tribal CSE programs; in FY2008, there were 25 comprehensive tribal CSE programs; in FY2009, there were 36 comprehensive tribal CSE programs; in FY2010, there were 38 comprehensive tribal CSE programs; in FY2011, there were 41 comprehensive tribal CSE programs; in FY2012, there were 45 comprehensive tribal CSE programs; in FY2013, there were 51 comprehensive tribal CSE programs; and in FY2014, there were 57 comprehensive tribal CSE programs (see Table B -1 ). Child support payments collected by tribes or tribal organizations increased from $14.5 million in FY2004 to $47.3 million in FY2014 (an increase of 196% between FY2004 and FY2014). The number of children whose paternity was established (or acknowledged) via the tribal CSE program increased by 150%, from 13,746 in FY2004 to 34,413 in FY2014. The number of child support orders/obligations established increased by 246%, from 9,767 in FY2004 to 33,834 in FY2014. Tribal CSE program expenditures also increased substantially, from $9.1 million in FY2004 to $41.7 million in FY2014 (a 357% increase). However, during that same period, the tribal CSE program caseload only increased 83%, from 27,750 cases in FY2004 to 50,892 cases in FY2014.", " Table 2 also shows that during the period FY2004-FY2014, the tribal CSE program increased the amount it collected on current child support obligations by about 136%, from $12.9 million in FY2004 to $30.4 million in FY2014. During that same period, the tribal CSE program substantially increased the amount it collected on past-due child support obligations by 606%, from $1.7 million to almost $12.3 million. Nonetheless, in FY2014, $268.5 million in child support obligations was owed to families receiving tribal CSE services, but only $42.7 million was paid. This means that in FY2014, the tribal CSE program only collected 16% of the child support obligations for which it had responsibility. If current child support collections are examined separately, Table 2 indicates that the tribal CSE program collected 48% of all current obligations in FY2014. If collections on past-due child support obligations (i.e., arrearages) are examined separately, Table 2 indicates that the tribal CSE program only collected 6% of child support arrearage payments in FY2014. The tribal CSE program closely parallels the state CSE program in its inability to collect a substantial portion of past-due child support obligations (i.e., child support arrearages). If child support is not paid in the month in which it is due it is considered past-due child support. Thus, the past-due child support shown in the table for FY2014 could be from FY2014 or any of the prior years. In other words, the past-due child support shown for FY2014 could have accrued in any of the years shown in the table or even in earlier years. This means that much of the child support arrearages that are currently part of the tribal CSE program could have been transferred from a state CSE program to the tribal CSE program. Indeed, Table 2 shows that in FY2004 (the first year in which comprehensive data are available) child support arrearages were already at nearly $50 million.", "The last row of Table 2 shows a measure of CSE program effectiveness, obtained by dividing total tribal CSE collections by total tribal CSE expenditures (costs). This measure is sometimes referred to as the collections-to-costs ratio. The table shows that in FY2014, $0.87 was collected from noncustodial parents for the financial support of their children for each dollar spent on tribal CSE programs. ", " Figure 2 shows the amount of child support collected by the tribal CSE program for the period FY2004-FY2011 and for FY2014. It also shows the amount of expenditures associated with the tribal CSE program. As mentioned earlier, one measure of a program's cost-effectiveness is often portrayed as the relationship of benefits to costs. As shown in Table 2 , in FY2004, the tribal CSE program collected $1.59 for each dollar that it spent. The collections-to-expenditures rate fluctuated throughout the 11-year period. In FY2014, it reached a low of $0.87. A reason for this might be that tribal CSE programs that are just getting underway are included in the data calculations. Another reason might be that the data may be inconsistent and/or unreliable across tribes.", "The data also show that expenditures per case in the tribal CSE program grew over the 11-year period FY2004-FY2014. Expenditures per case increased by 149% during that period, from $329 in FY2004 to nearly $820 in FY2014 (see Table 3 ). Collections per case also increased during the period, but not as much. Collections per case increased by 78%, from $522 in FY2004 to $929 in FY2014. As mentioned earlier, tribal CSE cases increased by 83% over the FY2004-FY2014 period. ", "Although the two measures, expenditures per case and collections per case (see Table 3 ), help illuminate the tribal CSE program, they are only averages and do not accurately reflect what individual families receive. As noted earlier, Census Bureau data pertaining to child support receipt do disaggregate by race, but AIAN are included in the \"other race\" category. OCSE data do not provide information on actual cases with collections for the tribal CSE program. Nevertheless, it is known that about $226 million of child support owed to tribal members went unpaid in FY2014, which is 84% of the amount of money that the tribes and tribal organizations were supposed to collect on behalf of Native American children.", " Table 4 and Table A -6 show that there were wide differences among the tribes in how much child support was collected for each dollar spent on the tribal CSE program, ranging from 0 (zero) cents in the Blackfeet Nation tribe to $2.37 in the Forest County Potawatomi tribe.", " Table 4 presents tribal CSE program data by tribe (for the 57 comprehensive tribal CSE programs) for FY2014. It shows tribal CSE collections (distributed), expenditures, and caseload data. It also displays the number of paternities and child support orders established by the tribe or tribal organization, and the collections-to-expenditures ratio for each tribe or tribal organization. The table indicates that the Navajo Nation ranked highest in five of the six categories shown. The Navajo Nation collected the most child support payments, had the highest child support expenditures, had the largest child support caseload, and established the most paternities and child support orders. The Navajo Nation was one of the first tribes to receive direct federal CSE funding. It has had a comprehensive CSE program since FY2002. The Forest County Potawatomi tribe had the best collections-to-expenditures ratio in FY2014, about two times higher than the average ($0.87) for all tribes. The Forest County Potawatomi tribe has had a comprehensive CSE program since FY2003 (one year after the Navajo Nation). See Tables A-1 through A-6 in Appendix A for a ranking of the tribes and tribal organizations with respect to each of the six program/performance indicators. The Navajo Nation is the largest Indian tribe in the United States, with about 14% of the U.S. tribal enrollment. Although the Navajo Nation is not among the wealthiest tribes per capita, it appears to have a very effective CSE administrative structure. In contrast, the Forest County Potawatomi tribe is a much smaller tribe but appears to be relatively wealthy and seems also to have an effective CSE administration. (See Table C -1 for enrollment and population data on these tribes.)", "It should be noted that during the formative years of any program, the meaning of program indicators may not be clear-cut. For example, with respect to tribal CSE programs, a large caseload may mean that the program is doing an excellent job of informing potential recipients of the program, or it may mean that there are reasons external to the program that are contributing to the high number of cases, such as high divorce rates, high rates of single-parent families, high rates of nonmarital childbearing, or high rates of nonpayment of child support. Similarly, high expenditures may mean that the program is providing a range of services to ensure child support collections, or that it has increased program staff to facilitate outreach and program administration, or that the families it is servicing require a lot of assistance (e.g., location services, paternity establishment, order establishment). Thus, although the tables are provided to shed some light on how individual tribal CSE programs are doing, it is probably unwise to draw conclusions from the data or make broad generalizations about tribal CSE programs. The effectiveness of tribal CSE programs may prove to be even more difficult to determine and evaluate than state CSE programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues", "paragraphs": ["Nearly eight years after tribes officially became part of the CSE program with the enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law, final regulations were established to implement direct funding to Indian tribes and tribal organizations for tribal CSE programs.

This includes taking all applications, opening a case for each, determining what services are needed and may be provided by the tribal CSE agency, and providing all of those services required by tribal CSE regulations. The tribe must provide, at a minimum, basic assistance, such as location, preparation of documents for intergovernmental processing, and case monitoring and distribution of collections forwarded from another jurisdiction. There may be circumstances where the tribal agency's only appropriate service will be to request assistance from another tribal or state CSE program with the legal authority to take actions on the case. In these and other such instances, states and tribes must work together to ensure that families receive the child support that they deserve.", "Although tribes and tribal organizations can now operate CSE programs, many problems have yet to be resolved. Even though there are rules related to whether a state or a tribe has jurisdiction over certain cases, in some instances there is concurrent jurisdiction and in some instances the complexity of the case blurs jurisdictional lines. Although federal regulations clarify that establishment of paternity under tribal CSE programs does not infer tribal enrollment or membership, paternity is inextricably linked to tribal membership. Many tribes view tribal membership as a political and cultural issue and thereby do not want to rely on scientific technology to confer tribal membership. A major difference between state CSE programs and tribal CSE programs is that tribal CSE programs can authorize the use of noncash payments to satisfy child support orders. Some observers are concerned that requiring the tribe to place a dollar value on each type of noncash payment may prove to be administratively cumbersome and costly. They argue that it is hard to predict and include a dollar amount for all of the kinds of noncash payments that members of the tribe may want to use to satisfy their child support obligations.", "Some child advocates are concerned that children who receive tribal CSE services may be less likely to receive the child support to which they are entitled than their counterparts who receive state CSE services, because tribal CSE programs do not have access to the vast array of state collection methods. Although nonpayment of child support is likely to be a perennial issue, especially for low-income noncustodial parents, some observers assert that tribal CSE programs that determine realistic and appropriate child support orders from the outset may improve the long-term success of their programs. In addition, some observers are concerned that unequal resources may result in children within a tribes' jurisdiction not getting the child support they are due, while others contend that the individualized approach used by tribes may counterbalance reduced and/or inadequate resources.

Whether a tribal court or state court has jurisdiction may be crucial in paternity cases and in child support matters. Most states do not have criminal or civil jurisdiction over Indian tribal members on their reservations. P.L. 83-280 (usually referred to as Public Law 280), however, was enacted in 1953 and the affected states received criminal and civil jurisdiction over Indians on some or all reservations within their boundaries. There are six mandatory Public Law 280 states (California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Alaska), where Public Law 280 required state jurisdiction (with some exceptions); and there are 10 optional Public Law 280 states (Nevada, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Washington, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, and Utah), which chose to acquire various jurisdictional powers under Public Law 280's authorization. Public Law 280 provides that a state can exert jurisdiction over individual tribal members. This jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the tribe. In general, a state with complete Public Law 280 civil jurisdiction has jurisdiction over domestic relations actions, to which Indians are parties, and which arise in Indian country. In the absence of Public Law 280 jurisdiction, if both parents are enrolled members of the same tribe and live in Indian country, it is generally held that the tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction.", "Although tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction (in the absence of Public Law 280) over parentage and child support matters where both parents are from the same tribe and reside on the tribe's reservation, there are many circumstances in which that is not the case. The following is a list of several examples that would raise the issue of tribal court versus state court jurisdiction: (1) Indian mother and non-Indian father, (2) non-Indian mother and Indian father, (3) Indian mother who is a member of the tribe and an Indian father who is not a member of the tribe, or (4) Indian mother who is not a member of the tribe and an Indian father who is a member of the tribe.", "Concurrent jurisdiction does not necessary resolve conflict. For example, if there is concurrent jurisdiction under Public Law 280, such as a case in which one party is a tribal member who resides on the reservation and the other party, who may or may not be a tribal member, resides off the reservation, it is possible that a state and a tribe may have competing interests. For example, while the tribe has a significant interest in establishing paternity in such cases, there also could be state concerns, such as the application for public assistance or CSE services. Also, tribal courts might not use genetic testing for paternity establishment to the same extent as state courts. Tribal courts are also less likely to recognize presumptions of paternity, and they historically have given limited recognition to the marriage presumption. Balancing state interests and tribal interests is an important consideration in such cases.", "Native American children who receive TANF benefits are another example in which state court versus tribal court jurisdictional issues could arise. Some courts would characterize the state as a non-Indian party and analyze jurisdiction accordingly. Other courts could characterize the state as an Indian because it derives its interest in the child support actions from the Indian parent's assignment of child support rights.", "Even in mandatory Public Law 280 states, conflict over jurisdiction may occur.

If the tested man does not contain the genetic characteristics necessary to be the biological father of the child, he is excluded. If the DNA of the tested man does contain those genetic characteristics, then the man cannot be excluded and the probability that the tested man is the true biological father can be calculated.", "Many tribes and tribal organizations view paternity differently than states. Although federal regulations clarify that establishment of paternity under tribal CSE programs does not infer tribal enrollment or membership, paternity may be inextricably linked to tribal membership. Thus, even though DNA testing is commonly used by tribes to establish paternity, many tribes view tribal membership as a political and cultural issue and thereby do not want to rely solely on scientific technology to confer tribal membership.", "Others note that many people view paternity tests as an affront to their integrity and an indication of a lack of trust. This situation is exacerbated in the case of an older child. According to some focus group discussants, for many couples, once one of the partners or alleged partners indicates that a paternity test is needed, any future chance for cooperative parenting is greatly diminished because of lingering animosity over the father not stepping forward and meeting his financial responsibility or the mother not being honest about her fidelity or use of birth control. Although the discussants mentioned above were talking about problems with and ways to improve state CSE programs, it is not unrealistic to infer that clients of tribal CSE programs may hold similar negative views about the implications of paternity testing.", "Although tribes and tribal organizations must give full faith and credit to child support orders, they do not have to recognize stand-alone paternity orders. Some commentators contend that tribes and tribal organizations should not be given so much discretion with regard to establishing paternity. They maintain that the advances in science and technology make paternity establishment straightforward and relatively inexpensive and argue that a tribe's reluctance to use DNA testing stems from its disinclination to confer membership on more persons and belies a financial motivation in that some tribes might not want to share revenue from casinos, oil and water rights, etc., with more members.", "Moreover, some persons argue that DNA testing to establish paternity is different from DNA testing that tries to prove whether or not a person is a member of a tribe. They assert that DNA paternity testing is almost infallible (with probability of paternity values reaching as high as 99.999%). They also point out that federal regulations more than adequately protect the status of tribes by stipulating that establishment of paternity under tribal CSE programs does not infer tribal enrollment or membership.", "Federal CSE law requires that in the case of unmarried parents, the father's name shall not appear on the birth certificate unless he has signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity or a court has issued an adjudication of paternity; no such provision exists for tribal CSE programs. This means that in a case in which a tribe or tribal organization has jurisdiction, if a woman puts a man's name on the birth certificate of her child and he does not contest the paternity (perhaps because he does not know about it), the child could be deemed to be the child of the man whose name is on the birth certificate\u2014regardless of whether the name is on the birth certificate due to a paternity adjudication, a default paternity order, or a paternity acknowledgment, and regardless of whether the man is the child's biological father."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Child Support Enforcement Methods", "paragraphs": ["Federal regulations require that tribes include in their tribal CSE plans tribal law, code, or regulations that describe the types of collection/enforcement actions the tribe can use. The only collection/enforcement method mandated (by federal regulations) for tribes and tribal organizations is income withholding. For the states, income withholding is by far the most effective method of obtaining child support payments. According to OCSE data, about 67% of child support collected through the state CSE agencies is collected via income withholding. However, if the noncustodial parent does not have a job or is self-employed, then income withholding is not applicable.", "Federal law requires that states enact state laws that authorize the use of the following collection/enforcement methods: income withholding; intercept of federal and state income tax refunds; intercept of unemployment compensation; liens against property; reporting child support obligations to credit bureaus; intercept of lottery winnings; sending insurance settlement information to CSE agencies; authority to withhold or suspend driver's licenses, professional licenses, and recreational and sporting licenses of persons who owe past-due child support; and authority to seize assets of debtor parents held by public or private retirement funds and financial institutions. Moreover, federal law authorizes the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports of debtor parents. All jurisdictions also have civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures and criminal nonsupport laws. In addition, federal criminal penalties may be imposed in certain cases. Federal law also provides for international enforcement of child support. Some tribes argue that allowing tribes to operate CSE programs but denying them access to the array of enforcement methods that are available to states results in inequities in service that adversely impact Native American children.", "Even though tribes do not have access to the vast array of child support enforcement/collection tools that are available to the states, many tribes have been successful in implementing new and innovative enforcement techniques, such as elders' panels, attachment of per capita payments, attachment of gaming winnings, and personal improvement mandates. (All enforcement techniques must first be approved by the tribe's governing body.)", "One of the child support collection methods that has been mentioned as a tool that would greatly benefit tribes is the federal income tax refund offset program. According to a representative of the National Tribal Child Support Association, many noncustodial parents of Native American children are reluctant to use their federal income tax refunds to pay past-due child support but do not mind if their refunds are withheld from them to pay past-due child support. Some noncustodial parents view the refund as extra money, and while they might not use it to pay child support on their own, they recognize as legitimate the reason for withholding it from them. Thus, some child advocates argue that the federal income tax refund offset is a very important enforcement tool that should be available to the tribes. Under current law, tribes do not have access to the federal income tax refund and because of jurisdictional boundaries, states cannot \"serve\" (i.e., deliver a legal summons) an individual in a child support case if that person is on Indian land. According to the National Tribal Child Support Association, several tribes are in the process of negotiating contracts for states to access the federal income tax refund offset on behalf of Indian children. In order for tribes to have direct access to the federal income tax refund offset, Congress would have to pass legislation that specifically provided access to tribes and tribal organizations.", "Tribes do not have access to most of the state child support collection tools, but tribes, unlike states, have the authority to allow noncustodial parents to use in-kind payments instead of cash to satisfy child support debt. Many tribal CSE administrators view this as a great advantage, especially because many of the noncustodial parents associated with their caseloads are individuals with low-income and/or barriers to employment. The use of in-kind payments allows noncustodial parents of Indian children to reduce or eliminate their monthly child support obligation by providing a service to the custodial parent. Federal regulations require that child support orders clearly include a specific dollar amount reflecting the child support obligation. For example, a tribal CSE order could provide that a noncustodial parent owes $200 a month in current support, which may be satisfied with the provision of firewood suitable for home heating to the custodial parent and child. The child support order could provide that a cord of firewood has a specific dollar value of $100 based on the prevailing market. Therefore, the noncustodial parent would satisfy his or her child support obligation by providing two cords of firewood every month. The valuation of noncash resources is the responsibility of the tribe. Other examples of in-kind payments include food such as salmon and buffalo, and ceremonial regalia.", "Some tribal CSE administrators view in-kind payments as an effective and innovative enforcement strategy that encourages responsible parenting (by allowing noncustodial parents with little income to provide for their children with noncash payments/services). Nonetheless, there is also the concern that requiring a tribe to place a dollar value on each type of noncash payment may prove administratively cumbersome and costly. Some observers argue that it is hard to predict and include in a tribal CSE plan all of the kinds of noncash payments that tribal members may want to use to satisfy their child support obligations. Others insist that one of the major roadblocks for tribal CSE programs is the lack of access to state locate resources and state enforcement tools. However, pursuant to P.L. 113-183 , the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014 (enacted September 29, 2014), tribes and tribal organizations are now considered \"authorized persons\" and thereby have direct access to the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS). Such access is expected to help increase the tribe's ability to locate noncustodial parents and their assets and resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonpayment Problems", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier, in FY2014 the tribal CSE program collected only 16% of the child support obligations for which it had responsibility (i.e., 48% of current child support obligations and 6% of child support arrearage payments). Nonpayment of child support is a major problem for both tribal and state CSE programs. Some commentators contend that certain CSE procedures such as the use of default judgments and unrealistically high child support orders are major contributors to the problem of nonpayment of child support.", "If a noncustodial parent gets a notice or a summons about child support or paternity establishment but does not appear in court at the stipulated date and time, the court can enter a child support order against the noncustodial parent by default. Although the majority of tribes with CSE programs do not acknowledge default judgments, some do. In cases where default judgments are recognized, if the noncustodial parent does not show up to tell his or her side of the story, the court can decide that the evidence against that person must be true. Thus, a \"no show\" by the noncustodial parent may result in the establishment of paternity and/or the establishment of a child support order, which will be effective whether or not the man in question is the actual father or whether or not the person in question has a job or a source of income. Some observers argue that the practice of using default judgments (i.e., judgments made in the absence of the alleged father), which is a practice of both tribal and state courts, has adversely affected many putative fathers who claim they are not the father of the child in question but, for whatever reason, did not show up in court to deny the allegations. Many analysts and observers maintain that the standards governing default judgments should balance the rights of the putative father to proper notice and the opportunity to be heard before paternity is established and a child support order is set against the right of the child to obtain a determination of paternity and support (on a timely basis) from a father who knowingly fails to appear in court.", "Although nonsupport can be partly attributed to the low incomes of many noncustodial parents, many commentators contend that unrealistically high child support orders and complicated time-consuming modification requirements exacerbate the problem. According to the American Community Survey (ACS) data for 2007-2011, 27.0% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, as identified by race, had incomes below the poverty level, more than twice the rate of their white counterparts. Setting child support orders at a level that exceeds a noncustodial parent's ability to pay may in some cases decrease the amount of child support received by the custodial parent because of the noncustodial parent's low income and/or because of the noncustodial parent's contention that the CSE system is unfair. In contrast, CSE policies, both tribal and state, that result in realistic child support orders, especially for persons at the lower end of the income scale, may result in more child support from low-income noncustodial parents. Some commentators contend that child support orders established by tribes are more realistic and fairer than those set by state guidelines. They argue that tribes are more aware of the circumstances of their people. There is agreement among policymakers and analysts that tribal CSE programs that establish realistic guidelines for child support orders, allow swift and in some cases automatic modification of child support orders, and provide effective means of cooperating and coordinating with states and other tribal CSE programs will probably avoid many of the mistakes of state CSE programs.", "Some noncustodial parents claim that the child support guidelines are inherently unfair because they do not account for \"affordability.\" They say that in many states and on many reservations, the basic living expenses of noncustodial parents, such as rent, food, and car payments, are often not considered a legitimate factor in determining the child support order. Many commentators agree that in many cases current levels of child support exceed what many middle and lower income noncustodial parents can afford to pay.", "According to information for the Puyallup Tribe, some tribes have significantly reduced child support debt that they claimed was inappropriately set by states or for which repayment would be impossible to achieve. However, other information indicates that some noncustodial parents who have appeared in tribal court to try to modify their child support order were told that the tribal court cannot modify their order because the custodial parent does not live on the reservation. They were told that the tribal court could not modify the underlying child support order, but it could make an \"ability to pay\" determination and thereby lower the amount to be paid to avoid a contempt of court ruling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consistency of Tribal CSE Programs to Each Other and to State CSE Programs", "paragraphs": ["While it is generally agreed that state and tribal CSE programs should move in the same direction, it is also acknowledged that tribes are a sovereign entity and thus should have the authority to develop their own policies to achieve CSE program directives. It is also recognized that tribes are at the early stage of CSE program development and therefore need flexibility (as long as they remain within the parameters established in the law) to adjust their programs so as to better serve their clientele.", "Although tribes have historically had some things in common, like their \"boarding school\" experience and how they viewed nature and shared a holistic philosophy based on the premise of the \"circle of life,\" they are also very diverse. In most tribes, the father is highly respected but his role as a caregiver varies. In some tribes, the role of the father, like the mother, is to provide affection and support to his children while the uncles (and aunts) provide supervision and discipline. In other tribes, the father is very instrumental in assuring the cultural survival of the tribe, so he may have a very close relationship to his male children so that they will model his behavior and be prepared for leadership roles in the tribe. In other tribes, it is the grandparents who instill in the children the cultural mores of the tribe. In many cases, the father's role in a particular tribe will have an impact on how other tribe members, including mothers, view paternity establishment and child support. In some tribes, establishing paternity and child support orders may be viewed as reducing the harmony and unity of the tribe. In some tribes, child support enforcement techniques such as suspending various types of licenses of noncustodial parents who owe past-due child support may be viewed as harming fathers rather than helping children. Some observers contend that the potential variation among tribal CSE programs may adversely affect some Native American children. They maintain that finding the correct balance between historical tribal practices and the present-day needs of children is a crucial part of developing and operating a tribal CSE program that will ultimately be successful in providing Native American children with the child support to which they are entitled.", "As indicated above, tribal CSE programs vary. Below is a summary of some of their differences, as identified in a document prepared by the National Tribal Child Support Association.", "Some tribes have adopted their own codes/laws but have incorporated their state's child support statutes by reference, while other tribes have written their own codes/laws, procedures, and policies to govern their child support program. Most tribes have a court order process, some have CFR courts and some have tribal courts. The Navajo Nation has an administrative process. Some tribal CSE programs use the automated/computer systems of their corresponding state while others are not yet computerized and operate using manual systems. A few tribes have agreements with their individual states or counties for personal services on their reservation, although most do not. Administrative hearings may or may not be provided within the tribal programs. Some tribes will accept default orders (court or administrative), most will not. Some tribes will require paternity testing based on their tribal codes/laws if the original order does not meet certain criteria.", "As seen earlier in Table 4 , there are big differences between tribal CSE programs in terms of caseloads, collections, and expenditures. The Navajo Nation is one of the tribes that is credited with operating an effective CSE program. The Navajo Nation has a collaborative relationship with Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico (the three states in which a majority of its members reside). The New Mexico Child Support Enforcement Division has had a formal cooperative agreement with the Navajo Nation since July 1, 1997.", "The JPA [Joint Powers Agreement] between the State and the Navajo Nation provides the Navajo Nation with the ability to access the CSED's information system called the Child Support Enforcement System (CSES). The CSES information system is connected through the National New Hire Directory (NNHD), the Child Support Enforcement Network (CSENet) and the Electronic Parent Locator Network (EPLN) through the \"Federal Case Registry\" to the case registries of the 54 other states and territories, and 10 foreign nations. These connections are used for \"locating\" persons who owe child support and automatically \"intercepting\" their wage withholdings and other financial assets, and distributing it to the children and their custodial parents who are owed that child support. The CSES system cost the State of New Mexico $30 million in development costs over several years. ... In order to accomplish the child support casework on Navajo Nation lands, two new regions (known as Region 8 and Region 9) were created within both the physical structure of the CSED and within the CSES system. In Region 8 and 9, employees of the Navajo Nation perform all aspects of child support enforcement. Cases are transferred in or out of Regions 8 and 9 as needed. This lends itself to cleaner casework that is done at a site closer to the custodial parent.", "Cooperative agreements are viewed as a productive way to enable states and tribes to better provide child support services to Indian children and to establish and enforce child support obligations and judgments. Cooperative agreements are a tool that allows states and tribes to work together as partners to provide culturally relevant CSE services, consistent with state and federal laws, that are based on tribal laws and customs. Under most cooperative agreements, cases in which all or some of the parties involved are tribe members living on the tribal reservation are referred by the state to the tribe to be processed in the tribal court.", "An integral part of state CSE programs is the incentive payment system. The incentive payment system is part of the CSE program's strategic plan that rewards states for working to achieve the goals and objectives of the program. Incentive payments, although small when compared to federal reimbursement payments for state and local CSE activities, are a very important component of the CSE financing structure. Together with the incentive payment system is a penalty system that imposes financial penalties on states that fail to meet certain performance levels. The purpose of the two complementary systems is to reward states for results while holding them accountable for poor performance, thereby motivating states to focus their efforts on providing vital CSE services. Although tribal CSE programs do not have an incentive payment component, in an effort to monitor the effectiveness of tribal CSE programs, federal regulations require a tribe to submit tribally determined performance targets for paternity establishment, child support order establishment, the amount of current child support collected, the amount of past-due child support to be collected and any other performance measures a tribe may want to submit. Tribes determine their own performance targets for each required measure and report the level of performance. Some analysts surmise that these self-ascribed performance targets might be intentionally low and that such a system provides little incentive for a tribe to operate more efficiently or effectively, especially given that the federal government pays for at least 80% of the tribe's CSE program costs regardless of the effectiveness of the program. Others note that tribal CSE programs are much smaller than state CSE programs and that tribal CSE programs generally view their clients as part of their extended family/community and thus may be more internally motivated to operate effective programs. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The precept \"it takes a village to raise a child\" could have had its foundation in Indian culture. For many years, the majority of Indian families maintained extended family relationships, usually living in groups that included the nuclear family plus grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, nephew, nieces, and other related individuals. Children were raised within this extended family network, which was responsible for their care, education, social well-being, cultural history, and traditions. This situation does not exist nearly as much today; Native American families, like those in many other population groups, have drifted apart over the past decades.", "Just as in the early years of the state CSE system when some noncustodial fathers moved from job to job or left the state where their children resided to avoid paying child support, it is surmised that some Native American noncustodial parents are residing on reservations to avoid paying child support. The principles of jurisdictional sovereignty, self-government, self-determination, and the government-to-government relationship that exists between tribes and the federal government were primary reasons why Congress provided direct federal funding of tribal CSE programs. It was meant to enhance tribal self-determination and to support Indian tribes and tribal organizations in their efforts to develop and implement their own programs to meet their particular and individual needs. Indian tribes were given the flexibility to design CSE programs that would meet the often complex and unique traditions and needs of Native American people.", "Nonetheless, new programs take time to mature. The state CSE program is now 41 years old, but during its early years, it faced many problems related to implementation, consistency of data, reporting of data, nonpayment of support, establishment of paternity, establishment of child support orders, distribution of support, and an antagonistic relationship with noncustodial parents. Many tribal CSE programs may also face these same problems, as well as problems related to the placement of the tribal CSE program within tribal government, reasonable salaries for workers, staffing, confidentiality of data, distribution of required notices, lack of reciprocity in enforcement, service of process, and poor communication.", "Perhaps the most important measure of the federal-state CSE program is its impact on overall national rates of paying child support. Both Congress and the American public view the CSE program as a means of improving the nation's system of ensuring that all parents who no longer live with their children continue to provide for their financial support. Although child support alone is generally not enough to raise family income above the poverty level, poor families who received child support but remained in poverty had their standard of living improved by the child support payments. Similarly, incomes and standards of living were improved by child support payments of non-poor families as well. On average, child support constitutes 14% of family income for households who receive it. Among poor households that receive it, child support constitutes about 49% of family income.", "Although the consistent and ongoing financial support of children by noncustodial parents is the main purpose of the CSE program, the program provides many other benefits to children. One such benefit, for many children, is the establishment of paternity. Social science research generally indicates that in most cases the social, psychological, emotional, and financial benefits of having one's father legally identified are irrefutable. The research also overwhelmingly indicates that both parents are critical in building the self-esteem of their children and helping the children become self-sufficient, responsible members of society. Some commentators contend that except for their role as payers of child support, fathers generally have been given short shrift by federal, state, and local social welfare programs. They assert that tribal CSE programs are in the position of being able to recognize, right from the start, the importance of fathers (who are usually the noncustodial parent) in the lives of their children and to participate in cooperative, respectful communication with fathers. It is generally agreed that an amenable relationship (as opposed to an antagonistic relationship) between noncustodial parents and the CSE agency is more likely to result in more noncustodial parents paying their child support obligations. Some observers also encourage tribal CSE programs to coordinate with state programs such as CSE access and visitation programs, healthy marriage promotion programs, and responsible fatherhood programs to further foster productive relationships with fathers, with the ultimate goal of obtaining the child support to which Indian children are entitled.", "It has been noted that there are 566 federally recognized tribal governments, but only 61 tribal CSE programs. Figures in Appendix C suggest that the 61 tribal CSE programs cover about 30%-49% of the total population of tribal members (as variously estimated). Some observers contend it is likely that gaps in the provision of CSE services to Native American children will remain a significant problem for many more years. They question whether the needs of the universe of Native American children can be met through the current configuration of tribal CSE programs. Others assert that tribal CSE programs are still in their early stages, that it is too soon to judge their effectiveness, and that the eventual universe of tribal CSE programs is not yet knowable.

A simple ranking of the tribal programs does not indicate a program's effectiveness. For example, one would expect programs with larger caseloads to have more child support collections (than other programs, all things being equal). Similarly, one would expect programs with larger caseloads to have higher program expenditures (than other programs, all things being equal). However, it may be less apparent that programs with smaller caseloads could have higher collections based on a tribe's access to casino profits and/or valuable mineral rights. Also, programs with smaller caseloads may have high program expenditures because a higher proportion of tribal members need paternity establishment services. Thus, broad generalizations about the data shown in the tables may prove to be inaccurate.", " Table A -1 shows the amount of child support collected by each tribe.
