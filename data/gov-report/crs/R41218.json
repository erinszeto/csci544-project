In particular, the law on political parties was widely denounced for placing unreasonable restrictions on the participation of many opposition political leaders and Burma's Buddhist monks and nuns. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Philip J.

The policy keeps most of the elements of the Burma policies of the last two administrations in place, but adds a willingness to engage in direct dialogue with the SPDC on how to promote democracy and human rights in Burma, and greater cooperation on international security issues, such as counternarcotics efforts and nuclear nonproliferation. The Obama Administration accepts that little progress has been made during the seven months that the new policy has been in effect, but has indicated that it will remain in place for now.", "There are signs of concern among Members of Congress about the dearth of progress in Burma towards democracy and greater respect for human rights. Nine Senators sent a letter to President Obama on March 26, 2010, urging the imposition of additional economic sanctions on the SPDC in light of \"a set of profoundly troubling election laws.\" However, another Senator perceives \"several substantive gestures\" on the part of the SPDC, and suggests it is time to increase engagement with the Burmese government.", "The 111th Congress has already taken action with respect to Burma, such as renewing the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. If it were to determine that additional actions should be taken, there are several alternatives available.

In September 2009, the U.S. State Department announced a new policy towards Burma that continued the existing political and economic sanctions but added a willingness to engage in high-level discussions with representatives of the SPDC. Previous U.S. administrations had generally refused to participate in high-level discussions with the SPDC.", "Burma's two most recent experiences with nationwide plebiscites do not augur well for the democratization of Burma.

Britain's Prime Minister [author name scrubbed] said of the election laws, \"Sadly, the Burmese regime has squandered the opportunity for national reconciliation.\" Australia's Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told reporters, \"I don't believe that any election without the National League for Democracy can be a full, free and fair election.\" The Philippines' Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo stated that the actions of the SPDC were \"contrary to the roadmap to democracy that they have pledged to ASEAN and to the world.\" Japan's Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada has indicated that Japan may cancel its plan to expand economic aid to Burma unless Aung San Suu Kyi and other opposition figures are permitted to participate in the 2010 elections. ", "Some nations have been more restrained in their comments about Burma's election laws. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa traveled to Burma in late March to discuss the 2010 elections with Burma's Foreign Minister Nyan Win. Following their meetings, Natalegawa stated \"We are trying very hard to ascertain as to what extent this sets [sic] of laws are consistent or inadvertently impede the holding of a multi-party election, an inclusive one and the likes.\" Singapore's Foreign Ministry issued a similar statement, expressing its hope that \"it is not too late for all parties to reach a compromise.\"", "On March 24, 2010, the U.N. Security Council held a closed-door meeting on the Burmese elections. It has been reported that Britain and China clashed over the appropriateness of the body to weigh in on the issue. The following day, the informal Group of Friends of Burma met and agreed that Burma's military junta should release all political prisoners (including Aung San Suu Kyi) and allow them to participate in the 2010 elections. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) released a statement following its April 9, 2010, leaders meeting, stating, \"We underscored the importance of national reconciliation in Myanmar and the holding of the general election in a free, fair, and inclusive manner, thus contributing to Myanmar's stability and development.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The SPDC's Response", "paragraphs": ["Burma's ruling military junta has used its state-run newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar , to rebut some of the criticisms leveled at its election laws, generally by pointing to similarities in other nation's election laws.

On the disenfranchisement of people serving prison terms, the article notes that in some countries, people are not allowed to vote for five or six years after their release from prison. It also recalls that Burma's 1947 constitution also had a provision prohibiting people from serving in the parliament for five years after their release from prison. As to members of religious orders, the SPDC has pointed out that past Burmese constitutions and election laws contained similar prohibitions on their participation in elections.

Nine Senators sent a letter to President Obama on March 26, 2010, urging the imposition of additional economic sanctions on the SPDC in light of the \"a set of profoundly troubling election laws.\" The letter specifically asks the President to fulfill four provisions of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-286 ): (1) the appointment of a special representative and policy coordinator for Burma; (2) the imposition of additional banking sanctions; (3) the submission by the Secretary of the Treasury to certain congressional committees of a report \"containing a list of all countries and foreign banking institutions that hold assets on behalf of senior Burmese officials\"; and (4) the submission by the Secretary of State to certain congressional committees of a report on countries, companies, and other entities that provide military or intelligence aid to the SPDC. Both of the reports mentioned in the letter were due no later than 180 days after the enactment of the law, and annually thereafter.", "Also, following the release of Burma's election laws, Senator Mitch McConnell issued a press release stating:", "The edict issued by Burma's State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) guarantees a profoundly undemocratic election by a profoundly undemocratic regime. If initial reports are accurate, it is no surprise that the law is a complete farce. By prohibiting Aung San Suu Kyi, political prisoners and Buddhist monks from participation, the junta makes clear that the only purpose of the upcoming election is simply to keep the SPDC in power.", "Congressional disappointment with recent SPDC actions is not limited to the election laws. For example, following the release of Kyaw Zaw Lwin, Senator John Kerry released the following statement: ", "Sadly, while he is coming home, Burma's junta continues to hold its grip on 2,200 political prisoners.... In concert with our friends and partners in East Asia and around the world, the United States must redouble its efforts to persuade the junta to open discussions with the opposition and ethnic groups, to conduct genuinely free and fair elections, and to honor the aspirations of the Burmese people for a peaceful transition to democratic rule.", "Some in Congress discern other points of progress in Burma over recent months. For example, Senator Jim Webb had a different interpretation of Kyaw Zaw Lwin's release and recent events in Burma, stating \"Since my visit to Burma last August, the military government has made several substantive gestures that should be appropriately considered by the U.S. Department of State as opportunities to increase our engagement with Burma.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Steps Taken", "paragraphs": ["The 111 th Congress has already taken steps to help achieve U.S. goals in Burma.

The House Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing on Burma on October 21, 2009; the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on Burma on September 30, 2009.

In addition to the four provisions mentioned in the Senators' March 2010 letter to President Obama, there are other provisions in the two laws that have not been fully implemented.

Some examples are a ban on the import of products containing timber or lumber from Burma; prohibiting \"United States persons\" from entering into economic-financial transactions, paying taxes, or performing \"any contract\" with Burmese government institutions or individuals under U.S. sanctions; requiring all U.S. entities to divest their investments and cease operations in Burma; and restricting the provision of transactional services to foreign financial institutions that hold assets on behalf of senior Burmese officials.", "A fourth possible course of action, if the 111 th Congress determines that decreasing pressure on the SPDC is warranted, would be to remove or reduce some of the existing sanctions on Burma.
