The Mann Act outlaws sex trafficking activities that involve travel in interstate or foreign commerce.

Section 2422 condemns coercing or enticing another person to travel in interstate or foreign commerce to engage in prostitution or unlawful sexual activity, or using interstate communications to coerce or entice a child to engage in such conduct. The communications offense is punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 years; the travel offense by imprisonment for not more than 20 years. Section 2423 outlaws four distinct offenses: (1) \u00a72423(a)\u2014transportation of a child in interstate or foreign commerce for purposes of prostitution or unlawful sexual purposes; (2) \u00a72423(b)\u2014interstate or foreign travel for purposes of unlawful sexual abuse of a child; (3) \u00a72423(c)\u2014foreign travel and subsequent unlawful sexual abuse of a child; and (4) \u00a72423(d)\u2014arranging, for profit, the travel outlawed in any of these offenses.

In addition, offenders are subject to a term of supervised release of not less than five years. An offender may also be subject to a restitution order. Moreover, property derived from a violation or used to facilitate a violation may be forfeited. Finally, unless they are indigent, offenders are subject to a $5,000 special assessment upon conviction.", "The courts have construed the offense's elements as follows:", "Whoever : When used in an act of Congress and unless the context demands another interpretation, the word \"'whoever' include[s] corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.\" Thus, corporations and other legal entities may be held criminally liable for the misconduct of their employees, officers, or agents within the scope of their authority and committed at least in part for the benefit of the entity. ", "Knowing ly : Knowingly ordinarily means that the individual was aware of the fact that he was engaging in the conduct proscribed. In this case, it means that he knew he was recruiting, enticing, harboring, transporting, providing, obtaining, or maintaining a person. The prosecution, however, need not prove that he knew his conduct occurred in United States territory or that it occurred in, or affected, interstate or foreign commerce.", "In or affecting interstate or foreign commerce : Congress enjoys only those legislative powers that may be traced to the Constitution. One such power is the power \"to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.\" The Supreme Court has explained that Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause embodies \"the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,\" including \"purely local activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\" Various appellate courts have explained that the \"substantial effect\" test judges the impact of a category of regulated activity, for example, sex trafficking. Individual instances need have no more than a de minimis impact on interstate commerce. The government has shown that the defendant's commercial sex trafficking had such an effect on interstate commerce when the defendant used the facilities of an interstate hotel chain, or when he used advertising that reached across state lines, or when he used products that had traveled in interstate commerce or the instrumentalities of interstate communications, for example, cell phones. ", "Within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States : The Constitution also vests Congress with the power to \"define and punish ... Felonies committed on the high Seas,\" and to exercise legislative jurisdiction retained or acquired over federal territories and enclaves. Congress has exercised this authority to claim federal criminal jurisdiction over sex trafficking and other crimes when committed on American vessels, within national parks or national forests, and other places \"within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\" ", "Recruits , ... obtains , advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits : Prior to enactment of the Victims Justice Act in 2015, each of the verbs in \u00a71591(a)(1)'s action element\u2014recruits, entices, harbors, transports, supplies, obtains, maintains\u2014seemed to refer to activities on the supply side of a prostitution operation. At least one federal appellate court held, however, that the verbs applied to the demand side as well. That is, the section applied to the customers, the Johns, of a prostitution operation. The Victims Justice Act confirmed the court's understanding by adding \"patroniz[ing]\" and \"solicit[ing]\" as alternatives in the section's action element. At the same time, it inserted \"advertis[ing]\" as another potential action element. ", "A person : Its sweeping terms notwithstanding, it appears unlikely that the courts will always read \u00a71591 literally. For example, on its face, the section appears to criminalize minors who engage in \"survival sex.\" Runaway juveniles who use sex to secure food, shelter, or the other necessities of life could be said to have \"maintained ... a person,\" themselves, knowing they have \"not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act.\" No prosecutor is likely to bring, no jury is likely to convict, and no judge is likely to sustain, such a case. ", "Knowing or i n reckless disregard of the fact : This element of the offense requires proof that the defendant knew, or recklessly disregarded, either (A) the fact that an (i) underage child (ii) would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act or (B) the fact that an adult victim (i) had been threatened, deceived, or coerced (ii) in order to cause the victim to engage in a commercial sex act. Subsection 1591(c), however, mitigates the government's burden with respect to knowledge of the age of a child victim: \"In a prosecution under subsection (a)(1) in which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the person so recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained or maintained, the Government need not prove that the defendant knew that the person had not attained the age of 18 years.\"", "Otherwise, the prosecution must prove that the defendant knew, or recklessly disregarded, the fact that the victim would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, and in the case of an adult victim, that \"force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion\" had been used to cause the victim to engage in such an act. As a practical matter, the distinction between knowledge and reckless disregard of the facts may be more technical than real. One speaks of efforts to avoid discovery of a fact and the other to indifference as to the existence of a fact. In most instances, evidence of one will implicate the other. ", "More specifically, in a criminal context, a defendant who claims a lack of guilty knowledge may be convicted when the evidence presented to the jury supports an inference that his ignorance was deliberate, a matter of conscious avoidance or willful blindness. In a civil context, \"[r]eckless disregard ... is an extreme version of ordinary negligence;\" it encompasses those instances of gross negligence where the defendant fails to seek out the facts that would be reasonable and prudent under the circumstances. Similarly, in a criminal context, \"[t]o act with 'regardless disregard' means to be aware of, but consciously and carelessly ignore, [clearly guilty] facts and circumstances.\"", "Means of force ... coercion : Section 1591 expands the reach that the words \"force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion\" might ordinarily convey, with a definition of \"coercion\" that envelops threats of physical harm, abuse of legal process, as well as \"psychological, financial, or reputational harm.\"", "Will be c ause d : The courts have concluded that the \"will be caused\" element of the offense indicates that the Congress intended the section to apply regardless of whether any commercial sex act ever occurs and regardless of whether the victim previously engaged in commercial sex acts unrelated to the defendant's involvement. ", "Commercial sex act : Section 1591(e)(3) defines the \"commercial\" component of the commercial sex act element as \"any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.\" The terms \"thing of value\" or \"anything of value\" appear with some regularity in federal criminal law, and are often understood to include both tangible and intangible remuneration.", "Section 1591, however, supplies no corresponding definition of \"sex act.\" The phrase is not a term of art. The provisions that outlaw other sex offenses in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States define the term \"sexual act\" and the less severely punished \"sexual contact.\" Given the breadth of \u00a71591 in other areas, it may be that Congress anticipated the section would apply to both commercial sexual acts and commercial sexual contact as understood in those provisions.

In some instances, the courts have used a modest standard: \"All that is necessary is to show some affirmative participation which at least encourages the principal offender to commit the offense.\" Occasionally, they assert a more exacting standard: \"[T]he elements necessary for an aiding and abetting conviction are: (1) that the accused had the specific intent to facilitate the commission of a crime by another, (2) that the accused had the requisite intent of the underlying substantive offense, (3) that the accused assisted or participated in the commission of the underlying substantive offense, and (4) that someone committed the underlying substantive offense.\"", "Courts agree, however, that unlike conspiracy, there can be no liability as an aider and abettor until after someone else has the commit the underlying crime."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extraterritorial Application", "paragraphs": ["Federal law is presumed to apply only within this country.
