The CFTC administers the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA; P.L. 74-765, 7 U.S.C. \u00a71 et seq) enacted in 1936 to monitor trading in certain derivatives markets. The CEA contains a sunset provision, meaning Congress periodically reauthorizes appropriations to carry out the CEA. If an explicit authorization of appropriations for a program or activity is present\u2014as in the CEA\u2014and it expires, the underlying authority in the statute to administer such a program does not, however. Thus, the CFTC continues functioning and administering the CEA even if its authorization has expired\u2014which has been the case since the last CFTC reauthorization expired on September 30, 2013. It has not been uncommon for Congress to pass CFTC reauthorization bills several years after the prior authorization had expired.", "The current CFTC reauthorization process is the first since the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank; P.L. 111-203) brought the roughly $400 trillion U.S. swaps market under regulatory oversight. Historically, the reauthorization process has often been one of the principal vehicles for modifying the CFTC's regulatory authority and evaluating the efficacy of its regulatory programs. The House passed a CFTC reauthorization bill, H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, on June 9, 2015, by a 246 to 171 vote. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry marked up and ordered to be reported an identically titled bill, S. 2917, which would also reauthorize such appropriations, as well as making other changes to the CEA. The Obama Administration threatened to veto H.R. 2289, stating that the bill \" ... undermines the efficient functioning of the CFTC by imposing a number of organizational and procedural changes and would undercut efforts taken by the CFTC over the last year to address end-user concerns.\" A number of the provisions in H.R. 2289 discussed in this report do not appear in S. 2917. This report examines the following selected major provisions of H.R. 2289, and S. 2917, which have generally garnered the most attention:", "H.R. 2289 expands the current 5 cost-benefit analysis provisions in the CEA to 12. It adds a requirement that the CFTC conduct quantitative as well as qualitative assessments, which appears to mark a change from previous practice. H.R. 2289 includes a provision that would extend an exemption from certain Dodd-Frank swaps trading and clearing requirements granted to nonfinancial companies so as to also include certain of their affiliates. H.R. 2289 would modify the definition of a \"financial entity,\" potentially enabling a wider range of companies to claim certain exemptions from the Dodd-Frank derivatives requirements. S. 2917 takes a different approach to modifying this definition. It directs the CFTC to issue a new rule defining the term predominantly engaged in financial activities to exclude hedging transactions. H.R. 2289 and S. 2917 would potentially broaden the bona fide hedging definition to allow anticipated, as well as current, risks to be hedged, which might increase the number of swaps that qualify as hedges. Bona fide hedging is often used to determine which swaps count toward registration requirements, position limits, large trader reporting, and other regulatory requirements. Language in the two bills on this topic is substantially the same. H.R. 2289 mandates that, starting 18 months from enactment, the swaps regulatory requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets must be considered comparable to those of the United States\u2014unless the CFTC issued a rule finding that any of those foreign jurisdictions' requirements were not comparable to U.S. requirements. S. 2917 and H.R. 2289 would essentially codify the deadline for a futures commission merchant (FCM) to deposit any capital to cover residual interest as no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the following business day. H.R. 2289 would remove a requirement in Dodd-Frank that foreign regulators indemnify a U.S.-based swap data repository for any expenses arising from litigation related to a request for market data.

At the time these markets were poised to expand beyond their traditional base in agricultural commodities to encompass contracts based on financial variables, such as interest rates and stock indexes. The CFTC's mission is to prevent excessive speculation, manipulation of commodity prices, and fraud. The agency administers the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), which was passed in 1936. Prior to the CFTC's creation, trading in agricultural commodities regulated by the CEA was overseen by the Commodity Exchange Administration, an office within the U.S. Department of Agriculture which was also formed in 1936.", "The CFTC oversees industry self-regulatory organizations (SROs)\u2014such as the futures exchanges and the National Futures Association\u2014and requires the registration of a range of industry firms and personnel, including futures commission merchants (or brokers), floor traders, commodity pool operators, and commodity trading advisers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank) significantly expanded the CFTC's jurisdiction to include over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, also called swaps. As a result of Dodd-Frank, major participants in the swaps markets must register with the CFTC, and certain swaps must be cleared by clearinghouses and traded on electronic trading platforms similar to exchanges. Newly regulated swap market participants include swap dealers, major swap participants, swap clearing organizations, swap execution facilities, and swap data repositories. These entities are subject to new business conduct standards contained in the statute or promulgated as CFTC rules. Like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the CFTC does not generally regulate the safety and soundness of individual firms, with the exception of newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants, for whom it will set capital standards pursuant to Dodd-Frank.", "Although most derivatives trading in today's market relates to financial variables (e.g., interest rates, currency prices, and stock indexes), congressional oversight remains vested in the House and Senate Agriculture Committees in part because of the market's historical origins in agricultural commerce. Appropriations for the CFTC are under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee in the House and the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee in the Senate.", "To meet additional responsibilities for oversight of swaps, the Obama Administration has requested additional funding for the CFTC since FY2011, when the CFTC's budget was $202 million. For FY2016, the CFTC requested a budget of $322 million, and a staff of 895 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). This represented an increase of $72 million (or 29%) and 149 FTEs over the FY2015 enacted appropriations amount of $250 million for the CFTC. The actual amount appropriated for FY2016 in P.L. 114-113 was $250 million. ", "For FY2017, the CFTC requested $330 million and a staff of 897 FTEs. This would represent an increase of $80 million or 32% over the enacted FY2016 amount. Of the requested $80 million increase, the CFTC has targeted 36% of the amount toward information technology investments, and the remaining 64% toward an increase in staffing and related support, particularly in areas such as surveillance, enforcement, economic and legal analysis, and examinations. The President's budget request stated that \"this increase is necessary because the Commission has not received budgetary increases sufficient enough to allow full implementation of its responsibilities, which have expanded greatly due to changes and growth in the markets and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as growth in the markets.\" ", "The House-reported Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2017 ( H.R. 5054 ) would provide $250 million, constant with the FY2016 enacted amount.

In economics, an externality refers to a consequence of an economic activity that is experienced by unrelated third parties; it can be either positive or negative. Pollution is often used as an example of a negative externality, in which the effects may be widely dissipated and hard to quantify. Risks to the financial system could be another example of a negative externality.

In the realm of financial regulation, benefits are often widely dissipated (for instance, prospective investors broadly benefit from fuller and more accurate corporate disclosures and related investor protections), and are sometimes speculative (e.g., trying to measure the benefit of avoiding potential financial fraud).

Some academics argue that, particularly for financial rulemakings, costs can be easier to quantify than widely dispersed potential benefits (such as \"a safer financial system\" or \"better investor disclosure\"), and that this may lead to an overstatement of costs over benefits.

The exception applies when one of the parties to the transaction is not a financial entity, is using swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, and properly notifies the CFTC regarding how it meets its financial obligations. The exception is commonly referred to as the end-user exception. The statute currently allows affiliates of end-users to use the exception, but only \"if the affiliate, acting on behalf of the person and as an agent, uses the swap to hedge or mitigate the commercial risk of the person or other affiliate of the person that is not a financial entity.\" ", "Without further definition, the term \"affiliated companies\" can loosely refer to companies that are related to each other in some way, including foreign affiliates. However, the Dodd-Frank Act does provide that an affiliate cannot use the exception if the affiliate is a swap dealer; a security-based swap dealer; a major swap participant; a major security-based swap participant; a hedge fund; a commodity pool; or a bank holding company with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets. ", "Proponents of a broader exception have argued that the hedging activities of corporate treasury units of non-financial parent companies could potentially be disqualified from using the exception. Treasury units aggregate similar risks within various parts of a parent company, and often consolidate the mitigation of those risks by engaging in one swap transaction that covers it all. Treasury units may serve other financial functions for an overall non-financial parent company as well. ", "Under current statutory language, treasury units could engage in swaps activity with non-financial affiliates without clearing the swap because the affiliate itself could use the end-user exception. The treasury unit could also engage in an uncleared swap with another financial entity if it did so acting on behalf of a non-financial entity and as its agent. However, treasury units often hedge risks with other financial entities on their own behalf, as a result of the risks they have aggregated from the non-financial entities within the parent company. Consequently, these entities may not be able to use the \"affiliate\" end-user exception, and they may not be able to use the end user exception in their own right because they \"predominantly engage in activities that are in the business of banking\" which makes them \"financial entities\" that cannot use the exception. Any inability of treasury affiliates of non-financial entities to use the end-user exception would make it more expensive for their parent corporation to hedge risks using derivatives.

", "The CFTC, in its 2012 final rule on the end-user exception, addressed some of the questions involved in deciding which entities to appropriately exclude from the end-user exception, as financial entities. The CFTC found that treasury units that operate as separate legal entities and whose primary function is financial in nature would be precluded from the \"end user\" exception, but treasury units housed within a non-financial corporation, and in which the non-financial company enters into the swaps in its own name, could be eligible to use the end user exception. The CFTC also noted that some commenters had argued that the end-user exception \"should be narrowly tailored to businesses that produce, refine, process, market, or consume underlying commodities and to counterparties transacting with non-financial counterparties\"; and that a number of form letters had argued that extending the end user exception to certain financial entities could increase systemic financial risks from derivatives trading.", "More questions regarding the proper application of the end-user exception to treasury affiliates continued to arise, however, and in 2014, the CFTC attempted to address them. The CFTC indicated that it would not bring enforcement actions against certain treasury affiliates in its November 26, 2014, no-action letter on centralized treasury units. The CFTC defines an \"eligible treasury affiliate\"\u2014which would qualify for the enforcement forbearance\u2014as entities meeting each of six conditions. The conditions include, among other things, that the affiliate is neither affiliated with nor is itself a swap dealer or a major swap participant. The CFTC also requires that the affiliate's \"ultimate parent\" is not a financial entity (and defines this as the topmost, direct or indirect, majority owner of the entity).", "Some industry participants have not been satisfied by the \"no-action\" letter, however. Treasury affiliates that rely on the no-action letter for swaps which they neither clear, nor execute on an exchange, are technically in violation of the Dodd-Frank Act's clearing requirement as interpreted by the CFTC. The CFTC's No-action Letter (NAL), while it assures those that qualify to rely on it that they will not face an enforcement action for violating the clearing and exchange trading requirements, does not actually change the statute. Consequently, proponents of the language in Section 301 have argued that a statutory amendment is necessary to provide clarity and certainty to end-users that use treasury affiliates to hedge their commercial risk.

If these entities are not financial entities, then they may use the end-user exception in their own right and need not meet the affiliate requirements of Section 723 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as it would be amended by Section 301 of H.R. 2289 . To use the clearing and exchange-trading exceptions, these entities would only need to use the swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk of other qualifying nonfinancial entities and to notify the CFTC in accordance with agency regulations.", "H.R. 2289 would create a broader, statutory exception from the Dodd-Frank clearing and exchange-trading requirements. It potentially would allow certain nonbank financial entities that do not have banking regulators to be eligible for the exception if these entities could show that they were \"commercial market participants\" or that they met the requirements for trading on behalf of other non-prudentially supervised affiliates. The bill leaves to the CFTC to further clarify who would be a commercial market participant and to determine which types of nonbank financial firms would qualify for the end-user exception.

Language in the two bills on this topic is substantially the same. The concept of bona fide hedging refers to transactions that in some way genuinely offset commercial risks. The CFTC relies on its established rules and guidance on what constitutes a bona fide hedge to help determine which types of swaps count toward the requirement to register as a swap dealer or MSP. The agency also uses the concept to determine which derivatives count toward limits on position size, referred to as position limits , and, similarly, which transactions count toward large trader reporting . ", "Large trader reporting requirements refer to a system the CFTC uses to monitor how large any one trading party's position size is. The broad purpose of this system is to ensure that no one entity wields excessive market power. The CFTC has the discretion to raise or lower the large trader reporting levels in specific markets to strike a balance between collecting sufficient information to oversee the markets and minimizing the reporting burden on market participants. Similarly, a position limit broadly refers to the maximum position in any one type of future, option, or swap for one commodity that may be held or controlled by one person.

In addition, it could potentially allow trades that were needed not only to reduce risks but also simply to manage risks.

Because the swaps market is international in nature, with considerable cross-border trading, this question is material. Section 722(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act stated that swaps reforms shall not apply to activities outside the United States unless the activities have \"a direct and significant connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States.\" ", "This mandate left much discretion to the CFTC as to how to interpret it. Former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler, under whom the CFTC first issued rules and interpretations implementing Section 722, stated that \"Failing to bring swaps market reform to transactions with overseas branches and overseas affiliates guaranteed by U.S. entities would mean American jobs and markets would likely move offshore, but, particularly in times of crisis, risk would come crashing back to our economy.\" Gensler and others have noted that derivatives trading by overseas affiliates of U.S. financial conglomerates can and has resulted in significant losses to U.S.-based entities.

In it, the agency sought to clarify who would count as a \"U.S. person\" for the purposes of meeting the requirements of Dodd-Frank, such as the clearing requirement for swaps, among other questions. Subsequently, on December 21, 2012, the agency issued a temporary exemption, extending the deadline for meeting all the requirements for cross-border swaps, while it continued to try to work with foreign regulators to create a more uniform system of requirements. Then, on May 1, 2013, the SEC proposed a rule and interpretive guidance on cross-border security-based swaps\u2014swaps related to a security, such as an equity\u2014which the SEC regulates. The SEC's proposed rule has been widely interpreted as taking a narrower approach to defining who is a U.S. person than did the CFTC\u2014and thus restricting the reach of Dodd-Frank requirements on security-based swaps to fewer overseas transactions or entities. ", "The CFTC issued its final guidance on July 26, 2013, setting out the scope of the term U.S. person, the general framework for determining which entities had to register as swap dealers and major swap participants (MSPs), and which swaps involving non-U.S. persons who were guaranteed by U.S. persons were subject to U.S. requirements. On November 14, 2013, the CFTC issued a staff advisory aimed at determining when to apply U.S.-derivatives requirements to trades that were booked in an offshore affiliate, but in which the non-U.S. affiliate used U.S. personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute the swap. ", "The CFTC continues to issue rules aimed at clarifying how to apply Dodd-Frank derivatives requirements to cross-border trades. Other issues that have arisen more recently include the need for U.S. and foreign regulators to recognize one another's derivatives clearinghouses, trading exchanges, and data repositories for reporting trades as \"equivalent,\" so that one trade spanning multiple jurisdictions need only be cleared, traded, and reported one time. This has proven challenging, as, among other things, the European Union has thus far not granted such an \"equivalence\" determination to U.S. clearinghouses and trading facilities.

H.R. 2289 drops the earlier bill's requirement that the CFTC and SEC must jointly issue a cross-border rule. But, similarly to H.R. 1256 , the current bill mandates that, starting 18 months from its enactment, the swaps regulatory requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets must be considered comparable to those of the United States\u2014unless the CFTC issues a rule or order finding that any of those foreign jurisdictions' requirements are not comparable to or as comprehensive as those of the United States. ", "It is not, however, immediately straightforward to list who those eight largest jurisdictions would be. For one thing, it would depend on how regulators treated the member countries of the European Union, for purposes of the statute. For another, the total notional value of swaps traded in a jurisdiction fluctuates over time, so how the 12-month period was drawn would likely impact the results. Further, regulators would have to determine \"where\" a swap is traded\u2014that is, in whose jurisdiction it would fall\u2014when a large portion of the market is considered \"cross-border\" in nature. This is essentially the same problem U.S. regulators are already facing in deciding when a swap qualifies as a \"U.S. transaction.\" ", "Under H.R. 2289 , if the CFTC were not to make such a determination (of non-comparability), then \"a non-United States person or a transaction between two non-United States persons shall be exempt from United States swaps requirements\" as long as they are in compliance with any of the eight permitted foreign jurisdictions. Effectively, the bill appears to substitute as a default, for trades that involved a non-U.S. person, the swaps requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets (which would encompass most of the world of swaps trading, particularly if countries in the European Union were treated as one swaps jurisdiction) for U.S. requirements\u2014unless the CFTC found a foreign jurisdiction to be lacking. ", "One question that would presumably be left to the CFTC to determine in a rulemaking would be how widely to apply this provision to \"a non-United States person or a transaction between two non-United States persons,\" were the provision enacted. For instance, would any swap in which a non-U.S. person were at least one counterparty potentially be encompassed? If so, that would potentially encompass a large majority of swaps, the bulk of which appear to be transacted in some way between a U.S. and non-U.S. person. It would presumably be left to the regulator to interpret and clarify its application. ", "Section 314 also includes a definition of a U.S. person, which, among other factors, includes \"any other person as the Commission may further define to more effectively carry out the purposes of this section\"\u2014thereby apparently giving the CFTC some leeway. However, Section 314 also specifies that, in developing its cross-border rules, the CFTC \"shall not take into account, for the purposes of determining the applicability of United States swaps requirements, the location of personnel that arrange, negotiate, or execute swaps.\" This requirement drew some criticism in congressional debate over the bill.", "The provision would appear to overturn CFTC Advisory 13-69, which had drawn much industry opposition. The advisory was aimed at resolving questions regarding the precise conditions in which swaps between U.S. and non-U.S. persons would be subject to Dodd-Frank requirements. The advisory, which technically represented the opinion of only one division of the CFTC, held that the Dodd-Frank requirements would apply to a swap between a non-U.S. swap dealer\u2014even if it were an affiliate of a U.S. swap dealer\u2014and a non-U.S. person, as long as the foreign swap dealer used \"personnel or agents located in the U.S. to arrange, negotiate, or execute such swap.\" The advisory proved controversial and drew strong industry opposition.

Indemnification generally refers to compensating someone for harm or loss. The provision instead requires the SDR and the CFTC, prior to sharing information, to first receive written agreements from the foreign regulator promising to abide by confidentiality requirements with respect to the data. The provision also does the same for security-based swap data repositories and for the SEC's information-sharing on security-based swaps with foreign regulators.", "In an effort to improve transparency in the opaque swaps market, Title VII of Dodd-Frank required all swaps to be reported to SDRs. Dodd-Frank included provisions requiring foreign regulators to indemnify U.S.-based SDRs, and the CFTC, for expenses arising from litigation related to requests for swaps transactions data. The original purpose of this Dodd-Frank provision appeared to be to try to encourage foreign regulators to more closely protect any shared information related to swaps by making it potentially more costly for them, should any information be leaked.

At a February 12, 2015, House Agriculture Committee hearing, CFTC Chair Massad, questioned about this indemnification provision, noted that \"If the legislation did remove this provision, this indemnification requirement, then it would facilitate the sharing of information ... across borders. Again, that would just make it easier for regulators to work together.\" ", "In the 114 th Congress, H.R. 1847 , which is substantially similar to the provision in H.R. 2289 repealing the indemnification provision, passed the House on July 14, 2015, on a voice vote.

This provision in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act was signed into law as P.L. 114-94 on December 4, 2015.

The provision in H.R. 2289 , as in H.R. 1847 , repeals the indemnification requirement but maintains the existing provisions that require confidentiality agreements to be signed prior to information sharing.
