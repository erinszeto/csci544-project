Work provides the principal means by which most families support themselves, and public policies directed at low-income families with children have generally attempted to encourage and support work. Family structure also has been a focus of public policy because an increasing number of children live with a single parent, and poverty rates for such children are much higher than for those in married-couple families. Families with children, regardless of marital status, are at greater risk of poverty, with child poverty rates higher than those for either nonaged or aged adults.", "Based on nuclear family income in 2004, 17.1% of families with children had total incomes below the poverty line; 21.5% had incomes of less than 125% of the poverty line (poor or near-poor); and 34% had incomes of less than 200% of poverty (low-income). Most low-income families had a parent who worked during the year.", "Many parents work at jobs that produce low incomes for their families. In 2004, 13% of parents worked at a wage rate that would have produced below-poverty income for a family of three, and 45% of parents worked at a wage rate that would have produced incomes below 200% of the poverty level, even assuming full-year, full-time work\u2014a level designated as low-income in this report. Thus, families with children headed by a single parent\u2014with only one potential earner\u2014are more likely to be poor than those headed by a married couple. However, married couples with children and one working parent sometimes struggle to attain even a modest income above 200% of poverty; it often takes both parents working for a family to exceed low-income levels. Moreover, for many families, if one parent's earnings are lost, the economic status of many married-couple families would suffer.", "Parents' characteristics (e.g., education and work experience) and the occupations in which they are employed affect wage rates, and therefore the possibility that a family is poor or low-income. Those with lower levels of educational attainment are more likely to earn low wages and be in low-income families. We estimate that 17% of working parents with just a high school diploma earn wages that are too low to support a family of three at the poverty line\u2014assuming full-time, full-year work\u2014and 60% would be unable to support such a family at twice that level. Among working parents with a bachelor's degree, only about 6% earn wages too low to support a family of three at the poverty line, but 24% lack the earnings capacity to support such a family at twice the poverty line. Additionally, younger parents typically earn less than older parents, who have had more time to accumulate work experience. This puts the families of young parents, who tend to have young children, particularly at risk for poverty and low income.", "Annual earnings and economic status also depend on number of hours worked per week and the number of weeks worked during the year. In married-couple families, strong attachment to the workforce of both parents is associated with higher income levels. However, among poor married-couple families, only half of all poor families had one earner working full-time all year.

The report specifically looks at the role parents play in supporting their families through work, with a focus on the adequacy of parental earnings. It examines parents' effectiveness as breadwinners, and seeks to address such questions as:", "How well are American families with children doing? How many families are poor, and how many are poor in spite of parents' work? If not poor, how many are near poor, or just getting by? Is the full-time work of one parent sufficient to support a family, or must other family members, most notably a spouse, also work to attain a modest level of income security relative to basic needs? Which categories of families are particularly struggling? Could they increase their income security by working more? How many families, while getting by, would be economically vulnerable if they lost a breadwinner's income or had an additional child?", "The report presents data on income and poverty status of families with children; looks at parents' wages relative to poverty and factors affecting wages, including parents' education level, age, and occupation; and examines the amount of work provided by parents and the relationship of job attachment to earnings adequacy. The report concludes by highlighting those families most vulnerable to poverty or low income based on parents' earnings, and briefly discusses public policies and government programs most relevant to those families.", "Our analysis is based primarily on data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS/ASEC) for 2005. The survey collects information on family composition at the time of the survey (February through April of 2005) and income and labor force participation in the previous year (i.e., 2004). While shedding much light on the economic status of families with children, the CPS cannot address certain questions, particularly those relating to compensation other than earnings, such as sick and/or family leave, or other benefits, such as health and retirement benefits.", "The major findings of the analysis in this report are:", "Based on nuclear family income, an estimated 6.8 million families with children were poor in 2004, accounting for 17.1% of families headed by a parent with one or more children. At an income standard of twice the poverty line, deemed to be \" low-income \" in this report, 14.4 million families with children qualified as low-income, accounting for 36.4% of all families with children. Many parents work at jobs with wage rates that translate into low incomes for their families. In 2004, an estimated 13% of all parents worked at a wage rate that would have produced below-poverty income (for a family of three) even if they worked full-time, all year; an estimated 45% of all parents worked at a wage rate that would have produced incomes of less than 200% of poverty. In married-couple families with children, it often takes the work of both parents to earn a modest income. In 2004, almost 40% of all married-couple families with children would have had incomes equal to less than 200% of the poverty threshold, based on the primary worker's earnings. Many single-parent families, having only one earner, have earnings that leave the family either poor or near poor. In 2004, more than half of mother-only families would have been poor based on the mother's earnings alone; more than three-quarters of these mothers had earnings that were less than 200% of the poverty threshold. Our economy has a division of labor and specialization. Some occupations pay relatively low wages, and a substantial number of parents are employed in these occupations. For example, in March 2005, 1.2 million parents worked as \"cashiers,\" an occupation with a median wage of $8.00 an hour. This wage rate would produce an income of less than 125% of poverty for a family of three. Parents' earnings depend on many factors, the most prominent being their level of educational attainment. Those with college degrees earn more than those without them. Another factor affecting parents' earnings is their age\u2014older workers who have had more time to acquire on-the-job experience and job skills are paid higher wages than less experienced, younger workers. This has important implications for parents in their 20s and early 30s (a period when many families are formed and people commonly have children), who earn less than older parents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How We Define Families", "paragraphs": ["In this report, we define families somewhat differently than the Census Bureau in its family income and poverty measures. Under the official Census Bureau measures, all persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption living in the same household (i.e., living quarters) comprise a family. As such, a married couple or a single parent with dependent (biological or adopted) children in their household constitutes a family, but so do more complex households containing other family members, such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, and grandchildren.", "We employ a more restrictive definition of family than that used by the Census Bureau because we wish to gauge parents' effectiveness in providing for their immediate family's needs\u2014that is, the needs of the parent or parents (if a spouse is present) and their dependent children. For this purpose, we define families as units composed of married couples or single parents with at least one child under the age of 18 (i.e., minor children). All minor children and all adult children living in the household are included in the family unit unless those children have a child of their own, or are married with a spouse residing in the household. In such cases, where a child or another relative who has a child lives in the household, those subfamily units are included in the analysis but are identified as separate family units. The family units constructed through this process are identified as \" nuclear families, \" which are at times identical to the Census Bureau's definition of family, but in more complex family households are a subset of the Census Bureau's definition. (See Appendix A for a discussion of family living arrangements and treatment of income in defining poverty.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How We Treat Income", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, we define nuclear families as the basic unit of analysis in this report. Much of our analysis compares family income, or components of family income (e.g., parents' earned income), relative to Census Bureau poverty income thresholds. We use Census Bureau poverty thresholds as a measure of families' basic needs. These poverty thresholds vary by family size and composition (e.g., number of related children under the age of 18) and are the most often used standard for measuring basic income needs.", "In our analysis, we examine nuclear family income and poverty status based on the unit's income compared to poverty thresholds that reflect the unit's size and composition. This is because, as stated above, we are trying to gauge parents' effectiveness in meeting their immediate family's income needs. Unless otherwise stated, in cases where there are extended family members and/or related subfamily units present in the household, their income and needs are excluded from the nuclear family income and poverty definitions used in this report. However, when reference is made to the \" official Census Bureau income and poverty measure, \" the income and needs of extended family members are included.", "In this report, we construct income to poverty ratios by dividing the family's earnings or income by the applicable poverty threshold, based on the family's size and composition. A family with income below 1.00 times the poverty line is considered poor. We also assess parents' earnings and family income at other income standards. For example, we identify families with income below 1.25 times the poverty line as \" near poor, \" below 1.5 times poverty as \" economically fragile, \" and below 2 times poverty as \" low-income. \" These labels, \" near poor, economically fragile, and low-income, \" are used to facilitate the narrative and presentation and should not be construed as official government definitions or designations of relative income adequacy. The body of the report focuses primarily on married-couple families and families headed by lone mothers, with only limited discussion of lone-father families, in large part due to their comparatively small numbers. However, data for all three family types are presented in a data appendix ( Appendix B )."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Family Income and Poverty Status", "paragraphs": ["Under the definition of nuclear family poverty used throughout much of this report, in 2004, an estimated 6.8 million families with children were poor, accounting for 17.1% of nuclear families, or family units composed of just parents and their dependent children. In all, we estimate there were approximately 39.7 million nuclear family units with children in 2004. Most of these families (31.6 million, or 80%) live in independent households, with no other family members or other unrelated household members. Under the official Census Bureau poverty definition, taking other family members into account, both in terms of their income and needs, reduces the number of poor families with children to an estimated 5.9 million, and their poverty rate to 14.9%.", " Figure 1 shows families with children by their incomes, relative to the poverty line. The lines represent the cumulative percentage of families with children with incomes below a specified level, by family type. The labeled brackets in the figure indicate the range at which families are considered poor (below 100% of poverty), poor or near poor (below 125% of poverty), economically fragile (below 150% of poverty), or low-income (below 200% of poverty). The line for all families shows that 17.1% of families with children have nuclear family incomes below 100% of poverty. About one-fifth of all families with children (21.5%) were either poor or near poor (with incomes below 125% of poverty); and well over one-third (36.4%) were low-income (i.e., had incomes below twice the poverty line).", "Most children live in families headed by either a married couple or a single mother. It is well known that the likelihood that a child will be impoverished depends greatly on which of these two family types he or she lives in. In 2004, just over two-fifths (41.8%) of nuclear families with children headed by a single mother were poor, while only 7.1% of families with children headed by a married couple were poor. Over two-thirds of mother-only families (68.8%) had incomes below twice the poverty line, while just over one-fifth of married-couple families with children (22.5%) fell within this low-income category.", "Though the likelihood that a family with children will be poor is much greater for those headed by a single mother than those headed by a married couple, married couples with children account for a nontrivial share of poor and low-income families with children. Figure 2 shows that, in 2004, more than one-in-four poor families with children (27.8%) were headed by a married couple, while married couples accounted for more than four of every ten (41.8%) low-income families with children. Being headed by a married couple is not sufficient for a family with children to escape poverty or low income status.

In other cases, both parents may choose to work to improve the family's economic standard of living. For families headed by single parents, choices between work and family obligations may be more difficult.", "In what follows, we compare family income and components of family income to poverty in several ways. At times, we count only the primary earner's earnings against the family's poverty threshold to gauge the effect of one parent's labor market engagement in providing for his/her family's needs. To this measure, we separately add earnings of a second parent, if present, to judge the effect of combining the labor income of both parents in supporting their family. In addition to parents' earnings, in a separate step we add all other sources of cash income in the immediate (i.e., nuclear) family to provide a fuller assessment of their level of economic well-being. In a subsequent final step, the income and needs of extended family members living in the household are included in the assessment of family income and poverty status.", "Considering earnings alone, of course, ignores the impact of other forms of income\u2014particularly government transfer payments such as food stamps and the refundable Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\u2014on parents' behavior and family economic well-being. Since the focus of this report is on low-income families with children, the impact of these other forms of income on economic well-being is obviously important. Considering the effect of earnings alone on family poverty status addresses the question: \"What would the economic well-being of families with children be if they relied only on their income from work and received no other income, including no government help?\"", " Figure 3 shows the role of parents' earnings and other income relative to the poverty threshold by family type. In 2004, more than half (52.6%) of families with children headed by a single mother would have been poor based on her earnings alone. Other income sources, such as alimony and child support, social insurance payments (e.g., social security), and government cash assistance, reduces the poverty rate of these families to 41.8%. Approximately one-in-four families headed by lone mothers live in household settings with extended family members (see Appendix A ). If the income and needs of these additional family members is factored in, the poverty rate of lone-mother families drops to 35.0%\u2014their official poverty rate.", "The inability of single mothers to provide their families with a basic\u2014let alone modest\u2014level of income security may be due to low wages, few hours worked, or a combination of the two. When only full-time, full-year working single mothers are considered, 23% are unable to provide a standard of living above poverty based on their earnings alone; 33% are unable to secure an earnings-based standard of living that is higher than near-poverty; and 62% are unable to attain a modest earnings-based level of income security above twice the poverty line ( not shown in figure ). It is unlikely that these mothers can work more, as they already are fully engaged in market-based work. As a single mother, there may be little time for in-home production (i.e., preparing meals, doing laundry, cleaning), if other family members are not available to chip in, and income may be limited to hire out these activities. Additionally, children must be cared for and nurtured. Low-cost or free child care (e.g. provided by a relative) may be essential for these mothers to work to support their families.", "Among married-couple families with children, the poverty rate based on the earnings of the primary earner alone is estimated at 12.9%. In the majority of these families (77%), the husband is the primary earner ( not shown in figure ). When the earnings of both parents are considered, the poverty rate for married couples with children falls to 10.0%. All other nuclear and extended family income (if present) reduces the poverty rate of married couples with children to 6.9%\u2014the official level under the Census Bureau definition.", "Among married-couple families with children, earnings of a second working parent are particularly important in attaining a higher family income standard. Although earnings of a second parent have only about a three percentage point effect on the poverty rate, the importance of these earnings is seen higher in the income distribution. Based on the earnings of a married couple's primary earner alone, nearly 40% of married couple families with children would be classified as low-income. However, when the earnings of the second parent are added to family income, that percentage drops to 27%. Thus, it often takes two working parents for a married-couple family to attain a modest income.", "In 2004, among primary earners in married-couple families with children who worked full-time full-year , 9% were unable to provide their families with a standard of living above poverty based on their earnings alone ; 15% were unable to secure an earnings-based standard of living beyond near poverty; and 36% were unable to attain a modest level of income security above twice the poverty line ( not shown in figure ). In many cases, both parents work, presumably at least in part to attain a higher standard of living. Married-couple families face a trade-off relating to whether a parent should stay home to care for the children, or go to work to secure additional income.

Hourly poverty wage rates shown in the table are calculated by dividing the corresponding annual poverty threshold by 2,080 hours\u2014the equivalent of 40 hours of work per week for 52 weeks per year. Thus, for the four-person family, a single earner working full-time, full-year (i.e., 52 weeks, 40 hours per week, or 2,080 hours) would need to earn $9.21 per hour to support his/her family at a poverty-line income, based on earnings alone. For the three-person family depicted above, the parent would need to earn $7.31 per hour, working full-time, full-year , to support his/her family at a poverty-line income. A single parent with one child would need to earn about $6.26 per hour to bring her/his family income up to the poverty line.

A worker's productivity is related to the knowledge, skills and abilities brought to the labor market. As shorthand, we will refer to these worker traits simply as skills or human capital. Employers' need for specific skills (demand), along with the relative scarcity of those skills in the labor force (supply), help determine the market value, or wage, that workers command and employers offer. Some workers' skills are valued highly, as reflected in their wages. Other workers' skills are valued such that the market offers comparatively low wages.", "Two commonly measured aspects of workers' human capital are educational attainment and lifetime work experience. In this section, we examine the effects of educational attainment on parents' wages and family poverty status, based on the highest education credential that parents have attained. However, lifetime work experience is not measured on the Current Population Survey (CPS). In this analysis, we use parents' age as a proxy for potential on-the-job experience.", "Wage rates vary by factors other than human capital. For example, wage rates of African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be lower than those for whites. Women often earn less than men. Numerous studies have examined wage rates by race, ethnicity, and gender, attempting to determine the amount by which wage differentials can be attributed to differences in measurable background factors (e.g. education and work experience) and the degree to which remaining unexplained differences might be due to other, less directly measurable factors, such as discrimination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Parents' Wages and Educational Attainment", "paragraphs": ["As is commonly known, wage rates tend to be higher for workers with higher levels of educational attainment.

It shows the hourly earnings by decile (each 10% of the wage rate distribution) for each level of educational attainment. The upward slope of the lines shows that wage rates increase with levels of educational attainment. Further, the widening \"spread\" of the lines as educational attainment increases shows that the returns to education have greater variability at higher levels of attainment than at lower levels.", "In 2004, the median wage rate equivalent for a parent who had less than a high school diploma was $9.62 per hour\u2014a full-time full-year earnings level that equates to about 132% of the poverty line for a married couple with one child. Based on those earnings alone, such a family would be classified as \" economically fragile. \" With one additional child, the family would be barely above poverty. The median hourly wage equivalent of workers with a high school diploma ($12.82) and those with some college but no degree ($14.62) affords a married couple with one earner and one child a standard of living equal to 175% of poverty in the former case, and 200% of poverty in the latter case.

In other words, half of these parents had hourly earnings that were higher than $11.06 and half had hourly earnings below $11.06. One-tenth of parents under age 25 had hourly earnings below $6.11 and one-tenth had hourly earnings above $18.68. On the other hand, among parents age 45 to 49 who were the primary earner in married-couple families, half had hourly earnings of $24.04 or more (median amount), and 10% earned $10.68 per hour or less.

For parents age 45 to 49, median hourly earnings of lone mothers ($13.94) were only about 58% of those of primary earners of similar age in married-couple families ($24.04).

As with the earlier figure, Figure 8 includes all parents (i.e., primary and secondary earners in married couple families, and lone parents) with observed wages.

A child's birth, especially among young parents, may interrupt parents' education and delay possible accumulation of work experience, thereby affecting future wage possibilities. Younger parents may lack the job security that comes with time on the job, exposing them to greater risk of being laid off during economic downturns.", "Figures 9 and 10 depict family income relative to poverty for married-couple and mother-only families, respectively, by parents' age.

Nearly two-fifths (39.6%) had immediate family income below 150% of the poverty line.

Given that wage rates of many parents' jobs would leave a family in low-income status, it often takes two parents working for a family's earnings to attain a modest income level, above the low-income threshold of 200% of poverty used in this report. Full-time work for many single parents may be difficult to attain, if safe, reliable and affordable child care is difficult to obtain. Obviously, then, single parent families are at high risk for low-income and poverty. Young families. The principal earner of families headed by a parent under the age of 25 had median earnings of $11.06 per hour\u2014a wage rate that would classify the three person benchmark family used in this analysis as low-income , but just slightly above the cut-off that would classify the family as economically fragile (i.e., 150% of poverty) , based on full-time full-year work. The low earnings of these young parents is a logical consequence of being at the beginning of their adult work careers and not yet having accumulated job experience that raises earnings capacity. In young married-couple families, it may make little economic sense for both parents to work, as child care for young children may be expensive relative to additional earnings that might be obtained. Additionally, many families prefer that a parent stay home to care for and nurture their children, and a parent's labor force withdrawal may be voluntary and temporary. Low income and economic insecurity may be temporary during the early years of family formation, but have implications for family well-being and child development and outcomes, in years beyond. Families Headed by a Parent Without A College Degree. Families headed by a parent who lacked a high school degree were likely to be low-income. Median wage rates\u2014even for high school graduates and those with some college, but no college degree\u2014result in the benchmark three-person family being classified in the low-income category, by having earnings below 200% of poverty.

Based on the earnings of both parents, 27% of married-couple families with children are low-income; however, based solely on the earnings of the family's principal earner, 39% of such families would be low-income. Thus, the economic well-being of many married-couple families with children is vulnerable to the loss of earnings of the family's second earner. Further, there are reasons that some parents do not or cannot work full-time all year, such as involuntary unemployment, illness, or disability, or the need to take time off for the birth or care of a child or disabled family member.", "This analysis has focused on the economic outcomes generated by the labor market. Government policy, of course, also has important implications for the economic well-being and security of families with children, although it will be only briefly mentioned in this report. Government policies that promote full employment while at the same time keeping inflation in check are clearly important to working families. While a strong economy is necessary to promote family economic security, for many families it is not sufficient. Families may still face economic vulnerability, even when the economy is healthy. Table 3 presents a typology of selected existing government programs (focusing on federal or federal-state programs) and how they relate to the economic well-being and vulnerability of families with children. Many of these programs face difficult tradeoffs and competing objectives\u2014such as providing some measure of basic economic security while also promoting personal responsibility. This is especially true of \"safety net\" programs that provide assistance to mitigate income loss caused by certain events, but result in inherent undesired behavioral effects, such as work disincentives and marriage penalties. Other policies and programs seek to mitigate the undesired outcomes often associated with safety-net programs, by increasing the financial returns associated with work or providing opportunities to reduce the intergenerational transmission of poverty.", "Policies to Mitigate the Risk of Earnings Loss. These programs represent the basic two-tiered \"safety net\" of social insurance programs and need-tested programs. The social insurance programs base benefits on past earnings, and entitlement to these benefits is earned through work in covered employment. The caseload and expenditures of social insurance programs are far greater than those of the need-tested programs. For families with children, the basic contours of the safety net were established in the Social Security Act of 1935, with the last major additions coming with establishment of Medicaid (1965), Medicare for the disabled, including children (1972), and food stamps, made available nationwide in the 1970s. Most recently, this safety net was affected by the welfare reform law of 1996, which converted Aid to Families with Dependent Children, originally established in the 1965 Social Security Act, into a block grant to states that provides time-limited and work-conditioned cash assistance to poor families with children. Policies to Raise the Financial Returns to Work . These are policies to directly raise wages (e.g., minimum wage legislation), provide earnings supplements, or reduce the costs of going to work. Minimum wage legislation\u2014like the Social Security Act\u2014dates back to the Great Depression. However, the 1990s saw a great deal of expansion of policies in this category, including expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which provides a \"work bonus\" to families with low to moderate earnings, and increased funding for child care, which helps offset the costs of going to work. Policies Aimed at Family Formation. There has been much recent attention paid to this class of policies. Tax policies, such as the deduction for dependents and the (partially refundable) child credit, benefit families based on their number of children. These policies to some extent adjust families' tax burdens based on family size. They may also mitigate, to an extent, the fact that employers consider a worker's assumed productivity when striking wage bargains, rather than the number of dependents a worker must support. The role of cash welfare\u2014cushioning economic hardship when one parent is absent, but thought by some to facilitate single-parenthood\u2014has been controversial. However, collections of child support for both welfare and non-welfare families, through the federal-state child support enforcement program, have increased dramatically since the mid-1990s. Recent attention has been paid to so-called \"marriage penalties\" in the tax code, and very recently marriage promotion and education programs have been introduced. Meanwhile, family planning grants, authorized in 1970, may have the effect of deferring child-bearing, while adolescent family life (created in 1980) and abstinence education (enacted in 1996) specifically focus on preventing pregnancy among teenagers. Policies Aimed at Preventing Intergenerational Transmission of Poverty. As briefly mentioned, poverty among families with children has special consequences, particularly since growing up poor might affect a child's life chances as an adult. Programs such as Head Start, and Title I grants to local school districts for supplementary education and services for disadvantaged children, are intended to help poor children obtain the education needed to escape poverty as an adult.", "Appendix A.

In other instances, extended family members' income and needs were also included in the analysis. As noted above, some nuclear and related extended families live in households with unrelated members as well. However, the potential effect of unrelated household members' income and needs on nuclear or extended family well-being may vary to the extent that resources are shared among household members. In some cases, unrelated household members, such as unmarried partners, may make significant economic contributions to the nuclear family co-residing in the household. In other cases, the sharing of economic resources among unrelated household members may be minimal. However, there is no clear means of determining the extent to which unrelated household members share income and represent a joint economic unit. In this analysis, we excluded unrelated household members' income and needs when considering family economic well-being.", "The effect of family living arrangements on poverty status can be illustrated by a closer examination of the families as economic units under various family configurations and income-sharing arrangements.

Among these families, an estimated 37% are poor. Their poverty status is the same under all three poverty definitions: poor based on nuclear family income; poor based on extended family income; and poor based on household income.", "Roughly 22% of lone-mother families live with other extended family members only. Among these families, an estimated 51% are poor based on their immediate family income. However, when the income and needs of other related household members are taken into consideration, their poverty rate drops to about 23%\u2014less than half the rate when only immediate nuclear family income was considered, and a rate below that of lone mothers who live as independent nuclear families (37%). In part, the nuclear family poverty rate (51%) of lone mothers in such living arrangements may be so high because they live with extended family members who help provide for their support; this support is not counted in determining the 51% poverty rate but is evidenced by the 23% poverty rate. If these lone mothers were living independently, their poverty rate might not be as high as 51%, but it also might not be as low as the 37% among lone mothers currently observed to be living independently; some would likely work and earn more than they do when living with extended family, or would seek to qualify for government assistance in the absence of extended family income support.", "The right-most set of clustered bars in Figure A -2 depict the poverty status of lone mothers living with only their children and at least one unrelated household member. As noted above, about 15% of lone mothers live in such households. When only her immediate nuclear family income and needs are taken into account, about 46% of these lone-mother families would be considered poor. However, if all unrelated household members are considered and their income counted for purposes of determining poverty, the poverty rate among these lone-mother families falls to 14.8%\u2014well below the poverty rate of lone mothers living independently in nuclear families with no extended or unrelated household members. In these households with unrelated members, the extent to which household income is shared among members is uncertain. CRS estimates that about 1 million lone mothers, (approximately 65% of 1.6 million lone-mother families living with unrelated household members) may be in cohabiting relationships with a man.
