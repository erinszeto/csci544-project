To be held to ERISA's fiduciary standard with respect to his or her advice, an individual had to (1) make recommendations on investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or other property, or give advice as to the value (2) on a regular basis (3) pursuant to a mutual understanding that the advice (4) will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions, and (5) will be individualized to the particular needs of the plan regarding such matters as, among other things, investment policies or strategy, overall portfolio composition, or diversification of plan investments.", "On April 8, 2016, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued a final regulation (called the 2016 final rule in this report) that redefined the term investment advice within pension and retirement plans. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; P.L. 93-406), a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation, which means that the person must provide the advice in the sole interest of plan participants. Thus, redefining the term investment advice could affect who is subject to this fiduciary standard. With the 2016 rule, DOL broadened the term's definition to capture activities that currently occur within pension and retirement plans, but did not meet the 1975 definition of investment advice.", "The 2016 final rule replaced the five-part test of the 1975 rule with a more inclusive definition. (Table 1 compares the prior and current definitions.) For example, under the prior regulation, an individual had to provide advice on a regular basis to be a fiduciary, which generally would not have included recommendations on whether to roll over a 401(k) account balance to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). The expanded definition removed the requirement that advice be given on a regular basis.", "Under the prior regulation, securities brokers and dealers who provided services to retirement plans and who were not fiduciaries were not required to act in the sole interests of plan participants. Rather, their recommendations had to meet a suitability standard, which requires that recommendations be suitable for the plan participant, given factors such as an individual's income, risk tolerance, and investment objectives. The suitability standard is a lower standard than a fiduciary standard. Under DOL's 2016 regulation, brokers and dealers are generally considered to be fiduciaries when they provide recommendations to participants in retirement plans.", "In addition to broadening the definition of investment advice, the rule provides carve-outs for situations that are not considered to be investment advice. For example, providing generalized investment or retirement education is not considered investment advice under the final rule.", "The 2016 final rule is accompanied by new prohibited transaction exemptions (PTEs) and amendments to existing PTEs. These allow fiduciaries to continue to engage in certain practices that would otherwise be prohibited (such as charging commissions for products they recommend or having revenue-sharing agreements with third parties).", "DOL first proposed broadening the definition of investment advice in October 2010. The proposed regulation generated much controversy and was withdrawn in September 2011. The revised proposals issued in April 2015 also generated considerable controversy. Following the release of the proposals, DOL received public comments and held three-and-a-half days of public hearings on the proposals.

In the mid-1970s, Americans who participated in an employer-sponsored pension plan most likely participated in a DB pension. Since then, the number of participants in DB plans has decreased and the number of participants in DC plans has increased. According to DOL data on participation counts, in 1975, 74% of participation in private-sector plans was in DB pension plans and 26% was in DC plans; by 2014, 28% of participation in private-sector plans was in DB pension plans and 72% was in DC plans. Participants in DC plans have more decisions to make than participants in DB plans (such as decisions on contribution amounts, investment allocations, rollovers, and withdrawals). Because financial decisions can be complicated, DC plan sponsors sometimes provide investment advice or investment education to plan participants. In addition, retirement investors may receive outside help with these decisions. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evidence in Support of Rule", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration's rationale for the need to update the investment advice rule was laid out in two documents: (1) a February 2015 report from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) on conflicted investment advice and (2) the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) by DOL that was released with the 2015 proposed rule.", "The CEA estimated that conflicted advice costs IRA investors about $17 billion per year. This cost is a result of both (1) lower investment returns of funds purchased and (2) higher fees associated with investments recommended as result of conflicted advice. ", "Some said that the CEA analysis was flawed. For example, one report critical of the CEA analysis said that the conclusions in the academic literature that CEA cites are more nuanced than presented in the CEA analysis. This report also said that the CEA analysis does not attempt to quantify the benefits that brokers provide under current regulations.", "Among the points the RIA made in support of the proposal are the following: ", "The structure of the market in which retirement plans operate creates conflicts of interest that are not adequately addressed by current regulations. For example, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicated that plan sponsors may be confused as to whether their advisers are subject to a fiduciary standard. Advisers that offer advice to plans regarding which investment options to include in their plans (platform providers) might have fee arrangements that create conflicts of interest. For example, a platform provider might have a revenue sharing arrangement in which the provider receives a commission when particular investment options are included in a plan. DOL indicated that it found enforcement challenging because it had to demonstrate that an individual met each element of the five-part test. For example, when a DB plan terminates, in order to guarantee participants' future benefits, the plan had to purchase annuity contracts for each of the plan participants. However, purchasing these annuity contracts were generally one-time events that would not have met the requirement for advice to be provided on a regular basis. An adviser providing recommendations on the purchase of the contracts thus might not be considered a fiduciary. IRA investors might have been particularly vulnerable to advisers' conflicts of interest in the existing regulatory framework and benefit from a new rule. The RIA indicated that IRA investors would see gains from the proposal of between $40 billion and $44 billion over 10 years and compliance costs among financial institutions would be between $2.7 billion and $5.7 billion over 10 years. The RIA also looked at changes to the investment advice regulation in Great Britain (which implemented new regulations on financial advisers in January 2013) and how these changes affected investors with smaller account balances. Some have expressed concerns about the impact of the proposal on U.S. investors with smaller account balances. The RIA concluded that there had been little impact on the ability of small investors to receive advice.", "Some stakeholders questioned the validity of the evidence in the RIA and claimed that the RIA did not justify the adoption of the 2015 proposed rule. For example, in a comment letter to DOL, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) challenged the RIA's conclusion that mutual funds that are sold by securities brokers underperform relative to other mutual funds. ICI also argued that the RIA failed to account for the societal harms as a result of the rule (e.g., some investors might lose access to investment advice)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns Regarding Rollovers from DC Plans to IRAs", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration and other policymakers expressed concerns regarding rollovers from DC plans (such as 401(k) accounts) to IRAs. In addition, the SEC included as one of its 2014 examination priorities the sales practices of investment advisers who target retirement-aged workers to roll over their account balances to higher-cost investments. One reason for the concern is the large amount of funds that are rolled over from employer-sponsored plans to IRAs. According to ICI, in 2013, 86% of traditional IRAs were opened by individuals making rollovers from employer-sponsored plans. ICI indicated that in 2014, $424 billion was transferred from employer-sponsored pension plans to traditional IRAs.", "A GAO report issued in March 2013 found that, upon separation from their employer, due to job change or retirement, individuals do not always receive recommendations that are in their best interests. The report also identified several factors that encouraged them to roll over their 401(k) account balances to IRAs. For example, plan participants often find the process confusing; there is a lack of assistance from their employers; and the marketing of IRAs by financial institutions is pervasive and may be misleading, particularly with regard to fees. ", "Pension plan participants have a variety of factors to consider when deciding to roll over an account balance from a 401(k) plan to an IRA. For example, the fees in a 401(k) plan are typically lower than in an IRA (because of economies of scale); IRAs often offer a greater number and variety of investment options; individuals sometimes prefer to consolidate 401(k) plans from multiple jobs into a single IRA; and ERISA's fiduciary protections generally do not apply to IRAs.", "Recognizing concerns over the IRA rollover market, in December 2013, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA, the securities industry self-regulating association) issued guidance reminding broker-dealers that their recommendations regarding rollovers into IRAs must adhere to the suitability standard.", "In 2005, DOL issued an advisory opinion that a recommendation regarding a rollover decision is not investment under current regulations and not subject to a fiduciary standard under ERISA. The 2016 final rule supersedes the 2005 advisory opinion on recommendations regarding rollovers from 401(k) accounts to IRAs and considers recommendations regarding rollovers to be investment advice subject to the 2016 final rule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Trump Administration's Perspective on the Rule", "paragraphs": ["The Trump Administration reviewed the 2016 final rule to determine whether it would likely harm retirement investors by (1) restricting access to retirement savings offerings and products, (2) disrupting the retirement savings industry in a way that adversely affects investors and retirees, and (3) causing an increase in litigation.", "As mentioned earlier, DOL delayed the applicability date of (1) the expanded definition of investment advice and (2) the Impartial Conduct Standard of the Best Interest Contract (BIC) exemption until June 9, 2017.
