Compounding the challenge for Japanese government, businesses, and communities was the resulting destruction of several nuclear reactors in the region which supplied electricity for homes and industry. Not only was electricity unavailable, but a large area was temporarily evacuated, making rapid reopening of affected industries impossible.", "Located in the disaster region and adversely affected by these forces are a number of manufacturing facilities which are integral to the global motor vehicle supply chain. They include plants that assemble automobiles and many suppliers which build parts and components for vehicles. Some of the Japanese factories that were forced to close provide parts and chemicals not easily available elsewhere. This is particularly true of automotive electronics, a major producer of which was located near the center of the destruction.", "The effect of these disasters has been first and foremost borne by Japanese automakers, which closed many of their Japanese assembly plants for several weeks as they assessed their supply chain issues and impact on their Tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers. Japanese motor vehicle plants in other parts of the world have also been affected, including facilities owned by Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and other manufacturers in the Midwest and South of the United States. Detroit 3 automakers, by contrast, are less affected, although they, too, have taken extraordinary steps to keep production moving, including visiting suppliers in Japan to help them rebuild, locating alternative sources for some parts and chemicals, and shifting plants' summer vacations to accommodate the loss of parts.", "IHS Global Insight, a global consulting firm, forecasts that over 4 million units of vehicle production will be lost because of the disasters in Japan, with 90% of them from Japanese automakers. It is possible that a shortage of some popular Japanese vehicles may develop over the summer in the United States. The Detroit 3 and South Korean automakers may be able to fill a portion of whatever demand Japanese producers are unable to meet.", "Congress has shown an interest in the economic effects of these disasters, and at least one hearing has been planned to examine the effects. Not only is Japan one of the United States' largest trading partners, but it is also an ally in Asia, and its rebuilding is an important step in global economic recovery. In addition, Congress may be interested in evaluating the resilience of global supply chains as a result of new information about the vulnerabilities of supply chains in the automotive sector."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The March 2011 Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami struck the northeast coast of Japan. These natural disasters were exacerbated by additional disruptions from the collateral damage to a seaside nuclear reactor that generated electricity for residential and commercial use in that part of Japan. Concern over leaking radiation caused the government of Japan to evacuate populations from the vicinity of the damaged reactors and to close highways connecting manufacturing and other employment centers. The damage to nuclear facilities also resulted in a shortage of electricity in parts of the country. Subsequent tremors and aftershocks continued to affect precision-oriented manufacturing, which automatically shut down operations when certain moderate-level aftershocks take place. Some ports, which ship product globally, were affected as well.", "These disasters have thrown into bold relief the vagaries and fragility of some elements of the global auto supply chain. A typical motor vehicle has over 15,000 parts, and the lack of an essential component may halt the completion of vehicles and cause a slowdown or stoppage of assembly lines. Japan is the second-largest vehicle-producing nation (after China), and many of the world's vehicles and vehicle parts originate there. It is also where many automotive technologies originate, giving Japanese suppliers \"substantial and growing shares of the global market.\" A relative handful of critical suppliers, especially of electronic components, were unable to meet their commitments. In some instances, the automakers that depended on them had few alternative sources of important inputs. Full restoration of supply capacity will take months.", "Not long after the earthquake and tsunami, an industry analyst noted that \"[g]iven the disruptions in Japanese industrial activity, the impact on global supply chains could also be significant. This is especially important in industries such as autos, telecommunications and consumer electronics.\"", "In the meantime, it is likely that a number of U.S. auto production facilities will see a slowdown of production throughout the spring and summer. Communities in the Midwest and South which have been returning to normal after the recent recession may see a parts shortage-induced drop in production that may affect employment and paychecks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Motor Vehicle Industry", "paragraphs": ["The motor vehicle industry is a major part of the U.S. economy, accounting in 2010 for over 674,000 jobs, or 5.8% of all U.S. manufacturing employment. Although some American manufacturers are adding production abroad, generating concern in Congress and in many states about the future of auto manufacturing in the United States, several automakers are opening new U.S. plants. In 2011, Toyota and Volkswagen (VW) have opened new plants in Mississippi and Tennessee, respectively, and Nissan is building a new plant to open in Tennessee in 2012.", "Few consumer products are as complex as automobiles: the 15,000 or more parts in each vehicle are integrated at the time of assembly into durable vehicles, most of which will last more than a decade. Vehicles are among the most globally sourced products a consumer can buy. Autos produced in U.S. plants\u2014whether owned by U.S. or foreign automakers\u2014contain parts from not only nearby Canada and Mexico, but also from parts manufacturers in Europe and Asia. Parts are purchased from far away because the supplier base has developed niche markets in some countries. For example, some electronic parts used in U.S.-made automobiles are manufactured primarily in Japan. ", "Since the recession of 2009, when U.S. auto sales and production fell to the lowest points in three decades, automakers have seen a recovery, as shown in Table 1 . Forecasts for 2011 indicate that North American production and U.S. sales may each hit about 13 million units, a level not seen since 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The U.S. Motor Vehicle Supply Chain", "paragraphs": ["The supply chain is the network and related processes which transform raw materials and disparate parts into a finished vehicle. The supply chain also includes financing, advertising, management, and distribution to the final customer. Hundreds of firms are engaged in motor vehicle parts production, final assembly, and sales.", "The geography of North American automaking is shown in Figure 1 . Assembly plants are located primarily along an axis stretching southwest from Ontario to central Mexico. Thousands of parts suppliers (e.g., Lear, American Axle, BorgWarner) serve the final assemblers (e.g., General Motors, Honda). Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, parts and finished vehicles flow freely among Canada, Mexico, and the United States, without tariffs or other restrictions. In Figure 1 , the parts suppliers are shown by circular dots and the auto assemblers with stars, including the two newest automaking plants: Toyota's Blue Springs, MS, facility and VW's plant in Chattanooga, TN. European and Asian automakers generally prefer to invest in lower-cost, right-to-work states in the South, and have primarily located their plants there during the past 25 years.", "Most modern assembly plants have \"supplier parks\" nearby. As foreign automakers established plants in the South, so too did major suppliers, broadening the auto industry's impact on local economies well beyond the traditional Great Lakes region. There are two major reasons for the close proximity of suppliers and automakers. According to a recent study, ", "first, motor vehicles and their main parts, such as seats, engines, transmissions and body panels, are large, heavy and sometimes fragile, which increase transportation costs. Second, the industry-wide implementation of \"lean\" production techniques and increasing product and module variety since the mid-1980s have kept parts production close to final assembly. Just-in-Time (JIT) parts deliveries that keep working inventories low and reveal defects quickly are an important element of lean production.", "JIT is a strategy and system of inventory management \"in which raw materials and components are delivered from the vendor or supplier immediately before they are needed in the manufacturing process,\" thereby cutting costs and reducing waste in the production process. ", "Not all parts require close proximity to the assembly operations, however. A recent report by researchers at MIT, Duke, and several other universities found that in the automotive sector, as in other industries, foreign direct investment and global sourcing of parts have increased significantly since the 1980s due to falling trade barriers. The authors also found that supplier firms are taking on more substantial responsibilities and operating globally. ", "It has been estimated that about one-fourth of all auto parts used in the United States are imported from Asia or Europe. This is particularly true of electronics, which are made of light-weight components and can be shipped quickly by air freight from Asia, while still meeting the needs of JIT assembly in normal times. The largest non-U.S. auto parts suppliers are in Japan, Canada, and Mexico. Among Japan's major exports of motor vehicle parts to the United States are tires, seat belts, air bags, bearings, fuel injection modules, exterior lighting (such as headlamps), and semiconductors. ", "It is important to note that the automotive supply chain is not fully global, as most vehicles are built in the regions in which they will be sold. As a result, the motor vehicle supply chain differs in important ways from supply chains for other manufactured products, such as electronics and apparel. Among key differences cited by the MIT/Duke researchers are:", "Assembly and parts production is regional and near major markets. Whereas a generation ago, those markets were primarily in Europe and the United States, economic growth in Asia has now spawned similar regional manufacturing of autos and parts in Japan, South Korea, southeast Asia, and China. Other consumer goods industries are more likely to be globally integrated, not regionally integrated, which allows their operations to be more concentrated geographically than is the case among automotive suppliers. The concentration of the auto industry in few companies in a few countries (11 lead firms in three countries of Japan, Germany, and the United States) has \"blunted the efforts to establish the sort of industry-level technical and business process standards that prevail in less concentrated industries.\" The authors contend that the small number of very large companies exerts influence over small firms, leading to less standardization that would possibly benefit the small manufacturers. In turn, the absence of industry-wide standards has led to the widespread customization of parts and vehicles. The researchers note that \"parts \u2026 tend to be specific to particular vehicle models in contrast to memory chips and microprocessors in the electronics industry and fabric and thread in the apparel industry.... Suppliers are often the sole source for specific parts.\"", "These unique elements of the auto supply chain have implications for final auto assembly when there are parts disruptions. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Technology Components Change Manufacturing Dynamics", "paragraphs": ["After the recent earthquake/tsunami and ensuing nuclear events in Japan, the auto parts supply chain, especially with regard to certain electronics, has been disrupted. Understanding the growing role of such electronics in vehicles provides a basis for appreciating the challenge for motor vehicle manufacturers. ", "For most of its hundred-year existence, the internal combustion automobile has run on the principles of mechanics, which have only recently been supplemented with a wide array of mechanisms that use electronic signals to operate certain parts of the car. For example, a car key that operates mechanically turns tumblers in the lock, which opens the door, and it performs a similar mechanical function in the ignition. With most of today's car keys, however, there is both a mechanical and an electronic connection: a semiconductor in the plastic key molding sends a signal to the car's computer, enabling the key to open the door mechanically and then similarly to start the ignition. A key without that chip would be unable to provide those functions, even if it had the correct grooves in the key blade. The computers that control the key and ignition access\u2014and hundreds of other functions in a car\u2014are called microcontrollers. ", "Electronics have been a growing element in auto design and manufacturing since the early 1970s, when the first OPEC oil price hike encouraged automakers to begin thinking about new technology applications. Electronic ignition was one of the first major innovations. In addition to aiding fuel economy and controlling emissions more effectively, electronics have also provided greater vehicle safety and many features once thought inconceivable in a motor vehicle. ", "It has been estimated that electronics comprised about 19% of vehicle cost in 2004, and that they may rise to 40% by 2015. Computing capacity has also grown: according to an engineer at Motorola, in just three generations, microcontrollers have become 100 times more powerful, and the number of transistors on the chip has grown 300 times. All vehicles manufactured and sold in developed countries have at least some level of computerization, even low-end models, which over time inherit electronic systems initially introduced into luxury vehicles. ", "Many critical automotive applications are now intertwined with electronics. For example:", "Electronic fuel injection replaced the carburetor, which mixed fuel and air prior to combustion. Electronic fuel injection uses an entirely different technology that forces the fuel under high pressure through small nozzles. A microcontroller apportions just the right amount of fuel needed by the engine. Airbags , which are now standard technology on all cars sold in the United States, are enabled by electronic sensors that measure the amount of sudden deceleration and inflate the air cushion. The microcontroller's job has grown more complex as airbags have been added throughout the vehicle, making deceleration calculations subject to more variables. Antilock braking system (ABS) prevents wheels from locking up (in a skid on ice, for example). Cars equipped with ABS have a dual braking system, including not only the traditional hydraulic brake system but also front and rear brake sensors and an electronic control unit. All-wheel drive (AWD) has been available on vehicles for decades, moving power from the engine to all four wheels and not just two, but current iterations of AWD harness electronics for traction control and to shift control between the front and rear axles. Global positioning systems (GPS) are electronic navigation tools that provide drivers with driving directions to their destinations. GPS can also transmit via satellite the location of a vehicle and track the direction it is moving and its speed, which can help locate the vehicle if stolen. Computer diagnostics are used to monitor systems throughout the vehicle and assist mechanics in diagnosing problems within the car. Microcontrollers check fluids, monitor tire pressure and temperature levels in various engine components, and communicate irregularities to the motorist. These computer diagnostics remove some of the guesswork in vehicle maintenance and repair. Hybrid vehicles employ electronics to manage the switch between the internal combustion engine and the electric motor. In all-electric vehicles, electronics manage the thermal controls that regulate the lithium-ion batteries' temperatures and communicate speed, battery discharge rates, and other information throughout the vehicle. ", "In some instances, the primary electronic control system is backed up with a redundant power system for safety reasons. For example, if a car's electrical system malfunctions, there is a special capacitor which kicks in to provide the electronic controls with the energy needed to inflate the air bags.

The ensuing shortages have affected all major automakers to varying degrees. ", "Specialty paints . Xirallic pigments were among the first automotive inputs to be affected by the Japan disasters because the only plant in the world that makes them, owned by Merck Chemicals International of Germany, is near the Fukushima nuclear reactor. According to the manufacturer, Xirallic pigments produce \"a stronger glitter effect than with all the other pigments. Lighter body color, greater color intensity and a more powerful luster are the advantages.\" ", "While the Merck Chemicals plant has restarted production, according to a news report, \"the shutdown of the plant affected many of the world's automakers, including Ford, Chrysler, Volkswagen, BMW, Toyota and GM. As a result, new cars the world over became a bit less shinier, dealers and carmakers lost markups.\" Chrysler announced to dealers in April that 10 paint colors for vehicles were temporarily unavailable. Ford placed a similar hold on some paint colors, stating that it was working on a replacement source which would enable it to resume production in June or July of vehicles painted in \"tuxedo black\" and three shades of red. Hyundai and Honda said they would replace Xirallic pigments with other chemicals.", "Electronics . Japanese electronics suppliers affected by the disaster include Renesas, Panasonic, Toshiba, and Hitachi. Renesas Electronics is one of the major global vehicle chip makers, producing as much as 40% of the world's supply of automotive microcontrollers at a plant disrupted by the earthquake. According to a New York Times analysis, ", "A reason for the industry's heavy reliance on Renesas is that it is the product of mergers involving three Japanese semiconductor companies. Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric merged their semiconductor operations in 2003 to form Renesas Technology. Then, last April [2010], Renesas Technology merged with NEC Electronics, the former semiconductor division of NEC, to form the current company, Renesas Electronics.", "The Renesas plant is expected to be out of commission until mid-June at the earliest and then, when it restarts production, will operate at only about 10% of capacity for an undisclosed period of time. It is transferring production to Renesas plants in Singapore and northern Japan, but that may take several months. It takes two months to manufacture the chips, meaning it could be at least four months before production meets demand.", "Another large vehicle chip maker is U.S.-based Freescale Semiconductor. Its Japanese plant near Sendai was so damaged that Freescale is not going to reopen it. Because so much of the auto industry's supply chain is customized for specific makes and models, parts like the microcontrollers that are suddenly in short supply are not easily found elsewhere. The software that instructs the chips in their functions is also not standardized, so even if an automaker could find a replacement chip quickly, it might not be able to communicate with the car's software programming. ", "Other Parts Issues. While some larger suppliers may reopen facilities soon, if smaller firms further up the chain remain closed, the larger firms will be unable to complete production. Some of these second- and third-tier suppliers have been affected by the power shortages and rolling blackouts that have been instituted in Japan since April, slowing their work. Others have yet to reopen. ", "An example of this domino effect is Keihin Corp., which supplies Honda with manifolds, engine control units, and other components. Four of Keihin's 11 plants were in the earthquake region, and although reopened, some of them are operating at less than 50% of capacity because several smaller suppliers have remained closed. This domino effect can also affect operations far from Japan: Keihin has five U.S. plants that have operated at capacity, but 10% of their components come from Japan, indicating a possible future supply chain problem if full Japan production cannot be resumed.", "Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp., USA, manufactures motorcycles and small off-road vehicles at a plant in Lincoln, NE. In March, it received a large shipment of faulty parts from a supplier in Japan. Because of the earthquake, the supplier had difficulty in replacing the parts quickly and Kawasaki laid off 115 employees. The plant hopes to be back to full production by the end of May.", "Toyota has indicated that some parts with rubber components are in short supply. To address that concern, Toyota's Tier 1 supplier, Denso Corp., is lending one of its plants to Fujikura Rubber, a smaller supplier whose plant has been closed by the earthquake.

Japan's motor vehicle manufacturing facilities are not concentrated in one area of the country, but are variously located on the main Japanese island of Honshu. Most production takes place southwest of Tokyo, far from the epicenter of the earthquake. Of the coastal area affected by the natural disasters, Nissan and Toyota operate assembly plants in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, respectively. ", "On May 10, the government of Japan announced that another nuclear plant would be closed because of its vulnerability to a future earthquake. The Chubu plant is more strategically located in Japan's auto-producing region southwest of Tokyo. Its closure will affect power available to half of Toyota's 18 Japanese plants, all four of Suzuki's facilities, and several Honda and Mitsubishi vehicle plants. Unlike the U.S. electric system, Japan's has two different cycle frequencies, making it difficult to move electricity from one part of the country to another. This has implications for manufacturers, because plant equipment is calibrated for either 50-Hz or 60-Hz cycles, and a manufacturer in the 50-Hz zone of eastern Japan cannot simply draw power from a supplier in the 60-Hz zone of western Japan.

The industry may seek to develop standards and diverse sources for certain parts so that in the case of future global supply chain interruptions, there will be alternative manufacturers for such components.", "The shortage of Xirallic pigments is a case in point, as they have been manufactured only in what is now the earthquake zone. A range of Japanese, U.S., and European automakers quickly found themselves without this important paint additive after the earthquake/tsunami.
