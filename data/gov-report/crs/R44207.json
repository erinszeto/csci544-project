Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; P.L. 93-406), a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation, which means that the person must provide the advice in the sole interest of plan participants. Thus, redefining the term investment advice could affect who is subject to this fiduciary standard.", "Regulations issued in 1975 define investment advice using a five-part test. To be held to ERISA's fiduciary standard with respect to his or her advice, an individual must (1) make recommendations on investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or other property, or give advice as to the value (2) on a regular basis (3) pursuant to a mutual understanding that the advice (4) will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions, and (5) will be individualized to the particular needs of the plan. DOL proposed broadening the term's definition to capture activities that currently occur within pension and retirement plans, but do not meet the existing definition of investment advice.", "The proposed rule would replace the current five-part test with a more inclusive definition. Table 1 in this report compares the current and proposed definitions. For example, under the current regulation, an individual must provide advice on a regular basis to be a fiduciary, which generally would not include recommendations on whether or not to roll over a 401(k) account balance to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). The expanded definition would remove the requirement that advice be given on a regular basis.", "Securities brokers and dealers who provide services to retirement plans and who are not fiduciaries under current regulations are not required to act in the sole interests of plan participants. Rather, their recommendations must meet a suitability standard which requires that recommendations be suitable for the plan participant, given factors such as an individual's income, risk tolerance, and investment objectives. The suitability standard is a lower standard than a fiduciary standard. Under DOL's proposed regulation, brokers and dealers could be considered fiduciaries when they provide recommendations to participants in retirement plans.", "In addition to broadening the definition of investment advice, the rule would provide carve-outs for situations that would not be considered investment advice. For example, providing generalized investment or retirement education would not be considered investment advice under the proposed rule.", "The proposed rule is accompanied by proposed prohibited transaction exemptions (PTEs) and proposed amendments to existing PTEs. These proposals would allow fiduciaries to continue to engage in certain practices that would otherwise be prohibited (such as charging commissions for products that they recommend or having revenue-sharing agreements with third parties).", "DOL first proposed broadening the definition of investment advice in October 2010. The proposed regulation generated much controversy and was withdrawn in September 2011. The revised proposals issued in April 2015 also have generated considerable controversy. Following the release of the proposals, DOL received public comments and held three and a half days of public hearings on the proposals.

This report also said that the CEA analysis does not attempt to quantify the benefits that brokers provide under current regulations.", "Among the points the RIA made in support of the proposal are the following: ", "The structure of the market in which retirement plans operate creates conflicts of interest that are not adequately addressed by current regulations. For example, a GAO report indicated that plan sponsors may be confused as to whether their advisers are subject to a fiduciary standard. Advisers that offer advice to plans regarding which investment options to include in their plans (platform providers) might have fee arrangements that create conflicts of interest. For example, a platform provider might have a revenue sharing arrangement in which the provider receives a commission when particular investment options are included in a plan. DOL has found enforcement challenges because it must demonstrate that an individual meets each element of the five-part test. For example, when a DB plan terminates, in order to guarantee participants' future benefits, the plan must purchase annuity contracts for each of the plan participants. However, the purchase of these annuity contracts would be a one-time event that does not meet the requirement for advice to be provided on a regular basis. An adviser providing recommendations on the purchase of the contracts thus might not be considered a fiduciary. IRA investors might be particularly vulnerable to advisers' conflicts of interest, even in the existing regulatory framework. The RIA indicated that IRA investors would see gains from the proposal of between $40 billion and $44 billion over 10 years and compliance costs would be between $2.7 billion and $5.7 billion over 10 years. The RIA also looked at changes to the investment advice regulation in Great Britain (which implemented new regulations on financial advisers in January 2013). Some have expressed concerns about the impact of the proposal on investors with smaller account balances. The RIA concluded that there had been little impact on the ability of small investors to receive advice.", "Some stakeholders have questioned the validity of the evidence in the RIA and claim that the RIA does not justify the adoption of the proposed rule. For example, in a comment letter to DOL, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) challenged the RIA's conclusion that mutual funds that are sold by securities brokers underperform relative to other mutual funds.

One reason for the concern is the large amount of funds that are rolled over from employer-sponsored plans to IRAs. According to ICI, in 2012, 87% of traditional IRAs were opened by individuals making rollovers from employer-sponsored plans. ICI indicated that in 2010, $288 billion was transferred from employer-sponsored pension plans to IRAs.", "A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2013 found that, upon separation from their employer, due to job change or retirement, individuals do not always receive recommendations that are in their best interest.
