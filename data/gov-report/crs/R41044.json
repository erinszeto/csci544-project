VA health care services are generally available to all honorably discharged veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces who are enrolled in VA's health care system. Based on a priority enrollment system, veteran enrollees are placed into priority groups. Under this system, VA decides annually whether its appropriations are adequate to serve all enrolled veterans. If not, VA may stop enrolling those in the lowest-priority groups. ", "The VA's health care system is organized into 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). In FY2009, VHA operated an estimated 153 medical centers, 135 nursing homes, 783 ambulatory care and community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), 6 independent outpatient clinics, and 271 Readjustment Counseling Centers (Vet Centers). VHA also operates 10 mobile outpatient clinics. ", "The VHA pays for care provided to veterans by private-sector providers on a fee basis under certain circumstances. Inpatient and outpatient care are also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA).

Beginning with the 1960s, Congress gradually expanded eligibility for outpatient care. Several research studies reported that a \"large proportion of VA hospital admissions in the mid 1980s and early 1990s were non-acute and could have been treated in an outpatient setting if ambulatory care services had been available geographically.\" Another study found that the \"lack of geographic access to VA outpatient care can lead to higher risk of readmission post-discharge.\"", "In the mid-1990s VA recognized that its system might want to respond to certain changes taking place in the private health care market and began a process of restructuring its health care delivery network. VA established regional networks (Veterans Integrated Service Networks [VISNs]) and decentralized certain budgetary authorities to these networks. Furthermore, advances in medical technology, such as laser and other minimally invasive surgical techniques, allowed care previously provided in hospitals to be provided on an outpatient basis. VA also began developing a strategy to expand its capacity to provide outpatient primary care, especially for veterans who had to travel long distances to receive care at VA facilities. To facilitate access to primary care closer to where veterans reside, VHA began implementing a system for approving and establishing CBOCs. In January 1994, the VHA hospital in Amarillo, TX\u2014now located in Childress, TX\u2014established what is generally recognized as the first VHA community based clinic. Prior to the establishment of this clinic, to establish a CBOC, a clinic had to have a workload of 3,000 visits or more and had to be located at least 100 miles or three hours travel time away from the nearest VHA hospital. In 1995, VHA issued a directive to eliminate these restrictions and to expand its network of CBOCs. New CBOC planning criteria were based on, among other things, (1) eligible veteran population, (2) services to be provided, (3) costs of available alternatives, and (4) sources of funds. The current process of developing CBOCs is discussed later in this report. ", "Since VHA initiated its CBOC initiative in 1995, over 700 clinics have opened. Figure 1 displays the number of active CBOCs for each fiscal year from 1999 through projected 2010. ", "Generally a CBOC is defined as a fixed health care site that is geographically distinct or separate from its parent medical facility. This site can be VA-operated, contracted, or a combination of the two; however, CBOCs are required to have the necessary professional medical staff, access to diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements to ensure the continuity of care for current and eligible veteran patients. A CBOC can provide primary care, specialty care, subspecialty care, mental health, and pharmacy benefits. It should be noted that services can vary from clinic to clinic.", "There are currently 783 active CBOCs throughout the United States and its territories, including American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Over 2.8 million patients were seen at CBOCs during FY2008. According to various studies conducted by the VA, CBOCs have been able to serve veterans in a more efficient and effective manner by improving access to health care services and providing high quality primary and mental health care.

In general, under contracted care the contactor refers veterans to the nearest VAMC for specialty care, extensive diagnostic work, and non-emergency hospitalization. Under the contract, VA requires the contractor to utilize the VA's Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) for documentation of all patient-related care, including clinical care provided, appointment management, completion of clinical reminders, requests for consultation, scheduling or ordering medications using the VA formulary, requests for prosthetics, and any other computer functions related to patient care. CBOCs are typically open a minimum of five days a week, for a minimum of 40 hours. These days and times could change based on the contract.", "When a CBOC contract is up for renewal, it is subject to review by the VA Central Office and approval by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. In addition to the description of the contract terms, the VISN or facility is required to submit an informational fact sheet to include justification for continued operation of the CBOC under a contract versus a VA-staffed model, and supporting demographic, utilization, and cost information.

Though CBOCs can be located in a variety of geographic areas, ranging from rural to urban, VA policies require that veterans receive a uniform standard of care at all VHA health care facilities to ensure continuity of care and quality for the veteran. For contract CBOCs, services must be comparable to services provided to veterans seen at VA-staffed CBOCs and must adhere to the standards set forth in VA regulations and policies. Generally these standards include, but are not limited to, quality, patient safety, and performance. ", "With regard to clinical indicators, the Office of Quality and Performance provides annual feedback on CBOC performance, including patient satisfaction surveys, preventive care, and clinical guidelines. In addition to timely administrative and clinical evaluations, all CBOCs are required to be integrated into their parent VAMC quality management program and meet the standards of The Joint Commission. By delegating quality assurance and quality improvement to individual VISNs, VA is able to assess CBOC compliance to evidence-based standards of care and to investigate further if facilities fall short of requirements or expected standards. During the CBOC performance evaluation process, VISNs may decide not to open a planned clinic or to close an operating clinic based on the CBOC's ability to accommodate veterans from the service area at a different community-based site, inability to contract care in the community, and/or inability to acquire adequate staffing or site accommodations. ", "Systematic reviews on administrative and managerial aspects of CBOCs are also conducted by the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG), as requested by Congress. The results and recommendations made by OIG are intended to ensure that CBOCs are \"operated in a manner that provides veterans with consistent, safe, high-quality health care in accordance with VA policies and procedures.\" Recent CBOC inspections, which have varied between sites, address a variety of areas, including ensuring patients' auditory privacy during check-in, examining CBOC access for disabled patients, measures to secure and protect health records, ensuring clinical competencies, monitoring collaborative practice of physician assistants, ensuring quality and safety standards with dispensing outpatient medications, providing oversight and enforcement in accordance with contract terms and conditions, and improving the physician privileges (and reprivileging) process, among other things.

One specific goal set by VA in transitioning from hospital-based care to outpatient care was to reduce the cost-per-user amount by 30%. In a recent study on the cost comparisons of CBOCs versus parent VAMC clinics, the total direct costs were lower for VA-staffed CBOC patients because of \"lower specialty and ancillary care costs.\" While this may be attributable to substituting primary care at CBOCs for expensive specialty and ancillary care at VAMCs, according to the authors of this study, this alternative is able to provide care at a lower cost than the traditional delivery model in VA Medical Centers. Table 2 illustrates the varying costs per patient for patients seen at a CBOC versus a VAMC primary care clinic.", "In 2000, a VA performance evaluation of CBOC costs and access found that VA-staffed CBOC patients had higher average direct costs per primary care visit than VAMC patients. This is attributable to a variety of factors, including CBOC providers practicing more resource intensive care, providing a greater range or different set of services to their patients than VAMC providers, and the need for improved access and convenience of primary care. When ancillary costs per patient per visit are included with direct primary care costs, CBOC patients had lower total care costs than those at VAMCs. Lower total direct costs for CBOC patients can be attributable to the physical separation of CBOC primary care and VAMC specialty clinics, additional procedural requirements for specialist referrals, better unmeasured general health, and possibly CBOC patients using non-VA services for a larger portion of their total care.", "According to VA, CBOCs may offer a cost-effective alternative to providing primary care at parent VAMC clinics while improving geographic access for veterans.
