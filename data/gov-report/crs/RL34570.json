The House has had nearly 220 years of experience with voting that manifests itself in precedents relevant today.", "The LRA contained two major departures related to record voting. First, it authorized development of an electronic voting system. Second, it allowed record votes in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, the form in which the House usually operates to consider amendments to legislation.", "Since the LRA's enactment, there have been notable developments in record voting procedures in the House. In general, the House through rules changes and precedents has limited votes that might be viewed as dilatory rather than substantive, and has expanded opportunities for votes that might be viewed as substantive. Changes in rules have also authorized the presiding officer to postpone and cluster votes and to reduce voting time to five minutes; largely ended pairing; and allowed Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole. Policy announcements by the Speaker and rulings by presiding officers have ended the correction of Members' votes; sought to limit the duration of votes; and dictated the manner by which Members may change a vote once cast.", "Controversies have arisen on occasion. Some were related to the use of the electronic voting system, some to Members being able to cast or change a vote after the 15-minute minimum voting-time had expired. Others were related to a perception that a vote had been \"held open\" beyond a reasonable amount of time. Only a very few controversies have resulted in an investigation. The Standards of Official Conduct Committee has made three investigations. A select committee is currently investigating the manner by which a vote was ended.", "Should the House wish to address rules, precedents, or practices, or the sources of particular controversies, it has a number of possible vehicles and potential options. Vehicles include House and party rules, the Speaker's policies, and administrative policies. Changes might be made to the electronic voting system, operations on the Speaker's dais, Members' ability to vote after the 15-minute minimum, and other aspects of voting in the House.", "Complementary analyses to this report may be found in CRS Report RL34366, Electronic Voting System in the House of Representatives: History and Evolution, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report 98-396, Guide to Individuals Seated on the House Dais, by [author name scrubbed].

Advocates also noted that oral roll calls consumed too much time as the House work load increased, and that changes in the LRA could further increase the number of roll-call votes. Some Members, having served in state legislatures, offered their experiences with automated systems as testament to the efficiency to be gained.

He stated that a Member could go to the Speaker's dais and obtain a \"red or green or amber ballot [card], just like we do now for a [recorded] teller vote.\" After the Member completed the ballot, a clerk would enter the Member's vote in the electronic voting system and the vote would be displayed in the chamber with the votes of other Members.", "The House also changed Rule VIII, cl. 2 related to the announcement of pairs.

Members shall have not less than fifteen minutes from the ordering of the roll call or quorum call to have their vote or presence recorded.", "Like the change to Rule I, cl. 5, this clause made voting by electronic device the customary system for conducting a recorded vote or a quorum call, and applied a 15-minute minimum time period to quorum calls as well as roll calls. The change also left it to the discretion of the Speaker whether to invoke a different, authorized manner of conducting a recorded vote or quorum call.", "Another change made by H.Res. 1123 altered Rule XXIII, cl. 2 to direct that a quorum call in the Committee of the Whole be conducted by electronic device \"under clause 5 of Rule XV,\" unless the chair of the Committee of the Whole invoked another procedure authorized under Rule XV.

I can say to the gentleman there is no plan for such a retrieval system.", "Mr. Ashbrook:...I think what is going to happen is that we are going to see the passage of one of the most time-honored traditions around this House. That is the system of putting pressure on Members to change their votes in the well. I think we have to be aware of the fact that a Member can vote and instantly leave the Chamber. I just asked the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hays] whether something can be done to equip the leadership with the proper tools, maybe a tracking device.", "Mr. Hays: That is really a leadership problem. It will be possible for Members to come into the back of the room and vote and go on their way.", "Mr. Ashbrook: That might help our processes.", "Representative Barber B. Conable Jr. stated that the current system discouraged Members from changing their votes, since the changes were reported. He asked whether the new system would lead to \"strategic maneuvering\" on close votes to allow a party's leadership to cloak from the other side \"where the votes are.\" Chairman Hays acknowledged the possibility and suggested several potential responses, including programming changes and having Members announce changes in the well of the House that would then be recorded. Mr. Conable also asked about the recording of Members' transactions with the electronic voting system. Chairman Hays responded that \"all actions,\" including changed votes, would be recorded, but that only a Member's final vote would be reported.", "Representative John F. Seiberling asked whether Members' names could be displayed so that Democrats' names were closest to the Democratic side of the chamber and Republicans' names were closest to the Republican side of the aisle. Chairman Hays indicated that it was indeed possible, but that it would be up to the Rules Committee and the House to make the decision to use a system different from the alphabetization of the House membership.

The two substantive departures from Speaker Foley's policy were, first, that Members in the well, not simply in the chamber, would not be prevented from voting, and, second, the Speaker would support the presiding officer in \"striving to close\" a vote at \"the earliest opportunity.\" He also indicated in remarks to the House following his election as Speaker that the House would attempt to hold votes to a 17-minute duration.", "Speaker Gingrich's policy was put to the test in a dispute over a vote on June 21, 1995. The ayes and noes stood at 213-214 when the chairman of the Committee of the Whole announced the result of a vote. Two Democratic Members, who reportedly intended to vote \"aye,\" were apparently rushing down the aisles into the well when the chairman announced the result. Pursuant to the Speaker's policy on the duration of votes, this vote had been open for about 17 minutes: the Republican leader the next day said 17 minutes and 10 seconds; two Democratic Members who had been prevented from voting said 16 minutes and 45 seconds; and the Democratic leader said other votes, including the vote following the disputed tally, were held open longer than 17 minutes to accommodate Members.", "The next day, June 22, Majority Leader Dick Armey stated that, after reviewing the videotape of the vote, \"it is quite clear that the Chair...was on solid parliamentary ground when he called the vote....\" He said the chairman had already stopped the announcement of the result to allow a Democratic Member to vote, that the well was empty of Members, and that a Republican Member subsequently arrived too late to vote and was unable to do so. Nonetheless, prior to asking unanimous consent in the House to vacate the June 21 vote in the Committee of the Whole and to allow a vote de novo, Mr. Armey explained why he was pursuing this course:", "...I know all too well that once the perception of unfairness and arbitrariness has set in, it is difficult to undo regardless of the facts of the matter. ...we should all, in each and every act of conduct, no matter how small, always put the honor and the dignity of this body ahead of the politics or even, for that matter the political subtlety of the moment.", "Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt stated that the Democrats' \"version of the facts is different\" from the majority leader's, but that what the majority leader was seeking to do was \"right.\" He stated that the Members \"were in the Chamber, were trying very much to get into the well....\" Representative Thomas M. Foglietta, one of the Democratic Members who sought to vote, said that a Member had cried out, \"One more vote, one more vote!\" as Mr. Foglietta passed him.", "Since there was no objection to the majority leader's unanimous consent request for a vote de novo in the Committee of the Whole, the Speaker ordered it and then reiterated his policy on voting by electronic device. The House later resolved into the Committee of the Whole and the amendment was agreed to, 220-204. (More information on the dispute over this vote appears below in the section Issues Related to Voting since 1970: Members Attempting to Vote .)", "At the convening of the 105 th Congress (1997-1999), Speaker Gingrich reiterated his policy. Later in the 105 th Congress, after consultation with the minority leader, the Speaker announced a \"reaffirmation\" of the policy, stating as well that the presiding officer would seek to close votes \"after no more than 17 minutes.\" The Speaker continued:", "Although no occupant of the chair will prevent a Member who is visible to the Chair before the announcement of the result from casting or changing his or her vote, each occupant of the chair will have the full support of the Speaker in striving to close each electronic vote at the earliest opportunity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "106th Congress to the Present", "paragraphs": ["In the 108 th Congress (2003-2005), a vote in the House was held open for approximately three hours.

The rules change to this clause added the sentence:", "A record vote by electronic device shall not be held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome of such.", "In furtherance of this rule, when Speaker Pelosi announced the policies of the chair for the 110 th Congress, she modified the policy on voting by electronic device. One phrase was deleted: \"each occupant of the chair will have the full support of the Speaker in striving to close each electronic vote at the earliest opportunity.\" In its place, Speaker Pelosi announced: \"Members will be given a reasonable amount of time in which to accurately record their votes.\"", "Parliamentary inquiries early in the 110 th Congress sought to clarify the operation of this new rules provision. One inquiry asked whether the outcome of the vote was the tally when voting time expired after 15 minutes. A Speaker pro tempore stated that 15 minutes was a minimum period and that on the first vote of the day \"a longer time may be necessary to complete the vote.\"", "In response to a different parliamentary inquiry, a Speaker pro tempore reiterated that 15 minutes was the minimum duration of a vote and that it was the \"responsibility of the Chair to see to it that each and every Member...who responds to the vote has a chance to record his or her vote.\" He said, \"After [15 minutes], it is in the discretion of the Chair in order to allow all Members a reasonable opportunity to vote.\" The Speaker pro tempore specifically addressed the new rules provision as follows:", "It is true under clause 2(a) of rule XX, a vote by electronic device \"shall not be held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome of such vote.\" In conducting a vote by electronic device, the Chair is constrained to differentiate between activity toward the establishment of an outcome on the one hand, and activity that might have as its purpose the reversal of an already-established outcome, on the other. The Chair also must be mindful that, even during a vote by electronic device, Members may vote by card in the well. So long as Members are recording their votes\u2014even after the minimum period prescribed for a given question\u2014the Chair will not close a vote to the disenfranchisement of a district whose representative is trying to vote.", "The language of this response, concerning the establishment as opposed to the reversal of an outcome, was used again in response to a parliamentary inquiry concerning the prevailing side. The inquiry occurred at a point some time after the minimum 15 minutes for voting. Members subsequently changed their vote, and the other side prevailed.", "Representative Lynn A. Westmoreland twice raised a point of order based on the new rule. On June 27, 2007, a chairman of the Committee of the Whole responded, \"The vote was kept open to do the numerical calculation to see if the votes of the Delegates would change the outcome.\" On May 8, 2008, Mr. Westmoreland received a more extensive response from a chairman of the Committee of the Whole to his point of order:", "The Chair has considered whether the new sentence in clause 2(a) of rule XX should be enforceable in real time. The black letter of the rule is not dispositive. It uses the mandatory \"shall.\" It might just as well say \"should,\" inasmuch as it is setting a standard of behavior for presiding officers. For this reason the Chair thinks it more sensible to enforce the rule on collateral bases, as by a question of the privileges of the House. A set of \"whereas\" clauses in the preamble of a resolution could allege the facts and circumstances tending to indicate a violation more coherently than they could be articulated in argument on a point of order or in debate on an appeal. The resolving clause of a resolution could propose a fitting remedy, rather than requiring the instant selection of a remedy in the face of competing demands for vitiation of the putative result, reversal of the putative result, or admonishment of the presiding officer. The Chair finds that the new sentence in clause 2(a) of rule XX does not establish a point of order having an immediate procedural remedy. Rather than contemplating a ruling from the Chair in real time, the language should be understood to establish a standard of behavior for presiding officers that might be enforced on collateral bases.", "A number of points of order and parliamentary inquiries in the 110 th Congress related to the new rule appear in Appendices C and D , respectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Members Changing Their Vote", "paragraphs": ["The parliamentarian's notes in the House Rules and Manual prior to the use of the electronic voting system explained when Members could change their vote:", "Before the result of a vote has been finally and conclusively pronounced by the Chair, but not thereafter, a Member may change his vote..., and a Member who has answered\"present\" may change it to \"yea\" or \"nay\"....", "When voting by electronic device began in 1973, Speaker Albert announced that voting stations would remain open until the presiding officer \"declare[d] the vote to be closed and announce[d] the final result,\" at which time the voting stations would be closed and the summary panel would indicate \"FINAL\".", "By the 94 th Congress (1975-1977), the Speaker implemented a new policy, to take effect September 22, 1975, disallowing Members from changing their votes by electronic device.

The rule obviously establishes 15 minutes as a minimum. Still, with the cooperation of the Members, a vote can easily be completed in that time. The events of October 30, 1991, stand out as proof of this point. On that occasion, the House was considering a bill in the Committee of the Whole under a special rule that placed an overall time limit on the amendment process, including the time consumed by record votes. The Chair announced, and then strictly enforced, a policy of closing electronic votes as soon as possible after the guaranteed period of 15 minutes.

As in recent Congresses, the cloakrooms should not forward to the Chair requests to hold a vote by electronic device, but should simply apprise inquiring Members of the time remaining on the voting clock. Members should not rely on signals relayed from outside the Chamber to assume that votes will be held open until they arrive in the Chamber. Members will be given a reasonable amount of time in which to accurately record their votes. No occupant of the Chair would prevent a Member who is in the Well before the announcement of the result from casting his or her vote.", "Appendix B.

Generally, Members try not to miss a vote, because it is an important demonstration to their constituents that they are always on the job. Procedural considerations suffuse voting, and thus it is important to understand the methods of voting in both the House and in the Committee of the Whole, where much of the chamber's business is conducted.", "In the House there are four ways for lawmakers to obtain a vote in the House. They are voice votes, division votes, yea and nay votes, and recorded votes.", "Voice Vote. This means that lawmakers call out \"yea\" or \"nay\" when a question is first put by the Speaker or Speaker pro tempore. As Rule I, clause 6, states, the Speaker will first say, \"Those in favor (of the question), say 'Aye'.\" Then the Speaker will ask: \"Those opposed, say 'No'.\" A voice vote can be quick and easy, but it is sometimes difficult for the Speaker to determine\u2014based on the volume of each response\u2014whether more lawmakers shouted \"aye\" compared to those who shouted \"no.\"", "Division Vote. Rule XX, clause 1(a), states that if the Speaker is uncertain about the outcome of a voice vote, or if a Member demands a division, the House shall divide. \"Those in favor of the question shall first rise from their seats to be counted,\" and then those who are opposed to the proposition shall stand to be counted. This procedure is reasonably accurate and takes only a few minutes, but it does not provide a public record of how each Member voted. Only vote totals (95 for, 65 against, for instance) are announced in this seldom-employed method of voting.", "Yea and Nay Vote. The Constitution (Article I, Section 5) declares that \"the Yeas and Nays of the Members...on any question\" shall be obtained \"at the Desire of one fifth of those present.\" Under this provision, it does not matter if a quorum of the House (218 Members) is not present to conduct business\u2014which the Constitution requires\u2014because any Member can say, \"Mr. Speaker, on that vote, I demand the yeas and nays.\" If the demand is supported by one-fifth of those present, the Speaker will say \"the yeas and nays\" are ordered.", "There is also an \"automatic\" yea and nay (or rollcall) vote provided in House Rule XX, clause 6. For example, if it is evident to a lawmaker that a quorum is not present in the chamber, he or she may object to a vote on that ground and, \"automatically,\" a vote will be ordered by the chair. To request an automatic vote, a Member says, \"I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\" The actual vote will then simultaneously determine both issues: the presence of a quorum and the vote on the pending question. Clause 10 of Rule XX also states that the \"yeas and nays shall be considered as ordered\" on final passage of a limited number of measures or matters, such as concurrent budget resolutions. The Constitution requires that votes to override presidential vetoes shall be determined by the yeas and nays.", "Recorded Vote. Under Rule XX, clause 1(b), if any Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner \"requests a recorded vote, and that request is supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum, such vote shall be taken by electronic device.\" (Yea and nay and recorded votes are all taken by electronic device\u2014employed since 1973\u2014unless the computerized voting system malfunctions; then standby procedures outlined in Rule XX, clause 2(b), are used to conduct the votes.) To obtain a recorded vote, a Member states, \"Mr. Speaker, on that I demand a recorded vote.\" If at least one-fifth of a quorum of 218\u2014or 44 members\u2014stand and support the request, then the recorded vote will be taken by electronic device. Recall that the distinction between recorded votes and the yeas and nays goes to the number of Members required to support each request: one-fifth of those present for the yeas and nays and one-fifth of a quorum (44 of 218) for recorded votes.", "In the Committee of the Whole. Three methods of voting are available in the Committee of the Whole: voice, division, and recorded. Yea and nay votes are not permitted in the committee, either the constitutional or \"automatic\" forms. In short, there is only one way to obtain a recorded vote in the committee\u2014where a quorum is 100 Members\u2014and it is outlined in Rule XVIII, clause 6(e). This rule of the House states: the \"Chairman shall order a recorded vote on a request supported by at least 25 Members.\" Thus, any Member may say, \"I request a recorded vote,\" and, if 25 lawmakers (the Member who made the request can be part of the tally, too) rise to be counted by the chair, the recorded vote will occur by electronic device. Alternatively, a lawmaker who plans to request a recorded vote even though few Members are present in the chamber will usually say, \"Mr. Chairman, I request a recorded vote and, pending that, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\" Once the chair ascertains that a quorum is not present, there is an immediate quorum call and the Member who requested the recorded vote can ask 24 other colleagues to support his request as they come onto the floor.", "Length of Time for Voting. Under Rule XX, clause 2(a), the minimum time for a record vote by electronic device is 15 minutes in either the House or the Committee of the Whole. The 15-minute period is the minimum, rather than the maximum, time allowed for the conduct of a recorded vote. The chair has the discretion to hold the vote open longer. A new 110 th rule states that votes are not to be held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome of a vote. However, this rule seems difficult to interpret in practice. There are also occasions in the House (see Rule XX, clause 9) when the Speaker has the discretion to reduce the voting time to not less than five minutes. The Speaker also has the authority under Rule XX, clause 8, to postpone and cluster certain votes. Votes in the Committee of the Whole may also be reduced to five minutes, as noted in Rule XVIII, clause 6(f).", "Appendix C.
