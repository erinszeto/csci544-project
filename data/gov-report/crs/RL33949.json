(Direct health impacts of noise are more difficult to determine.) Although the percentage of people affected by aircraft noise has been significantly reduced during the past 35 years by advancements in aircraft technology and noise abatement efforts, aircraft noise is often the principal focus for community groups and larger non-governmental organizations that oppose runway expansion.", "Despite improvements, noise continues to be a significant problem because", "the amount of air traffic is growing, the number of airliners and corporate jets is increasing, and airline traffic and noise is concentrated at a small number of airports that are also likely to be among the largest airports. An airport may use various approaches to address airport noise issues. Selected approaches, and challenges to implementing them, are summarized in Table 1 . Each approach is potentially eligible for federal funding.", "Ultimately, decisions regarding mitigation measures and operational changes are made by the airport authority in accordance with requirements of the state or local government; land use restrictions can be suggested by the airport authority, but are implemented entirely at the discretion of local government. The federal role is primarily to fund those efforts, establish aircraft noise limits, and fund research.", "Interested stakeholders have debated for a long time how funding dollars should be allocated. Airports are likely to prefer funding short-term operational and mitigation strategies to address immediate needs. Others argue that an increased proportion of federal funding should be directed toward research. For example, according to the NAS, the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) has set technically feasible noise reduction goals, but the level of funding for its research programs is too low to achieve the current goals on schedule or to remove noise as an impediment to the growth of aviation.", "For more information on airport noise requirements, see the \"Mitigating Aircraft Noise Through Policy and Technology\" section of CRS Report RL33698, Reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration: Background and Issues for Congress , by [author name scrubbed] et al., and CRS Report RS20531, Noise Abatement and Control: The Federal Role , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Quality Issues", "paragraphs": ["Airport operations include many activities likely to result in the discharge of pollutants to adjacent water bodies. Those activities include aircraft and airfield deicing and anti-icing, fuel storage and refueling, aircraft and vehicle cleaning and maintenance, and construction. These activities are regulated under provisions of the Clean Water Act (CWA).", "The CWA prohibits any \"point source\" (a discrete conveyance such as a drainage ditch, pipe, or other outfall) from discharging pollutants into waters of the United States. The primary mechanism for controlling pollutant discharges is through the administration of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, which is implemented, in most cases, by individual states. The NPDES permit program regulates discharges of stormwater and wastewater. Due to the nature of their outdoor operations and because airports are included in one of the industrial categories regulated under the NPDES stormwater permitting program (under the Standard Industrial Classification code \"Transportation by Air\"), all airports are required to have a stormwater permit. Airports that discharge other wastewater, such as from equipment maintenance and cleaning operations, require an additional NPDES wastewater permit.", "Discharges associated with stormwater often pose the greatest challenge to airport managers, because airports may be spread out over a wide surface area, with a majority of operations exposed to the elements. For example, the Dallas Forth Worth International Airport encompasses 18,000 square acres and has 62 stormwater outfalls. Controlling or monitoring every outfall is difficult.", "The primary method for controlling stormwater discharges is the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) that prevent or minimize the discharge of pollutants into a water body (e.g., construction of a stormwater retention pond to prevent stormwater drainage directly into receiving waters). BMPs appropriate for one airport are not necessarily appropriate for another. Factors that may affect permit requirements (i.e., appropriate BMPs), include", "the local climate (dry versus rainy/wet, cold versus warm); the type or size of adjacent water bodies\u2014pollutants are diluted depending on the size of the water body receiving the discharge (e.g., a creek or stream versus a river or ocean); the water quality of adjacent water bodies\u2014local permitting authorities consider existing pollutant levels when controlling airport discharges; and airport size.", "To comply with the Clean Water Act, most airport operators are particularly concerned about managing deicing chemicals and preventing oil spills."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Deicing and Anti-icing Activities", "paragraphs": ["With regard to water quality compliance issues, the management of deicing and anti-icing chemicals poses the greatest challenge to many airport operators. The deicing and anti-icing of aircraft and airfield surfaces is required by the FAA to ensure the safety of passengers. However, when performed without discharge controls in place, airport deicing operations can result in environmental impacts.", "Discharges from deicing operations have the potential to cause fish kills, algae blooms, and contamination to surface or ground waters. In addition to potential aquatic life and human health impacts from the toxicity of deicing and anti-icing chemicals, the biodegradation of propylene glycol or ethylene glycol (i.e., the base chemical of deicing fluid) in surface waters (e.g., lakes, rivers) can greatly affect water quality, including significant reduction in dissolved oxygen levels.", "Studies have also shown toxicological effects of deicer solutions that cannot be attributed to either propylene glycol or ethylene glycol. This has led to concern that these effects are attributable to unknown, proprietary additives. The environmental route and impact of these additives is not yet understood.", "Typically, airlines are responsible for aircraft deicing and anti-icing operations, and airports are responsible for the deicing and anti-icing of airfield pavement. The airport is ultimately responsible for managing the resulting wastewater. This responsibility is typically outlined in the airport's stormwater permit.", "As discussed above, significant differences exist among airport NPDES permits. For example, a local permitting authority may impose specific requirements, such as restrictions as to where deicing operations may occur, a requirement to use deicing collection units to vacuum deicing fluid prior to entering the storm water system, or requirements to use monitoring equipment to ensure compliance with the permit. Other permits may simply allow the airport to discharge deicing fluids directly into an adjacent water body.", "According to the EPA, the disparity in airport permitting requirements has led the agency to consider implementing national standards in the form of effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) for airport deicing and anti-icing operations. ELGs are national regulations for controlling wastewater discharges to surface waters. ELGs are technology-based and specific to an industry. ELGs applicable to airport deicing would be designed to provide uniform guidance for NPDES permit writers across the country, thereby establishing a baseline standard for all airports.", "In 2004, the EPA began to develop ELGs for airport deicing operations. Initial estimates from the EPA indicate that treatment technology and pollution prevention practices could potentially reduce deicing discharges from the current level of 21 million gallons a year to 4 million gallons a year.", "As stated previously, many airports have strict permit provisions that specify the management of deicing chemicals. Others have few controls. Those with few controls may be required to make capital improvements to comply with new permitting requirements. At this stage, cost estimates for the aviation industry as a whole are not available.", "The EPA is currently collecting survey data from airports and air carriers and conducting detailed sampling programs. The current work will be used to identify the best available technology that is economically achievable for treatment and discharge of spent deicing liquids.

These requirements are designed to ensure that facilities that store oil have planned for and taken measures to prevent environmental damage resulting from oil spills. An SPCC plan is required to include", "operating procedures intended to prevent oil spills, such as procedures to inspect tanks and associated piping for leaks; control measures installed to prevent a spill from reaching navigable waters, such as the construction of a dike, containment curb, or pit around a tank or tank farm; and countermeasures to contain, clean up, and mitigate the effects of an oil spill that reaches navigable waters, such as the presence of a spill clean-up kit with sorbent booms or wipes.", "As listed above, one of the primary control measures required under the SPCC requirements is the use of a secondary containment system for oil storage containers. Such a system must be large enough to temporarily hold the entire contents of the largest oil tank in the oil storage area, in the event of a breach in the system. For example, if a tank farm had four 12,000-gallon tanks and two 5,000-gallon tanks, and was the storage location for 10 mobile refueling trucks with 500-gallon tanks, the tank farm would be required to have secondary containment sufficient to hold the contents of the largest tank\u201412,000 gallons.", "When the EPA proposed new SPCC requirements in 2002, airport operators and the EPA disagreed about the secondary containment requirements applicable to mobile airport refueling trucks. In particular, airport operators argued that it was impractical to require mobile refuelers to provide secondary containment equal to the size of the tank because, during refueling operations, they would be expected to move to various areas of the airfield that could not be fitted with secondary containment systems.", "To address these concerns, the EPA amended the SPCC Rule to exempt mobile refuelers from specifically sized containment requirements. However, mobile refuelers remained subject to the general secondary containment requirements of the SPCC Rule (e.g., periodic testing of the container and piping).", "The EPA has extended the compliance date applicable to mobile refuelers (and for other new SPCC requirements) to October 31, 2009. This pending regulation may require airport operators to install necessary secondary containment mechanisms to comply with the regulation, in addition to meeting other SPCC requirements applicable to that facility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Air Quality Issues", "paragraphs": ["Airport emissions affecting local air quality come from both mobile and stationary sources, including the following:", "Aircraft.

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), subsequently established by the EPA, specify allowable concentrations and exposure limits for each of these criteria pollutants. A geographic area that meets the standard is considered to be in \"attainment\" for a particular NAAQS; areas that do not meet a standard are in \"nonattainment.\" A \"maintenance\" area is one that was previously in nonattainment but is currently attaining the NAAQS subject to a maintenance plan.", "The CAA requires states to develop a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to demonstrate how they will implement, maintain, and enforce the NAAQS. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the aviation industry as a whole makes a limited contribution to all criteria pollutant emissions nationwide. However, individual airports (particularly large airports in urban areas) may contribute significantly to local criteria pollutant levels. If an airport is located in a nonattainment or maintenance area, it may be required to change its infrastructure or operations to conform with provisions of the SIP, particularly if the airport is undergoing an expansion that requires approval from a state or local agency.", "Because aircraft emissions are a significant source of emissions at an airport, and largely outside the control of the airport, emission reductions will likely have to be made in operations or processes that the airport does control. For example, the airport ground vehicles may be changed to alternative fuel vehicles, some GSE may be converted to electrified systems, or older boilers and chillers may be replaced with more energy-efficient systems.", "Vision 100 included several provisions intended to reduce airport ground emissions at commercial service airports located in air quality nonattainment and maintenance areas.

In 2006, such aircraft represented a relatively small number of all operational turbojet aircraft under 75,000 pounds (approximately 1,330 or 13%). However, at some airports, particularly smaller commercial and general aviation airports, their use makes a disproportionate contribution to noise exposure contours. For example, the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) reported that at the L.G. Hanscom Field in Bedford, MA, non-Stage 3 aircraft accounted for less than 1% of the airport's annual traffic in 2005, yet were responsible for 23% of the noise energy produced by civil aircraft. Also, some airport operators have reported that between 50% and 80% of noise complaints lodged with the airport have been related to non-Stage 3 aircraft.
