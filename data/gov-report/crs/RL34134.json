While U.S. negotiators seek to eliminate barriers to U.S. agricultural exports, they also face pressures to protect U.S. producers of import sensitive commodities (i.e., beef, dairy products, sugar, among others). FTA partner country negotiators face similar pressures. One U.S. objective is for FTAs be comprehensive (i.e., cover all products). For the more import-sensitive agricultural commodities, negotiators have agreed on long transition periods, or compromised to allow for indefinite protection of a few commodities. In addition, because of political sensitivities for the United States or its partners, negotiators excluded sugar in the Australia FTA, tobacco in the Jordan FTA, and rice in the Korea FTA.", "Though food safety and animal/plant health matters technically are not part of FTAs, resolving outstanding disputes and reaching common understanding on the application of science-based rules to bilateral trade have directly affected the dynamics of concluding recent FTAs and/or the process of subsequent congressional consideration. One example has been the high U.S. priority to secure assurances that prospective FTA partners allow imports of U.S. beef in accordance with internationally recognized scientifically based rules.", "Most of the U.S. agricultural export gains under FTAs have occurred with Canada and Mexico, the top two U.S. agricultural trading partners. Though U.S. sales to overseas markets were expected to increase anyway because of population growth and income gains, analyses suggest that the FTAs recently put into effect or concluded since 2004 could boost U.S. agricultural exports by an additional 3.9% to 7.2%. Because of the reciprocity introduced into the agricultural trading relationship in those FTAs concluded with several developing countries that protect their farm sectors with high tariffs and restrictive quotas, U.S. exporters will benefit from increased sales. Net U.S. agricultural imports under these FTAs could be 1.5% higher than forecast.", "The share of two-way U.S. agricultural trade (exports and imports) covered by FTAs has increased from 1% in 1985 (when the first FTA took effect) to 41% in 2006 (reflecting FTAs with 13 countries). Ranked in order, they are Canada, Mexico, Australia, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, El Salvador, Singapore, Morocco, Nicaragua, Jordan, and Bahrain. If trade is included with nine other countries with which FTAs have been: approved but are not yet in effect (Costa Rica, Oman, and Peru); concluded and awaiting consideration in the 110th Congress (Colombia, Panama, and South Korea); took effect in 2007 (Dominican Republic); and may be concluded (Thailand and Malaysia)\u2014another 9% of U.S. agricultural trade would be covered.", "This report will be updated to reflect developments."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["In his State of the Union address on January 28, 2008, President Bush called upon Congress to approve this year pending free trade agreements (FTAs) negotiated with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.

For this reason, many U.S. policymakers since the mid-1980s have viewed negotiating trade agreements as a way to create opportunities to increase agricultural sales overseas, primarily by seeking to lower and/or eliminate other countries' trade barriers (e.g., tariffs and quotas). To accomplish this, the United States has had to reciprocate by lowering similar forms of border protection on farm and food products imported from prospective trading partners. Because of the import sensitivity of some U.S. commodity sectors (e.g., beef, dairy, and sugar, among others) to the prospect of increased competition from foreign suppliers, the executive branch has had to take the concerns of producers of these commodities into account during negotiations, in order to secure congressional approval of concluded trade agreements.", "The 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture negotiated under the structure of the multilateral institution that preceded the World Trade Organization (WTO) created substantial export opportunities for U.S. agriculture and agribusiness by partially lowering then-existing trade barriers worldwide. However, the U.S. FTAs that took effect with Canada in 1989 and with Mexico in 1994 (when both were combined into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)) were more ambitious than the Uruguay Round in reducing barriers to bilateral agricultural trade. With these two trade agreements setting into motion a process that removed many, or all, forms of border protection by the end of 10 or 15 year transition periods, respectively, Canada and Mexico became two of the fastest-growing markets for U.S. agricultural exports. During the period from the mid-1980s to 2001, the United States also entered into two other FTAs\u2014with Israel and Jordan ( Table 1 , top).", "Since 2002, the Bush Administration has pursued a strategy that emphasizes negotiating trade agreements on three fronts\u2014the multilateral, the regional, and the bilateral. This policy of \"competitive trade liberalization\" advocates using comprehensive bilateral FTAs as leverage to advance U.S. trade objectives in the multilateral WTO and regional (such as the failed hemispheric Free Trade Area of the Americas) trade negotiations, including those objectives laid out for agriculture (see next section).", "Applying this strategy under trade promotion authority, the Bush Administration since mid-2002 initiated FTA negotiations with 23 countries, and concluded agreements with 14 of them. Of these, Congress has approved eight FTAs with 12 countries. Agreements with 10 countries have gone into effect ( Table 1 , bottom). FTAs with three other countries (Costa Rica, Oman, and Peru) have been approved by Congress but not yet implemented for various reasons. Three FTAs await congressional consideration (Colombia, Panama, and South Korea). Negotiations with Malaysia are continuing despite the expiration of trade promotion authority (TPA), while talks with Thailand are suspended ( Table 2 ).

Achieving preferential access as much as possible to each other's market is the primary objective in negotiations, with the intent also to secure a competitive edge over third countries that sell into an FTA partner's market. Accomplishing this requires that negotiators work to reduce and eventually eliminate tariffs and quotas on most agricultural goods. Because the United States and each prospective FTA partner have some agricultural products that benefit from high levels of border protection, negotiators spend much of their time wrestling with how to transition these import-sensitive products towards free trade.", "The United States also has sought to address other non-tariff barriers (particularly those dealing with food safety and animal/plant health\u2014commonly referred to as SPS measures) on a separate, but parallel, track. Though U.S. negotiators assert that resolution of outstanding bilateral SPS disputes is not on the formal FTA negotiating agenda, press reports point toward negotiators on both sides seeking to resolve such disputes and using them as leverage to achieve other FTA negotiating objectives. Further, resolving these disputes is viewed as essential to ensure that FTA partners do not resort to using these barriers to undercut the openings created for U.S. exporters in market access talks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Market Access for Import-Sensitive Agricultural Products", "paragraphs": ["One U.S. objective in negotiations is that bilateral free trade agreements be comprehensive (i.e., cover all products). For the more sensitive agricultural commodities, negotiators generally agree on long transition periods before tariffs and quotas are completely eliminated. Recently negotiated FTAs, though, provide for indefinite protection for a few commodities. U.S. commodities that are protected this way include sugar in four FTAs and beef in the Australia FTA. Such protection takes the form of slowly-expanding preferential tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) and the retention of prohibitive tariffs on over-quota imports in perpetuity, the use of safeguards to protect against import surges, and special mechanisms to address unique situations (see \"Types of Provisions in U.S. FTAs that Apply to Agricultural Trade,\" below, for an explanation of these and related terms used in this report). Details on how these and other sensitive commodities are handled differ from one FTA to another, and are laid out in lengthy and complex tariff schedules and annexes to each agreement's agriculture chapter.", "For example, the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), the Peru FTA, and the FTAs with Colombia and Panama (still awaiting congressional consideration) allow the United States to cap in perpetuity the amount of sugar that enters. In return, DR-CAFTA allows Costa Rica to indefinitely limit imports of U.S. fresh onions and fresh potatoes, and the four other Central American countries to similarly treat imports of U.S. white corn. For the United States and CAFTA countries, the in-quota amount on only these specified commodities expands from 1% to 2% each year, while the prohibitive tariff on over-quota entries never declines. Similarly, while U.S. exporters received increased access to Morocco's wheat market, Morocco will indefinitely apply a quota and a prohibitive over-quota tariff on U.S. wheat. This new way to address the sensitivity of some agricultural products is unique in the FTAs recently negotiated by the United States, and apparently does not appear in other countries' FTAs.

However, NAFTA with Mexico (1994) resulted in bilateral free trade in all agricultural products, effective January 1, 2008.", "Many of the more recent FTAs negotiated by both the Clinton and Bush Administrations provide for long transitions to free trade for all but a handful of agricultural commodities and food products.

Though U.S. negotiators state that they do not view FTA negotiations as the forum in which to try to raise and resolve these disputes, parallel discussions on these SPS issues have affected the negotiating dynamics and the pace of concluding several recent FTAs. Also, the slow pace of movement by FTA partners in implementing side letter commitments reached on outstanding SPS issues has at times influenced the decision by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) on when to seek congressional approval of an FTA. Similarly, the same dynamic has influenced USTR's assessment of how to proceed to conclude an FTA or to complete the required legal steps before an FTA can enter into force. Members of Congress also have put the President and trade negotiators on notice that these issues must be dealt with before FTA talks conclude or congressional consideration proceeds. Examples of such developments are provided below in the country-by-country section.", "The controversies that have surfaced reflect the growing use by countries of SPS rules, intended to ensure food safety and protect animal and plant health, as disguised trade barriers. Trade experts have observed that as quota expansion has opened up foreign markets to agricultural imports, governments face pressure to protect domestic producers from increased competition using such non-tariff measures as SPS rules. Accordingly, U.S. policymakers have concluded that resolving outstanding SPS issues is important to the U.S. agricultural sector in order for exporters to be able to take advantage of the market access openings that new FTAs can create. Exporters also have signaled that the application of SPS rules must be science-based, transparent and predictable, so that they know what applies to them when selling products to FTA partners. Their view reflects each country's rights and obligations under the WTO's 1994 SPS Agreement, which lays out rules to ensure that each country's food safety and animal and plant health laws and regulations are transparent, scientifically defensible, and fair.", "Even though they are not technically on the agenda, two SPS issues have concerned U.S. negotiators in recent FTA talks with several countries. One U.S. objective has been to secure an FTA partner's recognition of the U.S. meat (beef, pork, and poultry) inspection system as equivalent to its own. Panama and some Central American countries had argued that their regulatory agencies be allowed to continue their policies of accepting meat imports only from those U.S. meat processing plants that their own food inspectors had approved. U.S. exporters argued that this practice stymied sales, requiring them to comply with multiple sets of rules that were redundant to the existing U.S. meat inspection system.", "Second, following the discovery of a cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease in Washington state in December 2003, many countries imposed bans on the import of U.S. beef. The United States asked the Office of International Epizootics (OIE) to review its response and the validity of measures already in place to mitigate the risks of this animal disease to humans and cattle herds. Along with Canada and Mexico, the United States earlier had asked this panel to reconsider its international guidelines for determining the risk status of countries with BSE, to better reflect the adequacy of a country's safeguards. This has involved U.S. regulatory agencies presenting extensive evidence to show that U.S. beef products are safe and that U.S. human and animal safeguards are effective. In negotiating the more recent FTAs, the United States pressed prospective partners (e.g., Colombia, Malaysia, Peru, Panama, and South Korea) to recognize U.S. measures taken to address the BSE issue as conforming with internationally recognized scientific guidelines governing meat trade, and to allow purchases of U.S. beef to resume. Similarly, some Members of Congress have stated that their support for the Korea FTA will depend on the measures South Korea adopts to allow U.S. beef imports to enter under the bilateral agreement reached in January 2006.", "To resolve these bilateral SPS issues, U.S. and FTA country negotiators have reached separate agreements or exchanged side letters that acknowledge prospective partners' acceptance of the equivalency of the U.S. meat inspection system and recognition of the steps the United States has taken to ensure the removal of beef parts that carry the risk of transmitting BSE. These frequently have stipulated the steps a partner will undertake to facilitate the entry of imports of U.S. meat products and/or commit a partner to allow U.S. beef certified as meeting specified standards to be imported by a specified date. Though these SPS side letters and agreements are not an integral part of FTA texts, the use of FTA negotiations as the opportunity to leverage resolution to longstanding SPS issues resulted in attaining market openings that would otherwise have taken much longer to achieve. For example, the United States succeeded in securing from Colombia, Peru, and Panama changes in their regulations to allow for the import of U.S. beef.", "The SPS chapter in each recent FTA reaffirms each partner's rights and obligations under the WTO's 1994 SPS Agreement to also be the basis for resolving SPS issues that come up in future bilateral trade. This text establishes a SPS standing committee to facilitate consultations on, and resolve, bilateral SPS problems as they arise. The Australia FTA went further, creating a Technical Group on Animal and Plant Health Measures to work to achieve consensus on the scientific issues behind a specific SPS dispute.

Concerned with the impact of free trade in sweeteners (sugar and HFCS), the U.S. and Mexican sugar producing sectors recently reached an agreement, to be proposed to their respective governments, to control the flow of sugar between both countries. Both sectors would adopt measures to limit sugar exports to the other country's market under specified conditions. U.S. sugar processors and growers reportedly are seeking to have these recommendations incorporated into the farm bill measure during conference committee deliberations. In response, U.S. HFCS manufacturers, some Members of Congress, and a food industry association have expressed concerns that such \"managed trade\" could lead to new Mexican tariffs and barriers on U.S. HFCS exports to Mexico, and \"would undercut\" NAFTA as commodity groups in both countries call for changes in other agreement agricultural provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Central American Countries and Dominican Republic23", "paragraphs": ["In the Dominican Republic - Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) approved by Congress in mid-2005 after heated debate, the United States and six countries (Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) agreed to phase out tariffs and quotas on all but four agricultural commodities and food products immediately or under one of six phase-out periods ranging up to 20 years.

The agreement made such treatment permanent. The most significant change is that DR-CAFTA grants additional market access in the form of country-specific preferential quotas to imports from the region of U.S. import-sensitive agricultural products (sugar, sugar-containing products, beef, peanuts, dairy products, tobacco, and cotton). These quotas will be in addition to (i.e., not carved out of) the existing agricultural TRQs established by the United States under current WTO commitments, which the six countries in varying degrees historically have used to export to the U.S. market.", "Drawing much attention during congressional debate were the agreement's sugar provisions which allow additional sugar from the region to enter the U.S. market.

This provision allows the United States to compensate the six countries for sugar they would not be able to ship under DR-CAFTA's preferential sugar quotas if the entry of such additional sugar is expected to undermine USDA's ability to administer the U.S. sugar price support program. This unique mechanism in U.S. FTAs (which applies only to sugar imported under DR-CAFTA and the FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and Peru) is structured to be activated and exercised at the sole discretion of the U.S. government.

Sugar producers and processors responded that USDA's pledge did not address their long-term concerns about the viability of the U.S. sugar program.

While Australia sought immediate and substantial openings for its beef and dairy products, the FTA provides for limited but growing access under quotas to the U.S. market over long transition periods. Quotas and high tariff protection on some dairy product imports will continue in place indefinitely. Negotiators also agreed to create a new mechanism to facilitate scientific cooperation between both countries to resolve bilateral sanitary and phytosanitary (animal and plant health) issues. Available analyses indicate that Australia's agricultural sector will gain more under this FTA than will U.S. agriculture, largely because of additional access to the much larger U.S. market for its most competitive food products. Because of the U.S. stance that longstanding SPS issues that limited U.S. pork exports to Australia be addressed before Congress considered the FTA, Australia's regulatory agency completed its assessment of the risks associated with such imports in May 2004.

While the durum wheat quota will expand slowly indefinitely, the common wheat quota will increase during the first 10 years and then be capped indefinitely beginning in 2015. In other words, while U.S. wheat will benefit from much improved access to the Moroccan market, a quota and a prohibitive over-quota tariff will always apply.

This reflected the interests of the US agricultural sector, which eyes much potential for further export gains, particularly in sales of higher-value food products to an expanding middle class. In 2006, South Korea was the world's 14 th largest agricultural importing country. At the same time, its agricultural sector is highly protected, reflecting the political influence of its farmers and the urban population's deep ties to its rural roots. South Korea's average applied agricultural tariff (2005) was 42%. Average applied tariffs are highest for vegetable products (over 100%); average tariffs for other broad agricultural product categories range from 8% to 23%. Tariffs on pistachios and walnuts are 30%, on pork between 22.5% and 25%, on poultry products from 18% to 27%, and on fruit juices from 30% to 54%. Also, Korea extensively uses TRQs to limit imports of rice, oranges, various dairy products, potatoes, onions, grains, and other agricultural products. For example, the over-quota tariff on soybeans is 487% (increased to 649% in 2006, if the import volume rose above a specified trigger level). The prohibitive over-quota tariff on barley ranges from 300% to 513%, on oranges is 50%, on corn for feed is 328%, and on milk powder is 176%. Though rice imports under a restrictive quota are subject to a 5% tariff, over-quota entries are prohibited (a unique concession that South Korea received during the Uruguay Round agricultural negotiations).", "In 2006, U.S. sales accounted for 25% of South Korea's $12.5 billion agricultural import market. However, the U.S. share of South Korea's import market has declined over the last decade, as China, Australia, and Brazil have expanded sales. In 2006, South Korea was the 6 th largest market for U.S. agriculture, with export sales totaling almost $2.9 billion.

USTR notes that most of the remaining agricultural tariffs and quotas will be phased out within 10 years after taking effect. In particular, Korea agreed to phase out tariffs, quotas, and safeguards on all but seven agricultural products under 12 phase-out periods ranging up to 23 years. Seasonal provisions would apply to U.S. sales of oranges, table grapes, and potatoes for chipping. Tariffs on many fruits, vegetables and food products would be eliminated in two or five years. Tariffs on the more sensitive commodities (e.g., beef, in-season potatoes for chipping, pears, apples, in-shell walnuts, and in-season grapes) would be phased out in15 to 20 years. Tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) also with long phase-out periods (10 to 18 years) would apply to such other sensitive products as cheeses, butter, dairy-based infant foods, barley, whey for food use, animal feed supplements and hay, corn starch, and ginseng.", "USDA notes that these TRQs lock in access that South Korea could have easily changed under its multilateral trade commitments. Slowly-expanding quotas would apply in perpetuity on imports from the United States of skim and whole milk powders, evaporated milk, in-season oranges, potatoes for table use, honey, and identity-preserved soybeans for food use. Unique to this FTA, South Korea secured the right to specify the state entities and trade associations that would administer each TRQ under either an auction or licensing system. Safeguards (e.g., applying special add-on tariffs in case of import surges) would be triggered if imports from the United States of some of these and other agricultural products exceed specified levels. Korea succeeded in excluding rice from the agreement\u2014its main objective in negotiating agricultural issues. This outcome reflected the prevailing view that rice is vital to maintaining, and inseparable from, Korea's national identity, and the political reality that rice farming preserves the basis for economic activity in the countryside. However, the United States will continue to be able to take advantage of rice quota access under South Korea's multilateral WTO commitments. Though South Korea would eliminate its tariffs on beef in 15 years, the terms of access for U.S. beef into Korea's market (related to Korean concerns over the perceived risk of introducing mad cow disease) remain unsettled.

Korea imposed this ban on December 27, 2003, after a Canadian-born cow in Washington state tested positive for BSE, or mad cow disease. To address concerns on the potential risk to human health associated with this disease, the United States took regulatory measures to try to reassure all of its trading partners that U.S. beef was safe. U.S. officials also engaged in intensive policy level and technical discussions with Japan, South Korea and other major beef importers seeking to resume sales. Not until about two years later (January 13, 2006) did bilateral talks on the terms of resuming beef trade result in an agreement on the conditions under which South Korea would lift its ban on U.S. beef by late March 2006. The United States had signaled this step was necessary before FTA negotiations, launched on February 2, 2006, could begin.", "In the February 13, 2006 protocol, South Korea agreed to allow imports of U.S. boneless beef slaughtered from cattle less than 30 months old, from U.S. slaughter and packing plants approved by its inspectors. This agreement allowed Korea to ban cattle parts classified as \"specified risk materials\" and of bone parts (including those attached to meat), and to impose an outright ban if another U.S. mad cow case occurred. Following fact-finding trips by Korean experts and the occurrence of another U.S. case of mad cow disease, South Korea only partially lifted its ban on September 8, 2006. It announced entry for imports of U.S. boneless beef products from cattle under 30 months of age. However, imports of U.S. bone-in beef and beef from cattle over 30 months old remained banned. U.S. exporters tested Korea's opening with three shipments of U.S. boneless beef in November and December 2006. However, South Korea rejected these shipments because of the presence of a few small bone fragments. As a result, an impasse over the agenda to be followed to address not only this technical matter but the scope of beef access issues began to affect the FTA negotiating process. Though USTR officials publicly continued to state that this issue was distinct from the FTA talks, Members of Congress and Administration officials signaled to Korea that there was a linkage and that a resolution was critical to concluding an FTA by the TPA-set deadline. High-level discussions continued through March 2007, with President Bush raising the beef issue with his counterpart one day before the first of three deadlines set to conclude FTA negotiations. However, the talks concluded on April 1 without any resolution. The only commitment was made the next day, when in a nationwide address, South Korea's President Roh Moo-hyun stated he had personally promised President Bush that his government would \"uphold the [yet-to-be-released] recommendations\" of the OIE and \"open the Korean [beef] market at a reasonable level.\" On May 22, 2007, the OIE formally found that the United States is a \"controlled risk\" country for the spread of mad cow disease. This means that internationally-recommended, science based measures are in place to effectively manage any possible risk of BSE in the U.S. cattle population. USDA Department of Agriculture (USDA) immediately requested South Korea to amend its import requirements for U.S. beef within a specified time frame to reflect this risk determination and to reopen its market to all U.S. cattle and beef products. In response, South Korea's animal health regulatory agency began an 8-step process to assess the BSE risks of the U.S. beef sector in light of the OIE finding, with the intent to negotiate a revised bilateral agreement that would lay out import rules applicable to U.S. beef. Initial expectations were that this process would be completed by late September 2007. However, the discovery of prescribed risk materials in some boxes of U.S. beef (see below) and the South Korean government's apparent desire to defer negotiations until after the December 19 th presidential election suggest a revised agreement on beef import rules might not be finalized at the earliest until spring 2008.", "Against the backdrop of these developments, U.S. boneless beef exports to South Korea nevertheless resumed. From late April through early October 2007, Korea's regulatory agency inspected and cleared for retail sale most U.S. boneless beef shipments, applying its interpretation of the January 2006 agreement. Even with partial-year exports, South Korea ranked as the 4 th largest market for U.S. beef through September 2007. With a third discovery of bone and/or spinal matter in a box of packaged beef, South Korean authorities announced on October 5, 2007 they would not conduct any more inspections of U.S. beef shipments until both sides conclude formal negotiations to revise the 2006 protocol. In an effort to move toward that goal, bilateral technical-level talks held October 11-12, 2007, failed to bring both sides closer to an agreement. South Korean officials sought rules that are reportedly more strict than OIE guidelines, intended to reportedly correct four shortcomings in the U.S. measures taken to limit BSE risks. The U.S. stance is that current rules already meet OIE standards.", "In formal negotiations (which have not yet been scheduled), the United States is expected to continue to press for full access in one step for U.S. beef. This would mean expanding the scope of the 2006 agreement to also include exports of bone-in beef and coverage of all U.S. beef from cattle regardless of age, as long as BSE-risk materials are removed during processing. South Korea's trade minister on November 9, 2007, signaled that his government instead prefers a \"two-phased\" approach to a full opening, claiming this could help persuade the public to more easily accept U.S. beef. The first step would be to allow imports of both boneless and bone-in (rib) beef cuts from U.S. cattle less than 30 months old, as long as risk materials are removed following OIE's guidelines. The minister argued this would give the United States about 80% of its market share before the late 2003 restrictions took effect.

The amendment required the executive branch to ensure that Peru has taken necessary steps to meet its obligations on SPS measures and technical barriers to trade by the time the FTA takes effect.

Panama also agreed to establish preferential TRQs for U.S. pork, chicken leg quarters, specified dairy products, corn, rice, refined corn oil, dried beans, frozen french fries, fresh potatoes, and tomato paste. The longest transition period (20 years) will apply to rice, Panama's most sensitive agricultural commodity. However, it agreed to increase tariff-free access for U.S. rice if needed to cover a shortfall in domestic output. Tariffs on imports of most other U.S. agricultural products would be phased out within 15 years.", "Almost all of Panama's agricultural exports to the United States already enter duty free under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and Generalized System of Preference trade preference programs. Of U.S. commodities subject to quota protection, much attention focused on the additional access granted to sugar from Panama. The United States agreed to create three preferential TRQs for sugar and sugar-containing products. The largest duty-free TRQ (6,000 MT for raw sugar) will expand by 60 MT (1%) annually for 10 years and then be capped at 6,600 MT indefinitely; all sugar product over-quota tariffs will remain indefinitely at current high levels. These quotas in the aggregate represent most of the sugar surplus that Panama traditionally has available to export each year. This FTA also includes a sugar compensation provision similar to that found in DR-CAFTA. Other U.S. preferential TRQs were established for cheeses, condensed and evaporated milk, and ice cream, to be phased out completely in 15 to 17 years.", "In the separate SPS agreement, Panama agreed to accept the U.S. meat and poultry inspection system \"as equivalent to its own.\" This means that all facilities that USDA certifies as meeting food safety standards to produce for the U.S. market are eligible to export meat products, and do not need further inspection by Panama. The SPS agreement also commits Panama to provide access for all U.S. beef and poultry, and related products, on the basis of accepted international standards. It also streamlines import documentation requirements for U.S. processed foods and affirms Panama's recognition of the U.S. beef grading system.

In particular, U.S. agricultural trade with those FTA partners that have benefitted from a long period of preferential access to the United States will quickly take on a more reciprocal character. As their trade barriers to imports of U.S. agricultural products are reduced, U.S. agriculture and agribusiness exporters, where they have a competitive edge over other countries in these markets, will be able to take advantage of sales opportunities. At the same time, some U.S. commodity sectors will face competition from increased imports under these FTAs. The degree of such competition will be mitigated by negotiated long transition periods and by likely continued growth in U.S. demand for such products due to population growth. Looking ahead, as transition periods to free trade for the more sensitive agricultural products near their end, disputes are likely to arise. This has been the case under NAFTA for several agricultural products, as free trade loomed, or actually took effect, and led affected producers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States to seek relief from the impacts of increased imports.", "Reflecting this outlook, most U.S. agricultural commodity groups, agribusiness and food manufacturing firms have supported these recently negotiated FTAs, looking to benefit from preferential and guaranteed increased access to these markets. The largest general farm organization\u2014the American Farm Bureau Federation\u2014has supported all of these FTAs but did not expect the agreement with Australia to result in an overall net gain for U.S. agriculture. The Farm Bureau views these trade agreements as the best way to reduce foreign barriers and expand export opportunities or face the prospect of reduced domestic farm production. The two leading national cattlemen trade organizations have held similar, but at times, differing positions on the beef provisions in certain FTAs, in large part due to the different geographic base of their membership.", "Opposition to FTAs has come from those U.S. commodity groups concerned with the impact of increased competition from foreign producers. The extent of opposition has varied by agreement, depending upon the sensitivity of increased imports from each FTA partner, the length of transition periods, and whether special provisions are included to provide some measure of long-term protection. Such groups represent producers and processors of sugar, cotton (initially with respect to DR-CAFTA), and certain processed vegetables. Another general farm organization\u2014the National Farmers Union (NFU)\u2014opposed DR-CAFTA. The NFU views other trade agreements as forcing U.S. producers to compete unequally with farmers from FTA partner countries, who have a cost of production advantage because they are not required to meet the same labor and environmental standards.", "Taking into account this mix of support and opposition to FTAs found in the agricultural and related food sectors, U.S. trade negotiators have sought to craft bilateral trade agreements keeping in mind the political realities involved in securing final congressional approval. It reflects a USTR FTA negotiating strategy to limit U.S. trade concessions on U.S. sensitive agricultural commodities in order to minimize opposition in Congress on any concluded agreement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Methodologies Used to Estimate Changes in U.S. Agricultural Trade Under FTAs", "paragraphs": ["The projections developed to illustrate expected changes to U.S. agricultural exports and imports as these FTAs are implemented vary significantly, because of the different analytical approaches used to derive them. What is common in the simulations developed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) and the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) is that they seek to present what would happen to U.S. agricultural trade under each FTA compared to a \"baseline\" that represents what each expects such trade would be without an agreement. Their approaches, however, differ in the scope of analysis undertaken and in how each handles the timing of full implementation of an FTA's agricultural trade liberalization provisions. These differences, in turn, largely explain the difference in estimates in the change in U.S. agricultural exports and imports attributable just to these agreements ( Table 7 ). The USITC employs a multi-country and multi-commodity/services sector econometric model to quantify what the broad and sectoral impacts of FTA market access provisions would mean for the entire U.S. economy. The AFBF also uses an econometric model, but employs a narrower methodology to examine what only happens to each FTA partner's main agricultural commodity sectors as border protection is eliminated. It then quantifies the resulting demand that would be met with increased agricultural imports from the United States.", "Another significant difference is that the USITC assumes all FTA provisions are fully implemented and its full effects felt immediately (i.e., in the first year that an agreement takes effect). In other words, the U.S. economy is no different in this first year from what it is in the baseline\u2014with the same population, resources, and other economic characteristics. By contrast, the AFBF projects the change in an FTA partner's agricultural trade with the United States at a point during, or at the end of, long transition periods. This is derived by looking at the impact of adjustments expected to occur in each country's agricultural sector (as trade liberalization takes effect over time), population growth, and assumed higher economic growth and per capita incomes associated in part because of its FTA with the United States. Because USITC analyses do not take into account that the more significant agricultural provisions in an FTA are staged in over long periods (up to 20 to 25 years), nor that income levels and population likely will grow over time, its projections probably understate the magnitude of the change in U.S. agricultural exports and imports attributable to these agreements. The Farm Bureau's estimates may overstate the magnitude of the projected higher level of U.S. agricultural exports, because of overly optimistic assumptions on the potential future U.S. market share for key agricultural commodities in some FTA partner countries.", "For more information, please see the following CRS products:", "CRS Report RL33463, Trade Negotiations During the 110 th Congress , by [author name scrubbed]", "CRS Report RL33743, Trade Promotion Authority (TPA): Issues, Options, and Prospects for Renewal , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]", "CRS Report RL31356, Free Trade Agreements: Impact on U.S. Trade and Implications for U.S. Trade Policy , by [author name scrubbed]"], "subsections": []}]}]}}
