Although the absence of the additional IG Act language regarding political affiliation and appointment based only on job qualification skills does not change the legal protections that the IG Act and EESA afford to the SIGTARP, the SIGTARP may be less independent than other IGs as a practical matter, given that the SIGTARP is not subject to the same appointment constraints.", "The nomination of a SIGTARP was required \"as soon as practicable\" after the establishment of the TARP and the Troubled Assets Insurance Financing Fund. The SIGTARP nominee appeared in hearings before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance in November, although the Finance Committee hearing was not an official nomination hearing. A Senate standing order approved on January 9, 2007, provided for sequential referral for a nomination to an \"Office of Inspector General\" to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee after proceedings in the committee with primary jurisdiction over the \"department, agency, or entity.\" That order did not refer to special IGs, however, and both SIGIR and SIGAR are not Senate-confirmed positions, so there was no controlling precedent for the nomination of a special IG prior to the SIGTARP's nomination.

The IG Act does not explicitly define the meaning of \"general supervision\" and its legislative history does not appear to address the scope of the agency head's supervisory role. A court case relying on the legislative history of the IG Act described the agency head's supervisory authority over the IG as \"nominal.\" Instead, under one interpretation of the SIGTARP's duties and responsibilities, discussed below, the SIGTARP will report only to Congress and not the agency head. This reporting arrangement would be unique among statutory IGs. Additionally, as discussed further below in the section entitled \"EESA Authority to Conduct Investigations and Audits,\" the SIGTARP will have complete discretion in pursuing audits and investigations, and in issuing subpoenas. The SIGTARP appears to possess greater latitude in pursuing audits and investigations than the Treasury IG, as the Treasury IG is one of six IGs that may be prevented by an agency head from initiating, carrying out, or completing an audit or investigation, or from issuing a subpoena, for specified reasons such as preventing disclosure of national security matters.", "In contrast to the SIGTARP, the other special IGs report to, and are supervised by, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense.

Yet it appears more likely that \u00a7 121(c)(3)'s reference to duties and responsibilities may be limited to those under \u00a7 4 of the IG Act, which is entitled \"Duties and responsibilities; report of criminal violations to Attorney General.\"", "The provision that grants the SIGTARP the same duties and responsibilities as those of IGs under the IG Act also appears in the acts that created SIGIR and SIGAR. This provision seems to bridge some, but not all, of the differences between the authorities of the special IGs and IGs created under the IG Act.

That section provides that IGs are \"to provide policy direction for and to conduct, supervise, and coordinate audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of such establishment.\" Since the provisions creating the SIGTARP contain specific language with regard to conducting, supervising, and coordinating audits and investigations, and this specific language does not mention \"policy direction,\" this provision of the IG Act would not seem to be included in the duties mentioned in \u00a7121(c)(3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SIGTARP Reports", "paragraphs": ["If the SIGTARP's duties and responsibilities are interpreted to be confined to those in \u00a7\u00a04 of the IG Act, the above cross reference to \"the reports required by section 5\" in \u00a7\u00a04(a)(5) of the IG Act appears to subject the SIGTARP to the IG Act \u00a7 5 reporting requirements as well. However, it is not clear as to whether the SIGTARP would need to submit the reports in \u00a7 5 of the IG Act in addition to the reports required in EESA or whether the SIGTARP would only be responsible for the required reports set forth in EESA.", "For example, \u00a7 5(d) of the IG Act requires establishment IGs to immediately report \"particularly serious or flagrant problems, abuses, or deficiencies\" to the head of the establishment whenever the IG becomes aware of such issues. The head of the establishment then must send the report to the appropriate congressional committees within seven days, along with the establishment head's comments in his or her own report. Since EESA requires the SIGTARP to report to Congress only, and not to an establishment head, it is not clear if the SIGTARP would be required to comply with those reporting requirements in \u00a7 5(d) of the IG Act. If EESA is interpreted to include the reporting requirements in \u00a7 5 of the IG Act, then the SIGTARP could be required to submit certain reports to the establishment head, which would appear to be the Secretary of the Treasury, as TARP itself has not been designated an establishment.", "EESA \u00a7 121(f) specified certain reporting requirements for the SIGTARP, including a report 60 days after the SIGTARP's confirmation by the Senate and every calendar quarter thereafter. P.L. 111-15 amended this provision to require the SIGTARP to submit reports to the appropriate congressional committees no later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, instead of each 120-day period after the initial 60 day report following the SIGTARP's confirmation.

Alternatively, the IG Act \u00a7 5 reports could be required in addition to the reports set out in EESA.", "There is no explicit requirement in EESA that the Treasury Secretary (or anyone else) be allowed to comment on the reports that the SIGTARP submits to Congress. Although there may be other reporting requirements with respect to TARP, they would not be intended to respond to SIG concerns or criticisms. SIGAR and SIGIR have such requirements enabling the Secretaries of State and Defense to submit comments to the appropriate congressional committees, as well as requirements that the reports be made public, and even published on a website. The IG Act also provides that the head of the establishment must make the semiannual IG reports and the semiannual establishment head reports available to the public, on request, within 60 days of the establishment head's transmission of the reports to the appropriate congressional committees.", "P.L. 111-15 added a provision requiring the Treasury Secretary to \"take action to address deficiencies identified by a [SIGTARP] report or investigation,\" or to certify to the appropriate congressional committees \"that no action is necessary or appropriate.\" Additionally, P.L. 111-15 required a September 1, 2009, report to Congress \"assessing use of any funds, to the extent practical, received by a financial institution under the TARP.\" Such a report would be publicly available on the SIGTARP's website \"within 24 hours after the submission of the report.\" P.L. 111-15 also required all reports submitted by the SIGTARP to be publicly available, with exceptions prohibiting public disclosure of certain information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Whistleblower Protections", "paragraphs": ["It is important to note that EESA \u00a7 121(c)(3) will not necessarily encompass the whistleblower protections in \u00a7 7 of the IG Act.

Under the IG Act, not every complaint must be investigated, and the IG has discretion in accepting complaints from individuals other than employees. However, it appears that IGs are willing to accept complaints from anyone, not just employees, and the legislative history of the IG Act does not prohibit IGs from receiving and acting on information or complaints from any source. On a related note, EESA provides that the Financial Stability Oversight Board, as established by the legislation, will be responsible for \"reporting any suspected fraud, misrepresentation, or malfeasance\" to the SIGTARP or the Attorney General.", "However, a whistleblower with information concerning the possible existence of illegal activities or mismanagement regarding the purchase or insurance of troubled assets could conceivably be covered by the IG Act \u00a7 7 protections if he or she reported the information to the Treasury IG, as opposed to the SIGTARP. The acts that created SIGIR and SIGAR do not contain whistleblower protections either.", "In view of the fact that the current TARP approach is concentrating on banking concerns, it is interesting to note that federal law providing whistleblower protection to employees of insured depository institutions and federal banking agencies applies only to information turned over to federal banking agencies or the Attorney General."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resources and Law Enforcement Authority", "paragraphs": ["Section 121(d) of EESA states that the SIGTARP will have the authorities of \u00a7 6 of the IG Act, which provides in subsection (c) that the head of an establishment must give the IG office within the establishment adequate office space, equipment, supplies, and other services. It could be argued that the Secretary of the Treasury is the head of the establishment in which the TARP is located, as \u00a7 11(2) of the IG Act defines \"establishment\" to include the Treasury.

However, Congress recently provided SIGIR with temporary employment authority that follows the authority granted to temporary federal organizations. Employees in such temporary federal organizations are excepted from competitive civil service rules in title 5, United States Code regarding appointment, pay, and classification.

Only a provision in a statute could officially order an IG investigation or audit.

The IG's ability to \"have access to all records\" indicates that the IG's investigative and audit powers extend into the private sector and to individuals outside the agency, for instance, when the IG audits contracts with industry or investigates suspected fraud in agency purchases or other wrongdoing by private individuals in connection with agency operations and programs.", "The SIGTARP retains these powers as well, as EESA \u00a7 121(d) provides that the SIGTARP \"shall have the authorities provided in section 6 of the Inspector General Act of 1978.\" As a result, it appears that the SIGTARP would be able to access records of third-parties that participate in the TARP program and that relate to EESA funds. However, additional legislation could make the SIGTARP's authority in this area more explicit.

Without the power necessary to conduct a comprehensive audit of these entities, the Inspector and Auditor General could have no serious impact on the way federal funds are expended....", "The committee does not believe that the Inspector and Auditor General will have to resort very often to the use of subpoenas. There are substantial incentives for institutions that are involved with the Federal Government to comply with requests by an Inspector and Auditor General.

In United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit noted that the IG Act facilitates the IG's auditing and investigative functions by giving \"each Inspector General access to the agency's documents and agency personnel.\" The court held that four proposals by a union \"regarding procedures to be followed during investigatory interviews of the agency's employees by the Inspector General\" were not consistent with the IG Act because \"Congress intended that the Inspector General's investigatory authority include the power to determine when and how to investigate.\" To grant the union's proposals regarding interviews \"would directly interfere with the ability of the Inspector General to conduct investigations.\"", "The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit echoed the Fourth Circuit's remarks regarding IG independence in United States Department of Justice v. FLRA .

As far as the IG [Act] is concerned, NASA-OIG's investigators are employed by, act on behalf of, and operate for the benefit of NASA.\" The Court also noted two limitations of the IG Act: (1) it \"grants Inspectors General the authority to subpoena documents and information, but not witnesses,\" and (2) \"[t]here may be other incentives for employee cooperation with OIG investigations, but formal sanctions for refusing to submit to an OIG interview cannot be pursued by the OIG alone.\" Rather, the OIG may request assistance from the agency head \"insofar as is practicable and not in contravention of the law,\" which has been interpreted to mean that the agency head could direct the employee to appear at an OIG interview."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible Rationales for Delaying, Modifying, or Rejecting a Requested Audit or Investigation", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, IGs have discretion in mounting audits and investigations.

According to the letter, SIGTARP requested \"Emergency Processing\" by OMB of its letter to TARP recipients. Reportedly, OMB initially noted that SIGTARP \"would not be limited\" by the PRA, and then subsequently withdrew its emergency approval within several minutes of granting such approval. According to the letter, it was Senator Grassley's understanding at the time that OMB \"is requiring SIGTARP to post a proposed letter of inquiry to TARP recipients for 15 days, wait for comments, and then justify to OMB that it has taken into account the public comments in redrafting the inquiry letter.\" It is not clear if a proposed letter of inquiry was posted for 15 days, but it appears unlikely that it was posted, given the following chain of events.", "According to testimony on February 5, 2009, by SIGTARP Neil M. Barofsky, the office \"received approval from OMB to send letter requests to each of the TARP recipients\" that week. On that day, the SIGTARP began issuing letters with an OMB control number that expires in August 2009. Such letters were sent from February 5-11, 2009, and encompass the issues indicated in the SIGTARP's January 22, 2009 letter.

It was published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2009. The comment request noted that the SIGTARP's information collection requirement was submitted to OMB \"for emergency review, and it has been approved under the [PRA].\" The section of the comment request describing the purpose of the SIGTARP information collection noted that the questionnaires \"are intended to accommodate a September 2009 report to Congress,\" and the summary of the proposed information collection estimated that the questionnaires would be sent to 350 respondents, \"[b]ased upon current program participants.\" This estimate may increase as the Treasury announced its plan for the use of the remainder of the TARP funds on February 10, 2009, the date before the comment request was published.

Under that provision, no one can be penalized for failing to comply with a collection of information subject to the PRA if the collection does not display a valid OMB control number or if the agency does not inform the respondents that they are not required to respond unless the collection of information contains a valid OMB control number. OIRA can disapprove any collection of information if it believes the collection is inconsistent with the requirements of the PRA. It has been estimated by some in the IG community that it takes nine to ten months to receive approval for a collection of information under the PRA.", "The Act generally defines a \"collection of information\" as the obtaining or disclosure of facts or opinions by or for an agency by 10 or more nonfederal persons. The PRA does not apply to collections of information \"during the conduct of a Federal criminal investigation,\" or \"during the conduct of ... an administrative action or investigation involving an agency against specific individuals or entities,\" which would appear to include IG investigations that fall within this category. However, the PRA does apply to \"the collection of information during the conduct of general investigations ... undertaken with reference to a category of individuals or entities such as a class of licensees or an entire industry.\" The PRA requires agencies to justify any collection of information from the public by establishing the need and intended use of the information, estimating the burden that the collection will impose on respondents, and showing that the collection is the least burdensome way to gather the information.

Agencies cannot conduct a collection of information until after undertaking such a review, evaluating public comments received, and submitting a certification that the information collection meets statutory requirements (such as being written in plain terms and \"necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency\" ), in addition to receiving OMB approval and a control number.

One approach would be for the SIGTARP to proceed with the information collection regardless of the requirements of the PRA or to only send future requests to nine entities. The potential repercussions of ignoring the PRA would be that the public protection provision of the PRA would be triggered and that the entities that received the SIGTARP request could not be penalized for failing to comply with that collection of information. However, public expectations might decrease potential noncompliance by recipients of TARP funds or the challenge of a request from SIGTARP, whose purpose is to provide oversight of such expenditures, for information regarding how the entity spent its funds. ", "A second approach to address the SIGTARP's responsibilities and the PRA would be for Congress to enact an amendment to the PRA that would exclude SIGTARP, or executive branch IGs generally, from the definition of \"agency,\" similar to the exclusions currently provided for the GAO and the Federal Election Commission. It could be argued that GAO has similar auditing and investigative functions to those of IGs. The former President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, a council of presidentially appointed IGs that has now been codified, reconstituted, and renamed under the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008, has previously suggested amendments that would (1) exempt federal IGs from the PRA definition of \"agency,\" and (2) add a new section which, when read with the rest of the statute, would state: \"Except as provided in paragraph (2), this chapter shall not apply to the collection of information ... (B) during the conduct of ... (iii) audits, inspections, evaluations, investigations or other reviews conducted by federal inspectors general.\" S. 976 would provide such an exemption for statutory IGs, special IGs, the Council of IGs on Integrity and Efficiency, and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which is comprised of IGs and a presidential designee or appointee.", "A third approach would be for Congress to create an exemption from the PRA for collections of information undertaken specifically with regard to TARP funds in 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3518(c)(2), which states that the PRA applies to \"the collection of information during the conduct of general investigations ... undertaken with reference to a category of individuals or entities such as a class of licensees or an entire industry.\" Such a legislative fix could state that the provision would not apply to collections of information undertaken by the SIGTARP.", "A fourth approach would be for SIGTARP to use its subpoena powers to compel the production of such information by TARP fund recipients. As mentioned above, EESA \u00a7 121(d) gives the SIGTARP the \"authorities provided in section 6\" of the IG Act, which encompass subpoena powers. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
