In FY2018, an estimated 41% of Title I-A appropriations were allocated through the Basic Grant formula, 9% through the Concentration Grant formula, and 25% through each of the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. ", "The current four formula strategy has evolved over time, beginning with the Basic Grant formula when the ESEA was originally enacted. The Concentration Grant formula was added in the 1970s in an attempt to focus funding more effectively on LEAs with relatively large numbers or high percentages of formula children (i.e., low-income children or children in need). During consideration of ESEA reauthorization in the early 1990s, there was an attempt to replace the two existing formulas with a new formula that would target Title I-A funds better by providing more funding per formula child as the percentage or number of formula children in an LEA increased. Both the House and the Senate developed formulas intended to accomplish this goal (Targeted Grants and EFIG, respectively). A compromise on one new formula was not reached; nor was there agreement on eliminating the existing formulas. As a result, funds are allocated through four formulas under current law.", "For each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a \"formula child count,\" consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children in poor families, by an \"expenditure factor\" based on state average per pupil expenditures for public K-12 education. In some formulas, additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor.

In general, LEAs must have a minimum number of formula children and/or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific Title I-A formula. Some LEAs may qualify for a grant under only one formula, while other LEAs may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas.", "Under three of the formulas\u2014Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Targeted Grants\u2014funds are initially calculated at the LEA level. State grants are the total of allocations for all LEAs in the state adjusted for state minimum grant provisions.

It is also the formula under which the largest proportion of funds are allocated (41% of FY2018 appropriations), and under which the largest proportion of LEAs participate, largely due to its low LEA eligibility threshold (see below). However, because all post-FY2001 increases in Title I-A appropriations have been provided to the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas (see below), the proportion of Title I-A funds allocated under the Basic Grant formula has been declining steadily since FY2001 (see Appendix B ). ", "Compared to some of the other Title I-A formulas, the Basic Grant formula is relatively straightforward. Grants are based on two formula factors\u2014each LEA's relative share, compared to the national total, of a formula child count multiplied by an expenditure factor\u2014subject to available appropriations, an LEA minimum or hold harmless provision, and a state minimum. These formula factors and features are described below, followed by a mathematical expression of the formula.", "Population Factor (Formula Child Count) . The population used to determine Title I-A grants for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico consists of children ages 5-17 (1) in poor families, according to estimates for a recent income year for LEAs from the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program; (2) in institutions for neglected or delinquent children or in foster homes; and (3) in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) payments above the poverty income level for a family of four (hereinafter referred to as TANF children). These children are commonly referred to as formula children. In FY2018, children in poor families accounted for about 97% of the total formula child count. Each element of the population factor is updated annually.", "Eligibility Threshold. To receive funding under Basic Grants, an LEA must have at least 10 formula children and these children must account for more than 2% of the children ages 5-17 in the LEA. The latter qualification is referred to as the formula child rate and is calculated by dividing the number of formula children in an LEA by the number of children ages 5-17 who reside in the LEA. Both the number of formula children in an LEA and the number of children ages 5-17 who reside in the LEA are based on SAIPE data.", "Expenditure Factor. The state expenditure factor is determined using the state average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for public K-12 education. For Basic Grants, state APPE is subject to a minimum of 80% and a maximum of 120% of the national APPE. That is, if a state's APPE is less than 80% of the national APPE, the state's APPE is automatically raised to 80% of the national APPE. If a state's APPE is more than 120% of the national APPE, the state's APPE is automatically reduced to 120% of the national APPE.

Of the funds allocated to the Outlying Areas under this scenario, $1 million will be taken off the top for a grant to Palau.

There is also a somewhat higher LEA eligibility threshold for Targeted Grants than for Basic Grants (e.g., 5% formula child rate for Targeted Grants and 2% formula child rate for Basic Grants). Aside from these two differences, Targeted Grants, like Basic Grants, are based on each eligible LEA's share, compared to the national total, of a formula child count multiplied by an expenditure factor, subject to available appropriations, an LEA minimum or \"hold harmless,\" and a state minimum. These formula factors are described below, followed by a mathematical expression of the formula.", "Population Factor (Formula Child Count) . The children counted for calculating Targeted Grants are the same as for Basic Grants (see above).

In general, children counted in the formulas are assigned weights on the basis of (1) each LEA's formula child rate (commonly referred to as percentage weighting), and (2) each LEA's number of formula children (commonly referred to as number weighting). Under both percentage weighting and number weighting, a weighted formula child count is produced. The higher of the two weighted formula child counts for a given LEA is then used in the formulas for determining grants. As a result, the higher an LEA's formula child rate and/or number are, the higher grant per formula child it receives. Of the LEAs for which ED calculates grants under the Targeted Grant formula, about 88% have higher weighted formula child counts based on their formula child rates than based on their number of formula children for FY2015. That is, 88% of LEAs receiving grants under the Targeted Grant formula use the percentage-based rather than the numbers-based weighting scale.", "The weights are applied under number weighting and under percentage weighting in a stepwise manner to all LEAs nationwide to produce two weighted child counts (one under each weighting system).

This intra-state allocation process is based on the same number and percentage scales used for Targeted Grants, but the weights vary among states based on a state's equity factor (see below for more information). ", "Third, slightly narrower floor and ceiling constraints are applied to the expenditure factor under EFIG compared to the other Title I-A formulas. In general, this results in higher expenditure factors for lower-spending states and lower expenditure factors for higher-spending states relative to the other Title I-A formulas.", "Fourth, the EFIG formula includes not only a formula child count and an expenditure factor but also two unique factors. These are an effort factor, based on APPE for public K-12 education compared to personal income per capita for each state compared to the nation as a whole, and an equity factor, based on variations in APPE among the LEAs within a given state.", "Thus, state total grants under EFIG are based on each state's share, compared to the national total, of a formula child count multiplied by an expenditure factor, an effort factor, and an equity factor, adjusted by a state minimum. Then, each LEA's share of the state's total grant under EFIG is based on a weighted formula child count for the LEA, compared to the total for all LEAs in the state, adjusted by an LEA hold harmless provision.

In the first-stage calculation of state total grants under EFIG, this factor is the same as for Basic Grants (see above). In the second-stage suballocation of state total grants to LEAs, as under all stages of the allocation process for Targeted Grants, weights are applied to the formula child counts before they are actually used in the formula. This process is the same as for Targeted Grants with respect to the number and percentage scales used, and use of the greater of the two weighted child counts to calculate LEA grants. However, for EFIG the weights on the number and percentage scales differ, depending on the state's equity factor. That is, the weights rise more rapidly as the numbers and percentages of formula children increase in states with higher equity factors. As is discussed below, states with higher equity factors have relatively high degrees of variation in APPE among their LEAs. For states with an equity factor below 0.10, the weights are the same as for Targeted Grants. For states with equity factors of 0.10 to less than 0.20, the maximum weights are 50% higher than for Targeted Grants. For states with equity factors of 0.20 or above, the maximum weights are twice as high as for Targeted Grants. This variation is illustrated in Table 2 .", "Eligibility Threshold.

That is, if a state's APPE is less than 85% of the national APPE, the state's APPE is automatically raised to 85% of the national APPE. If a state's APPE is more than 115% of the national APPE, the state's APPE is automatically reduced to 115% of the national APPE. After adjustments, should they be needed, a state's APPE is multiplied by 0.40 as specified in statute. The expenditure factor is the same for all LEAs in the same state.", "Effort Factor. The effort factor is one of the two factors that is only included in the EFIG formula. It is a ratio of the three-year average APPE for public K-12 education to the three-year average state personal income per capita (PCI) divided by the ratio of the three-year average national APPE to the three-year average national PCI. The effort factor ratio is ", "The resulting index number is greater than 1.0 for states where the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education to PCI is greater than the average for the nation as a whole, and below 1.0 for states where the ratio is less than the average for the national as a whole. Narrow bounds of 0.95 and 1.05 are placed on the resulting multiplier, so that its influence on state grants is rather limited. The effort factor is the same for all LEAs in the same state.", "Equity Factor. The equity factor is also unique to the EFIG formula. It is based on a measure of the average disparity in APPE among the LEAs of a state, called the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV is expressed as a decimal proportion of the state APPE. In the CV calculations for this formula, an extra weight (1.4 vs. 1.0) is applied to estimated counts of formula children. The effect of including this additional weight is that grants would be maximized for a state where expenditures per formula child are 40% higher than expenditures per nonformula child. Typical state equity factors range from 0.0 (for the single-LEA jurisdictions of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, where by definition there is no variation among LEAs) to approximately 0.25 for a state with high levels of variation in expenditures per pupil among its LEAs. The equity factors for most states fall into the 0.10-0.20 range. In calculating grants, the equity factor is subtracted from 1.30 to determine a multiplier to be used in calculating state grants. As a result, the lower a state's expenditure disparities among its LEAs are, the lower its CV and equity factor are, and the higher its multiplier and grant are under the EFIG formula. Conversely, the greater a state's expenditure disparities among its LEAs are, the higher its CV and equity factor are, and the lower its multiplier and grant are under the EFIG formula. In effect, states are rewarded for having lower disparities among LEAs.", "LEA Minimum Grant or \"Hold Harmless\" Level. Same as Basic Grants (see above), with one exception. The hold harmless provisions are not taken into consideration in the initial calculation of state total grants. Therefore, it is possible (and it has occurred in a small number of instances) that state total grants would be insufficient to fully pay hold harmless amounts to all LEAs in a state. In that case, each LEA would get a proportional share of its hold harmless amount.", "Minimum State Grant. Same as Target Grants (see above), with one exception.

While there are several rules related to school selection, LEAs must generally rank their public schools by their percentages of students from low-income families, and serve them in rank order. This must be done without regard to grade span for any eligible school attendance area in which the concentration of children from low-income families exceeds 75%. Below this point, an LEA can choose to serve schools in rank order at specific grade levels (e.g., only serve elementary schools in order of their percentages of children from low-income families). Beginning in FY2017, LEAs will have the option to serve elementary and middle schools with more than 75% of their children from low-income families and high schools with more than 50% of their children from low-income families before choosing to serve schools in rank order by specific grade levels. All participating schools must generally have a percentage of children from low-income families that is higher than the LEA's average, or 35%, whichever of these two figures is lower, although LEAs have the option of setting school eligibility thresholds higher than the minimum in order to concentrate available funds on a smaller number of schools.", "In a large majority of cases, the data used to determine which students are from low-income families for the distribution of funds to schools are not the same as those used to identify school-age children in poor families for purposes of calculating allocations to states and LEAs. This is because data are not typically available on the number of school-age children enrolled in a school, or living in a residential school attendance zone, with income below the standard federal poverty threshold. Such \"population in poverty\" estimates, as used in the formulas for allocation of funds to states and LEAs (discussed above), are usually available only for LEAs, counties, and states.", "Thus, LEAs must use available proxies for low-income status. The Title I-A statute allows LEAs to use the following low-income measures: (1) the number of children ages 5 through 17 in poverty counted in the most recent Census data approved by the Secretary; (2) eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunches; (3) eligibility for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); or (4) eligibility for Medicaid. At the level of individual schools, the most commonly used criterion for determining whether students are from low-income families is eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunches. The income eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price lunches are higher than the poverty levels used in the allocation formulas to states and LEAs: 130% of poverty for free lunches, 185% for reduced-price lunches.", "Funds are allocated among schools in proportion to their number of students from low-income families, although grants to eligible schools per student from a low-income family need not be equal for all schools. LEAs may choose to provide higher grants per child from a low-income family to schools with higher percentages of such students (e.g., higher grants per child to a school where 70% of students are from low-income families than to a school where 40% of students are from low-income families). If an LEA provides Title I-A funds to schools with low-income child percentages below 35%, then it must provide a minimum amount of funds per child from a low-income family\u2014equal to at least 125% of the LEA's Title I-A grant per child from a low-income family\u2014to each participating school.", "Similarly, the share of funds to be used by each recipient LEA to serve educationally disadvantaged students attending private schools is determined on the basis of the number of children from low-income families living in the attendance areas served by public schools selected to receive Title I-A grants.
