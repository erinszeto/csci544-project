Broker-dealers, or simply brokers, have significant range in the kinds of services they provide and generally divide into two groups, full-service and discount brokerage firms.

A broker-dealer's investment recommendations suite may include buying securities from or selling securities to retail customers on a principal basis or recommending the purchase of proprietary products.

Under this standard, advisers are generally expected to serve the best interests of their clients and are required to subordinate their own interests to those of their clients. Ideally, advisers are also expected to either eliminate material conflicts of interest or be fully transparent to the client about the existence of such conflicts.", "By contrast, broker-dealers are generally subject to a less demanding standard of client care that is found in FINRA's Rule 2111, the suitability standard . Triggered when a broker-dealer makes an investment recommendation, the \"standard requires that a firm or associated person have a reasonable basis to believe a recommended transaction or investment strategy involving a security or securities is suitable for the customer....

This was encapsulated in an observation made in a Rand Corporation study: \"[T]he industry is becoming increasingly complex, firms are becoming more heterogeneous and intertwined, and investors do not have a clear understanding of the different functions and fiduciary responsibilities of financial professionals.\"", "In 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a white paper on potential financial reforms in the wake of the financial crisis, Financial Regulatory Reform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A New Foundation: Rebuilding Financial Supervision and Regulation . A section of the report observed that for many investors there was little if any difference in the way they perceived brokers and advisers. It then argued that \"retail customers repose the same degree of trust in their brokers as they do in investment advisers, but the legal responsibilities of the intermediaries may not be the same.\" ", "The white paper then recommended the enactment of new legislation \"requiring that broker-dealers who provide investment advice about securities to investors have the same fiduciary obligations as registered investment advisers.\"", "On the heels of the Treasury report and driven in part by similar concerns regarding investor confusion over the roles of investment advisors and broker-dealers, Section 913 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. 111-203 ) did a number of things in this area. Among them was granting the SEC authority to impose fiduciary rules on broker-dealers subject to certain conditions and requiring the SEC to study various aspects of financial professionals' standards of retail customer care. Among other questions, the study was asked to evaluate \"whether there are legal or regulatory gaps, shortcomings, or overlaps in legal or regulatory standards in the protection of retail customers relating to the standards of care for providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers that should be addressed by rule or statute.\"", "Released in 2011, the staff study recommended that the SEC bolster investor protection and reduce investor confusion regarding the differences between brokers and investment advisers.

No such rulemaking was proposed or adopted by the SEC under Chair Schapiro or her successor, Chair Mary Jo White, who in 2015 reportedly said that the agency should \"implement a uniform fiduciary duty for broker-dealers and investment advisers where the standard is to act in the best interest of the investor.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 2016 DOL Fiduciary Rules", "paragraphs": ["In April 2016, the Obama Administration's Department of Labor (DOL) adopted new rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; P.L. 93-406 ). Previously, under ERISA, securities brokers-dealers who provided services to retirement plans and who were not fiduciaries were generally subject to a suitability standard.

Major parts of the rules were not to be implemented until 2018.", "In making the case for the reform, the Obama Administration argued that the definition of investment advice needed to be revised given the changed nature of how Americans were readying themselves for retirement after ERISA's enactment in 1975. More specifically, the number of participants in traditional defined benefit (DB) plans had significantly declined, whereas the number of participants in defined contribution (DC) plans, such as 401(k) plans, had surged. The Administration argued that DC plan participants tend to confront more decision options, such as contribution amounts, investment allocations, rollovers, and withdrawals, than do DB plan participants. As such, it was argued that those in DB plans may have greater need for investment assistance and advice subject to the more strenuous fiduciary standard.", "Supporters of DOL's fiduciary rules, including investor advocates, argued that financial advisers (including broker-dealers) would no longer be able to direct clients to products that awarded them larger commissions at the client's expense. Detractors, including broker-dealers, financial planners, and various Members of Congress, stressed that the rules would increase the cost of retirement accounts and would curtail various investors' access to investment advice. ", "In February 2017, President Trump released a presidential memorandum ordering the Labor Department to reexamine the rule. Later, between April and November 2017, DOL ordered a series of delays for key parts of the rule that stretched until July 2019.

The decision formally halted implementation of the rules. The adjudication was the result of a lawsuit brought by various business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (a major business trade group), the Financial Services Roundtable (a group that represents the nation's largest firms in banking, insurance, and investment services), and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA, a major trade group for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers).

However, in fall 2018, DOL officially announced that it was \"considering regulatory options in light of the Fifth Circuit opinion\" and projected a September 2019 date for the potential new final rules.

Scalia was later confirmed for that post by the Senate on September 26, 2019. ", "While a partner with the law firm Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher, Scalia presented oral arguments on behalf of the plaintiffs in the aforementioned case in which the court vacated DOL's fiduciary rule. Scalia has reportedly described the rule as \"an immensely controversial and burdensome rule that really pushed the envelope of the agency's regulatory authority.\"", "The possibility has been raised that Secretary Scalia may have to recuse himself from involvement in the development of a fiduciary rule because of government ethics rules that guard against conflicts of interest by prohibiting officials from participating in issues they were involved with in the private sector.

", "As observed earlier, in addition to its stated goal of requiring a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer making recommendations, Reg BI also seeks to address some remaining conflict-of-interest concerns. Reg BI will do so by requiring broker-dealers to \"address conflicts of interest by establishing, maintaining, and enforcing policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and fully and fairly disclose material facts about conflicts of interest, and in instances where [the SEC] ... determined that disclosure is insufficient to reasonably address the conflict, to mitigate or, in certain instances, eliminate the conflict.\" ", "According to SEC officials, under Reg BI, which the SEC deliberately constructed to be a principles-based set of obligations rather than an expressly defined one, when retail investor clients receive and use a broker-dealer recommendation, the broker-dealer will be required to act in the retail customer's best interest without placing the broker-dealer's financial or other interests ahead of the retail customer's. The SEC interprets Regulation BI to apply to recommendations of (1) \"any securities transaction\" (purchase, sale, and exchange); and (2) any \"investment strategy\" involving securities (including account recommendations).

As a result, customers' costs for such advice could increase. The release then examined the potential fallout from a hypothetical scenario in which brokers operate under a new fiduciary standard but uniformly remain broker-dealers. According to the release, this could result in increased compliance costs for brokers that could be fully or partially passed on to their clients. That possibility, it argued, could lead to some customers problematically engaging less expensive investment advice providers outside of the regulated world of investment advisers and broker-dealers.", "Some data-based research has also examined the implications of a hypothetical final rulemaking that imposed a fiduciary standard on brokers.

Of the 21 respondents, 53% reported that they had either eliminated or limited access to brokerage advice services and 67% had migrated away from open choice to fee-based or limited brokerage services.

Among other things, the 2012 research found that the number of registered representatives conducting business within a state as a percentage of total households did not significantly change whether or not a state had a stricter fiduciary standard. It also found no significant differences among such financial professionals in states with a strict fiduciary standard compared with states that did not have a fiduciary standard with respect to (1) whether they were limited in their ability to recommend certain products or to serve clients with limited wealth; (2) the percentage of clients with lower incomes and higher levels of wealth; (3) their ability to provide a broad range of investment products including those that involve commission-based compensation; and (4) the ability to provide tailored customer advice.", "Bhattacharya , Padi , and Illanes .

Among other things, they found that subjecting brokers to a fiduciary duty shifted the suite of investment products that they sell to retail investors. Relative to counties without broker fiduciary obligations, brokers in counties with fiduciary standards saw increased costs of doing business, but the jurisdictions also witnessed direct improvements in the quality of the financial advice."], "subsections": []}]}}
