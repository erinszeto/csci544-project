Therefore, throughout the funding tables of this report, advance appropriations numbers are shown under the label \"memorandum\" and in the corresponding fiscal year column. For example, advance appropriations for FY2013 authorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ), are shown under a separate memorandum and in the FY2013 column.

Each component is subject to a number of adjustments to account for the characteristics of VA health care and the veterans who access VA's health care services. The EHCPM makes projections three or four years into the future. Each year, VHA updates the EHCPM estimates to \"incorporate the most recent data on health care utilization rates, actual program experience, and other factors, such as economic trends in unemployment and inflation.\" For instance, in 2012, VHA used data from FY2011 to develop its health care budget estimate for the FY2014 request, including the advance appropriations request for FY2015.

Absent this data, the Committee cannot accurately assess the merits of an additional request. The Committee also notes that the Department routinely carries forward significant funds from one fiscal year to the next and directs that any of funding carried forward from fiscal year [FY] 2013 be applied to unanticipated needs.", "Furthermore, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved measure ( H.R. 2216 ; S.Rept. 113-48 ) proposes an additional $100 million for the medical facilities account for FY2014 for nonrecurring maintenance projects (see Table 8 ).

Lawmakers also failed to agree on language in a FY2014 continuing resolution (CR). With no agreement in place on October 1, 2013, the resulting lapse in funding led to a partial shutdown of government operations. Congress finally reached agreement on a temporary CR on October 16, 2013, and the President signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-46 ), the following day to reopen the government. That CR (P.L. 113-46) funded most of the VA (excluding the three medical care accounts: medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities) through January 15, 2014. P.L. 113-73 extended the CR through January 18, allowing extra time for legislative consideration of an omnibus appropriation bill. On January 17, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ).

P.L. 113-76 provides $40 million for FY2014 for the medical services account in addition to the advance appropriation of $43.6 billion that was provided in P.L. 113-6 (see Table 8 ). Furthermore, the MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2014, provides $85 million for FY2014 for the medical facilities account in addition to the advance appropriation of $4.9 billion provided in P.L. 113-6. This additional funding will be used to address the backlog of non-recurring maintenance needs at existing VA hospitals and clinics. As required by the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-81), the MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2014, provides advance appropriations of $55.6 billion for FY2015 for three VHA accounts (medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities).
