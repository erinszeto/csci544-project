{"id": "RL33752", "title": "Softwood Lumber Imports from Canada: Issues and Events", "released_date": "2006-12-15T00:00:00", "summary": ["U.S. lumber producers have long raised concerns about softwood imports from Canada. They argue that Canada subsidizes its lumber producers with low provincial stumpage fees (for the right to harvest trees). In Canada, the provinces own 90% of the timberlands, which contrasts with the United States, where 42% of timberlands are publicly owned and where government timber is often sold competitively; these differences in land tenure make comparisons difficult. U.S. producers also argue that Canadian log export restrictions subsidize producers by preventing others from getting access to Canadian timber; U.S. log exports from federal and state lands are also restricted, but logs are exported from U.S. private lands. Finally, U.S. producers argue that they have been injured by imports of Canadian lumber. They point to the growth in Canadian exports and market share, from less than 3 billion board feet (BBF) and 7% of the U.S. market in 1952 to more than 18 BBF per year and a market share of more than 33% since the late 1990s. Canadians counter these arguments, asserting that their stumpage fees are based on markets, that the WTO prohibits treating export restrictions as subsidies, and that the U.S. industry has been unable to satisfy the growth in U.S. lumber demand for homebuilding and other uses.", "The United States initiated investigations of Canadian subsidies\u2014a prerequisite for establishing countervailing duties (CVDs)\u2014in 1982, 1986, and 1991. Subsidy findings led to a 15% Canadian tax on lumber exports in 1986 and a 6.51% CVD in 1992. Canada challenged the CVD, which was revoked in 1994. A 1996 Softwood Lumber Agreement restricted Canadian exports until March 31, 2001. U.S. producers filed antidumping (AD) and CVD petitions immediately after the 1996 agreement expired. U.S. agencies determined that Canadian lumber was subsidized and was being dumped and that the imports threatened to injure U.S. industry. Final AD and CV duties of 27% were imposed in May 2002, although lumber duties were later lowered as a result of annual Commerce Department reviews. Canada filed NAFTA and WTO cases and, with Canadian producers, suits in U.S. federal court challenging U.S. agency actions in the AD and CVD investigations. Canadian companies also filed claims against the United States under the NAFTA investment chapter.", "On July 1, 2006, the United States and Canada signed a Softwood Lumber Agreement (2006 SLA) to end the dispute. A finalized version was signed September 12, 2006, and, with subsequent amendments, entered into force October 12, 2006. Among other things, the seven-year agreement provides for the settlement of pending litigation and establishes Canadian export charges, varying by weighted average lumber prices and lower if the Canadian exporting region also accepts volume restraints. The United States has revoked the AD and CVD orders, with at least 80% of the duty deposits being returned to the importers of record. The remaining 20% is being used to fund lumber-related entities and initiatives provided for in the agreement."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["On April 27, 2006, the United States and Canada announced a seven-year framework agreement to resolve their longstanding dispute over U.S. imports of Canadian softwood lumber. The United States-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement (2006 SLA), which entered into force with amendments on October 12, 2006, establishes Canadian export charges, with the level generally depending on average lumber prices, except for lumber from logs harvested in the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Atlantic Provinces. As required under the 2006 SLA, the United States has revoked its antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on softwood lumber, and 80% of the estimated duties collected are being returned to importers of record. The SLA also provides for the termination of pending litigation, the most recent phase of the dispute having been notable for the volume of domestic and international legal proceedings initiated by Canada and Canadian producers challenging U.S. trade remedy actions.", "Concerns among U.S. lumber producers about softwood lumber imports from Canada have been raised for decades; the current dispute has persisted for 25 years. U.S. producers argue that they have been harmed by unfair competition, which they assert results from subsidies to Canadian producers, primarily in the form of low provincial stumpage fees (fees for the right to harvest trees from province-owned timberlands) and Canadian restrictions on log exports. Canadians defend their system, and U.S. homebuilders and other lumber users advocate unrestricted lumber imports. This report provides a concise historical account of the dispute, summarizes the subsidy and injury evidence, and discusses current issues and events."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Historical Background", "paragraphs": ["The current dispute began in 1981, when letters from Members of Congress and a petition from\u00a0the U.S. lumber industry asked the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to investigate lumber imports from Canada for a possible CVD. The ITC found preliminary evidence of injury to the U.S. industry, but in 1983, the DOC determined that the subsidies were de minimis (less than 0.5%), ending the CVD investigation.", "In 1986, the U.S. lumber industry filed a petition for another CVD investigation. A 1985 court ruling on a DOC determination of countervailable benefits on certain imports from Mexico was seen as a favorable precedent for reversing the DOC finding on Canadian lumber subsidies. In addition, numerous Senators made it clear to the President that action on lumber imports was necessary for legislative approval of fast-track authority for a United States-Canada free trade agreement. The ITC again found preliminary evidence of injury to the U.S. industry, and the DOC reversed its 1983 determination, with a preliminary finding that Canadian producers received a subsidy of 15% ad valorem (i.e., 15% of lumber market prices). On December 30, 1986, the day before the final DOC subsidy determination was to be issued, the United States and Canada signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Canada imposing a 15% tax on lumber exported to the United States, to be replaced by higher stumpage fees within five years. The U.S. industry then withdrew its petition.", "In September 1991, the Canadian government announced that it would withdraw from the MOU because most of the provinces had increased their stumpage fees. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) responded by beginning a Section 301 investigation, pending completion of a new CVD investigation by the DOC and the ITC. In March 1992, the DOC issued a preliminary subsidy finding of 14.48% ad valorem, with a final determination in May establishing a 6.51% ad valorem subsidy leading to a 6.51% ad valorem duty. In July 1992, the ITC issued a final determination that the U.S. industry had been materially injured by Canadian lumber imports.", "The Canadian federal government appealed both the DOC and the ITC final determinations to binational review panels established under Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which had entered into force on January 1, 1989. In May 1993, the binational\u00a0panel reviewing the subsidy determination remanded the DOC finding for further analysis, and in September, the DOC revised its finding to 11.54% ad valorem. In December, the binational subsidy panel again remanded the DOC finding and ordered the DOC to find no subsidies. In January 1994, the DOC complied with the order. Using a provision of the FTA, the USTR requested an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC) to review the binational panel decisions, but the ECC was dismissed in August 1994 for failing to meet FTA standards. The DOC then revoked the CVD, and in October, the USTR announced that it would terminate the Section 301 action.", "Two events in September of 1994 induced Canada to negotiate restrictions on its lumber exports to the United States. First, the U.S. lumber industry filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the binational panel review process, now contained in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Second, the President submitted implementing legislation for the GATT Uruguay Round agreements, which explicitly approved the President's Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) accompanying the proposed legislation, the document containing language indicating that because of Canadian practices, lumber imports from Canada could be subject to a CVD. In February 1996, the two nations announced an agreement-in-principle\u2014a fee on Canadian lumber exports to the United States in excess of a specified quota for five years\u2014with the final U.S.-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement (1996 SLA) signed in May and retroactive to April 1, 1996.

U.S. lumber producers argue that subsidies to Canadian producers give them an unfair advantage in supplying the U.S. market and that this has injured U.S. producers. These two issues\u2014subsidies and injury\u2014are the basis in U.S. trade law for determining whether a CVD is warranted.

About 90% of the timberlands in the 10 provinces are owned by the provinces. The provinces require management plans for forested areas and allocate the timber harvests through a variety of agreements or leases, often for five or more years with renewal options. Stumpage fees for the timber are determined administratively, often with adjustments to reflect changes in market prices for lumber. This contrasts with the U.S. situation, where 42% of the forests are publicly owned and where public timber is typically sold in competitive auctions; thus, much of the timber in the United States is sold by public and private landowners at market prices. The use of administered fees in Canada opens the possibility that the Canadian system results in transfers to the private sector at less than their fair market value, as the U.S. lumber industry has charged. However, comparisons of U.S. and Canadian stumpage fees are often disputed, because of: differences in measurement systems and the imprecision of converting Canadian cubic meters of logs to U.S. board feet of lumber; differences in the diameter, height, quality, and species mix of U.S. and Canadian forests; differences in management responsibilities imposed on timber buyers (e.g., road construction, reforestation); differences in environmental conditions and policies; and other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subsidies: Export Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["In its 1992 CVD investigation, the DOC identified export restrictions by British Columbia (BC) as a subsidy to BC softwood lumber manufacturers. The DOC found that the BC export scheme constituted indirect government action having the effect of lowering the price of logs sold in the BC domestic market and as a result conferring a benefit on the BC manufacturers by reducing their production costs. BC generally prohibits the export of logs from Crown (provincial) lands to ensure domestic production, provide jobs, and encourage economic development. Export restrictions on public timber in the United States indicate substantially higher prices for export logs than for comparable logs sold domestically. Most economists would consider restrictions that reduce domestic prices below the world market price to be subsidies, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) generally prohibits export restrictions. The DOC affirmed its earlier position on the countervailability of export restraints in implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). Canada later challenged this approach in a World Trade Organization dispute settlement proceeding, arguing that treating export restraints in this way violated the SCM Agreement.

Beginning in 1998, Canadian lumber imports have been more than 18 BBF, rising to 22 BBF in 2005, and Canada's market share has fluctuated between 33% and 35% since 1995. These facts are cited by U.S. producers as evidence that Canadian imports have come at the expense of normal domestic growth in industrial lumber production.

On May 16, 2001, ITC issued its preliminary determination of threat of material injury, which permitted the investigations to continue. On August 17, the DOC published its preliminary determination of Canadian subsidies of 19.31% ad valorem and established a preliminary duty at that level. The DOC also preliminarily found that critical circumstances existed, potentially allowing for retroactive application of the duty. On November 6, 2001, the DOC published its preliminary determination that Canadian firms were dumping lumber, with margins ranging from 5.94% to 19.24% (12.58% for most firms).

The binational panel determines whether the challenged determination is in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country involved and, if the panel finds that it is not, directs the issuing agency to issue a new determination in accord with the panel decision within a prescribed time frame. Either party to the dispute may appeal a panel decision to an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC) for review on a limited range of issues. NAFTA-implementing legislation requires that the International Trade Commission or the Department of Commerce, as the case may be, \"take action not inconsistent with\" a NAFTA or ECC panel decision within the time period set out by the panel. Multiple remands to an agency may occur if the reviewing panel is not satisfied with the agency determination issued in response to the panel's directions.", "WTO dispute settlement, a government-to-government process set out in the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), involves a three-stage process consisting of consultations, panel and possibly Appellate Body review, and, if needed, implementation. In contrast to NAFTA Chapter 19, a WTO panel reviews a challenged measure to determine whether it is consistent with international obligations contained in one or more WTO agreements. The WTO process also permits a longer, and possibly open-ended, implementation phase. Rather than permitting the panel or the Appellate Body to prescribe a deadline for complying with an adverse WTO decision, the DSU allows the disputing parties to agree on a deadline themselves or, if they cannot do so, to have the period be determined by arbitration. The WTO cannot compel a WTO Member to comply with a decision; instead, if the defending Member does not implement the decision within the established period, the complaining Member may seek compensation from the defending party or request authorization from the WTO to impose a retaliatory measure, usually a tariff increase on selected products, until compliance is achieved. In addition, any party to the dispute may ask that a compliance panel be established to determine whether the defending party has abided by the WTO decision rendered in the case. In practice, such a proceeding, which may involve an appeal, is usually completed before the request to retaliate is placed before the WTO for final approval.", "In contrast to NAFTA-implementing legislation, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) provides the executive branch with discretion to determine how to respond to an adverse WTO decision involving an agency determination in an AD or CVD investigation.

Under the agreement, a financial contribution may consist of government provision of goods and services other than general infrastructure and includes a situation where the government entrusts or directs a private body to carry out the financial contribution involved. In the Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act, and in the Federal Register explanation of the DOC's subsequent implementing rule for countervailing duties, the executive branch made clear that U.S. law and the SCM Agreement recognized that an indirect subsidy could be provided through an export restraint scheme, the DOC stating that although export restraints \"may be imposed to limit parties' ability to export, they can also, in certain circumstances lead those parties to provide the restrained good to domestic purchasers for less than adequate remuneration.\" The DOC also confirmed that were it again to investigate situations and facts similar to those in the 1992 softwood case, U.S. trade law would continue to permit it to reach the same conclusion.", "In May 2000, Canada challenged this policy in the WTO, alleging that the U.S. interpretation, as set forth in the above-cited documents, was inconsistent with U.S. obligations under the SCM Agreement.
