The first stage in the reconciliation process is the adoption of the budget resolution. If Congress intends to utilize the reconciliation process, reconciliation directives (also referred to as reconciliation instructions) must be included in the annual budget resolution. These directives trigger the second stage of the process by instructing individual committees to develop and report legislation that would change laws within their jurisdiction related to spending, revenue, or the debt-limit. These directives detail which committee(s) should report reconciliation legislation, the date by which the committee(s) should report, the dollar amount of budgetary change to be achieved in the reconciliation legislation, and the time period over which the impact of the budgetary change should be measured. If a single committee is directed in the budget resolution to develop reconciliation legislation, it will likely be instructed to report this language directly to its full chamber. If, however, several committees are directed to report reconciliation legislation, they typically will be directed to submit the language to their respective Budget Committee for packaging, without any substantive change, into an omnibus measure.", "During the second stage of the reconciliation process, the specified committee develops legislation in response to the reconciliation directive included in the budget resolution. The committee will then meet to vote whether to report that language. The committee may vote to report the language favorably or unfavorably, the latter meaning that although it satisfied its directive, the committee did not support the language.", "As stated above, if more than one committee has been directed to report reconciliation legislation, they are directed to submit such language to their respective Budget Committee. The Budget Committee then packages all committee responses into an omnibus budget reconciliation bill without making any substantive revisions and votes on whether to report the omnibus reconciliation bill to the full chamber. In this way, both the legislative committees and the Budget Committees in both chambers have important roles to play in the reconciliation process.", "During the final stages of the reconciliation process, the reported legislation is considered under expedited procedures in both the House and Senate. As with all legislation, any differences in the reconciliation legislation as passed by the two chambers must be resolved before the bill can be sent to the President for the final stage of the process, either approval or veto.", "Sometimes the reconciliation process triggered in the annual budget resolution of a specific year is not completed until the subsequent year.

Since the 101 st Congress, 13 budget resolutions have included reconciliation directives to Senate committees. Twelve of those thirteen budget resolutions directed the Senate Finance Committee to report reconciliation legislation.

Twelve of those thirteen budget resolutions directed the House Ways and Means Committee to report reconciliation legislation.", "In current practice, reconciliation may include mandatory spending legislation, but does not include discretionary spending.

In 2000, for instance, the budget resolution included four separate reconciliation instructions to the House Ways and Means Committee.", "There are several reasons why a budget resolution may include multiple directives to a single committee. First, a committee may be directed to report more than one kind of reconciliation legislation (revenue, spending, or debt-limit legislation) with a separate directive given for each type. The Budget Act also recognizes that committees may be directed to report a combination of spending and revenue legislation, including a directive to achieve deficit reduction. If a committee is given more than one directive, for instance to increase revenues and decrease spending, then the committee may respond with separate pieces of legislation.", "A committee may also be asked to report reconciliation legislation that achieves budgetary goals over different periods of time.

These types of directives include a dollar amount that in practice is considered a maximum , sometimes referred to as a ceiling, meaning that the committee might report a lower level of spending increases or revenue reductions, but not greater. Further, the Budget Act provides that it is not in order in the Senate to consider reconciliation legislation that includes extraneous matter. One definition of extraneous is a provision that would increase the deficit beyond the period specified in the reconciliation directive.", "Compliance with the dollar amount set forth in a reconciliation directive is measured on a net basis. This means that legislation responding to a directive to reduce spending, for instance, might have a provision that would increase spending for a certain program. This would be considered in order as long as the legislation, taken as a whole, would satisfy the overall spending decreases set forth on the reconciliation directive.", "If a committee does not respond to its directive, each chamber has methods that it may employ that would allow it to include legislative language that falls within the non-reporting committee's jurisdiction to satisfy the committee's directive.

If a committee is given more than one directive, for instance to increase revenues and decrease spending, then the committee may respond with separate pieces of legislation. Under current Senate practice, however, this provision has been interpreted to mean that no more than one reconciliation measure of each type is permitted. Reconciliation instructions, therefore, may result in the creation of as many as three reconciliation bills that may be considered on the floor under expedited procedures, but no more than one each for spending, revenue, and the debt limit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spending", "paragraphs": ["In current practice, reconciliation directives pertain to direct spending which is in the jurisdiction of House and Senate legislative committees, rather than discretionary spending, which is in the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committees. Such direct spending directives may instruct a committee to report legislation that would effect spending levels. A committee may respond to the directive by reporting changes to direct spending programs or by recommending changes in offsetting collections. Offsetting collections, such as user fees for water or mineral rights on federal land, are treated as negative spending rather than as revenues.", "Reconciliation directives pertaining to direct spending generally refer to changes in outlay levels. The outlay level is the projected level of dispersed federal funds. Outlays differ from budget authority (which gives agencies the authority to incur obligations) and are used to assess the impact of the legislative changes on the federal budget.", "In practice, if a reconciliation directive instructs a committee to report legislation reducing spending by a specific amount, that amount is the minimum by which the legislation should reduce spending. Conversely, if a reconciliation instruction directs a committee to report language increasing spending, that amount is a maximum by which spending should be increased.
