In some respects these issues are distinct, each with its ownpolicy and economic implications. In other respects the issues are interrelated. They have emergedfrom common sets of domestic political, foreign policy, and economic factors and affect or areaffected by the concerns of Members of Congress, of other policymakers and of many interestgroups. These issues and how policymakers deal with them will define overall U.S. trade policy.", "During the first session, the 109th Congress dealt with a number of critical trade issues. TheBush Administration requested and received a two-year extension of its trade promotion authority. The Congress also debated U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) as itconsidered, but did not pass, a congressional resolution to withdraw from the WTO. In addition, theAdministration sent and the Congress passed legislation to implement a free trade agreement withfive Central American countries plus the Dominican Republic, the DR-CAFTA, and passedimplementing legislation for a free trade agreement with Bahrain. Furthermore, the 109th Congressrepealed two trade programs that had been declared illegal by the WTO. During the second session,the 109th Congress may be called on to debate more free trade agreements, trade relations with China,and tariff preferences for developing countries, among other issues. The Congress might alsocontinue to monitor the Doha Development Agenda negotiations proceeding in the WTO.", "Each issue or set of trade issues bears its own implications as Members of Congress weighthe merits and disadvantages. In most cases, the 109th Congress will be considering and debatingeach issue separately. However, the trade issues as a whole have implications for a wider debate onU.S. trade policy. As the 109th Congress addresses these issues, its decisions will have implicationsfor key questions that help define U.S. trade policy in the long-term.", "This report will generally cover the trade issues as they unfold.

It is also influenced by political factors, such as the roleand concerns of Congress in trade policy, the role and agenda of the President, and the differentperspectives that the two branches bring to the trade debate and foreign policy considerations. Thesefactors influence the climate in which the issues emerge and are debated by the Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economic Factors", "paragraphs": ["Domestic economic conditions can influence the trade policy agenda. Poor economicgrowth or recession that is coupled with escalating unemployment often causes policymakers todirect their attention to trade. For example, the structural adjustments that the steel industry hadbeen experiencing led to presidential measures to restrict steel imports in 2002. (1) ", "Rapidly growing U.S. trade deficits also generate interest in foreign trade and reassessmentsof trade policies. Economists assert that trade deficits are themselves not the results of trade policybut are the products of broader economic conditions. Nevertheless, large trade deficits have causedthe Congress, in many cases, to give priority to trade on its agenda especially when U.S. tradedeficits with one or more trading partners are increasing rapidly. Large deficits are often perceivedas an indication that the trade relationship is unbalanced or unfair. Table 1 below shows U.S. tradein goods and services from 1996-2005.", " Table 1. U.S. Trade in Goods and Services,1996-2005", "(Billions of Dollars)", "Source: U.S. Department of Commerce. Bureau of the Census.", "In 2005, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services hit a record $725.8 billion, a 17.5%increase over the previous record of $617.6 billion in 2004. During the 10-year (1996-2005) period, the U.S. trade deficit increased over 600%, from $102.9 billion to $725.8 billion. Most economistsattribute the deficits, especially the broader current account deficits, to macroeconomic factors,including relative real economic growth rates of the United States and its major trading partners, realexchange rates, and savings and investment balances in the United States and other countries. (2) Trade policy and trade policytools have little effect on trade balances, especially in the long run. However, they affect thecomposition of trade. But trade deficits, by definition, translate into more U.S. firms and workersbeing hit by import competition thereby increasing the pressure for protection.", "Related to U.S. trade deficits is the value of the U.S. dollar in terms of other majorcurrencies. Over time, the U.S. dollar has fluctuated in value. Recently, the dollar has beenappreciating against major currencies despite record-breaking U.S. current account deficits. (3) A stronger dollar makes U.S.domestic goods more expensive compared to imports exacerbating U.S. trade imbalances. Whileconsumers benefit from lower import prices, import-sensitive manufacturers must make adjustmentsto match the competition. These adjustments might include using labor-saving technology and/ormoving some production offshore and may lead to protectionist trade policy actions.", "Along with the growing U.S. trade deficits and the value of the U.S. dollar, the increasing importance of foreign trade in the U.S. economy plays a role in setting the congressional tradeagenda. It creates more \"winners\" and \"losers\" from trade, thus, increasing the potential salience ofthe trade issues. In 1960, the ratio of exports plus imports of goods and services to U.S. grossdomestic product (GDP), a measure of openness, was 9.5%. By 2005, the ratio increased to26.6%. (4) As the UnitedStates has become more integrated with the rest of the world economy, a larger range of economicactivities is affected by trade and raises policy issues. For example, advances in telecommunicationstechnology now allow some services to be imported or \"outsourced\" from India and other countriescreating competition for some U.S. domestic providers. However, these same advances also lowercosts to consumers of those services. ", "The geographical distribution of U.S. trade has shifted. In particular, the role of advanceddeveloped countries has declined while the role of less developed countries has expanded. In 1990,63.9% of U.S. exports went to the industrialized countries while 35.1% went to developingcountries. By 2005, the share of U.S. exports accounted for by developing countries had increasedto 47.0%. Similarly, in 1990 58.8% of U.S. imports came from industrialized countries and 40.9%from developing countries. In 2005, 54.9% of U.S. imports came from developing countries. (5) The rise of the newlyindustrializing economies of East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan) and theemergence of Mexico as a significant U.S. trading partner account for part of this surge; however,much of the increase in developing countries' share of U.S. trade derives from China. Between1990-2005, China's share of U.S. imports grew from 3.1% to 14.6% and its share of U.S. exportsrose from 1.2% to 4.7%. Shifts in trade patterns have coincided with rising concerns about theability of U.S. workers to compete with countries with low wages and the impact of globalizationon U.S. employment, wages, and living standards.", "The relative share of the United States in world trade has declined over the years. U.S.exports accounted for 15.7% of world exports in 1960 (when Japan and Europe were still recoveringfrom the devastation of World War II) and 9.0% in 2004. The decline can be attributed to, amongother things, the emergence in the international trading system China and other developing countries,as they have opened up their economies to the rest of the world. It can also be attributed to theemergence market economies in the former communist states in Central and Eastern Europe and theformer Soviet Union. (6) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Political Factors", "paragraphs": ["Congressional concerns and responsibilities in U.S. trade and trade policy are extensive. The Constitution assigns trade responsibility to the Congress. Article I, Section 8, states in part thatthe Congress shall have the authority \"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises... [and]regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states...\" For most of U.S. historythis responsibility largely meant setting tariffs on imports into the United States. ", "With the enactment of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) of 1934, the Congressdelegated for limited periods of time the authority to the President to negotiate trade agreements toreduce tariffs reciprocally. It also delegated to the President the authority to reduce tariffs byproclamation within certain parameters. The RTAA was a congressional and executive branchreaction to the growing political burden on the Congress from tariff administration, to the politicalreality that it was easier for Congress to raise tariffs than lower tariffs given the political imperativeof constituent interests, and to the largely adverse economic results of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Actof 1930. (7) ", "Over time, trade negotiations have become more complex as trade negotiations have movedbeyond tariffs to nontariff trade barriers, investment, labor, environment, and other issues. Theyhave moved from the bilateral frameworks under the original RTAA to the multilateral negotiationsunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor organization, theWorld Trade Organization (WTO). In 1974, the trade negotiating authority was granted in the formof expedited (or fast-track) congressional consideration (limited debate and no amendments) ofimplementing legislation for proposed agreements. ", "While delegating negotiating authority to the President, the Congress maintains much controlover trade policy. It does so by placing time limits on the authority, thus requiring the President toreturn to Congress to request its renewal. The Congress establishes negotiating objectives that mustbe adhered to in any agreement eligible to receive expedited (fast-track) treatment. The Congressrequires that the executive branch notify the Congress when it intends to enter trade agreementnegotiations and when it intends to sign trade agreements. It also requires the executive branch toconsult the Congress during the negotiations. The Congress most recently granted the authority in2002, initially until July 1, 2005, but was extended until July 1, 2007, as provided by law, upon thePresident's request and after the Congress did not pass a resolution disapproving the request.", "An overall concern of Members of Congress is that the President remains mindful ofCongress's constitutional authority over trade. In addition, Members want to make sure theAdministration consults the Congress as its pursues negotiations in the bilateral and multilateral foraand conducts other aspects of U.S. trade policy. Members are also concerned that U.S. trade policynot unduly harm their constituents. Some want to make sure that the United States will preserve itsability to protect U.S. industries from dumped imports and other unfair foreign trade practices andthat foreign countries allow U.S. exports to compete fairly. Members also want to ensure the UnitedStates holds its trade partners accountable for adhering to trade agreement obligations.", "Each presidential administration conducts trade policy based on its own priorities andstrategy. During the Bush Administration's first term, the United States pursued an activist tradeagenda. It took the lead with the European Union (EU) and other trade powers in launching a newround of multilateral negotiations in the WTO; pursued negotiations with individual countries andgroups of trade partners to establish bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs); and usedother initiatives to forge closer economic ties that could lead to free trade agreements. The BushAdministration's priorities in its second term appear to include completing FTA negotiations;launching negotiations with other trading partners; completing of Doha Development Agenda(DDA) round of negotiations in the WTO; and ensuring U.S. trade partners' compliance with theirobligations under bilateral and multilateral agreements. ", "In order for U.S. trade policy to be implemented successfully, the legislative and executivebranches must work in tandem. As with many policy issues , conflicts on trade matters may arisebetween some Members of Congress and the Administration because of positions taken by theirrespective political parties. However, the Congress and the President bring different institutionalperspectives that can place the two branches in conflict over trade matters regardless of their partyaffiliation. In general, Members of Congress are most concerned for the interests of their respectiveconstituencies -- workers, firms, agriculture, and industries -- and the impact of trade on them. ThePresident, as national leader, must weigh the positions of various groups against other nationalobjectives (such as national security and foreign policy concerns and broad economic gains) inmaking trade policy.

The expiration date has become a virtual deadline forU.S. negotiations on multilateral, regional, and bilateral trade agreements that require congressionalapproval. The deadline constrains the presidential and congressional trade agendas, especiallyregarding trade negotiations. The TPA statute stipulates that agreements entered into by July 1,2007, would be eligible for expedited congressional consideration if all other conditions under theauthority are met. However, the statute also requires that the President notify the Congress of hisintention of entering into (signing) an agreement at least 90 calendar days prior to doing so. Therefore, any U.S. agreement would have to be concluded by April 2, 2007, in order to meet theTPA criteria. While the Congress could choose to renew the authority briefly, as was done in 1993to cover the completion of the Uruguay Round agreements, it is by no means certain that the 110thCongress would choose to do so.

The WTO is evolving: The membership is now negotiating expansion and revision of itsrules in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) round, and countries are negotiating their entry intothe WTO as new members. For some Members of Congress and for some interest groups, the WTOis controversial. They view the organization's rules as impinging on U.S. sovereignty, especiallywhen WTO trading partners are able to challenge U.S. trade remedy laws for being contrary to WTOrules and principles. On the other hand, others assert that the WTO provides stability andpredictability to the international trading system by ensuring that member countries' trade regimesmeet basic standards and by providing a forum to encourage other countries to remove trade barriers.

The Congress did not passa resolution that would have called for the withdrawal of the United States from the World TradeOrganization (WTO), thus agreeing to U.S. participation, at least for another five years.

In November 2001, the United States and the other members of the WTO launched what has becomeknown as the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) round of negotiations. The failure early on to reachagreement on some basic ground rules, such as the modalities for negotiations on agriculture, madethe end of 2005 deadline unachievable. The negotiations have continued with an emphasis onagriculture, non-agriculture market access (NAMA), and services. Trade ministers from the 149members met in December 2005 in Hong Kong for the biannual ministerial meeting andrecommitted their countries to completing the round of negotiations by the end of 2006, keeping inmind the April 2007 deadline on trade promotion authority (TPA) within which the BushAdministration is operating. (9) ", "Although the Congress has no direct involvement in the negotiations, legislation establishingthe trade promotion authority (TPA) requires the executive branch to consult continually with theCongress during trade negotiations. The Congress could also conduct oversight hearings on theprogress of the negotiations.

Under the tradepromotion authority, the Congress would consider the implementing legislation for the agreementson an expedited basis. ", "U.S. Compliance with WTO Decisions. TheWTO has ruled against the United States in several cases brought to the Dispute Settlement Body(DSB) against U.S. trade actions, most of which involve U.S. trade remedy laws. In some cases, theWTO has determined that U.S. implementation of its trade remedy laws does not comply with WTOrules. In some cases, compliance requires just a change in administrative regulation or practice. Insome other cases, the determination was that the U.S. law itself violated U.S. WTO obligations and requires an act of Congress for the United States to come into compliance. Compliance with WTOrulings has generated debate, especially when the program in question has broad congressionalsupport. On the one hand, the program may benefit critical constituencies and be politically popular. On the other hand, failure to comply subjects the U.S. to possible WTO-authorized sanctions andmight encourage noncompliance by trading partners in cases where they lose.", "The 109th Congress passed legislation that addressed two outstanding adverse decisionsagainst the United States. In the first, the Congress repealed the so-called Byrd Amendment,the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) of 2000 (Title X of P.L. 106-387 ). The law requires the Treasury Department to distribute revenues, collected from antidumping (AD)and countervailing duty (CVD) orders, to firms that had been successful petitioners in the AD andCVD cases. In 2002, the WTO had ruled against the United States in a challenge brought by 11WTO members. Of the 11, the EU, Canada, and Japan eventually imposed tariff sanctions,authorized by the WTO, against selected U.S. exports because the United States had failed to repealthe law by an established deadline. After much congressional debate, a provision to repeal the Byrdamendment was included in the conference report accompanying S. 1932 , the DeficitReduction Act of 2002. It passed the House on December 19, 2005, and the Senate on December21, 2005. (Because the House version did not include some language (language unrelated to therepeal), the House had to vote again on the Senate version, which it did on February 2, 2006.) However, under the provision the operation of the Byrd Amendment program continues untilSeptember 30, 2007. The EU, while acknowledging the repeal, has raised concerns about the delayof its effect. It is not clear whether U.S. trading partners will continue sanctions against U.S.exports.

For example, someMembers of Congress have questioned the criteria that the Bush Administration uses to choose FTApartner countries. They have argued that many of the recently completed FTAs are with countrieswith relatively small economies that do not offer significant new commercial opportunities to U.S.exporters and investors. The Bush Administration has countered that these FTAs are stepping stonesin building regional free trade areas that will offer greater opportunities to the United States whileencouraging economic growth and development in those regions. The Administration also contendsthat FTAs assist the United States in defending its foreign policy and national security interests bystrengthening ties with countries that have cooperated with the United States on the war on terrorismand the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.", "Trade negotiations also raise concerns about the potential impact of pending agreements onthe U.S. economy as a whole and on specific sectors, particularly import-sensitive sectors such assome agricultural products and textiles. Economists have argued that FTAs can create new trade,boosting economic efficiency -- a positive contribution to the economy, but they can also divert tradefrom more efficient to less efficient producers by giving preferential treatment to the imports of thelatter, a negative contribution to the world economic welfare.

Under WTO rules, the United States would have to grant them unconditional MFN (or PNTR) upontheir accession. If it does not, then the United States would have to invoke the WTO provision of\"non-applicability,\" that is, it would declare that the WTO rules and other obligations would notapply in its trade relations with the other country. Therefore, the United States would not benefitfrom their accession to the WTO.

For example, issues may arise over Russian President Putin'smoves to centralize political power in the Kremlin by eliminating direct elections for regionalgovernors and by putting political pressure on the domestic press and over his policies towardChechnya. The U.S. business community could raise concerns about the business climate in Russiain the wake of the arrest of Yukos Oil chairman Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the forced sale of Yukosassets.
