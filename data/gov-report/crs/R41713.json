Many of the EU's more recently added countries of Eastern Europe ( Table 3 ) have been slow to adopt Western technology, in large part due to the extremely small size of their agricultural holdings. For example, the United States has 2.2 million farms with an average size of 418 acres per farm. This contrasts with Romania, which has nearly 4 million individual farm holdings with an average holding of about 9.4 acres, and Poland, which has another 2.4 million holdings averaging about 19 acres each. Even the more Western EU member country of Italy has 1.7 million farms with an average holding of about 23 acres.

In general, the small size of EU farm holdings, their substantially larger number relative to the United States, and the generally larger share of rural population in the EU (26.3% versus 18%) has played a strong role in the formation of EU farm policy\u2014it tends to have a stronger rural development flavor and allows frequent exemptions for identifiably small farming units from certain restrictions and payment limitations.", "Because the United States and the EU figure so dominantly in the development and use of agricultural policy on the global level, information comparing the EU and U.S. farm support programs will likely continue to be of interest to Congress as the United States prepares for another round of domestic farm bill negotiations and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha negotiations move forward.

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Europe was confronted with serious food shortages. Although the shortages subsided by the mid-1950s, Europe remained a major importer of foodstuffs well into the 1970s; thus, the EU's initial policy focus was on ensuring adequate internal supplies.

Both nations recognized their dilemma but were hesitant to unilaterally undertake reforms for fear of losing market share in the very competitive international marketplace. ", "The United States began to slowly rein in direct farm support levels, starting with the 1985 farm bill ( P.L. 99-198 ) which lowered Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) price-support loan rates, froze income support target prices and program yields used to calculate per-acre payments, and introduced special marketing loan provisions for rice and cotton to avoid government stock ownership. Further reforms followed in the 1990 farm bill ( P.L. 101-624 )\u2014acreage eligible for income support payments was reduced and acreage set-asides were tied to end-of-season stocks making them mandatory when stocks were too high relative to usage.", "The EU initiated reforms to its agricultural policy starting with the MacSharry Reforms of 1992 ( Table 3 ). The drive to reform farm policy by moving away from government supply management and towards a more liberalized market and trade environment was further crystallized in the legal texts of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994 with the culmination of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture\u2014adopted at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks on April 15, 1994\u2014marked a turning point in the history of the multilateral trading system by subjecting agricultural trade to essentially the same rules that discipline trade in industrial goods. In particular, WTO member countries made commitments to reduce domestic support to agriculture, reduce the use of export subsidies, and improve access to their markets.", "Two years after completion of the Uruguay Round, the United States enacted the 1996 farm bill ( P.L. 104-127 ) which made substantial changes towards greater market orientation in the design of U.S. agricultural policy. In addition to eliminating acreage reduction programs (ARPs) and most planting restrictions, as well as farmer-owned (but government financed) grain reserves, the 1996 farm bill also replaced the target-price deficiency payment program (a type of counter-cyclical income support program) with direct payments (a type of lump sum decoupled payment) and extended the use of special marketing loan repayment provisions (first begun for rice and cotton in the 1985 farm bill) to the other major program crops, thus effectively curtailing USDA's role in commodity storage and management.", "The EU also continued to increase the market-orientation of its own farm policy, in large part due to the looming enlargement eastward and the need to include millions of new farms under the Common Agricultural Policy. The EU's \"Agenda 2000\" reforms lowered support prices and replaced them with production-based direct payments. Subsequent reforms in 2003, inspired by the midterm review of Agenda 2000, continued the pattern of replacing government controls with greater market orientation. These were followed by reforms of support programs for hops and the so-called Mediterranean commodities (cotton, olive oil and tobacco) in 2004, sugar in 2006, and the wine sector in 2008 and 2009.", "As a result, since the mid-1980s both the United States and the EU have steadily modified their farm programs in part by shifting away from traditional \"trade-distorting\" types of production-based price and income support programs and toward various types of less market-distorting \"non-commodity\" support, such as rural development and farmland conservation (or so-called \"agri-environment\") programs. Non-commodity support now constitutes the dominant share of total agricultural support, compared to production-based support, for both the United States and the EU\u2014in the United States it comprises 88% of notified domestic support, compared with a 69% share in the EU ( Table 4 ).", "Many in Congress have historically defended U.S. farm support programs as a means to ensure that the United States has continued access to the \"most abundant, safest, and cheapest food supplies in the world.\" European defenders of the CAP have made similar arguments for state-sanctioned intervention in the agricultural sector. Yet long-standing criticisms and continued debate have challenged the extent of and need for government support of farm programs.

These diverse policies are governed by an equally diverse set of laws. Many of these policies can be and sometimes are modified through freestanding authorizing legislation, or as part of other laws; however, the omnibus, multi-year farm bill (which comes up for renewal every five or six years) provides an opportunity for policymakers to address agricultural and food issues more comprehensively. The most recent omnibus farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 , the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008) covers a range of areas, including commodity crops, horticulture and livestock, conservation, nutrition, trade and food aid, agricultural research, farm credit, rural development, energy, forestry, and other programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Commodity Price and Income Support Programs", "paragraphs": ["The traditional \"core\" farm programs provide price and income support to producers of select \"covered commodities\" such as grains, oilseeds, and cotton in the form of both fixed direct payments and counter-cyclical assistance payments (CCP).

Payments under both the marketing loan provisions and CCP are linked to current market prices\u2014payments decline and eventually stop as market prices approach, then exceed commodity loan rates and the CCP target prices, or contrarily, payments will expand as market prices fall below support price targets. In addition, the dairy sector receives price support via government purchases of surplus dairy products at statutory prices, and income support via the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program which makes direct payments to participating dairy farmers when the market price of farm milk in any month falls below a legislatively mandated target price. Sugar is supported through a minimum pricing system that includes marketing allotments (which limit the amount of sugar that domestic processors can sell) and quotas to limit imports.

But over time, average commodity support levels have remained fairly consistent.

In general, land retirement and easement programs take land out of crop production and provide for program rental payments and cost-sharing to establish longer-term conservation coverage to convert the land back into forests, grasslands, or wetlands. Working lands programs provide technical and financial assistance to assist agricultural producers in improving natural resource conservation and management practices on their productive lands. In addition, aside from some long-standing rural business and community programs, the 1996 and 2002 farm bills, as amended, included several new rural development programs intended for infrastructure improvements, community services, and business development.

", "The CAP's original objectives were to increase agricultural productivity, ensure fair living standards for farmers, stabilize markets, ensure the availability of food, and provide food at reasonable prices.", "These aims were achieved primarily by the EU intervening in commodity markets to buy farm output when market prices fell below agreed target prices. To prevent imports from undercutting the high internal prices that resulted from the operation of the intervention buying system, the EU levied variable tariffs on imported agricultural products. Export subsidies were used to eliminate the surpluses of agricultural products that resulted from the high internal prices of the intervention buying system. The system of intervention buying, import levies, and export subsidies was carried out in various common market organizations (CMOs) for bananas, cereals, floriculture, dried fodder, fruits and vegetables, hops, olive oil and table olives, flax and hemp, eggs, pork, milk products, rice, seeds, sugar, tobacco, beef and veal, sheep meat and goat meat, wine, poultry meat, and other agricultural products.", "Among the unintended consequences of the CAP were high prices for consumers and high budget expenditures. During the 1970s and 1980s, the CAP accounted for as much as 70% of the total EU budget. The CAP was also criticized by EU trading partners for distorting world markets and interfering with global agricultural trade. As the EU expanded from its original six member countries formed by the 1958 Treaty of Rome to 12 members in 1986, the generous support programs of the CAP resulted in ever-increasing budget outlays.

Amber box programs include payments contingent on participation in agricultural production. As a result, these are the most market-distorting types of programs. Examples are U.S. price supports for dairy (including MILC payments) and sugar; U.S. marketing loan and CCP benefits for grain, oilseed, and cotton producers; and EU intervention purchases of farm products at administratively maintained prices above market prices. Amber box payments are subject to WTO reduction commitments. 2. Blue box programs are direct payments made under a production-limiting program.

Examples are EU direct payments to producers based on fixed areas or yields or a fixed number of livestock. There are currently no U.S. blue box programs. Blue box programs are not subject to WTO disciplines or reductions. 3. Green box programs are payments that are only minimally market-distorting.

If total non-product-specific subsidies are below 5% (10% for developing countries) of the value of a developed country's total agricultural production, then they do not have to be included in the AMS calculation. Similarly, product-specific support is limited to 5% (10% for developing countries) of the value of that product's annual output.", "The AMS data provide a comprehensive accounting of farm program support. Like the OECD's PSE calculation (described below), the AMS includes support for all program areas and all commodities, even those that are supported through indirect price supports such as import quotas and tariffs. For example, the primary method of support provided under the U.S. dairy and sugar programs are non-price mechanisms such as government purchases (dairy) and marketing quotas and import barriers (sugar). Yet the AMS captures this support as part of its overall estimate by measuring the price difference between the domestic and international prices, then applying it to annual production.

For example, the United States' \"green box\" payments differ from the EU's in that the U.S. includes \"domestic food aid,\" which includes food stamps, and other domestic food and child nutrition programs ( Table 4 ). In addition, internal shifts among categories between reporting periods also complicate a direct or historical comparison. For example, prior to 2002 the U.S. notification classified the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), as a \"resource retirement program,\" whereas since 2002 it has been classified as an \"environmental payment.\" This type of change can distort historical trends and period averaging of the available data, understating U.S. spending on conservation programs prior to 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Commodity Support Has Declined and Shifted Focus", "paragraphs": ["During the 1995 to 2005 period, the United States averaged $10.7 billion annually in commodity-type (or amber box) support with four commodity groups receiving the majority of support\u2014dairy (45%), grains, pulses, and oilseeds (31%), sugar (11%), and cotton (11%) ( Table 4 ).

EU commodity support has been spread across dairy, sugar, grains and oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, olive oil, and wine. Unlike in the United States where fresh and processed fruits and vegetables are largely excluded from market support, these products (along with olive oil and wine) represented 31% of EU amber box outlays.

Domestic food aid in the United States has risen by 42% between the two periods\u2014from $38.3 billion to $54.3 billion as both benefits and eligibility have expanded over time. EU decoupled income support has grown even more dramatically from $1.9 billion to $43 billion as the EU has relied heavily on the use of the SFP to move away from commodity price supports.", "Fourth, the United States provides less support than the EU for both environmental programs and rural development programs under the green box, but substantially more for domestic food aid ( Table 4 ). As already mentioned, in 2002 the United States reclassified the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) as an \"environmental payment\" whereas previously it was classified under \"resource retirement programs.\" Given that these data are averaged over the 1995-2005 period, average U.S. environmental payments ($1.2 billion) can be combined with \"resource retirement programs\" payments ($1 billion) to better capture the inclusion of CRP in earlier years. The combined U.S. value of $2.2 billion is substantially lower than the EU's combined $5.9 billion. For the more recent period, 2006-2007, the difference in environmental payments is even more significant: U.S. environmental payments averaged $3.8 billion per year, compared to the EU's $8.2 billion.

This does not provide a comprehensive accounting of rural development outlays since U.S. payments are slightly higher for agricultural research, extension, regulatory, and technical services under the \"general services\" category.

OECD analysts have developed a methodology to evaluate and classify the various types of agricultural support programs of major developed countries in a more consistent fashion both across countries and over time. In addition to being more consistent, the OECD data also provides for a longer time series from 1986 through 2009.", "OECD aggregates agricultural policy support levels according to several types of criteria, two of which are used in this report for cross-country comparisons: ", "the producer support estimate (PSE), and general services support estimates (GSSE).", "The PSE reflects the value of all policy measures (both explicit and implicit) that support agriculture. OECD defines the PSE as \"an indicator of the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to support agricultural producers, measured at farm gate level, arising from policy measures, regardless of their nature, objectives or impacts on farm production or income.\" This measure includes production-based support (commodity price supports, payments related to input use, and payments based on various current and historical criteria including area planted, animal numbers, receipts, and income), two payment categories where no production is required (based on historical criteria or on other non-commodity criteria such as long-term resource retirement), and a miscellaneous category. The PSE measure includes most conservation payments as well as the EU's SFP and the U.S. direct payment; however, it does not include domestic food assistance and nutrition program payments which are instead included in the GSSE (defined below).", "While the PSE data are initially available as values (expressed in units of each country's domestic currency), OECD also expresses the PSE as a percentage of the value of gross farm output to avoid the issues associated with exchange rate fluctuations when making comparisons of agricultural support across countries. ", "The definition of PSE \"non-commodity outputs\" is closely related to the concept of \"multi-functionality,\" which is widely acknowledged in the EU and builds on the idea that agriculture has many functions in addition to producing food and fiber. These positive attributes include environmental protection, landscape preservation, biodiversity, rural viability and employment, animal welfare, food safety and quality, and food security. Typically, non-commodity outputs of agriculture satisfy two conditions: they are jointly produced with commodity outputs, and they provide social value (and impose social costs) not reflected in markets. ", "The General Services Support Estimates (GSSE) measures the value of support that is intended to benefit the agricultural sector in general and includes policy areas such as extension, research and development, infrastructure, marketing and promotion of agricultural products, public stockholding, training, and inspection services. In addition, GSSE includes domestic food assistance programs and other consumer-directed nutrition programs that support demand for food products. Thus, GSSE support is similar to the WTO Green Box with the major exception of decoupled payments which are included in the PSE. As with the PSE, GSSE may also be expressed as a percentage of the value of gross farm output.", "The OECD's policy database extends from 1986 to 2009, thus allowing for a longer historical perspective of the effects of policy reforms over time than are available from WTO notification data.

Comparable estimates for the EU show that total production support (PSE) also has declined from an estimated 39% of gross farm receipts during the 1986-1988 period to about 24% in 2009.
