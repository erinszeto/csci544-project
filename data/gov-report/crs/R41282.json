Initially, federal biofuels policies were developed to help kick-start the biofuels industry during its early development, when neither production capacity nor a market for the finished product was widely available. Federal policy (e.g., tax credits, import tariffs, grants, loans, and loan guarantees) has played a key role in helping to close the price gap between biofuels and cheaper petroleum fuels. Now, as the industry has evolved, other policy goals (e.g., national energy security, climate change concerns, support for rural economies) are cited by proponents as justification for continuing or enhancing federal policy support.", "The U.S. biofuels sector responded to these government incentives by expanding output every year from 1980 through 2011 (with the exception of 1996), with important implications for the domestic and international food and fuel sectors. Production of the primary U.S. biofuel, ethanol (derived from corn starch), has risen from about 175 million gallons in 1980 to nearly 14 billion gallons in 2011. U.S. biodiesel production (derived primarily from vegetable oil), albeit much smaller, has also shown strong growth, rising from 0.5 million gallons in 1999 to a record 969 million gallons in 2012. Despite the rapid growth of the past decades, total agriculture-based biofuels consumption accounted for only about 8% of U.S. transportation fuel consumption (9.7% of gasoline and 1.5% of diesel) in 2012.", "Federal biofuels policies have had costs, including unintended market and environmental consequences and large federal outlays (estimated at $7.7 billion in 2011, but declining to $1.3 billion in 2012 with the expiration of the ethanol blender's tax credit). Despite the direct and indirect costs of federal biofuels policy and the relatively small role of biofuels as an energy source, the U.S. biofuels sector continues to push for federal involvement. But critics of federal policy intervention in the biofuels sector have also emerged. Current issues and policy developments related to the U.S. biofuels sector that are of interest to Congress include", "Many federal biofuels policies require routine congressional monitoring and occasional reconsideration in the form of reauthorization or new appropriations. The 10% ethanol-to-gasoline blend ratio\u2014known as the \"blend wall\"\u2014poses a barrier to expansion of ethanol use. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued waivers to allow ethanol blending of up to 15% (per gallon of gasoline) for use in model year 2001 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. However, the limitation to newer vehicles, coupled with infrastructure issues, could limit rapid expansion of blending rates. The slow development of cellulosic biofuels has raised concerns about the industry's ability to meet large federal usage mandates, which in turn has raised the potential for future EPA waivers of mandated biofuel volumes and has contributed to a cycle of slow investment in and development of the sector.", "In 2012, the expiration of the blender tax credit, poor profit margins (due primarily to high corn prices), and the emerging blend wall limitation have contributed to a drop-off in ethanol production and have generated considerable uncertainty about the ethanol industry's future."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Increasing dependence on foreign sources of crude oil, concerns over global climate change, and the desire to promote domestic rural economies have raised interest in renewable biofuels as an alternative to petroleum in the U.S. transportation sector. However, energy from renewable sources has historically been more expensive to produce and use than fossil-fuel-based energy. U.S. policymakers have attempted to overcome this economic impediment by enacting an increasing number of policies since the late 1970s, at both the state and federal levels, to directly support U.S. biofuels production and use. Policy measures have included blending and production tax credits to lower the cost of biofuels to end users, an import tariff to protect domestic ethanol from cheaper foreign-produced ethanol, research grants to stimulate the development of new technologies, loans and loan guarantees to facilitate the development of biofuels production and distribution infrastructure, and, perhaps most importantly, minimum usage requirements to guarantee a market for biofuels irrespective of their cost.

The two principal biofuels are ethanol and biodiesel; however, other fuels such as methanol and butanol could also qualify when produced from a qualifying biomass.", "Biomass is organic matter that can be converted into energy. Common examples of biomass include food crops, energy crops (e.g., switchgrass or prairie perennials), crop residues, wood waste and byproducts, and animal manure. The term biomass has been a part of legislation enacted by Congress for various programs over the past 30 years; however, its explicit definition has evolved with shifting policy objectives. Over the last few years, the concept of biomass has grown to include such diverse sources as algae, construction debris, municipal solid waste, yard waste, and food waste. The exact definition of biomass is critical, since it determines which feedstocks and resultant biofuels qualify for the different federal biofuels programs. ", "For example, the principal biofuels program in effect as of this report is the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), which mandates annual usage rates for four nested categories of biofuels\u2014(1)\u00a0total renewable fuels, (2) advanced renewable fuels, (3) cellulosic biofuel, and (4) biomass-based diesel. Qualifying biofuels under each category are differentiated by their type of feedstock, the land on which the feedstock is produced (e.g., federal versus private, virgin versus previously cultivated soil, etc.), the production process used both to grow the feedstock and to process it into a biofuel (certain technologies are favored based primarily on environmental considerations), and the estimated amount of greenhouse gas emissions that result from the entire production pathway. ", "The idea of formally defining biomass has evoked criticism. Some argue that by explicitly enunciating qualifying feedstocks, the definition may be excluding new or as-yet-undiscovered feedstocks that may emerge in the future. Also, there appears to be some inconsistency across programs. For example, algae-based biofuels presently do not qualify for inclusion under the RFS cellulosic biofuels mandate, but do qualify for the \"advanced other\" biofuels mandate, as well as for the cellulosic biofuels tax credit and the depreciation allowance for qualifying cellulosic biofuels plants. These differentiations tend to confuse and may slow or inhibit investments in algae-based biofuels. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ethanol from Corn Starch Dominates U.S. Biofuels Production", "paragraphs": ["Ethanol is the principal biofuel produced in the United States ( Figure 1 ). Ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, is an alcohol made by fermenting and distilling simple sugars. As a result, ethanol can be produced from any biological feedstock that contains appreciable amounts of sugar or materials that can be converted into sugar such as starch or cellulose. Sugar beets and sugar cane are examples of feedstock that contain sugar. Corn contains starch that can relatively easily be converted into sugar. Trees, grasses, and most agricultural and municipal wastes are made up of a significant percentage of cellulose, which can also be converted to sugar, although with more difficulty than is required to convert starch. ", "Since its development in the late 1970s, U.S. biofuels output has relied almost exclusively on ethanol produced from corn starch. Small amounts of ethanol have also been produced using sorghum, wheat, barley, and brewery waste. This contrasts with Brazil, the world's second-largest ethanol producer behind the United States, where sugar cane is the principal feedstock. In 2012, the United States and Brazil accounted for 88% of the world's ethanol production. Approximately 13.3 billion gallons of ethanol were produced in the United States in 2012, over 95% from corn starch. ", "Because of concerns over the significant expansion in corn production for use as an ethanol feedstock, interest has grown in spurring the development of motor fuels produced from cellulosic biomass materials. Since these biomass sources do not compete with traditional food and feed crops for prime cropland, it is thought that their use would result in substantially fewer unintended market effects. However, the technology needed for the conversion of cellulose into its constituent sugars before conversion to biofuels, while successful in laboratory settings, is thought to be expensive relative to corn ethanol and has yet to be replicated on a significant commercial scale. Many uncertainties remain concerning both the viability and the speed of commercial development of cellulosic biofuels.", "After ethanol, biodiesel is the next most significant biofuel in the United States. Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel that can be produced from any type of organic-based oil, including vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste restaurant grease and oils. In the United States and Brazil, biodiesel has traditionally been made from soybean oil. In the European Union, rapeseed oil is the primary feedstock, while Canada relies primarily on canola oil. In recent years persistently high vegetable oil prices have pushed biodiesel producers to increase the share of much cheaper animal fats (especially poultry fat) and tropical palm oil; however, soybean oil remains the largest single source of biodiesel feedstock in the United States, with a share of over 56% in 2012.", "Other biofuels with the potential to play a role in the U.S. market include diesel fuel substitutes and other alcohols (e.g., methanol and butanol) produced from biomass.

When a specific biofuel is blended (or used) in excess of its RFS mandate, the surplus RINs may be sold (ideally to another fuel blender to make up for a shortfall in meeting that blender's own RFS mandate) or stored for use in meeting the following year's RFS mandate. As a result of their tradability, secondary markets for RINs\u2014by RFS category\u2014have developed and gain in importance whenever the supply of a specific biofuel type tightens relative to its RFS mandate. RIN values are nested\u2014since cellulosic and biomass-based diesel RINs can be used to meet their own category as well as the advanced and total categories, they have an inherent premium over advanced and total RINs. Similarly, advanced RINs would have a premium over total RINs.", "In contrast, when the supply of a specific biofuels category exceeds its mandated usage volume, the associated \"nested\" value will diminish. In volumes above the RFS total renewable mandate, biofuels use is no longer obligatory and it must compete directly in the marketplace with its petroleum-based counterpart. As a result, once they have met their RFS blending mandates, fuel blenders, seeking to maximize their profits, are very sensitive to price relationships between petroleum-based fuels and biofuels. This is particularly important for ethanol since it contains only about 68% of the energy content of gasoline. As a result, value-conscious consumers could be expected to willingly pay only about 68% of the price of gasoline for ethanol. ", "From 2006\u2014when the RFS was first introduced\u2014through 2011, both ethanol production capacity, supply (production and imports combined), and consumption have easily exceeded the federally mandated usage levels ( Figure 2 ). As a result, ethanol's marginal value during that period was as a transportation fuel (rather than as an additive), where it competed directly with gasoline. However, economic conditions changed substantially in 2012, driven largely by the severe drought that summer, and the RFS has played a larger role in driving ethanol use. As for biodiesel, which is significantly more expensive to produce than its petroleum-based counterpart, biodiesel's use has been driven almost entirely by federal policy\u2014i.e., the RFS biomass-based diesel and the biodiesel production tax credit (described below)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Blend Wall Emerges as Major Value Determinant", "paragraphs": ["An important valuation concern for U.S. ethanol consumption in 2013 is the emergence of the so-called \"blend wall\" as a constraint on domestic consumption of ethanol in sufficient volumes to satisfy the RFS mandate. Ethanol-gasoline blends of up to 10% ethanol are compatible with existing vehicles and infrastructure (fuel tanks, retail pumps, delivery infrastructure, etc.). All automakers that produce cars and light trucks for the U.S. market warranty their vehicles to run on gasoline with up to 10% ethanol (E10); however, automakers have been reluctant to offer such warranties for higher ethanol blend ratios. As a result, the 10% blend ratio represents an upper bound (sometimes referred to as the \"blend wall\") to the amount of ethanol that can be introduced into the gasoline pool given the current automobile fleet and fuel delivery infrastructure. ", "In 2012, ethanol accounted for nearly a 10% share of blended gasoline sold in the United States ( Figure 1 ). In 2013, the RFS mandates for non-advanced ethanol of 13.8 bgals will likely exceed the blend wall (estimated at approximately 13 bgals by CRS based on EIA data). Supplementing actual ethanol blending with carry-over RINs (estimated at 2.6 bgals) will likely be sufficient to satisfy the 2013 RFS; however, surmounting the blend wall could prove more difficult in 2014. Because of this infrastructure constraint, ethanol production in excess of the blend wall will have limited value in the domestic market unless it is consumed at higher blending ratios in flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) or exported into the international market."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Evolution of the U.S. Ethanol Sector", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Policy Kick-Starts Ethanol Production", "paragraphs": ["Several events contributed to the startup and growth of U.S. ethanol production in the late 1970s. First, the global energy crises of the early and late 1970s provided the rationale for a federal policy initiative aimed at promoting energy independence from foreign crude oil sources. In response, the U.S. Congress established a partial exemption for ethanol from the motor fuels excise tax (legislated as part of the Energy Tax Act of 1978). All ethanol blended in the United States\u2014whether imported or produced domestically\u2014was eligible for a $0.40 per gallon tax credit.

The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 raised the ethanol tax credit to $0.60 per gallon. Based on its oxygenate characteristic, provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90) favored ethanol blending with reformulated gasoline (RFG). One of the requirements of RFG specified by CAAA90 was a 2% oxygen requirement, which was met by blending \"oxygenates,\" including methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and ethanol into the gasoline. Ethanol was the preferred oxygenate in the Midwest where it was produced, while MTBE\u2014a petroleum derivative\u2014was used in almost all RFG outside of the Midwest.", "In addition to CAAA90 oxygenate requirements, a tax credit for small ethanol producer was established in 1990 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; P.L. 101-508 ) as a $0.10 per gallon supplement to the existing ethanol tax credit, but limited to the first 15 million gallons of ethanol produced by ethanol producers with production capacity below 30 million gallons per year. Aided by these events, the U.S. ethanol industry steadily grew during its first two decades\u2014rising from an estimated 175 million gallons in 1980 to 1.8 billion gallons in 2001, when ethanol production was using about 7% of the U.S. corn crop.

Unlike the RFS, which groups biofuels into four categories, the LCFS evaluates each fuel on its own demonstrated level of lifecycle GHG emissions. The LCFS requires that biofuels demonstrate lower lifecycle GHG than the fossil fuels that they replace.
