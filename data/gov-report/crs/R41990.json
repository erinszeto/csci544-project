In 1880, George Washington's Birthday was included. In 1885, Congress extended holiday coverage for some holidays to all federal employees. Although Thanksgiving Day was included in the first holiday bill of 1870, it was not until 1941 that Congress specifically designated the fourth Thursday of November as the official date.", "Since 1888, Congress has added six federal holidays, creating Decoration Day (now Memorial Day) in 1888, Labor Day in 1894, Armistice Day (now Veterans Day) in 1938, Inauguration Day in 1957 (quadrennially and only celebrated in the District of Columbia), Columbus Day in 1968, and Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday in 1983.

Instead of creating additional federal holidays to commemorate each war, Congress felt it would be better to commemorate the sacrifices of all American veterans on a single day. On June 1, 1954, the name of Armistice Day was officially changed to Veterans Day. This legislation did not establish a new holiday.

Roosevelt proclaimed the third Thursday in November as Thanksgiving Day. By moving Thanksgiving up a week, Roosevelt \"hoped to aid retail business by producing a longer Christmas shopping season.\" Although Roosevelt's decision was greeted enthusiastically by the business community, others, including a sizable portion of the public and a large number of state officials, protested against changing the long-standing American tradition of celebrating Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday in November.

By May 1941, however, the Administration concluded that the experiment of advancing the observance date had not worked.", "On December 26, 1941, President Roosevelt signed a joint resolution to settle the dispute and permanently established Thanksgiving Day as a federal holiday to be observed on the fourth Thursday in November.

The 1880 legislation was prompted by a grievance filed by a group of employees who had been denied holiday pay for the previous New Year's Day while other federal workers had been paid. The House committee which favorably reported the bill that would become the law signed by President Hayes, stressed that while there were no existing laws requiring such payment, this group of employees, \"in the committee's opinion, should be placed upon an equality in this regard\" with those of other government departments. The committee went on to point out that, on the \"question of legal holidays,\" the Revised Statutes of the United States were silent, but those relating to the District of Columbia were very precise on the issue.

This was done even though Congress, as late as the turn of the century, had yet to enact legislation \"absolutely requiring that the Executive Departments of the Government to be closed [sic] and the clerks and other employees therein to be released from work on such days.\" ", "In 1885, Congress approved additional legislation making the five holidays thus far approved also applicable to per diem employees of the government \"on duty at Washington, or elsewhere in the United States.\" This act, apparently for the first time, extended at least limited holiday benefits to all federal employees.", "For other holidays, the decision to pay federal workers was made at various times.
