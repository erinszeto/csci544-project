Lee", "released_date": "2016-09-07T00:00:00", "summary": ["This report examines the two patent law cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in its October 2015 Term. The first patent case, decided on June 13, 2016, Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., concerns the circumstances in which the awarding of enhanced damages in a patent infringement case are warranted and the discretion of the district courts to award them. Section 284 of the Patent Act provides that the court may increase damages up to three times the amount found by a jury or assessed by the court, but does not provide any guidance to the court, or any express limits or conditions, in how to exercise its discretion to do so. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), a specialized tribunal established by Congress that has exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases, limited such awards to cases of \"willful infringement.\" Specifically, in its 2007 opinion, In re Seagate Technology, the Federal Circuit established a two-part test that must be met before the district court can exercise its discretion to increase damages under Section 284. This strict standard arguably made such awards very difficult for patent holders to recover. In a unanimous opinion, the Halo Supreme Court rejected the Seagate test for enhanced damages, determining that it was unduly rigid and inconsistent with the statutory grant of discretion to courts to decide when to award punitive damages. In invalidating the strict Seagate test, the Halo opinion advised district courts to exercise their discretion to award enhanced damages in a manner consistent with Supreme Court precedent that generally reserves such punishment for \"egregious cases of misconduct beyond typical infringement.\"", "The Court's second patent opinion of its October 2015 Term, issued on June 20, 2016, involves the \"claim construction\" standard used by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) in an administrative proceeding called an inter partes review (IPR), where members of the public may challenge the validity of issued patents. In Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, the Court upheld a USPTO regulation that requires the PTAB, in IPR proceedings, to read a disputed patent claim according to its \"broadest reasonable interpretation.\" Such an interpretive standard arguably makes it more likely that the PTAB finds a patent claim to be obvious or not novel (and thus subject to invalidation), compared to in a judicial proceeding in which a court construes patent claims according to the \"plain and ordinary meaning\" of the claims' language (a narrower standard). Furthermore, the Cuozzo Court held that a provision of the Patent Act precludes judicial review of the USPTO's decision whether to institute an IPR proceeding.", "The Halo opinion arguably favors patent holders by improving the chances of receiving enhanced damages in patent infringement cases, while Cuozzo leaves in place a process that may help third parties seeking to challenge the validity of issued patents. However, the impact of these decisions could be affected in the future by Congress, as some Members have expressed their disagreement with the Halo decision, and legislation pending in the 114th Congress (the Innovation Act (H.R. 9)) and the Protecting American Talent and Entrepreneurship Act (PATENT Act (S. 1137)) would require that the PTAB use the same claim construction standard in IPR proceedings that is applied by federal courts."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["This report pr ovides an overview and analysis of the two patent cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court during its October 2015 Term, Halo Electronics, Inc. v.

By granting inventors a limited monopoly over the use of their inventions and discoveries, patent holders will be able to receive a return on investment from their creations. Without patent protection, competitors could \"free ride\" on the inventor's research and development efforts and easily duplicate or otherwise practice the new inventions without having incurred the costs to develop them.", "According to Section 101 of the Patent Act (or the Act), one who \"invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or any composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefore, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\" Thus, an invention is eligible for patent protection if it falls within one of the four statutory categories of patent-eligible subject matter: processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. Whether the discovery is patentable subject matter is a threshold inquiry that \"must precede the determination of whether that discovery is, in fact, new or obvious.\"", "The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues a patent to an inventor after its examiners approve the submitted patent application for an allegedly new invention. An application for a patent consists of two primary parts: (1) a \"specification,\" which is a written description of the invention enabling those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and (2) one or more claims that define the scope of the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. These claims define the scope of the patentee's rights under the patent.", "Before a patent may be granted, the USPTO examiners must find that the new invention (1) is patentable subject matter and (2) satisfies several substantive requirements set forth in the Act. One of the statutory requirements for patentability of an invention is \"novelty.\" For an invention to be considered \"novel,\" the subject matter must be different than, and not be wholly \"anticipated\" by, the so-called \"prior art,\" or public domain materials such as publications and other patents. Another statutory requirement is that the subject matter of an alleged invention must be \"nonobvious\" at the time of its creation. A patent claim is invalid if \"the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\" Finally, the invention must also be \"useful,\" which means that the invention provides a \"significant and presently available,\" \"well-defined and particular benefit to the public.\" Once a patent is issued by the USPTO, it is presumed to be valid; however, members of the public may challenge the agency's decision to grant the patent either in litigation or in an administrative proceeding, as discussed in detail later in this report.", "A patent holder has the exclusive right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling their patented invention throughout the United States, or importing the invention into the United States. Whoever performs any one of these five acts during the term of the invention's patent, without the patent holder's authorization, is liable for infringement. A patent holder may file a civil action against an alleged infringer in order to enjoin him or her from further infringing acts (by securing an injunction, also referred to as injunctive relief). The Act also provides federal courts with discretion to award damages to the patent holder that are \"adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer.\" The usual term of patent protection is 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. At the end of that period, others may use the invention without regard to the expired patent.", "Because the Act expressly provides that \"patents shall have the attributes of personal property,\" patent holders may sell their patent rights in a legal transfer called an \"assignment.\" Alternatively, patent holders may grant others a \"license\" to exercise one of the five statutory patent rights. A license is not a transfer of ownership of the patent, but rather is the patent holder's permission to another entity to use the invention in a limited way, typically in exchange for periodic royalty payments during the term of the patent. A patent holder may grant to a licensee the right to practice the invention through a contract (typically known as a patent licensing agreement). The terms of the licensing agreement, however, may include conditions upon the grant of rights\u2014for example, restricting the licensee from making the invention but allowing that party to sell it. A licensee that performs an act that exceeds the scope of the license (through a violation of the limitations and conditions of the grant of rights) or refuses to comply with the terms of the license agreement (such as by refusing to pay the required royalties) is potentially liable to the patent holder for breach of contract as well as for patent infringement.", "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) is a specialized tribunal established by Congress that has exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases. Parties dissatisfied with the Federal Circuit's rulings may petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the appellate court's decision. However, the Supreme Court is not required to entertain the appeal; it has discretion to decide whether to grant certiorari to review the case.", "The next section of the report will describe the law governing the award of enhanced damages in patent infringement cases and how the Supreme Court's June 2016 opinion in Halo Electronics, Inc. v.

Nonetheless, the Federal Circuit has limited enhanced damages awards to cases of \"willful infringement.\" The appellate court has explained that willful infringement occurs when \"the infringer acted in wanton disregard of the patentee's patent rights\" based upon such circumstances as whether the infringer deliberately copied the ideas or design of the patentee, the closeness of the willfulness determination, the infringer's concealment of its conduct, and the infringer's motivations. The court opined that willful infringement \"is not simply a conduit for enhancement of damages; it is a statement that patent infringement, like other civil wrongs, is disfavored, and intentional disregard of legal rights warrants deterrence.\" A 1992 Federal Circuit opinion stated that:", "Willfulness is a determination as to a state of mind. One who has actual notice of another's patent rights has an affirmative duty to respect those rights. That affirmative duty normally entails obtaining advice of legal counsel although the absence of such advice does not mandate a finding of willfulness.", "Under the willful infringement doctrine that existed since the 1980s until 2007, courts assessed whether the adjudicated infringer knew of the patent before being charged with infringement in court, or if the infringer acted with the reasonable belief that the patent was not infringed or that it was invalid. During this time period, Federal Circuit decisions emphasized the affirmative duty of someone with actual notice of a competitor's patent to exercise due care in determining if his or her acts will infringe that patent.", "Prior to 2004, the Federal Circuit held that when an accused infringer invoked the attorney-client or work-product privilege in refusing to answer interrogatories on whether the party had obtained the advice of legal counsel before it began allegedly infringing acts, courts were permitted to reach an adverse inference that either (1) no advice of counsel had been obtained or (2) the legal opinion had been obtained and was contrary to the infringer's desire to continue practicing the patented invention. However, in its 2004 decision Knorr-Bremse Systeme fuer Nutzfahrzeuge GmbH v. Dana Corp. , the Federal Circuit expressly rejected this principle and eliminated the adverse inference. The appellate court emphasized that a court may not draw an adverse inference with respect to willful infringement when the defendant in an infringement suit invokes the attorney-client or work-product privilege (because of the inappropriate burden it may place on the attorney-client relationship in patent cases) or when the defendant has failed to seek legal advice (because of the burdens and costs of such a requirement). Following the Knorr-Bremse opinion, willful infringement determinations are based upon \"the totality of circumstances, but without the evidentiary contribution or presumptive weight of an adverse inference that any opinion of counsel was or would have been unfavorable.\"", "In 2011, Congress essentially codified the holding of Knorr-Bremse with the passage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which included language specifying that the \"failure of an infringer to obtain the advice of counsel ... may not be used to prove that the accused infringer willfully infringed the patent.... \" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "In re Seagate Technology", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Circuit made significant changes to the willful infringement doctrine in its 2007 decision, In re Seagate Technology . The appellate court overturned two decades of its precedent by opting to \"abandon the affirmative duty of due care.\" The Federal Circuit instead explained that accused infringers had no obligation to obtain an opinion of counsel. Rather, \"proof of willful infringement permitting enhanced damages requires at least a showing of objective recklessness.\" Under this view, which the appellate court believed was required by Supreme Court precedent, the \"state of mind of the accused infringer is not relevant to this objective inquiry.\" Thus, in order for a patent holder to establish willful infringement, \"a patentee must show by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent.\" Furthermore, if this objective standard is met, the patent holder must also demonstrate (also by clear and convincing evidence) that the infringer knew or should have known of the objectively high risk of infringement. ", "Seagate thus requires a two-prong analysis, involving both an objective and subjective inquiry, that must be satisfied before the district court can exercise its discretion to increase damages pursuant to Section 284 of the Patent Act. In addition, Federal Circuit precedent establishes a multipart standard of appellate review of an award of enhanced damages in patent cases: ", "1. Part one of the Seagate test regarding objective recklessness is subject to de novo review. 2. Part two of the Seagate test regarding subjective knowledge is reviewed under a substantial evidence standard. 3. The final decision by the court to award enhanced damages is reviewed for abuse of discretion. ", "The Seagate standard was used by courts until the Supreme Court heard Halo Electronics, Inc. v.

", "The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's decision to decline an award of enhanced damages. The appellate court agreed with the district court that Pulse's obviousness defense was not objectively unreasonable and thus Pulse did not willfully infringe Halo's patents.

In addition, the Court rejected Seagate 's requirement that a patent holder must prove recklessness by clear and convincing evidence because Section 284 \"supplied no basis for imposing such a heightened standard.\" Instead, the appropriate standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence, a lesser standard. The Court also rejected the Federal Circuit's multi-part standard for appellate review of an award of enhanced damages, explaining that a district court's discretion to award enhanced damages under Section 284 against adjudged patent infringers is reviewable on appeal for abuse of that discretion. Because the district court and Federal Circuit had applied the now-invalidated Seagate framework to Halo , the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Federal Circuit and remanded the case.", "In reaching its conclusions in Halo , the Court relied significantly on its 2014 opinions, Octane Fitness LLC v. Icon Health & Fitness , Inc. and Highmark, Inc. v. Allcare Health Management Systems, Inc., which concerned Section 285 of the Patent Act ( granting courts discretion to award \"reasonable\" attorney's fees to the prevailing party \"in exceptional cases\"). Similar to its Seagate two-prong test for enhanced damages under Section 284, the Federal Circuit had articulated a two-part test for determining when a case was sufficiently \"exceptional\" under Section 285 to warrant the award of attorney's fees\u2014when the claim asserted is both (1) brought in subjective bad faith and (2) objectively baseless. However, the Supreme Court in Octane Fitness invalidated the Federal Circuit's test for exceptional cases because the standard improperly confined the ability of district courts to exercise the discretion to award attorney's fees that the Patent Act commits to them. The Octane Fitness Court also rejected the Federal Circuit's requirement that prevailing parties establish their entitlement to attorney's fees by \"clear and convincing evidence\" and instead embraced a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. In Highmark, an opinion issued on the same day as Octane Fitness, the Court rejected the Federal Circuit's position that a district court's \"exceptional case\" determination is to be reviewed on appeal \"de novo\" and \"without deference.\" Instead, the Court held that the district court's determination must be reviewed on appeal under an abuse-of-discretion standard.", "The Halo Court explained that the reasoning and holdings in Octane Fitness and Highmark are \"instructive\" for its analysis of the Seagate test and the Federal Circuit's tripartite framework for appellate review of enhanced damages. The Court noted that the express language of Section 284 \"contains no explicit limit or condition,\" nor does the statutory text provide a \"precise rule or formula\" for awarding enhanced damages. In contrast, the Court found that the Seagate test \"is unduly rigid, and it impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to the district courts.\" According to the Court, the consequence of the Seagate approach is that \"it can have the effect of insulating some of the worst patent infringers from any liability for enhanced damages.\" The Court explained that the \"principal problem\" with the Seagate test is that it requires a court to determine, as a threshold matter, that the defendant's infringement was \"objectively\" reckless, as a prerequisite to the possibility of awarding enhanced damages. Instead, the Court stated that \"the subjective willfulness of a patent infringer, intentional or knowing, may warrant enhanced damages, without regard to whether his infringement was objectively reckless.\" Furthermore, the Seagate test \"aggravates the problem\" because it allows an adjudged infringer to avoid enhanced damages by offering a reasonable defense at trial, \"even if he did not act on the basis of the defense or was even aware of it.\"", "While the Halo opinion frees district courts from the constraints of the mechanical Seagate analysis in deciding whether to award enhanced damages (and in what amount), the Court cautioned district courts to exercise their discretion in a manner consistent with Supreme Court precedent that generally reserves such punishment for \"egregious cases of misconduct beyond typical infringement.\" The Court explained that \"[t]he sort of conduct warranting enhanced damages has been variously described in our cases as willful, wanton, malicious, bad-faith, deliberate, consciously wrongful, flagrant, or\u2014indeed\u2014characteristic of a pirate.\"", "Justice Breyer issued a concurring opinion, joined by Justices Kennedy and Alito, that expressed his understanding of the limits on district courts' discretion to award enhanced damages. He first explained that \"the Court's references to 'willful misconduct' do not mean that a court may award enhanced damages simply because the evidence shows that the infringer knew about the patent and nothing more. \" Rather, courts must examine whether the circumstances in the case \"transform[] simple knowledge into such egregious behavior\" that merits a punitive sanction.", "Second, Justice Breyer emphasized that the Court's interpretation of Section 284 is not intended to diminish or otherwise affect a new section of the Patent Act added by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act that states: \"The failure of an infringer to obtain the advice of counsel with respect to any allegedly infringed patent ... may not be used to prove that the accused infringer willfully infringed the patent.... \" He cited the likely high costs to small businesses and individual inventors in obtaining an opinion of counsel to determine if their products infringe a particular patent or if the patent is probably invalid; such costs could prevent or \"discourag[e] lawful innovation.\" By enacting this section of the Patent Act, \"Congress has thus left it to the potential infringer to decide whether to consult counsel\u2014without the threat of treble damages influencing that decision.\" ", "Finally, Justice Breyer urged courts to carefully use their discretion in awarding enhanced damages, ensuring that such punitive measures be limited to cases involving egregious misconduct. If increased damages are more readily available in any case involving intentional infringement, innovation could be hindered, he warned. As an example, he specifically mentioned the risk that small businesses face when they receive \"demand letters\" sent by \"patent assertion entities\" (firms that do not develop, manufacture, or sell any product, but rather use patents primarily to obtain licensing fees from others):", "How is a growing business to react to the arrival of such a letter, particularly if that letter carries with it a serious risk of treble damages? Does the letter put the company \"on notice\" of the patent? Will a jury find that the company behaved \"recklessly,\" simply for failing to spend considerable time, effort, and money obtaining expert views about whether some or all of the patents described in the letter apply to its activities (and whether those patents are even valid)? These investigative activities can be costly. Hence, the risk of treble damages can encourage the company to settle, or even abandon any challenged activity. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reactions to Halo", "paragraphs": ["Some patent practitioners have called the Halo decision a significant victory for patent owners because the Federal Circuit's Seagate test had made it almost impossible for patentees to recover enhanced damages in cases of willful infringement. Other observers were not surprised by the outcome in Halo, given the Court's 2014 Octane Fitness opinion. One organization that represents technology companies such as Amazon, Cisco, and Google, raised concerns that the Halo decision may incentivize patent assertion entities (sometimes pejoratively referred to by their critics as \"patent trolls\") to file more lawsuits and may also encourage patent holders to \"forum shop\" for district courts that have a reputation for being more willing to award enhanced damages. ", "In an effort to demonstrate his disagreement with the Supreme Court's Halo decision, Senator Orrin Hatch filed a \"sense of Congress\" amendment to the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Bill that expressed Congress's views on willful infringement in patent cases. The amendment's findings section indicates that Congress, in enacting the America Invents Act in 2011, was \"well aware of the Seagate standard\" and chose not to substantively amend Section 284 at that time, \"knowing that no action from Congress would be required to ensure that the standard established in Seagate would remain in place and continue to govern the enhancement analysis under that section.\" The amendment then expressed the sense of Congress that \"(1) the Seagate standard has governed and continues to govern the enhanced damages analysis under section 284 of title 35, United States Code; and (2) this intent of Congress should be considered in any decisions interpreting that section.\" As of the date of this Report, the Senate has not voted on this legislation or the amendment. In January 2016, Senator Hatch had filed an amicus brief in the Halo case, joined by Senators Leahy and Bennet and Representatives Bob Goodlatte, Lamar Smith, and Steven Chabot, that urged the Court not to alter or overturn the Seagate standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Impact of Halo", "paragraphs": ["By rejecting the stringent Seagate test and lowering the patent holder's evidentiary burden of proof to establish an infringer's reckless actions, the Halo decision may possibly make it easier for patent holders to receive enhanced damages in certain circumstances. In addition, once a patent holder is awarded enhanced damages by the district court, the Federal Circuit is unlikely to overturn that decision under Halo's \"abuse of discretion\" standard of appellate review. However, a patent practitioner has argued that \"[t]he percentage of cases where district courts actually award enhanced damages may not go up much because the Supreme Court has set a high bar of 'egregious' behavior.\" Another practitioner notes that, as a practical matter, the challenge facing patent holders and third parties \"is predicting where the line will ultimately fall between typical infringement and egregious cases, as well as what an accused infringer should do\u2014or must do\u2014to be on the safe side of that line.\" In future cases, courts will likely need to determine the range of \"egregious misconduct\" that may warrant enhanced damages under the Halo standard.", "The remaining portion of this report will describe the mechanics of the USPTO's patent reexamination proceedings, including the claim construction standard that applies to them.

", "However, the constitutionally based \"case or controversy\" requirement for federal judicial proceedings significantly limits the ability of members of the general public to challenge the USPTO's decision to grant a patent. Unless the patent holder becomes involved in an actual, continuing controversy with another person, that person may have difficulty requesting that a federal court determine that a patent is invalid. To address this perceived deficiency, Congress in 1980 established an administrative reexamination mechanism through which the USPTO may reconsider its initial decision to approve a patent application. Members of the public may challenge the validity of an issued patent in these patent reexamination proceedings, which need not satisfy the constitutional \"case or controversy\" requirement because the proceedings are administrative in nature and do not involve a use of the federal judicial power. Furthermore, the proceedings serve as a potentially faster and cheaper alternative to judicial determinations of patent validity. There are several possible outcomes of reexamination proceedings: a certificate confirming the patentability of the original claims, an amended patent with narrower claims, or a declaration of patent invalidity.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedural History", "paragraphs": ["The USPTO agreed to review the Cuozzo Patent's claim 17, as well as claims 10 and 14. The PTAB acknowledged that Garmin had not expressly identified in its IPR petition the specific grounds on which it was challenging claims 10 and 14. However, \"believing that 'claim 17 depends on claim 14 which depends on claim 10,' the [PTAB] reasoned that Garmin had 'implicitly' challenged claims 10 and 14 on the basis of the same prior inventions.\" The PTAB conducted the IPR proceedings and determined that claims 10, 14, and 17 of the Cuozzo Patent were obvious in light of the patents that Garmin had cited and ordered the cancellation of those claims. ", "Cuozzo appealed the PTAB's decision to the Federal Circuit, arguing that the USPTO had improperly instituted IPR with respect to claims 10 and 14 because the agency had found that Garmin only implicitly challenged those claims, in apparent violation of the Patent Act's requirement that IPR petitions must state \"with particularity\" the grounds on which the challenge for each claim is based. Cuozzo also asserted that the PTAB had improperly used the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" standard in construing patent claims in an IPR; instead, the company argued that the PTAB should apply the same claim construction standard used by federal courts when assessing a patent's validity (\"i.e., it should have given those claims their 'ordinary meaning \u2026 as understood by a person of skill in the art.'\").", "In February 2015, a divided panel of the Federal Circuit rejected both of Cuozzo's arguments. First, the appellate court asserted that Section 314(d) of the Patent Act precludes its review of the USPTO's decision to institute IPR. The court then upheld the PTAB's use of the BRI standard in claim construction, holding that the USPTO's regulation requiring such a standard was a reasonable exercise of the agency's rulemaking authority that had been granted by the AIA. The Federal Circuit explained that by applying the BRI standard, the USPTO \"reduce[s] the possibility that, after the patent is granted, the claims may be interpreted as giving broader coverage than is justified.\" The appellate court noted that the USPTO has long applied the BRI standard in a variety of proceedings, including initial examinations, interferences, and reissue and reexamination proceedings. Finally, the court observed that \"[t]here is no indication that the AIA was designed to change the claim construction standard that the PTO has applied for more than 100 years. Congress is presumed to legislate against the background of the kind of longstanding, consistent existing law that is present here.\" Thus, according to the Federal Circuit, \"Congress implicitly adopted the broadest reasonable interpretation standard in enacting the AIA.\"", "In July 2015, the Federal Circuit, by a narrow vote of 6 to 5, denied Cuozzo's petition for rehearing en banc (by the full court). In October 2015, Cuozzo filed a petition with the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the Federal Circuit's judgment, which the Court granted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supreme Court's Opinion in Cuozzo", "paragraphs": ["In an opinion authored by Justice Breyer, the Supreme Court in Cuozzo held that Section 314(d) of the Patent Act \"bar[s] judicial review of the kind of mine-run claim at issue here, involving the Patent Office's decision to institute inter partes review,\" though it may not prevent courts from considering a constitutional question. This conclusion was supported by six justices, with two dissenting. Second, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Congress had given the USPTO the statutory authority to issue the regulation specifying that the PTAB apply the broadest reasonable interpretation standard in construing patent claims in an IPR proceeding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Judicial Review of USPTO's Determination Whether to Institute an IPR", "paragraphs": ["The Supreme Court's majority opinion on this first question agreed with the Federal Circuit that the decision of the USPTO whether to institute an IPR is nonappealable. Although recognizing the \"strong presumption\" in favor of judicial review, even for statutes that purport to limit or preclude review, the Court noted that the presumption can \"be overcome by clear and convincing indications, drawn from specific language, specific legislative history, and inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole, that Congress intended to bar review.\" The Court found that this standard was satisfied in this case. In the AIA, Congress elected to make the USPTO's decision on whether an IPR should proceed \"final and nonappealable\"; thus, the Court's \"conclusion that courts may not revisit this initial determination gives effect to this statutory command.\"", "However, the majority opinion explained that its conclusion applies to issues relating specifically to IPR proceedings and not necessarily those that involve constitutional questions, other sections of the Patent Act, or other federal statutes:", "We emphasize that our interpretation applies where the grounds for attacking the decision to institute inter partes review consist of questions that are closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to the Patent Office's decision to initiate inter partes review. \u2026 This means that we need not, and do not, decide the precise effect of \u00a7 314(d) on appeals that implicate constitutional questions, that depend on other less closely related statutes, or that present other questions of interpretation that reach, in terms of scope and impact, well beyond \"this section.\"", "Justice Alito wrote a dissenting opinion to this part of the Cuozzo opinion , which was joined by Justice Sotomayor, in which he disagreed with the majority's view that Congress intended to shield \"from all judicial scrutiny\" the USPTO's compliance (or noncompliance) with statutory requirements that govern the agency's decision to institute an IPR proceeding. He first observed that Section 314(d) \"does not say that an institution decision is 'not subject to review,'\" but rather makes such decision \"nonappealable.\" He would interpret this statutory language to \"bar only an appeal from the institution decision itself, while allowing review of institution-related issues in an appeal from the Patent Office's final written decision at the end of the proceeding.\" Under Justice Alito's interpretation of Section 314(d), a court cannot prevent an IPR proceeding from commencing (because the decision to institute IPR is \"final and nonappealable\"), but \"the question whether it was lawful to institute review will not escape judicial scrutiny.\" However, he then took \"the Court at its word that today's opinion will not permit the Patent Office to act outside its statutory limits.\" Nevertheless, he argued that the Court should have held that Section 314(d) \"does not bar judicial review of the Patent Office's compliance with any of the limits Congress imposed on the institution of patent review proceedings,\" which would include the statutory condition that Cuozzo alleged was violated by Garmin in this case, i.e., Section 312(a)(3) of the Patent Act's requirement that IPR petitioners must state the grounds on which the challenge for each claim is based \"with particularity\"."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPTO's Authority to Require the Use of Broadest Reasonable Interpretation", "paragraphs": ["Regarding the other question presented in Cuozzo's certiorari petition , a unanimous Supreme Court agreed that the Federal Circuit did not err in holding that the Patent Act grants the USPTO the legal authority to require the PTAB to apply the BRI standard to claim construction in IPR proceedings. The Court first noted that no part of the IPR statute \"unambiguously directs the agency to use\" the BRI standard or the standard used by federal courts, which construe the claims in an issued patent according to their \"plain and ordinary meaning\". Because the statute leaves a \"gap\" or is \"ambiguous\" on this matter, courts \"typically interpret it as granting the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text, nature, and purpose of the statute.\" In addition, the Court observed that Section 316(a)(4) of the Patent Act expressly delegated rulemaking authority to the USPTO to issue \"regulations ... establishing and governing inter partes review under this chapter,\" which would include the power to promulgate a rule filling that gap in the IPR statute with the BRI standard. Furthermore, the Court could not find anything in the statutory language, its purpose, or its legislative history to \"suggest that Congress considered what standard the agency should apply when reviewing a patent claim in inter partes review.\" ", "The Court then held that the BRI regulation is a reasonable exercise of the USPTO's rulemaking authority, for several reasons. First, in the Court's view, applying a BRI standard to claim construction helps to protect the public interest:", "Because an examiner's (or re-examiner's) use of the broadest reasonable construction standard increases the possibility that the examiner will find the claim too broad (and deny it), use of that standard encourages the applicant to draft narrowly. This helps ensure precision while avoiding overly broad claims, and thereby helps prevent a patent from tying up too much knowledge, while helping members of the public draw useful information from the disclosed invention and better understand the lawful limits of the claim.", "Second, the Court explained that the USPTO has used the BRI standard for over a century in its administrative proceedings, and thus this precedent supports the reasonableness of its regulation in this case. The Court stated that \"we cannot find unreasonable the Patent Office's decision to prefer a degree of inconsistency in the standards used between the courts and the agency, rather than among agency proceedings.\"", "Finally, the Court downplayed Cuozzo's concern that the use of different claim construction standards by the USPTO and the courts to interpret the same patent claims may lead to inconsistent and conflicting results, such that a court could uphold the validity of a patent claim while the agency may cancel that same claim in an IPR proceeding:", "This possibility \u2026 has long been present in our patent system, which provides different tracks\u2014one in the Patent Office and one in the courts\u2014for the review and adjudication of patent claims. As we have explained above, inter partes review imposes a different burden of proof on the challenger. These different evidentiary burdens mean that the possibility of inconsistent results is inherent to Congress' regulatory design."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reactions to and Potential Impact of Cuozzo", "paragraphs": ["Some observers have called Cuozzo a victory for companies, particularly those in the technology industry, that want to utilize the faster and cheaper IPR proceedings to invalidate \"bad patents.\" On the other hand, some believe that Cuozzo leaves in place a process that may negatively impact companies that value strong patent protections, such as those in the pharmaceutical drug and biotechnology industries. ", "It remains to be seen whether Congress will legislatively \"overrule\" parts of the Cuozzo opinion. Legislation in the 114 th Congress, the Innovation Act and the PATENT Act, would require that the PTAB, in IPR proceedings, use the same claim construction standard that is applied by federal courts; that is, the PTAB would need to construe a patent claim \"in accordance with the ordinary and customary meaning of such claim as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and the prosecution history pertaining to the patent\" rather than use the BRI standard. However, this legislation has not been enacted into law."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
