In this process, NCTC maintains a classified database known as the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE). TIDE is the U.S. government's \"central repository of information on international terrorist identities.\" TIDE includes: ", "to the extent permitted by law, all information the [U.S. government] possesses related to the identities of individuals known or appropriately suspected to be or to have been involved in activities constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism (with the exception of purely domestic terrorism information).

Of this number, about 25,000 were U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents linked to international terrorist organizations. Not all of the entries in TIDE get into the TSDB, which according to the FBI held approximately 800,000 people in November 2014. Every day, NCTC analysts work on updating identities in TIDE, and NCTC exports a subset of its TIDE data holdings for the TSDB. Analysts at the TSC perform a final verification of identities before they become a part of the TSDB.

The TSC vets all nominations, and when the facts, bound with rational inferences, hold together to form a reasonable determination that the person is suspected of having ties to terrorist activity, the person is included in the TSDB.

According to the TSC, this occurs as the information is processed, \"seconds later, it shows up with our partners so they can do near-real-time screening.... \" According to the TSC, \"five major U.S. Government agencies\" receive TSDB exports (subsets of the entire watchlist). Each of the agencies gets a different portion of the TSDB, \"tailored to [its] mission, legal authorities, and information technology requirements.\" The agencies and examples of some of the screening systems that ingest TSDB information include the following: ", "The Department of State , whose consular officers draw on TSDB information in the Consular Lookout and Support System that is used for passport and visa screening. The Transportation Security Administration , which uses information from the TSDB for aviation security screening. The No Fly List, the Selectee List, and the Expanded Selectee List are parts of what is known as the Secure Flight program. The No Fly List includes identities of individuals who may present a threat to civil aviation and national security. Listed individuals are not allowed to board a commercial aircraft \"flying into, out of, over, or within United States airspace; this also includes point-to-point international flights operated by U.S. carriers.\" The selectee list includes individuals who must undergo additional security screening before being allowed to board a commercial aircraft. The minimum derogatory information requirements that form the basis for including an identity in the No Fly List and the Selectee List are \"more stringent than the TSDB's known or reasonably suspected standard.\" This makes these lists much smaller than the TSDB. In 2014, there were approximately 800,000 identities in the TSDB according to the FBI, double the figure in 2008. In 2014, about 8% of the TSDB identities\u2014around 64,000\u2014were on the No Fly List and about 3%\u2014roughly 24,000\u2014were on the Selectee List. As an extra security measure developed in response to a failed attempt to trigger an explosive by a foreign terrorist on board a U.S.-bound flight on December 25, 2009, the Expanded Selectee List was created. It screens against all TSDB records that include a person's first and last name and date of birth that are not already on the No Fly or Selectee Lists. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) owns and uses TECS (not an acronym), the main system that CBP officers employ at the border and elsewhere to screen arriving travelers and determine their admissibility. TECS accepts \"nearly all\" records from the TSDB. CBP also uses the Automated Targeting System (ATS), which is \"a decision support tool that compares traveler, cargo, and conveyance information against law enforcement, intelligence, and other enforcement data using risk-based targeting scenarios and assessments.\" As one of its functions, ATS \"compares information about travelers and cargo arriving in, transiting through, or exiting the country, against law enforcement and intelligence databases\" including information from the TSDB. As its name suggests, Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) is the portion of ATS focused on passengers, \"for the identification of potential terrorists, transnational criminals, and, in some cases, other persons who pose a higher risk of violating U.S. law\" and is used by CBP personnel at the border and ports of entry as well as elsewhere. The FBI runs the National Crime Information Center's (NCIC) database, which has been described by the Bureau as \"an electronic clearinghouse of crime data that can be tapped into by virtually every criminal justice agency nationwide, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\" The NCIC includes 21 files. One of them, the \"Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist File\" includes TSDB records. The NCIC database is used for domestic law enforcement screening.
