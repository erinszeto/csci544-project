Approximately 142,000 members of the Armed Forces (active, Guard, and Reserve) are single custodians of minor children. Temporary duty assignments, mobilization, and deployments to areas that do not allow the military member's dependent(s) to accompany them require the servicemember to have contingency plans providing for the care and well-being of their dependent(s) to include temporary custody arrangements if necessary. In some instances, custody battles have ensued when the military parent leaves for duty and the other parent decides to file for temporary or permanent custody of the child in the absence of the servicemember. Some servicemembers involved in such child custody cases have expressed concern that family courts in some states are using their military service against them in determining custodial arrangements. The issue addressed in this report is whether a federal child custody law is needed to protect servicemembers' rights in custodial disputes.", "Since 2008, the Congress, led by Representative Michael Turner, has proposed federal military child custody legislation that would establish a national standard for litigating child custody cases in which the custodian is in military service. Although legislative efforts in the House have passed on several occasions (as part of the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act from FY2008 through FY2013) and once as a stand-alone bill by voice vote in 2008 (H.R. 6048), all versions of the proposed legislation have failed to pass in the Senate. At the heart of the legislative debate is the potential conflict between the protection of the rights of servicemembers, which is arguably a federal responsibility, and jurisdiction over child custody issues, which traditionally falls within the purview of the States.", "Proponents of federal child custody legislation argue the lack of uniform state laws in the treatment of deployed and deploying military parents complicate child custody matters and that the potential exists for state courts to use a servicemember's deployment, or potential deployment, against them when making child custody determinations. Those proposing a national standard for determining military child custody cases argue such legislation would eliminate this possibility by prohibiting state courts from using deployment or the possibility of deployment against a servicemember when making child custody determinations. Opponents, however, argue that such legislation encroaches on the historical precedent of a state's right to adjudicate family law matters, would ultimately place the legal rights of the servicemember above those of the best interest of the child, and is not necessary, given that the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act already protects a servicemember's rights in child custody proceedings. Nevertheless, both sides of the debate agree that no court should show a bias for a non-deploying parent or a prejudice against a military parent solely because of military service. However, both sides disagree on the extent to which deployment or the threat of deployment plays in determining the best interest of the child which is the ultimate criterion for determining child custody cases.", "Congressional interest in federal legislation for military child custody cases stems from Congress's authority to raise and support the standing armed forces of the U.S. and Congress's authority to make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval Forces as well as to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The issue of state courts using servicemember's military service as a factor in child custody hearings has been the subject of legislative action by the U.S. Congress since 2007.

Most complex of all situations, perhaps, are those in which a single servicemember has physical custody of a child without ever having obtained an order of custody from any court. When any of these custodial-servicemember parents deploy, attend military training, or attend a service-mandated school, the question arises: \"Who takes care of the children while I'm gone?\" ", "Child custody cases are traditionally a state matter.

App. \u00a7\u00a7501-597b), formerly known as the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act (SSCRA). The purpose of this act is (1) to provide for, strengthen, and expedite the national defense through protection extended by the SCRA to servicemembers of the United States to enable such persons to devote their entire energy to the defense needs of the Nation; and (2) to provide for the temporary suspension of judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect the civil rights of servicemembers during their military service (applicable excerpts from the SCRA pertaining to child custody can be found in Appendix C ). In response to Congress's earlier attempts at passing federal child custody legislation, language was passed in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 110-181 ) that amended Sections 201(a) and 202(a) of the SCRA clarifying its applicability to child custody cases.", "Under the SCRA, judges must grant a stay of legal proceedings applicable to any civil action or proceeding, including any child custody proceeding, in which the defendant's military service affects their ability to participate in the proceedings. However, such stays are mandatory for only the first 90 days after a servicemember's deployment after which time they may apply for an additional stay based on the continuing material effect of military duty on the servicemember's ability to appear. Entry of such additional stays is at the discretion of the court and many times are not granted based on resolving custody issues in the interest of the affected child/children.", "Proponents of federal child custody legislation argue the SCRA is inadequate when it comes to the rights of servicemembers dealing with child custody issues. Although it protects the rights of the servicemember to be present at the custody proceedings by requiring judges to grant a stay of legal proceedings, proponents argue the SCRA does not prevent courts from using the servicemember's military service against them in making the final custody determination. In addition, proponents point out the SCRA does not provide procedures for entry of temporary custody arrangements nor does it provide guidance on how courts should balance servicemembers' interests against other relevant interests, including the best interest of the child.", "Opponents argue the SCRA provides military parents protection in concert with state laws and without federal litigation. In a May 22, 2012 letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee, William T. Robinson III, President of the American Bar Association, wrote that, \"The SCRA prevents any permanent change in parental rights until a reasonable time following an absent servicemember's return\" and \"unlike the proposed legislation, the SCRA applies to all cases, including support and visitation rights, those involving custody over an incapacitated adult and the considerable cases where there is no original custody order in place.\" In 2010, the DOD submitted a Priority DOD Appeal to the FY2010 Defense Authorization Bill ( H.R. 2647 , Section 584) arguing that in many of the high-visibility child custody cases, the basic and generally easily met prerequisites for automatic 90-day stays under the SCRA were simply not followed (DOD's priority appeal can be found in Appendix D ). In other cases, judges simply ignored the SCRA or it was not properly pled.

Representative Turner and other proponents argue that federal legislation protecting servicemembers in child custody cases will provide a national uniform standard for determining military child custody cases instead of the multiple legal precedencies used amongst the states. Citing differences in state laws on the question of whether deployment or the potential for deployment can be used as criterion by courts in child custody determinations, proponents argue this lack of a national standard creates the risk for servicemembers that their military service will be used against them in determining the best interest of the child. Proponents also argue that difference in state laws could provide an opportunity for ex-spouses to venue shop until they find a state that will alter previously settled custody agreements. Furthermore, proponents also point out that many servicemember custody battles may involve up to three states which further compounds the problem; the state of the original custody order, the state where the child is residing, and the state where the servicemember is stationed. Proponents argue federal legislation establishing a national standard for resolving military child custody cases would resolve the inconsistencies among the states, create more certainty in the process, and enhance military readiness and morale.", "Opponents of a federal standard argue that the issue of child custody and any family law matter are the proper province of state law. In a 2011 white paper on federal military child custody, the American Bar Association (ABA) noted that, rather than encouraging states to pass laws, proposed legislation would federalize the area of child custody, removing any incentive for states to pass or improve existing custody laws protecting servicemembers. According to the ABA, the states have the background and expertise to write, pass and enforce such legislation. In addition, the ABA argues there is \"no single national standard\" for the return of child custody after a deployment, nor should there be. The ABA writes,", "Throughout the area of family law, the states have been preeminent, as against the concept of \"single standard\" whether in the area of military pension division, grounds for divorce for military personnel, or establishment of family support. Each case is unique, and a single national standard would tie up military cases involving custody into a federal straightjacket.... It is not the province of federal law to provide detailed and specific instructions on how to handle child custody cases, whether these involve custodial parents who are members of the armed forces, the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency or the federal civil service. Congress should not interject itself into writing rules for custody and visitation; this is the responsibility of state courts.", "Opponents also argue that passage of federal child custody legislation would lead directly to federal court involvement where the final custody determination will be made by federal judges who are not versed in family law issues\u2014not to mention the increased cost, delay, and uncertainty for all parties involved due to increased oversight by the federal courts.

There is rarely, if ever, a single variable that plays as the sole determiner in child custody decisions. Therefore, although a DOD review of 33 military child custody cases did not reveal a single instance in which deployments or threat of deployments was the sole factor in withholding custody or loss of custody from a servicemember, the effects of deployments on the child's best interest was considered by courts in some cases as one of the myriad of factors analyzed in determining the best interest of the child.", "Supporters of federal legislation argue this is not always the case and all too often, state courts disproportionately use a servicemember's military service against them, therefore, a federal standard is needed to prohibit a court from using deployment or the possibility of deployment when determining the best interest of a child. However, opponents point to the DOD's study as evidence there is no reported child custody case in which deployment or the threat of deployment was the sole factor in any initial determination of custody or loss of custody by a servicemember. Furthermore, opponents argue such legislation, if enacted, would ignore any potential effects deployments would or could have on a child and would ultimately place the rights of servicemembers over those of the best interest of the child\u2014which is and should be the ultimate determinant in child custody cases.

According to the American Bar Association (ABA), such language would not prevent removal to federal court under 28 USC \u00a7 1442a and cannot prevent federal review of the enforcement of a right conferred under federal statute. Sighting the legal precedence established in Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., 288 U.S. 476, 53 S.Ct. 477, 77 L.Ed. 903 (1933), the ABA points out that, \"Federal jurisdiction may be invoked to vindicate a right or privilege claimed under federal statute.\" In the opinion of the ABA, federal rights such as those proposed in H.R. 1898 would lead directly to federal court involvement in military child custody cases. According to the ABA,", "Whenever counsel wants to avoid unpleasant results in state court, the procedure of removal to federal court is the logical next step. While Mr. Turner's bill doesn't create a federal right of action, it says nothing about the existing remedy of removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442a if the defendant is a servicemember-parent.

All seven federal child custody bills passed in the House and introduced in the Senate since 2008 have not made it out of Senate committees.

Our General Counsel has reviewed the various state law protections for Service members. We find that, at present, some level of protection for Service members facing child custody issues exists in approximately 28 states, but the states' approaches to the issues vary widely. Many of these variances no doubt reflect different societal dimensions of the problem in different communities across the country. Thus, we have concluded that it would be unwise to push for federal legislation in an area that is typically a matter of state law concern.", "However, Secretary Gates did go on to acknowledge in the letter a number of steps that he and DOD should take in an effort to ensure protection of Service members in child custody cases to include", "Personally contacting the governors of each of the states that have yet to pass legislation addressing the special considerations of child custody cases in the military and to urge them to pass such legislation; Including concerns over child custody matters on the list of the Department's 10 Key Quality of Life Issues that were presented to governors, state legislators and other state officials; Improving liaison efforts between the Department's Office of Legal Policy and the Department's ten Regional State Liaisons to aggressively reach out to state officials whose legislators have not addressed military custody concerns to provide them with appropriate and effective draft language and to develop a general strategy for focusing on those states with the largest military populations; Having the military service Judge Advocates General and Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant ensure they are doing all they can to work with the American Bar Association (ABA) to publicize, emphasize and support the ABA's national pro bono project to provide Service members free legal representation from some of the country's most accomplished child custody practitioners; and, Engaging with the military services to update and standardize Family Care Plans (FCPs) across the services...

This proposal, which has been included in substantially the same form for the last three legislative sessions, would disrupt State domestic schemes, discourage passage of broader, more helpful State laws, and increase cost, delay, and uncertainty due to increased oversight by the Federal courts. The Department applauds the efforts by almost thirty States to pass legislation that addresses the special circumstances facing parents who have dropped their own affairs to take up the burdens of the nation, and encourages the remaining States to consider similar legislation. The Department also recognizes the complexities of such cases, and the difficulties in balancing the interests of the Servicemember against the best interest of the child and the consequences of a parent's absence due to military service. The States, however, are in the best position to balance these equities within the context of their domestic relations laws.

Richards and Kessler, 504 U.S. 689, 703-04 (1992).", "There is no evidence of any trend in family courts to remove custody of minor children from servicemembers solely as a result of deployment or the prospect of deployment. The vast majority of cases reported by the media in which such allegations have been made involve servicemembers who ultimately prevail in litigation against their former spouses (or the other biological parent of the child involved), and who are understandably unhappy about the expense in attorney fees and time that such litigation causes. However, no legislation can prevent dedicated ex-spouses from filing change of custody actions and efforts at \"one size fits all\" statutes that mandate a particular outcome based on a single factor are ill-advised and unworkable. [emphasis in original]", "The Department believes that effective legislation on the state level more appropriately address the issues of child custody related to military service. Moreover, the most effective measure to minimize the potential disruption of child custody litigation involving deployed or deploying servicemembers is an appropriate Family Care Plan, which emphasizes early consultation with the non-custodial parent concerning custody arrangements in the event of deployment.", "Although military service was not the sole factor\u2014positively or negatively\u2014in the custody decisions presented, the DOD's report does exclude such service as playing a contributing role in the final decision as to the best interest of the child. Thus, the House Armed Services Committee was not wholly satisfied with the DOD's report and expressed concern with its conclusions with language in H.Rept. 111-491 on the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 5136 ).", "The committee is concerned the Department limited the scope of the report to cases where military service was the sole factor in determining custody instead of cases where it was an issue in the custody dispute.", "The committee is aware that during a hearing held by the House Veteran's Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity in February 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD) witness testified that the department had to ''resort to anecdotal data'' in the course of preparing the report mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The report discusses the challenges faced with gathering data through available case law research tools and the limited information to conduct detailed research required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. From this, the committee concludes that there is not sufficient data available to ascertain the full scope of how many members of the Armed Forces experience the loss of child custody as a result of their service. Although the committee is encouraged with the Department's efforts to encourage states to change their laws to better support service members and its efforts to better educate service members who may have potential child custody issues; the committee continues to support the need for congressional legislation to provide maximum protection for our service members and their children, who, while deployed, remain at risk of having that deployment used against them to determine or change child custody arrangements.", "Nevertheless, on February 15, 2011 outgoing Secretary Gates sent a letter to Representative Turner withdrawing his objections to the federal child custody legislation. No specific reason was cited by Secretary Gates for his change in position and the judge advocates in the Pentagon who had consistently opposed the proposed legislation were not consulted before the letter was sent. In the letter, Secretary Gates wrote,", "I have been giving this matter a lot of thought and believe the Department of Defense should change its position to one where they are willing to consider whether appropriate legislation can be crafted that provides Service members with a federal uniform standard of protection in cases where it is established that military service is the sole factor involved in a child custody decision involving a Service member ... we should work with Congress to pursue an acceptable legislative formula.", "Since Secretary Gates' reversal in position and his departure in July, 2011, DOD support for federal child custody legislation has been somewhat in question. In testimony before the HASC, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's support for child custody legislation was questioned as well as his support in opposing efforts by the Uniform Law Commission in drafting the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act (UDPCVA) of 2012. In response to such questioning, Secretary Panetta stated, \"As I indicated to you in my letter, I support the efforts that you've made, you've provided tremendous leadership on this issue, and I will do the same with regards to the amendments on the Senate side.\" However, when the legislation passed in the House version of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, Secretary Panetta responded with a letter to Representative Turner on April 30, 2012 stating, \"the bill as written ... and now passed by the House ... needs a small but critical revision and that without it, the bill would appear to constitute a federal mandate to state courts that they, in certain circumstances, subordinate the best interest of the child to the interest of an adult service member. As I [Secretary Panetta] understand it, the best interest of the child should always be the highest priority in child custody cases.\" Secretary Panetta expressed his concern by writing,", "As a lawyer and former legislator, I am sensitive to avoiding legislation that dictates an outcome in certain court cases, without regard to the best interests of the parties before the court in the particular situation\u2014that is especially important when children are involved. One potential solution is to add the words \"as the sole factor\" between the words \"deployment\" and \"in determining\" at lines 25-26 of page 2 of the bill. We believe this simple addition preserves a degree of flexibility that enables the court to always fashion a remedy in the best interest of the child.", "The language \"as the sole factor\" was incorporated into the latest legislative proposal ( H.R. 1898 ). However, no further statements have been made by DOD since former Secretary Panetta's letter to Representative Turner.

According to Mr. Fish, \"States are all across the board on those issues, so the impetus for the uniform act was to provide states with a well-conceived piece of legislation that takes the best practices from all the states that we have seen and give them some guidance.\"", "The Uniform Law Commission opposes any federal legislation that seeks to protect deployed servicemembers in child custody cases based on the argument that family law is a state's rights issue.

Mr. Fish argues that the Uniform Law Commission's approach \"maintains states' rights and protects service members across the country, without creating an invasive federal system that is just going to confuse child custody.\"", "Representative Turner disagrees with Mr. Fish's assessment and argues his bill would not create federal jurisdiction for custody matters, but instead would ensure minimum protections for military parents: \"Our bill only establishes a floor minimum ...
