Forty percent of HOME funds are allocated to states and 60% are allocated to localities.

This concern stemmed from an increasing awareness of a variety of problems related to housing, including homelessness, families living in sub-standard housing, and decreasing opportunities for homeownership. The concern over these issues led to a number of efforts to focus attention on housing policy, including the creation of a National Housing Task Force that included housing policy experts and industry leaders. In March 1988, the task force produced a report on its findings. Among the housing issues that the task force report identified was a diminishing supply of rental and homeownership housing that was affordable to low-income households.", "In a 1988 hearing on the task force report, some members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs suggested that federal funding for housing programs was inadequate to meet the affordable housing needs identified in the report. Most federal housing assistance distributed to states and localities at the time was restricted to specific uses, such as Section 8 vouchers or Public Housing projects. Furthermore, programs that did give communities flexibility to choose how to use their funds, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, were primarily meant to fund economic development and community revitalization activities and restricted the ways in which funding could be used for affordable housing (for example, CDBG funds could be used for some housing rehabilitation but could not generally be used to construct new housing units). Concerned that existing programs were not meeting the nation's affordable housing needs, members of the Housing Task Force argued to the committee that the level of federal funding specifically dedicated to affordable housing should be increased in order to fully address affordable housing issues. At the same time, task force members argued that local jurisdictions should be allowed more control over the ways in which they used any such federal affordable housing funding.", "In 1990, Congress passed a major housing bill that responded to some of the issues raised by the Housing Task Force and other experts. The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act ( P.L. 101-625 ), or NAHA, stated that the nation's housing policy was not meeting the goal of providing \"decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable living environments for all Americans\" that was first set out in the Housing Act of 1949. The law revised, amended, or repealed several existing housing programs and authorized some new programs, including the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (often just referred to as HOME).", "HOME is the largest federal block grant program that provides funding dedicated exclusively to increasing the availability of adequate, affordable housing for low-and very low-income households. The program places a particular emphasis on giving states and localities flexibility in how they achieve their affordable housing goals, and funds can be used for a variety of activities related to both rental and owner-occupied housing. HOME is also designed to expand the capacity of states and localities to meet their long-term affordable housing needs by leveraging federal funding to attract state, local, and private investment in affordable housing and by strengthening the ability of government and nonprofit organizations to meet local housing needs.", "HOME is authorized by Title II of NAHA. HUD promulgated regulations governing the program in September 1996. In July 2013, HUD issued a final rule making significant revisions to certain program requirements, representing the first substantive changes to the regulations since they were first finalized in 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The HOME Program", "paragraphs": ["This section of the report describes the structure of the HOME program, including the requirements that states and localities must meet in order to receive their own allocations of HOME funds, eligible uses of program funds, and certain requirements that HOME-assisted housing must meet.

States and localities that meet certain requirements to receive their own allocations of HOME funds are referred to as \"participating jurisdictions\" (PJs).", "States are automatically eligible to become PJs and receive the greater of their formula grant amount or $3 million annually. Localities can only become PJs if they are metropolitan cities or urban counties, and if they meet two funding thresholds. First, localities must be eligible for a minimum amount of funding under the formula, usually $500,000. Once localities meet this threshold, they must also meet a second threshold: localities must dedicate a total of at least $750,000 to affordable housing activities, either by having a HOME formula grant of at least $750,000 or by making up the difference between their grant amount and the $750,000 threshold with their own funds or HOME funds provided by the state from the state's formula allocation. ", "Localities that do not meet the requirements to become participating jurisdictions may join with other contiguous localities to form consortia in order to reach the minimum funding thresholds. Localities that are not PJs can also participate in the HOME program by applying to their home state to receive a portion of the state's allocation of HOME funds. States in which no locality receives its own allocation of HOME funding have their grant amounts increased by $500,000.", "A state or locality that is otherwise eligible to receive HOME funds must submit a document describing how it plans to use HOME funds to meet its affordable housing needs for HUD's approval before it can become a PJ.

Once a state or locality has been designated a PJ, it remains one \u2013 and therefore continues to be eligible to receive its own allocation of HOME funds \u2013 unless its designation is revoked by the Secretary of HUD. The Secretary has the authority to revoke a jurisdiction's designation if he finds that the jurisdiction is not complying with program requirements, or if a locality's formula grant amount falls below certain thresholds over a specified period of time, although he is not required to do so.", "A participating jurisdiction can administer HOME funds itself, or it can designate a public agency or nonprofit organization to administer all or part of the HOME program on its behalf. Such an organization is referred to as a subrecipient. Participating jurisdictions or their subrecipients can distribute funds to a variety of organizations to undertake specific projects.

The Consolidated Plan also describes how the jurisdiction will leverage HOME funds to attract local, private, nonprofit, or other non-federal sources of funds for affordable housing, and it prioritizes projects by type and geographic location. While many activities are eligible uses of HOME dollars, participating jurisdictions must specify in their Consolidated Plan which activities they intend to fund. ", "As part of the consolidated planning process, PJs submit annual Action Plans that describe the specific activities that a PJ plans to undertake during the year to address its housing needs and make progress towards the goals that are included in its Consolidated Plan. PJs also submit annual performance reports on their use of funds and their progress towards their goals. ", "The Consolidated Plan is meant to be the product of \"a participatory process among citizens, organizations, businesses, and other stakeholders\" in a community. The HOME regulations stress community participation, especially by low- and moderate-income individuals, in developing the Consolidated Plan, and jurisdictions must submit a \"citizen participation plan\" that describes how citizens have been included and consulted in the process. ", "In 2012, HUD implemented certain changes to the Consolidated Planning process. Specifically, HUD began providing additional data and mapping tools for PJs to utilize for planning purposes. The public can also access these data and mapping tools, which is intended to enable the community to be a more informed part of the consolidated planning process. Furthermore, HUD now requires Consolidated Plans to be submitted through a standardized template in the Integrated Disbursement & Information System (IDIS), the computer system into which PJs report their activities and uses of HOME funds. According to HUD, the new data are expected to help PJs produce better Consolidated Plans that more fully reflect local needs and to increase public participation in the process. The ability to submit plans directly to IDIS through a standard template is expected to make it easier for PJs to produce and submit Consolidated Plans, and to make it easier for HUD to track PJs' progress toward the goals that they include in their plans.

The matching funds must be devoted to affordable housing activities that are eligible under the HOME guidelines, but they do not necessarily have to support projects that use HOME funds. The match can also take many forms, including in-kind contributions such as labor, construction materials, and land for HOME-eligible projects. Other contributions, such as foregone taxes, other foregone fees, and infrastructure improvements, may also count toward the matching requirement if they are used specifically for projects funded by HOME dollars. The matching requirement may not be met using federal funds.", "The matching requirement must be met in the same fiscal year that HOME funds are used, but if a jurisdiction provides more matching funds than are required in a given year, it can carry those funds forward to meet the matching requirement in subsequent years.

Leveraging can be an important concept for affordable housing because attracting multiple funding sources makes projects more feasible, and because the ability to attract other sources of funds could reduce the amount of federal funding that needs to be invested in a project. Attracting other types of funding for affordable housing can also help to build the capacity of organizations that might not be able to undertake projects without the assistance of HOME funds. HOME does not have a specific leveraging requirement, although PJs do have to meet the matching requirement described previously. ", "HUD reports leveraging statistics for HOME. According to HUD, every dollar of HOME funds used for housing units that were completed between FY1992 (the first year in which the program was first funded) and July 31, 2014, attracted $4.16 in non-HOME funds. This amount includes other federal funding sources as well as funding from other sources (such as states, local governments, and private entities).", "In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report analyzing the leveraging statistics that HUD and the Department of the Treasury report for various programs and calculating alternative leverage measures. It found that alternative measures of a program's leverage ratio may provide a more complete picture of how effective a program is at leveraging specific types of funds. For example, according to the GAO report, for HOME-assisted units completed in FY2006, HUD's reported leverage ratio was $4 of non-HOME funding for every dollar of HOME funding. Using the same data, GAO found that for every dollar of HOME funding used in units that were completed in FY2006, HOME-assisted units used $1.92 of private spending, $1.33 of other federal spending, and $0.76 of state or local spending. Therefore, a leverage ratio that only took into account other non-federal sources of funding for HOME-assisted projects completed in 2006 would be $2.68 for every dollar of HOME funding ($1.92 of private funding and $0.76 of state and local funding)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Uses of HOME Funds", "paragraphs": ["HUD reports a number of HOME program performance statistics.

Therefore, the breakdown of total HOME funding used for each eligible activity looks somewhat different than the number of units completed for each eligible activity. For example, rehabilitated units accounted for just over one-third of the completed units (including TBRA) that used HOME funds, but the funds used for rehabilitation account for nearly 43% of total HOME funds expended on completed units (a total of about $12 billion since the program's inception). Acquired units accounted for over a quarter of completed units that use HOME funds, but account for only about 15% of the funding (about $4 billion). New construction and TBRA each accounted for about 20% of completed units, but new construction accounts for nearly 40% of the funds spent (almost $11 billion) while TBRA accounts for only 3% of funds spent (less than $1 billion). Figure 5 illustrates the amount of funding that has been spent on each activity since the program began.", "The difference between the percentage of funding going toward each activity and the percentage of completed units of each activity type reflects the difference in the average investment of HOME funds required for each activity. A newly constructed unit costs the most, on average: a newly constructed unit costs an average of $38,000 in HOME funds, while the average cost of rehabilitating a unit is $24,000 in HOME funds and the average cost of acquiring a unit is about $11,000 in HOME funds.", "Whether a PJ uses HOME funds for rehabilitation, acquisition, or new construction depends in part on the types of programs it is administering and the housing needs it is trying to meet. As shown in Figure 6 , about three quarters of home buyer units that receive HOME funds use those funds for acquisition costs (such as down payment assistance). A relatively small number of home buyer units use HOME funds for rehabilitation or new construction. In contrast, virtually all owner-occupied units with HOME investments use those funds for rehabilitation activities. For rental units that use HOME funds, about half of the units are rehabilitated.

Other OIG reports have raised questions about whether HUD has ensured PJs' compliance with program rules. For example, a 2010 OIG audit report found that, in some cases, HUD had not ensured that PJs included appropriate resale and recapture provisions in projects that used HOME funds. The OIG has also reported conducting over 60 external audits of specific PJs in recent years, some of which were undertaken at the request of HUD.", "Another source of concern about HUD's oversight of the HOME program was a series of investigative articles published in the Washington Post beginning in the spring of 2011.

The articles suggested that nearly 15% of HOME-assisted rental projects were experiencing significant delays, and that almost 700 rental housing projects that had been awarded a total of $400 million in HOME funds over the program's life had since stalled and were either incomplete or unoccupied. The article also claimed that HUD did not properly oversee funds that are awarded to PJs in order to identify such stalled or abandoned projects, that it had difficulty tracking program funds, and that it did not adequately demand reimbursement from PJs for misused funds.

It also noted that some stalled projects were the result of a weak economy rather than mismanagement or other problems. HUD argued that its oversight of the program was adequate and that it had de-obligated HOME funds from PJs that did not meet commitment and expenditure deadlines and recovered additional funds that were spent improperly by PJs.
