Some states have SBE-FPs: they have SBEs but use the federal information technology platform, including the federal exchange website www.Healthcare.gov. In states with FFEs, the exchange may be operated by the federal government alone or in conjunction with the state. States may have different structures for their individual and SHOP exchanges.", "Consumers who obtain coverage through the individual exchange may be eligible for financial assistance from the federal government. Financial assistance in the individual exchanges is available in two forms: premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. Small businesses that use the SHOP exchange may be eligible for small business health insurance tax credits. The tax credits assist small businesses with the cost of providing health insurance coverage to employees.", "The ACA generally requires that health insurance plans offered through an exchange are qualified health plans (QHPs). To be a certified as a QHP, a plan must be offered by a state-licensed issuer and must meet specified requirements, including covering the essential health benefits (EHB). QHPs sold in the individual and SHOP exchanges must comply with the same state and federal requirements that apply to QHPs and other health plans offered outside of the exchanges in the individual and small-group markets, respectively. Exchanges also may offer variations of QHPs, such as child-only or catastrophic plans, and non-QHP dental-only plans.", "This report provides an overview of the various components of the health insurance exchanges. It begins with summary information about how exchanges are structured and then discusses both individual and SHOP exchanges in terms of eligibility and enrollment, financial assistance for certain exchange consumers and small businesses, and enrollment assistance entities.

In an individual exchange, eligible consumers can compare and purchase non-group insurance for themselves and their families and can apply for premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. In a SHOP exchange, small businesses can compare and purchase small-group insurance and can apply for small business health insurance tax credits; in addition, employees of small businesses can enroll in plans offered by their employers on a SHOP exchange. Besides facilitating consumers' and small businesses' purchase of coverage (by operating a web portal, making determinations of eligibility for coverage and any financial assistance, and offering different forms of enrollment assistance), the other major function of the exchanges is to certify, recertify, and otherwise monitor the plans that participate in those marketplaces.

States also may have a state-based exchange using a federal platform (SBE-FP), which means they have an SBE but use the federally facilitated information technology (IT) platform (i.e., HealthCare.gov).", "For the 2018 plan year, 34 states have FFEs, 12 states have SBEs, and 5 states have SBE-FPs. In addition, state involvement in the FFEs may vary. In many states with FFEs, the exchange is wholly operated and administered by HHS.

One state is exempted from operating a SHOP exchange. For the 2018 plan year, most states' individual and SHOP exchanges are administered in the same way (i.e., both state-based or both federally facilitated).

Undocumented individuals are prohibited from purchasing coverage through the exchanges, even if they were to pay the entire premium without financial assistance. ", "Consumers can use their state's exchange website (Healthcare.gov or a state-run site) to compare and enroll in plans, and the exchange websites are required to display a calculator that estimates consumers' costs after any cost-sharing reductions or premium tax credits for which they are eligible (see \" Premium Tax Credits and Cost-Sharing Reductions \" in this report). Consumers may be linked to Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollment pages if they are eligible. ", "In addition to using the exchange websites, consumers can enroll by phone, by mail, or in person\u2014including through an agent, broker, or plan issuer\u2014as available by state. Enrollment assistance is available for those who want it (see \" Individual and SHOP Exchange Enrollment Assistance \" in this report).", "Once the exchange receives and verifies consumers' eligibility and enrollment information, it may continue to serve as a conduit through which consumers pay their premiums to their issuers.

The OEP for calendar year 2018 coverage was November 1, 2017, to December 15, 2017, for FFE and SBE-FP states (see Table 1 for enrollment periods). States with SBEs may observe different OEPs. For 2018 coverage, all 12 SBEs' OEPs lasted longer than the federal OEP. The OEP for plan year 2019 is currently set as November 1, 2018, to December 15, 2018, for FFE and SBE-FP states. ", "Consumers also may be allowed to enroll for coverage in an exchange if they qualify for a s pecial e nrollment p eriod (SEP). Generally, consumers qualify for SEPs due to a change in personal circumstances\u2014for example, a change in marital status or number of dependents\u2014or loss of qualifying coverage. HHS also may choose to offer SEPs or extend an OEP for some or all consumers due to broadly applicable circumstances. In addition, consumers generally may enroll in Medicaid or CHIP whenever they qualify, regardless of their state's exchange OEP.", "Annual individual exchange enrollment estimates to date are shown in Table 1 . Given the exchange eligibility determination process as well as the OEPs and SEPs, data on exchange enrollment are released in stages. Pre-effectuated enrollment is the number of unique individuals who have been determined eligible to enroll in an exchange plan and have selected a plan. These individuals may or may not have submitted the first premium payment. In general, cumulative and final pre-effectuated enrollment estimates are released during and soon after an annual open enrollment period. ", "Subsequently, effectuated enrollment is the number of unique individuals who have been determined eligible to enroll in an exchange plan, have selected a plan, and have submitted the first premium payment for an exchange plan. Effectuated enrollment estimates generally are point-in-time and may change over the coverage year. For example, due to changes in life circumstances, an individual may disenroll (e.g., if later offered coverage through an employer) or enroll (e.g., given eligibility for an SEP) in an exchange plan.

Eligibility for such assistance is based primarily on income and provided in the form of premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions.", "The premium tax credit is generally available to consumers who do not have access to public coverage (e.g., Medicaid) or employment-based coverage that meets certain standards. The credit is designed to reduce an eligible individual's cost of purchasing health insurance coverage through the exchange. The amount of the premium tax credit is based on a statutory formula and varies from person to person. It is designed to provide larger credit amounts to individuals with lower incomes compared to those with higher incomes. ", "The premium credit is refundable, so individuals may claim the full credit amount when filing their taxes, even if they have little or no federal income tax liability. The credit also is advanceable, so instead of waiting until they file taxes, individuals may choose to receive the credit on a monthly basis to coincide with the payment of insurance premiums (technically, these advance payments go directly to issuers). Advance payments automatically reduce monthly premiums by the credit amount. Therefore, the direct cost of insurance to a consumer eligible for premium credits generally will be lower than the advertised cost for a given exchange plan. ", "In addition to premium tax credits, certain consumers also may be eligible to receive cost-sharing reductions that reduce out-of-pocket expenses. There are two forms of cost-sharing reductions, and individuals may receive both if they meet the applicable eligibility requirements.", "The first form of cost-sharing assistance reduces the annual out-of-pocket limit applicable to an individual's exchange plan. Annual out-of-pocket limits apply to all plans in the exchanges and to other plans under the ACA. In 2018, the annual out-of-pocket limit is $7,350 for a self-only plan and $14,700 for coverage other than self-only (e.g., a family plan). In 2019, those limits will be $7,900 and $15,800, respectively. This form of cost-sharing assistance further lowers the spending cap for eligible consumers. The second form reduces cost-sharing requirements applicable to an individual's exchange plan. All exchange plans must meet certain requirements related to actuarial value, or the percentage of allowed health care expenses that issuers will cover. This form of cost-sharing assistance reduces the percentage of costs that the individual is responsible for, effectively raising the actuarial value of the plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SHOP Exchanges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility and Enrollment Process", "paragraphs": ["Certain small businesses are eligible to use the SHOP exchanges. For the purposes of SHOP exchange participation, states may define small employers (or small businesses) as employers that have 50 or fewer full-time employees or employers that have 100 or fewer full-time employees. A majority of states define small as having 50 or fewer employees, and only four states employ the 100-or-fewer-employee definition for their SHOP exchanges. As of 2017, all states have the option to allow large businesses to use SHOP exchanges, as well, but no states have taken that option.", "To participate in a SHOP exchange, a small business must offer coverage to all of its full-time employees , meaning those working 30 or more hours per week on average. The business may, but is not required to, offer coverage to part-time or other employees. Employees must meet the same citizenship and other eligibility requirements that apply in the individual exchanges. ", "For an employee to obtain coverage through a SHOP exchange, a SHOP-eligible employer must select one or more plan options on the SHOP exchange for its employees to choose from. Then, employees can visit the SHOP exchange website to compare their employer's plan options and to enroll. Employers and their employees also can work with a SHOP-registered broker or directly with a plan issuer instead of going through their SHOP exchange's web portal (or if their SHOP exchange does not offer a web portal with enrollment functionality, as discussed below). ", "Small employers that want to offer more than one plan option to their employees generally are able to do so. Via the employee choice method, also called horizontal choice , the employer can allow its employees to select any plan at a certain coverage and value tier (e.g., a certain metal level of actuarial value).

In subsequent guidance, CMS extended that policy for plan years beginning in 2015-2019, still for SB-SHOPs only. As of April 2016, CMS indicated that SB-SHOPs would need to implement online portals in time for plan years beginning in 2019 and outlined different options for those states to consider, including transitioning to the federal IT platform (becoming an SB-FP-SHOP) or applying for an ACA Section 1332 waiver to obtain an exception to the requirement to have a SHOP exchange at all. ", "Via the \"2019 Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters\" (2019 Payment Notice) finalized in April 2018, HHS signaled a new policy direction, citing generally low employer participation in the SHOP exchanges and decreasing issuer participation. For plan years beginning in 2018, the direct enrollment approach is not just a transitional option for SB-SHOP states: it is the only option in FF-SHOP and SB-FP-SHOP states. Although small businesses using the SHOP exchange in those states still will be able to use the Healthcare.gov portal to browse plans and determine their eligibility for small business tax credits (discussed below), they will not be able to enroll in a plan through the SHOP web portal. States with SB-SHOPs also can choose to maintain or return to a direct enrollment approach or to maintain online enrollment, if they have it.", "HHS also confirmed in the 2019 Payment Notice that because of these reductions in federal SHOP web portal functionality, going forward, state-based SHOP exchanges will not be able to use the federal IT platform. In other words, HHS is eliminating the SB-FP-SHOP option (discussed above in \" Types of Exchanges \"). The two states that currently use this option, Kentucky and Nevada, may continue to do so if desired, knowing that the Healthcare.gov functionality is to be diminished.", "As of June 2018, three SB-SHOP states still use their initial direct enrollment approaches and five other SB-SHOPs are transitioning to this approach and/or are instructing small businesses to enroll directly with issuers off the exchange because no issuers are offering plans in their SHOP exchange in 2018.
