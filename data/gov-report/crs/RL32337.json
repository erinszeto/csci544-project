Uribe has increased the size of the military and police, largely through a one-time 1.2%war tax on wealthy individuals and businesses, and created a \"civilian informers\" program. Withregard to ending narcotics trafficking, President Uribe substantially increased resources for the aerialfumigation program, vowing to spray all coca crops by the end of his term in 2006.", "There are indications that this hard-line approach has produced measurable results. PresidentUribe announced at the end of 2003 that 4,294 members of armed groups had deserted, an 80%increase over the previous year. Police are being redeployed to areas from which they had beenpreviously ousted by guerrilla groups. The homicide rate dropped 22%, and the rate of ruralmassacres dropped by 37% from 2002. The number of kidnappings fell by 32% over the same timeperiod. On the economic front, private investment increased 17% and the economy grew by 3.3%in 2003. Growth projections for 2004 are in the 3.5% to 4% range. (9) ", "AUC Demobilization and Amnesty Proposal. OnJuly 15, 2003, the Uribe Administration announced an agreement with leaders of the AUC thatwould result in the demobilization of its members by the end of 2005. It is estimated that as manyas 5,000 fighters operate outside of the AUC, some of whom are negotiating separately with thegovernment, and others who are not participating at all. The Organization of American Statesestablished a Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia in February 2004 to mediate thedemobilization process.As part of demobilization, President Uribe has proposed controversiallegislation that would grant conditional amnesties to illegal combatants, which means that it couldalso apply to FARC and ELN fighters if they decide to enter into negotiations with the government.The United States has designated the AUC a foreign terrorist organization and has requested theextradition of two top AUC leaders, Carlos Casta\u00c3\u00b1o and Salvador Mancuso, on five indictments ofconspiracy to import cocaine into the United States. The State Department has confirmed that theUnited States will not drop its requests for the extradition of any Colombians under indictment inthe United States.", "The Uribe Administration argues that without the inducement of amnesties, or the possibilityof paying reparations to victims instead of serving jail sentences, paramilitary leaders and fighterswill be unwilling to demobilize, and a spiral of violence will continue in Colombia. Critics of theproposal include Colombian legislators, political commentators, and international human rightsorganizations. They argue that AUC forces have been responsible for some of the worst violationsof human rights, including massacres of civilians, and that the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights, to which Colombia is party, requires that states will ensure that violators are broughtto justice. Other critics argue that the paramilitaries are not respecting the accord and are continuingmilitary activities. President Uribe's proposal would allow the president to determine whichmembers of illegal armed groups would qualify for suspended sentences. Combatants who qualifywould have to agree to disarm and to demonstrate support for the peace process. Combatants wouldalso agree to make reparations, of money or assets, to victims directly, or into a government fund forvictims. The amnesty process requires that fighters appear before a criminal court where crimes willbe admitted and penalties imposed. Fighters would be convicted of crimes and then alternativepenalties to prison would be determined by a judge. In response to criticism, President Uribesubmitted revised legislation that requires minimum jail sentences of at least five years. Theproposal is pending before the Colombian Congress.", "Coca Cultivation and Eradication. Upon takingoffice, President Uribe announced that aerial eradication, (10) along with alternative crop development, would form asignificant basis of the government's efforts. The Plan Colombia eradication spraying programbegan in December 2000 with operations by the U.S. funded counternarcotics brigade in Putumayo. Despite early indications that coca cultivation had increased by 25% in 2001, Colombian and U.S.officials reported decreases of 15% in 2002. The United Nations, using a different method of surveyand calculation, estimated a 30% decrease over the same time period. According to the StateDepartment, cultivation of opium poppy declined by 24% in 2002, and 10% in 2003. Cocacultivation in 2003 declined by 21%, according to the State Department. It is believed that the PlanColombia goal of having sprayed 50% of the country's coca crop by the end of 2005 may have beenaccomplished two years ahead of schedule. At the same time, however, the Office of National DrugControl Policy reported that coca cultivation remained stable in Colombia in 2004. It should benoted, however, that spraying does not prevent, although it may discourage, the replanting of illicitcrops.", "Aerial fumigation has been controversial. Critics charge that it has unknown environmentaland health effects, and that it deprives farmers of their livelihood, particularly in light of a lack ofcoordination with alternative development programs. Proponents argue that both eradication andalternative development programs need time to work. The Secretary of State, in consultation withthe Environmental Protection Agency, certified on December 15, 2003 that the chemicals used inspray operations do not pose a risk to health or the environment.", "Funding and Request for Colombia.", "Under the P.L. 106-246 Plan Colombia funding, Colombia received $832million in State Department funds for assistance to the Colombian police and military, economic andalternative development assistance, aid for displaced persons, human rights, administration of justice,and other governance programs.
