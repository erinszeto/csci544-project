The Reference case projection assumes trend improvement in known technologies, along with a view of economic and demographic trends reflecting the current central views of leading economic forecasters and demographers.

While electricity generation remained flat after 2010, CO 2 emissions continued a general trend of reduction. Thus in 2016, electricity generation was essentially equivalent to generation in 2005, while CO 2 emissions were 25% below 2005 levels.", "The decrease in CO 2 emissions in the electricity sector in recent years was likely a result of several factors. The economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 likely played a substantial role in both generation and emission levels. The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) decreased in both of those years. Historically, annual GDP decreases are a relatively uncommon occurrence: The United States has seen an annual decrease in GDP 7 times over the last 50 years. The 2.9% GDP decrease in 2009 was the largest GDP decrease during that time frame.", "Another factor contributing to the recent decrease in CO 2 emissions from electricity generation was the change in the electricity generation portfolio. Electricity is generated from a variety of sources in the United States. Some sources\u2014nuclear, hydropower, and some renewables\u2014directly produce no CO 2 emissions with their electricity generation. Fossil fuels generate different amounts of CO 2 emissions per unit of electricity generated. Figure 6 illustrates the relative comparison of CO 2 emissions between electricity produced from coal, petroleum, and natural gas. As the figure indicates, petroleum-fired electricity yields approximately 80% of the CO 2 emission of coal-fired electricity per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Natural-gas-fired electricity from a steam generation unit yields approximately 60% of the CO 2 emissions of coal-fired electricity per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Natural-gas-fired electricity from a combined cycle unit yields approximately 43% of the CO 2 emissions of coal-fired electricity per kilowatt-hour of electricity.

Natural gas: Between 2005 and 2016, natural-gas-fired generation increased by 81%. Its contribution to total electricity generation increased from 19% to 34%.

Its contribution to total electricity generation increased from 2% to 8%. Petroleum: Between 2005 and 2016, petroleum-fired generation decreased by 87%. Its contribution to total electricity generation decreased from 2% to less than 1%.", "Several factors likely played a role in these recent changes. Due in large part to technological advances\u2014particularly directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing \u2014U.S. natural gas production increased dramatically (by 46%) between 2005 and 2016. Natural gas production levels reached record levels in 2011 and have increased further each year until declining in 2016. Relatedly, the weighted average annual price of natural gas dropped by about 60% between 2005 and 2015. By comparison, the weighted average annual coal price increased by about 40% during that time frame. This change in relative fuel prices has played a key role in altering the economics of power generation (i.e., order of dispatch), leading to some natural gas displacement of coal in particular regions of the country.", " Figure 8 provides a more detailed breakdown of the changes in generation from non-hydro renewable energy sources. The vast majority of the increased generation from renewable energy over the past 11 years is due to wind power, which increased 13-fold between 2005 and 2016. Although solar increased 67-fold over that time frame, the magnitude of wind generation dwarfs solar generation (227 Terawatt-hours of wind in 2016 versus 37 Terawatt-hours of solar). Energy from wood fuels has remained relatively constant during this time frame.

The rule would establish uniform national CO 2 emission performance rates\u2014measured in pounds of CO 2 per megawatt-hour of electricity generation\u2014and state-specific CO 2 emission rate and emission targets.
