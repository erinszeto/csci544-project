This report describes the federal tax structure, provides some statistics on the tax system as a whole, and presents analysis of selected tax concepts.", "The federal income tax is levied on an individual's taxable income, which is adjusted gross income (AGI) less deductions and exemptions. Tax rates, based on filing status (e.g., married filing jointly or single individual) determine the level of tax liability. Tax rates in the United States are progressive, such that higher levels of income are taxed at higher rates. Once tax liability is calculated, tax credits can be used to reduce tax liability. Tax deductions and tax credits are tools available to policy makers to increase or decrease the after-tax price of undertaking specific activities. Individuals with high levels of exemptions, deductions, and credits relative to income may be required to file under the alternative minimum tax (AMT).", "Corporate taxable income is also subject to varying rates, where those with higher levels of income pay higher levels of taxes. Social Security and Medicare tax rates are, respectively, 12.4% and 2.9%. In 2014, Social Security taxes are levied on the first $117,000 of wages. In 2015, the Social Security wage base is inflation-adjusted to $118,500, reflecting increases in average wages in the economy. Medicare taxes are assessed against all wage income. Federal excise taxes are levied on specific goods, such as transportation fuels, alcohol, tobacco, and telephones.", "In FY2013, individual income taxes accounted for 47% of total federal revenue. Social Security taxes accounted for 34%. Corporate income taxes accounted for 10% while excise taxes accounted for 3%. Estate and gift, customs, and miscellaneous taxes accounted for the remaining 6% of total revenue. Over time, the corporate income tax has become much less important as a revenue source while Social Security taxes have provided a larger share of total revenues.", "Analysis of tax statistics from the federal tax system as a whole leads to three conclusions: (1) federal revenue as a percentage of GDP is in line with historical trends; (2) the U.S. fiscal position is in line with the fiscal position of other industrialized nations (revenues and expenditures as a percentage of GDP are relatively low); and (3) over the past decade, average tax rates have fallen for individuals at all income levels, but have fallen more for lower-income individuals, reducing their share of overall tax liabilities.", "The final sections of this report analyze a number of tax concepts. Tax expenditures are revenue losses from special tax deductions, credits, and other benefits. Capital gains warrant special attention, as there is debate about their being taxed at a lower rate. Marriage tax penalties and bonuses, while reduced following legislation enacted in 2001 and 2003, still pose an inequity in the tax system. Tax deferral, or the timing of taxes, poses problems related to the timing of taxation, specifically with respect to capital gains. Depreciation is important, as accelerated depreciation schemes or expensing can influence firm behavior. Tax liability also depends on form of business organization. Finally, the issue of whether taxes can influence firms' competitiveness is reviewed.", "This report will be updated on enactment of major changes in the federal tax system."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The major sources of federal tax revenue are individual income taxes, Social Security and other payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, excise taxes, and estate and gift taxes.

This step of the process produces adjusted gross income (AGI), which is the basic measure of income under the federal income tax. Deductions from the income tax base that result in an individual's AGI are also known as \"above the line\" deductions. These deductions are available to all taxpayers, whether the taxpayer chooses to take the standard deduction or itemize deductions.", "The tax base is further reduced by either the standard deduction or individuals' itemized deductions. Itemized deductions are allowed for home mortgage interest payments, state and local income taxes, state and local property taxes, charitable contributions, medical expenses in excess of 10% of AGI, and for a variety of other items. For taxable years 2004 through 2013, at the election of the taxpayer, state and local sales taxes can be deducted as an alternative to state and local income taxes. ", "The tax base is reduced further by subtracting personal and dependent exemptions. Exemptions are a fixed amount to be subtracted from AGI. Exemptions are allowed for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, and each dependent. In 2014, the exemption amount per person is $3,950. For taxpayers with high levels of AGI, the personal and dependent exemptions are phased out.", "Federal income taxes are assessed on a taxpayer's taxable income. Taxable income equals AGI reduced by either the standard deductions or itemized deductions and personal and dependent exemptions. Figure 1 illustrates the computation of taxable income.", "The tax liability depends on the filing status of the taxpayer. There are four main filing categories: married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household, and single individual. The computation of a taxpayer's tax liability depends on their filing status.", "The income tax system is designed to be progressive, with marginal tax rates increasing as income increases. At a particular marginal tax rate, all individuals, regardless of their level of earnings, pay the same tax rate on their first dollar of taxable income. Once a taxpayer's income surpasses a threshold level placing them in a higher marginal tax bracket, the higher marginal tax rate is only applied on income that exceeds that threshold value. Currently, the individual income tax system has seven marginal income tax rates: 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%. These marginal income tax rates are applied against taxable income to arrive at a taxpayer's gross income tax liability.", "After a taxpayer's tax liability has been calculated, tax credits are subtracted from gross tax liability to arrive at a final tax liability. Major tax credits include the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, education tax credits, and the credit for child and dependent care expenses. ", "Not all income is subject to the marginal income tax rates noted above. Long-term capital gains\u2014that is, gain on the sale of assets held more than 12 months\u2014and qualified dividend income are taxed at lower tax rates.

As a benchmark, economists often turn to the Haig-Simons comprehensive income definitions. Here, taxable resources are defined as changes in a taxpayer's ability to consume during the tax year. Another way to view the individual income tax base is as an approximation of the sum of all labor and capital income earned or received over the course of the year. Under this view, the tax base resembles national income as measured by economists. In addition to labor and capital income, many transfer payments are also subject to taxation.", "There are a number of forms of what would broadly be defined as income that are excluded from taxable income in practice. For example, wage income of employees is taxed, although most contributions to employee pension and health insurance plans and certain other employee benefits are not included in wages subject to income tax. Employer contributions to Social Security are also excluded from wages. When pensions are received, they are included in income to the extent that they represent contributions originally excluded. If the taxpayer has the same tax rate when contributions are made and when pensions are received, this treatment is equivalent to eliminating tax on the earnings of pension plans. Some Social Security benefits are also subject to tax.", "Passive capital income, in the form of capital gains, interest, and dividends on financial instruments, is also taxed. The tax base excludes capital gains that are unrealized, such that capital gains are only taxed on realization. Unlike capital gains, assets earning interest are taxed on accrual. Taxes are paid on the interest earned in each tax year. Taxable interest income is added to a taxpayer's AGI and taxed according to the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. Interest that is earned on tax-exempt securities, such as those issued by state and local governments, is not subject to taxation. Like capital gains, dividends are taxed at a lower rate than other income. Qualified dividends are taxed at the same rate as capital gains. ", "Income from operating a business through a proprietorship, partnership, or small business corporation that elects to be treated similarly to a partnership (Subchapter S corporation), or through rental property (which reflects returns to both investment and effort) is also subject to tax. This income is the net of gross receipts reduced by such deductible costs as payments to labor, depreciation, costs of goods acquired for resale and other inputs, interest, and taxes. Some investment income of small businesses is subject to favorable treatment through provisions that allow costs of capital equipment to be expensed. Other income, such as miscellaneous income, gambling winnings, and royalties, is also included in the tax base.", "As noted above, there are several adjustments to the income made to determine adjusted gross income (AGI).

Wages are tax deductible, so labor's contribution to corporate revenue is excluded from the corporate tax base. Income produced by corporate capital investment includes that produced by corporate investment of borrowed funds, and that produced by investment of equity, or funds provided by stockholders. Profits from debt-financed investment are paid out as interest, which is deductible. Thus, the return to debt capital is excluded from the corporate tax base. Equity investments are financed by retained earnings and the sale of stock. The income equity investment generates is paid out as dividends and the capital gains that accrue as stock increases in value. Neither form of income is generally deductible. Thus, the base of the corporate income tax is the return to equity capital.", "Because of the nature of its base, the corporate income tax has several broad effects on the allocation of capital investment. First, it favors non-corporate investment\u2014for example, unincorporated business and owner-occupied housing\u2014over corporate investment. Second, it favors corporate debt over corporate equity investment since the former is not subject to the tax. However, while the base of the tax is equity income, the flow of capital out of the corporate sector and other economic adjustments probably cause the burden of the tax to spread to all owners of capital: owners of unincorporated business, bondholders, and homeowners. The tax can also shift from capital income to labor income, or even benefit labor income (with capital bearing more than 100% of the tax). The government agencies that provide distributional analysis allocate most of the corporate tax to capital.", "In evaluating the corporate tax, it is useful to ask why corporate profits are subject to separate taxation. Corporate equity profits are taxed twice, once at the corporate level and once under the individual income tax when they are received by stockholders as dividends or capital gains. As a consequence, taxes tend to steer investment away from the corporate sector. Further, corporations are not persons who can bear the burden of taxes, but merely legal entities through which individuals earn income. From this point of view, it is misleading to compare the tax burden of a corporation with that of an individual. The corporate tax, some argue, should be combined (\"integrated\") with the individual income tax in some manner. ", "On the other hand, there are arguments for maintaining the current tax structure where corporate profits are subject to a separate tax. First, it discourages the use of corporations as shelters from the individual income tax. Second, it likely enhances the tax system's progressivity. Third, integration of the individual and corporate taxes would present administrative difficulties. Fourth, the corporate tax has a degree of public support.

As an alternative to reduced capital gains tax rates, lock-in could be reduced by taxing capital gains on an accrual basis (as opposed to the current system, which taxes capital gains when they are realized) or by taxing capital gains passed on at death.

Ideally, a tax levied on income should be assessed when the income accrues to the taxpayer. However, as a result of many factors, taxes are often deferred into the future. This can happen when income is taxed when it is realized, rather than when it accrues or when there is a mismatch between when income is earned and the expenses associated with earning that income. Since money has a time value (a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future), tax deferral effectively lowers the tax rate on the income in question.", "Income from capital gains can be used to illustrate the benefits of tax deferral. For capital gains, the tax is assessed when the gain is realized rather than as it accrues.

In essence, the reason for this result is simply that, for the asset producing a capital gain, the tax on the appreciation in the first year was deferred, with the deferred tax remaining in the account and earning interest. The benefits of tax deferral increase the longer an asset is held and tax can be deferred.

This decline in value (depreciation) is a cost. Because assets gradually depreciate until they are worthless, the tax code permits firms gradually to deduct the full acquisition cost of an asset over a number of years.", "The tax code contains a set of rules that govern the rate at which depreciation deductions can be claimed. The rules determine the tax depreciation rate by specifying a recovery period and a depreciation method for different types of assets. An asset's recovery period is the number of years over which deductions for the asset's full cost must be spread. The applicable depreciation method determines how depreciation deductions are distributed among the different years of the recovery period. The slowest method is straight-line, in which equal deductions are taken each year. Declining balance methods, in which a fixed fraction of the cost less prior depreciation is deducted, cause larger shares to be taken in earlier years.", "Because of the time value of money, a tax deduction of a given dollar amount is worth more to a business the sooner it can be claimed.

If depreciation deductions can be claimed faster than an asset actually declines in value, a tax benefit exists; depreciation is said to be accelerated . If, on the other hand, depreciation deductions can be claimed more slowly than the corresponding asset actually depreciates, a tax penalty occurs. Only if depreciation deductions are claimed at the rate an asset actually depreciates do taxes confer neither a tax benefit nor a tax penalty.", "According to some estimates, current tax depreciation for some types of equipment is somewhat accelerated compared to economic depreciation. \"Bonus\" depreciation allowances that recent tax acts have provided for temporary periods may have further accelerated depreciation for certain equipment.

Because the nation's resources are limited, the theory holds, a narrowly targeted tax benefit will simply reshuffle the way resources are employed, drawing them into the favored industry and away from alternative uses. While exports in the favored sector may rise (or imports fall), theory predicts that the performance of other sectors will decline. Further, economics predicts that the effect of taxes on how the economy's resources are deployed diminishes the nation's economic vitality: market forces, not tax rules, are usually the best way to guarantee that resources are used efficiently.", "Policy makers or others at the national level may take a broader view of competitiveness and define it as the ability of the country as a whole to sell its exports\u2014not just the performance of one sector. Such a view might recommend, for example, a tax incentive for exporting, regardless of the product. But in this case, economic theory suggests that exchange rate adjustments will stymie any effect the export subsidy may have in improving the trade balance. Although implementation of an export subsidy may initially increase exports, the increase in exports raises the price of the dollar in currency markets, which, in turn, makes U.S. exports more expensive and imports cheaper. As a result, exports are predicted to fall and imports increase until any initial improvement in the balance of trade that may have occurred disappears. Further, to the extent that part of the export tax benefit is passed on to foreign consumers as lower prices, analysis indicates that the measure transfers economic welfare from U.S. taxpayers to foreign persons.", "Many economists would argue that taxes can alter the balance of trade in the short and medium term, but not in the way that is perhaps commonly thought. If a country runs a trade deficit, it is using more than it produces; and to do so, it must, in effect, borrow from abroad, importing the foreign investment that finances the deficit. The trade balance thus mirrors the balance on capital account, and it follows that taxes alter the trade balance not by their direct application to exports or imports, but by altering capital flows. For example, a cut in taxes on business investment in the United States increases the U.S. appetite for investment; foreign capital inflows accordingly increase and net U.S. exports (imports minus exports) fall. Or, a tax cut that increases the federal budget deficit can be expected to exert upward pressure on real interest rates, thereby attracting additional foreign capital and expanding the trade deficit. Conversely, a tax increase that reduces the budget deficit can also reduce the trade deficit.", "Finally, there are questions regarding whether tax preferences on capital rather than trade can enhance competitiveness for U.S. firms. For example, can taxes improve the economy by making U.S. firms that operate abroad more competitive, cutting their costs and helping them compete more effectively against foreign firms?
