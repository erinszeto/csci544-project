Empirical research has also led to conflicting results. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau argues that small creditors may have \"strong incentives and particular ability\" to make mortgages that accurately assess a borrower's ability to repay that larger lenders may not have. It is unclear, however, what the appropriate size thresholds should be and whether other factors, such as keeping the mortgage in portfolio, can compensate for a larger lender's possibly reduced incentives and ability. It is unclear how significant an effect an expanded portfolio QM option would have on credit availability, as the mortgages that would qualify for the expanded option may already receive QM status under existing options. The legislative proposals may, however, have a greater effect on reducing a creditor's regulatory burden, as the lender may be able to use less cost-intensive underwriting processes of the expanded QM option.

Under the ATR requirement, a lender must determine based on documented and verified information that, at the time a mortgage loan is made, the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. A lender must consider and verify certain types of information prior to originating a loan, including the applicant's income or assets, credit history, outstanding debts, and other criteria. Lenders that fail to comply could be subject to legal liability, such as the payment of certain statutory damages.", "Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule implementing the ATR requirement, a lender can comply with the ATR requirement in two ways. First, a lender can originate a mortgage that meets the relatively less prescriptive underwriting standards of the General ATR Option. Under the General ATR Option, the loan does not need to satisfy specified criteria, but the lender must not make a mortgage \"unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation that the consumer will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms.\"", "Second, a lender could originate a mortgage that satisfies the more prescriptive standards of the QM rule. A QM is more prescriptive than the General ATR Option in the sense that, to receive QM status, the mortgage must satisfy specific underwriting and product-feature requirements and document compliance with the requirements. When a lender originates a mortgage that receives QM status, it is presumed to have complied with the ATR requirement, which consequently reduces the lender's potential legal liability of its residential mortgage lending activities. A lender can comply with the ATR rule by making a mortgage that is not a QM and instead satisfies the General ATR Option, but the lender will not receive the additional legal protections. The definition of a QM, therefore, is important to a lender seeking to minimize its legal risk of its residential mortgage lending activities, specifically its compliance with the statutory ATR requirement. Some are concerned that, at least in the short term, few mortgages will be originated that do not meet the QM standards due to the legal protections that QMs afford lenders, even though there are other means of complying with the ATR requirement.", "Underwriting and product-feature requirements of the QM categories are intended to ensure that a mortgage receiving QM status satisfies certain minimum standards, with the standards intended to offer protections to borrowers. A loan that satisfies the less strict General ATR Option, in contrast, is allowed to have a balloon payment, a term in excess of 30 years, and other features that are generally prohibited in a QM so long as the lender verifies that the borrower would have the ability to repay the loan."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economics of the ATR Rule", "paragraphs": ["In the preamble to the final rule, the CFPB explained that the ATR requirement is intended to address certain market failures that policymakers identified in the housing finance system. Some attribute the expansion in mortgage credit that fueled the housing bubble to market failures that encouraged lenders to offer and borrowers to accept more credit than was socially optimal. ", "Market failures can occur in many instances in the housing market, such as lenders and borrowers not accounting for societal costs outside of a transaction (such as foreclosure) and borrowers' difficulty in understanding mortgage terms and accurately assessing their ability to repay given that consumers typically have limited experience buying and financing a house. According to the CFPB, the \"Dodd-Frank Act and the final rule address these potential market failures through minimum underwriting requirements at origination and new liability for originators ... in cases where the standards are found not to be met.\" The minimum standards and the new liability are intended to encourage lenders to account for costs in addition to those that they bear when extending credit and to make more informed underwriting decisions, potentially reducing market failures and resulting in a more socially optimal amount of credit being allocated.", "The underwriting requirements and new liability in the ATR rule are viewed as working in tandem to encourage the lender to determine that the borrower will be able to repay the loan. If the lender originates a loan that satisfies the minimum underwriting standards (the General ATR Option), then the lender is exposed to a certain amount of legal liability. But if the lender originates a mortgage that meets more prescriptive requirements and is therefore deemed a QM, then the lender is exposed to less legal risk. The reduced legal risk is warranted, the CFPB argues, because the QM's minimum underwriting and product-feature standards \"are judged in the rule to be enough to ensure that the lender made a reasonable and good faith determination that the borrower will be able to repay the loan.\" The CFPB notes that lenders, therefore, face a tradeoff between (1) \"exert[ing] greater care in underwriting the loan\" to ensure that it receives QM status and the reduced liability associated with it or (2) performing a potentially less thorough and less costly initial underwriting of the General ATR Option and having a greater exposure to liability.", "In summary, the additional liability and the minimum underwriting standards enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act are intended to address market failures that some policymakers believed fueled the housing bubble that precipitated the financial crisis. As discussed in more detail later in this report, some argue that the QM rule is one size fits all, has led to an unnecessary constriction of credit, and has been unduly burdensome on lenders.

The CFPB-issued QM regulations establish a Standard QM that meets all of the underwriting and product-feature requirements outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. However, the QM regulations also establish several additional categories of QM that provide lenders the same presumption of compliance legal protections with the ATR requirement as a Standard QM. One of those additional categories is the Small Creditor Portfolio QM . The CFPB argues that the Small Creditor Portfolio QM is \"necessary to preserve access to responsible, affordable mortgage credit for some consumers.\" It believes \"that portfolio loans made by small creditors are particularly likely to be made responsibly and to be affordable for the consumer.\" ", "To receive QM status under the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, three broad sets of criteria must be satisfied. First, the loan must be held in the originating lender's portfolio for at least three years (subject to several exceptions). Second, the loan must be held by a small creditor , which is defined as a lender who originated 2,000 or fewer mortgages in the previous year (excluding portfolio loans) and has less than $2 billion in assets. Third, the loan must meet certain underwriting and product-feature requirements. ", "Compared with the Standard QM, the Small Creditor Portfolio QM has less prescriptive underwriting requirements and is intended to reduce the regulatory burden of the ATR rule for small creditors. To receive QM status under the Standard QM, a borrower must have a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43% after accounting for the payments associated with the mortgage and other debt obligations. Under the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, the lender is required to consider and verify the borrower's DTI but does not have a specific numeric threshold that the borrower must be below. A lender, therefore, has the flexibility to offer a loan with a higher DTI ratio if the lender determines that the borrower is creditworthy. Because the DTI threshold is considered by some to be one of the factors limiting credit availability under the QM rule, relief from that threshold allows small creditors to originate mortgages that they may not otherwise have made. Though relief is provided from the DTI threshold for the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, the other underwriting and product-feature requirements for the Standard QM must still be followed.", "Although the Small Creditor Portfolio QM has less prescriptive underwriting requirements than the Standard QM, the Small Creditor Portfolio QM requires a lender to hold the loan in portfolio and limits the portfolio QM option to small creditors. The CFPB justified establishing the Small Creditor Portfolio QM on the basis that even though the underwriting standards have been reduced (potentially making it easier for some borrowers to qualify), certain factors unique to portfolio loans and to small creditors provide added incentives that ensure that a lender using the Small Creditor Portfolio QM will accurately assess whether a borrower can repay the mortgage. The CFPB believes both the portfolio requirement and small creditor limitation are necessary to justify the less prescriptive underwriting standards. ", "Supporters of an expanded portfolio lending option contend that not all of the lender and underwriting requirements included in the Small Creditor Portfolio QM are essential to ensuring that a lender will extend credit to creditworthy borrowers and argue that a less burdensome approach can be employed. Some in Congress propose establishing an additional portfolio QM option that would have more relaxed eligibility criteria for the three major categories that serve as a framework for discussion\u2014portfolio requirements, lender restrictions, and loan criteria. This report analyzes three legislative proposals that would establish alternative portfolio QM options. ", "1. S. 1484 , the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, was reported by the Senate Banking Committee on June 2, 2015. 2. S. 1491 / H.R. 2642 , the Community Lender Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2015, have been characterized as an alternative to S. 1484 because the text was initially offered unsuccessfully as an amendment to S. 1484 during the Senate Banking Committee markup. 3. H.R. 1210 , the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, was passed by the House on November 18, 2015.

Portfolio Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Small Creditor Portfolio QM requires a small creditor to retain the mortgage in its portfolio for three years in order for the mortgage to receive QM status. If the lender sells the mortgage before three years, the mortgage loses its status as QM, with some exceptions. The mortgage would retain its QM status if it is sold to another lender who meets the definition of small creditor. The mortgage would also maintain its QM status if it is acquired as a result of a merger of a lender with another lender or if the mortgage is sold because the sale is determined to be necessary by a regulator to revive or resolve a troubled lender. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Retained Risk and Aligning Incentives", "paragraphs": ["By keeping the loan in portfolio, the CFPB argues, creditors have added incentive to consider whether the borrower will be able to repay the loan. Keeping the loan in portfolio means that the lender retains the default risk and could be exposed to losses if the borrower does not repay. This exposure, the argument goes, would encourage creditors to provide additional scrutiny during the underwriting process, even in the absence of a legal requirement to do so. Keeping the mortgage in portfolio is intended to align \"consumers' and creditors' interests regarding ability to repay.\" If the lender sold the mortgage immediately after origination, as is done under an \"originate-to-distribute\" business model, this incentive may not exist. According to the CFPB, the added incentive to do thorough underwriting that comes with holding the loan in portfolio is necessary to justify the less prescriptive underwriting standards of the Small Creditor Portfolio QM. ", "Although retaining risk may bring creditors' and consumers' interests more in line, they may not be perfectly aligned. Lenders have the incentive to be repaid and consumers have the incentive to repay, but those two things are different. Even with the loan in portfolio, the lender may have the incentive to lend to borrowers who do not have sufficient liquid sources of repayment , such as an applicant's income and money in a checking account. The ATR requirement mandates a lender focus on a borrower's liquid sources of repayment in assessing a borrower's ability to repay. When performing its underwriting, the lender typically takes a broad view of the borrower's ability to repay, considering not only liquid sources of repayment but also the value of the house that is being purchased. Even though the home is an asset to the borrower, it is not typically a liquid source of repayment. The lender considers the value of the house during its underwriting because, in a mortgage, the house serves as the underlying collateral. So long as house prices are rising, the house can be sold to repay the lender the amount that it is owed if the borrower does not repay, allowing the lender to profit from the initial fees it is paid for originating the loan and then recouping its principal through the home sale, a process often referred to as collateral-dependent lending. In this instance, holding the loan in portfolio may not align the lender's and borrower's interests.", "As a response to collateral-dependent lending, the ATR rule requires the lender to consider and verify the borrower's ability to repay independent of the underlying value of the house. Lenders are required to focus on liquid sources of repayment as part of compliance with the rule. Although some of the underwriting requirements are less prescriptive for the Small Creditor Portfolio QM than the Standard QM, the lender is still required to assess the borrower's ability to repay independent of the underlying value of the house even though the mortgage is held in portfolio. Lenders consider the value of the house and other illiquid assets when performing their underwriting and use it to inform their decisions about whether to extend credit, but they assess a borrower's ability to repay in accordance with the ATR rule using liquid sources of repayment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three-Year Requirement", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned previously, the Small Creditor Portfolio QM requires a small lender to retain the mortgage in its portfolio for three years in order for the mortgage to receive QM status, subject to some exceptions. If the loan is sold before three years to a lender that does not meet the small creditor definition, then the mortgage would lose its QM status, but if it is sold to anyone after three years, then the mortgage retains its QM status. One of the reasons that the CFPB cites for why the lender must keep the loan in portfolio for three years is to prevent evasion. If a small creditor could originate a mortgage and was required to keep it in portfolio for only a short period of time prior to selling it, then the benefits associated with keeping it in portfolio would be reduced.", "The CFPB also chose three years for the length requirement in order \"to conform to the statute of limitations for affirmative claims for violations of the ability-to-repay rules.\" If a borrower is going to initiate an affirmative claim against a lender under the ATR rule, the borrower must do so during the first three years. The borrower may cite the ATR at any point, however, as a defense against foreclosure. By holding the mortgage in portfolio for three years, the CFPB argues, the small lender \"retains all of the litigation risk for potential violations of the ability-to-repay rules except in the event of a subsequent foreclosure.\" As mentioned before, the possibility of litigation is one of the tools to address market failures in the mortgage market and is intended to encourage lenders to account for not only their own costs but also the costs borne by others when extending credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Proposals and Policy Discussion", "paragraphs": ["Similar to the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, all three proposals would require the mortgage to be held in a lender's portfolio, at least initially.

Table 2 summarizes the differences. These policy issues, as well as several other issues related to lenders' portfolios, are discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Originator's Portfolio and Three Years", "paragraphs": ["The Small Creditor Portfolio QM allows (and S. 1484 would allow) a mortgage to be transferred from the originator's portfolio to another eligible entity's portfolio and retain QM status. S. 1491 and H.R. 1210 , however, would require the mortgage to stay in the originator's portfolio; if it was transferred then it would lose its QM status (with some exceptions). As described below, the differences in the portfolio requirements can affect the borrower's cost of credit and the lender's incentive to perform thorough underwriting.", "A mortgage that can be transferred to another entity while retaining its QM status is, generally speaking, more liquid than a mortgage that would lose its QM status when transferred. (Liquid in this context refers to the ease with which a mortgage can be bought and sold.) If the mortgage cannot be transferred without losing its QM status, the originator may charge a higher rate to a borrower to account for this lack of liquidity and for the risks associated with the lack of liquidity. This liquidity premium would potentially vary based on the severity of the restrictions, with more restrictive portfolio requirements yielding a higher liquidity premium. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM, for example, would likely face a liquidity premium because, in the first three years, the mortgage could be transferred to another small creditor only to retain QM status. The restriction on transferring to only small creditors may make the liquidity premium higher for the Small Creditor Portfolio QM compared to S. 1484 , because S. 1484 would allow the mortgage to retain its QM status while being transferred to almost any lender. The liquidity premium could also be lower for the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, however, because after three years the mortgage would not need to be kept in portfolio to retain QM status, making it more liquid than would be the case under S. 1484 . In sum, more stringent portfolio requirements may make the mortgage more illiquid and could result in a higher rate that would be expected to be charged to the borrower.", "While more relaxed portfolio requirements could reduce the liquidity premium associated with the mortgage, more relaxed standards could also reduce the lender's incentive to thoroughly underwrite the mortgage. If the mortgage can be transferred without losing its QM status, there may be a weaker incentive for the originator to do thorough underwriting, because the originator knows that the mortgage can be sold, transferring both the credit risk and the liability risk to a new entity. (The liability risk also transfers to the new mortgage holder when the mortgage is sold. ) The market, however, could respond by developing legal contracts such that, when the mortgage is transferred, the new mortgage holder could have the ability to \"put back\" the risk on to the originator if certain specified conditions are met. In that case, the originator would still be exposed to the liability risk even if the originator did not hold the mortgage at the time the claim was brought by the borrower. The possibility that the originator could be exposed to liability even if the mortgage is sold could provide added incentive to thoroughly assess the borrower's ability to repay even if the originator does not intend to keep the mortgage in portfolio. This example serves to illustrate that while the legislative proposals may have one set of portfolio requirements, it is possible that the market would evolve to reach an alternative outcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evidence of Portfolio Lending's Effect on Ability to Repay", "paragraphs": ["The CFPB and supporters of the legislative proposals often cite economic theory\u2014the importance of retained risk and aligned incentives\u2014to justify a portfolio QM. Empirical research, however, has found conflicting results about whether loans held in portfolio are less likely to default than loans that are securitized. Researchers have suggested alternative theoretical frameworks to explain their results. ", "Several studies have found that loans held in portfolio were, in general, less likely to default than comparable loans that had been securitized. One study found that prime mortgages that had been securitized in private-label securities (PLS) were more likely to default than \"observably similar\" mortgages retained in a lender's portfolio. Mortgages securitized by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, however, were less likely to default than portfolio loans, though the effect was found to be small. The same study, when analyzing subprime loans, found that subprime loans that were securitized in PLS were less likely to default than portfolio loans, though the author attributes the result to early defaults , loans that were \"so risky that it may not have been possible to securitize them before they defaulted, and thus, they end up being overrepresented in lender portfolios.\" The author argues that his results, especially for prime mortgages, provides evidence that lenders engage in adverse selection , that they \"used private information to determine which loans to securitize\" and chose to keep those that were less likely to default in their portfolios. ", "Other research, however, found that some types of securitized loans had lower default rates than comparable loans held in portfolio. A 2012 study found that, in the prime mortgage market, lenders \"chose to sell low-default-risk (not high-default-risk) and high-prepayment-risk loans to the secondary market in the pre-crisis period, 2004-2006.\" During this period default rates were relatively low, so lenders may not have been as concerned about default risk as they were about prepayment risk\u2014the risk that borrowers will repay their mortgages before the full term. Keeping lower prepayment-risk loans and selling higher default-risk loans \"would have been a profitable strategy [during 2004-2006] when prepayment risk driven by high refinancing activity was a bigger concern for lenders than default risk in the prime market.\" In addition to concerns about prepayment risk, lenders may have chosen to keep higher-default-rate mortgages in their portfolio because of regulatory capital requirements, which may give banks \"incentives to retain riskier mortgage loans with higher expected return and securitize less risky mortgage loans, as long as both groups of loans have the same capital requirements when held on banks' balance-sheets.\" This is an example of regulatory arbitrage, a shift in activities in an attempt to circumvent regulation. ", "In the subprime market, the authors did not \"find a significant difference in the default and prepayment risks between portfolio and securitized loans.\" The authors also found that small lenders behaved differently than larger lenders during the period they studied. During certain years, small lenders were more likely to sell higher default risk loans than larger lenders. The authors attribute this to two different reasons. First, they argue that \"small lenders are more likely to be small-town lenders who have private information about their borrowers to adversely select loans for securitization.\" Second, \"small lenders are less likely to retain higher-default-risk loans even if the loans have lower prepayment probability because of their less diversified borrower base and their small cost of gaining a damaged reputation in the secondary market.\"", "In summary, different studies have found different results as to whether loans retained in portfolio are likely to have a higher or lower default rate. Among other things, the results are sensitive to the time period analyzed, whether the loans are prime or subprime, and whether the lenders are large or small. Although the CFPB and supporters of the legislative proposals emphasize the importance of retained risk to encourage lenders to originate lower default risk mortgages, the empirical research presents conflicting evidence.

If a bank is facing financial distress and is attempting to sell assets to satisfy its regulatory requirements, it could respond to the mortgage portfolio requirement by selling higher quality non-mortgage assets that are more liquid because they do not face the same portfolio requirements.

A mortgage, regardless of whether or not it is held in portfolio, could receive QM status through either the Standard QM or the GSE QM.

The Small Creditor Portfolio QM can, therefore, be viewed as a complement to the existing compliance options. Under this line of argument, larger lenders are less likely to need an additional compliance option because they generally originate conforming mortgages that already receive QM status under the GSE QM.

The CFPB found that \"approximately one half of all nonconforming loans are originated by creditors with assets less than $2 billion and approximately one quarter are originated by creditors with total assets less than $2 billion that originate fewer than 500 first-lien mortgages annually.\" (The CFPB's original definition used a 500 mortgage threshold, but the threshold was raised to 2,000 mortgages in the amended final rule. ) Under the original definition of small lender, three-quarters of non-conforming loans, therefore, were originated by lenders that are not small creditors and would have been unable to take advantage of the Small Creditor Portfolio QM.", "In addition to non-conforming credit, the CFPB argues that small creditors are an important source of credit in rural communities. Failure to create an additional compliance option for small creditors could, they argue, result in restricted credit access in rural areas. The CFPB notes that \"small creditors are significantly more likely than larger creditors to operate offices in rural areas, and there are hundreds of counties nationwide where the only creditors are small creditors and hundreds more where larger creditors have only a limited presence.\" The CFPB cites a study that found that in 2011 \"there were 629 U.S. counties, with just over 6 million in population, where community banks operated offices, but where no noncommunity banking offices were present\" and \"another 639 counties where community banks operated offices but where fewer than three noncommunity banking offices were present.\" Collectively, these 1,268 counties accounted for 16.3 million people and include more than one-third of the approximately 3,200 counties in the United States.", "The CFPB emphasizes the importance of ensuring that non-conforming credit and credit in rural areas continues to be extended, but it addresses these concerns indirectly by providing an additional compliance option for small creditors. Alternatively, the CFPB could have provided compliance options that centered on whether the mortgage was non-conforming or originated to a borrower in a rural area rather than be dependent on the type of lender. The CFPB argues, however, that it is appropriate to focus on the small creditors because, as discussed in more detail in the next section, they believe small creditors have certain qualities and face certain incentives that make them more likely to thoroughly evaluate a borrower's ability to repay. It is unclear, however, what affect the Small Creditor Portfolio QM option has on credit availability in rural areas because the QM rule also has a separate compliance option for certain lenders operating in rural areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Creditors' Sources of \"Strong Incentives and Particular Ability\"?", "paragraphs": ["The CFPB argues that small lenders \"have both strong incentives and particular ability to make\" portfolio mortgages that consumers are able to repay, but the strong incentives and particular ability \"may not be present for larger lenders.\" The CFPB cites three factors unique to small lenders that, it argues, allow small creditors \"to make more accurate assessments of consumers' ability to repay than larger creditors.\" ", "First, a small lender's size, the CFPB argues, provides added incentive to accurately assess a consumer's ability to repay. When the loan is held in portfolio, the lender is exposed to the risk, and that risk \"represents a proportionally greater risk to a small creditor than to a larger one.\" For any given mortgage, a small bank has a smaller base across which to spread any losses, so, the argument goes, a small lender would have more incentive to only originate mortgages that it expects consumers to be able to repay. Small size could, alternatively, mean that a small lender has less to lose and could restart as a new business if its investments fail to pay off. This is likely less of a concern for a bank or credit union that has to go through the process of receiving a charter than a non-bank entity that would face lower start-up costs. ", "Second, the CFPB argues that small creditors are more likely to use a relationship-based lending model that may yield a more accurate assessment of the borrower. A relationship-based lending model is one in which lenders develop close familiarity with their respective customer bases. Relationship banking allows institutions to capture lending risks that are unique, infrequent, and localized. Underwriting in the relationship banking model often relies on \"qualitative information gained from personal relationships between creditors and consumers.\" Qualitative or \"soft\" information, such as a consumer's character, \"may be difficult to quantify, verify, and communicate through the normal transmission channels of a banking organisation.\" The relationship banking model emphasizes maintaining extended relationships with consumers, offering not just a mortgage but also holding their deposits and offering other services.", "Relationship-based lending can be contrasted with a \"transactional banking\" or high-volume lending business model that is often associated with larger lenders. These lenders are more likely to rely on automated underwriting methodologies that emphasize hard data\u2014credit scores, income, and other quantifiable characteristics\u2014that often cannot capture atypical lending risks, such as the uniqueness of a particular property that is collateralizing a mortgage loan in a rural area. ", "The CFPB believes that lenders using the relationship-based model \"may be better able to assess ability to repay because they are more likely to base underwriting decisions on local knowledge and nonstandard data and less likely to rely on standardized underwriting criteria.\" The CFPB cites several studies that found that lenders using soft information in their underwriting had lower default rates on mortgages than lenders that did not. Overreliance on soft information, however, could leave lenders susceptible to their biases. ", "Third, small lenders' ties to their communities, the CFPB argues, provide added incentive to thoroughly underwrite their mortgages for the borrower's ability to repay. Small lenders are likely to provide financial services within a circumscribed geographical area, allowing them to \"have specialized knowledge of the community in which they operate\" and potentially \"have a more comprehensive understanding of their customers' financial circumstances.\" A more comprehensive understanding would likely improve a lender's capacity to accurately assess a consumer's ability to repay. In addition, the emphasis on maintaining long-standing relationships with consumers and limiting their business to a specified geographic area, the CFPB argues, makes small lenders more concerned about their reputational risk.", "These three factors, the CFPB argues, provide small creditors with a better ability to assess a borrower's creditworthiness and offer strong incentives for the lender to internalize the costs of a borrower's default.

The number of small banks has decreased over time, with much of the decrease driven by the drop in the number of banks with less than $100 million in assets. Although the number of small banks has fallen, the vast majority of banks had less than $1 billion in assets, and just 107 banks had more than $10 billion in assets in 2014. Small banks make up the majority of institutions, but Figure 2 shows that most assets are held by banks over $10 billion.", "The CFPB's lender restrictions are stricter than those of the legislative proposals. The CFPB uses both an asset limit and origination threshold in its definition of small because it \"believes that both elements of the threshold play independent and important roles.\" The CFPB contends the origination threshold is the best way of restricting the portfolio QM to small lenders that use the relationship-based business model that it believes is important. The CFPB intends the asset limit to prevent a large lender that has a low origination level and does not use the relationship-based business model from participating. Both factors impose limits on which lenders can participate. The CFPB estimates that \"approximately 95 percent of creditors with less than $500 million in assets, approximately 74 percent of creditors with assets between $500 million and $1 billion, and approximately 50 percent of creditors with assets between $1 billion and $2 billion\" would meet its original definition of small , which has since been expanded. ", "S. 1491 would allow larger lenders\u2014those with up to $10 billion in assets\u2014to participate if the lender satisfied certain criteria. It is unclear how the CFPB would implement and define the other criteria, so it is unclear how many additional lenders would be eligible. Using $10 billion as a benchmark provides the upper bound for lender eligibility under S. 1491 . Approximately 98.2% of banks have less than $10 billion in assets, but banks with less than $10 billion in assets account for only 18.7% of the banking system's total assets. H.R. 1210 and S. 1484 have no asset or origination threshold for participating, and thus many additional lenders would be eligible to participate if the proposals were enacted.", "The CFPB had some discretion in setting the thresholds that it used, and the CFPB's rule implementing the Small Creditor Portfolio QM explained why it chose to limit eligibility to the smaller lenders that it did. The CFPB notes that \"a creditor with assets between $1 billion and $2 billion has, on average, 16 branches, 252 employees, and operations in 5 counties. In contrast, a creditor with between $2 billion and $10 billion in assets has, on average, 34 branches, 532 employees, and operations in 12 counties.\" As the staff and geographic reach of the lender increases, the CFPB argues, \"it becomes less and less likely that a creditor will engage in relationship lending or use qualitative or local knowledge in its underwriting. In addition, as an institution adds staff and branches, it is more likely from a systems perspective to handle compliance functions.\"", "Although the CFPB emphasizes the correlation between institution size and relationship lending, it is unclear why the CFPB originally chose the $2 billion in assets and 500 mortgages originated as the thresholds. In fact, the CFPB expanded the origination threshold to 2,000 mortgages per year (excluding mortgages held in portfolio). Although larger banks may be less likely to use a relationship lending business model, those who support eliminating size restrictions for portfolio QM in S. 1484 and H.R. 1210 would deem the quality of the mortgages they originate to be sufficiently high to warrant receiving QM status.

In fact, over the last several years, on average, mortgages held by community banks outperformed even fixed-rate, prime loans, the best performing mortgage category.", "In addition, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, presented in Figure 4 , shows the delinquency rate of mortgages held in portfolio by banks of different sizes in the aftermath of the bursting of the housing bubble. Banks of all sizes had similar delinquency rates at the beginning of 2008, but the rates diverged over the next four years, just as argued by Governor Duke. The larger banks experienced higher delinquency rates, whereas smaller banks saw less of an increase.", "Performance during the most recent crisis, however, may not be indicative of future performance.

", "Some argue that the added liquidity injected in to the market by allowing large banks to purchase mortgages, especially during a market downturn, would justify large banks' eligibility for the portfolio QM. S. 1484 would allow large banks to purchase mortgages that they did not originate, but if the mortgage was held in portfolio, the mortgage would receive QM status. H.R. 1210 would allow a large bank to originate a mortgage and have it receive QM status if the mortgage was retained in portfolio, but it would not allow a large bank to use the portfolio QM option for a mortgage that it acquired and did not originate.

As can be seen below, the banking system reduced the total amount of mortgages that were held in portfolio, and the largest banks shrank their mortgage portfolios by a similar amount. During this period, the largest banks, in aggregate, were not providing disproportionate support or drag on the market but were generally moving with the market.

Lenders are still required \"to consider the consumer's debt-to-income ratio ... and to verify the underlying information\" used to calculate the DTI under the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, but \"there is no numeric limit.\" The CFPB removes the numeric DTI limit for portfolio loans offered by small lenders because it argues that the factors unique to portfolio loans and to small lenders (as explained earlier in this report) provide added incentives that ensure that a lender using the Small Creditor Portfolio QM accurately assesses a borrower's creditworthiness. Though the 43% limit is removed, the CFPB argues that lenders should still have to consider DTI because \"consideration of debt-to-income ... is fundamental to any determination of ability to repay.\" The less prescriptive underwriting standards are intended to reduce the burden on small creditors and allow for greater credit availability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Proposals and Policy Discussion", "paragraphs": ["The legislative proposals have significant variation in how prescriptive they would be in setting underwriting and product-feature requirements for a loan that would be eligible for a portfolio QM option.

A consumer can bring a suit claiming the lender failed to comply with the ATR rule, but the borrower's likelihood of success is partially dependent on the stringency of the loan criteria and the ease with which the lender can document that it complied with the requirement. If a lender must satisfy prescriptive or difficult to document criteria to have a loan receive QM status, then a borrower is likely to be more successful in showing that the lender failed to comply with those detailed standards. If a lender must satisfy less prescriptive criteria, such as simply documenting that the loan is currently held in portfolio, then it is likely to be more difficult for the borrower to win the suit. The more likely a borrower is to win, the argument goes, the more incentive a lender has to thoroughly underwrite the loan and address the market failures that are at the root of the ATR rule. Alternatively, the more prescriptive standards that may make it more likely for a borrower to win a suit could dissuade lenders from extending credit to borrowers who are not clearly within the required underwriting standards. Making the loan criteria easier to satisfy could reduce the burden on lenders and allow them to expand credit but could reduce consumer protections by making it harder for a borrower to win a suit. This highlights the tradeoff between consumer protection and access to credit when establishing minimum underwriting standards.", "One of the areas that has received particular attention is the treatment of borrowers who have atypical financial situations, such as self-employed individuals or seasonal employees. The CFPB has standards and definitions for terms such as income and debt in its Appendix Q that lenders use to ensure compliance with the ATR rule, and Appendix Q has specific information related to how to address certain atypical financial situations. Some industry groups argue, however, that Appendix Q is too complex. They contend that lenders are less likely to extend credit to atypical borrowers whom they otherwise deem creditworthy because of the complexity of Appendix Q and of the uncertainty lenders face as to whether they have appropriately applied its requirements to atypical borrowers.", "Supporters of the expanded portfolio QM options argue that the less prescriptive standards and easier to document criteria in their proposals would expand credit availability, especially for those with atypical financial situations.

It would not mandate any specific underwriting requirements and, for product-feature requirements, would limit only prepayment penalties.

The effect on credit availability would depend on many different factors, including which expanded portfolio QM proposal (if any) was implemented. Even if the broadest and least prescriptive proposal were enacted, it is unclear how significant an effect it would have on credit availability. As a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report explains, \"agencies, market participants, and observers estimated that the QM ... regulations would not have a significant effect initially because many loans made in recent years already met QM ... criteria before these regulations were promulgated.\" Based on GAO's analysis, an expanded QM option may not result in a significant expansion in credit availability, as many of the mortgages that would receive QM status under the new QM option would also receive QM status under the previously available options. Similarly, a December 2015 study by the Federal Reserve found \"evidence that some market outcomes were affected by the new rules, but the estimated magnitudes of the responses are small.\" Others argue that QM's prescriptive criteria are preventing some lenders from lending to creditworthy borrowers.

Market participants expect mortgage credit conditions to loosen as more time passes from the bursting of the housing bubble, meaning that lenders may want to expand credit availability, but it is unclear whether they would do so because of the restrictions in the QM rule. In addition, the Temporary GSE QM category\u2014which, in general, has less prescriptive underwriting criteria than the Standard QM category\u2014is scheduled to expire in 2021, which may restrain credit after its expiration for borrowers on the margins of creditworthiness. An expanded portfolio QM option may have a greater effect on credit availability at that time.

The less prescriptive portfolio options would not require lenders to underwrite using Appendix Q. So even if a mortgage would have received QM status under an alternative QM option, the fact that the less prescriptive portfolio QM option is available would mean that a lender would not necessarily have to perform as cost-intensive of an evaluation.

In establishing the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, the CFPB argued that because borrower and lender incentives were more correctly aligned, the underwriting criteria for the Small Creditor Portfolio QM could be less prescriptive than for the Standard QM, but the compliance option would be limited to small creditors. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM needs to contain certain lender restrictions and loan criteria rather than just apply to all portfolio loans offered by all lenders, the CFPB contends, because lender and borrower incentives are not perfectly aligned.
