In addition to addressing tariffs and other trade restrictions, the negotiations seek to reduce regulatory barriers to transatlantic commerce. Among the barriers under discussion are those affecting motor vehicles. Although many automakers build and sell cars in both regions, they must comply with very different safety, fuel economy, and emissions standards, as well as different regulatory processes. TTIP negotiators are seeking to identify ways to narrow the regulatory differences, potentially reducing costs and spurring additional trade in vehicles. U.S. and EU automakers support this initiative, which they see as furthering economic and vehicle design trends already under way. The complexity of complying with different greenhouse gas emissions regulations is also a factor in the industry's support.", "This report looks at ways in which TTIP might lead to a convergence of motor vehicle regulatory regimes on both sides of the Atlantic. These regimes govern three distinct aspects of vehicle manufacturing and involve a number of U.S. and EU agencies.", "Safety. U.S. automakers self-certify that they are meeting U.S. vehicle standards. In Europe, vehicles must obtain \"type approval\" from a government before an automaker can bring out a new model. Emissions. U.S. and EU emissions regulations are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Commission (EC), respectively. While U.S. and EC rules address a similar range of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and non-methane organic oxides, allowable emissions levels in the EU are different from those in the United States\u2014and they are stricter in more than a dozen U.S. states than in the other states. The United States and the EU have similar \"type approval\" systems for new engine models. Fuel Efficiency. Auto manufacturers selling in the United States must meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards enforced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Under the Obama Administration, greenhouse gases (GHG) in vehicle emissions are being regulated for the first time, making fuel economy standard-setting a joint venture between NHTSA and EPA. The EU does not directly set fuel economy standards, but it effectively does so by regulating greenhouse gas emissions of new vehicles.", "There are several different ways a TTIP agreement could promote convergence of automobile regulation, from harmonizing existing U.S. and EU rules to providing for mutual recognition of some or all automotive standards. If a TTIP agreement is reached, it will be subject to congressional approval.

Such an agreement, the working group urged, should provide for \"the promotion of more compatible approaches to current and future regulation and standard-setting and other means of reducing non-tariff barriers to trade.\"", "One month later, President Obama notified Congress that the United States would enter into negotiations with the EU to seek a free trade agreement, referred to as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The negotiations, the President wrote, would ", "seek greater compatibility of U.S. and EU regulations and related standards development processes, with the objective of reducing costs associated with unnecessary regulatory differences and facilitating trade, inter alia by promoting transparency in the development and implementation of regulations and good regulatory practices, establishing mechanisms for future progress, and pursuing regulatory cooperation initiatives where appropriate. ", "The formal TTIP negotiations began in July 2013. Motor vehicle safety and emissions standards are areas where the United States and the EU could break new ground. Trade in vehicles and parts between the United States and the EU reached $57 billion in 2012, and numerous companies manufacture on both sides of the Atlantic. The major U.S. and European motor vehicle manufacturer associations have called for TTIP to provide for mutual recognition of existing technical standards and the creation of a U.S.-EU process for harmonization of future vehicle regulations. Such steps, an industry alliance has contended, would \"increase trade, lower costs, create jobs and improve the international competitiveness of the industry\" in both North America and Europe. The alliance estimates that current non-tariff barriers on vehicles are equivalent to a 26% tariff on vehicle imports. It projects that elimination of tariffs and just 10% of non-tariff barriers could raise U.S. vehicle and parts exports to the EU by over 200% and EU parts and vehicle exports to the United States by 71%.", "Safety, fuel efficiency, and emissions standards differ between the two regions (see Table 1 ), due to historical differences in producer and consumer preferences as well as the role of government in industry practices. The United States and the EU have different standards even for an item as simple as a seat belt. Some of these differences may reflect past efforts to protect domestic vehicle industries against foreign competition, and others may result from different legal traditions or divergent views as to the best way of achieving goals such as cleaner air and reduced oil consumption.", "Past auto agreements have been effective in leading to a more globalized auto industry. The 1965 motor vehicle agreement between the United States and Canada and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) removed barriers to trade and cross-border trade in autos and established a more regional motor vehicle industry in the process. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a separate negotiation involving the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries, could have a similar effect. With respect to the auto industry, TTIP represents another effort to extend these regional templates to encompass a greater share of trade and investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S.-EU Vehicle Trade", "paragraphs": ["The EU and the United States are the second- and third-largest vehicle producers in the world (see Figure 1 ), together accounting for nearly one-third of global auto production.

Sales in each region were about the same in 2012: 14.8 million vehicles sold in the United States and 14.3 million in the EU. The remainder of EU production was exported, much of it to the U.S. market. ", "Seventeen of the EU member states manufacture vehicles. Germany is by far the largest auto producer within the EU (see Figure 2 ).

In 2012, imports constituted about 20% of U.S. sales, and about 17% of sales in the EU. ", "In some cases, a vehicle that is entirely legal in one country may not be sold in another due to differing fuel efficiency, safety, and emissions standards, unless the manufacturer is willing to make major investments to bring the vehicle into compliance. For example, Ford Motor Company's ECOnetic high-efficiency diesel engine, made in Great Britain, gets up to 71 miles per gallon (mpg) of fuel. This engine is not sold in North America because it does not comply with U.S. and Canadian emissions standards. Ford has determined that expanding its Mexican engine plant to make a redesigned version of the ECOnetic for North America would cost $350 million, and it does not believe consumer demand justifies the expenditure. ", "Increasingly, however, auto manufacturers and their parts suppliers have sought to organize their production on a global basis. The German automaker BMW, as an example, produces sport utility vehicles for markets worldwide from a plant in South Carolina. Greater commonality in regulation would make it easier for automakers and parts makers to coordinate production across major markets. This is consistent with individual companies' efforts to reduce costs with new design and production plans, such as the following:", "Reducing platforms. Automakers are developing global vehicle platforms that will reduce the number of models sold around the world, while consolidating suppliers and cutting costs. For example, the new Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Dart are based on Fiat's Compact Wide platform. The Ford Focus was developed in Europe but is built with similar components in the United States, China, Germany, Russia, and Thailand and sold in 130 countries. Joining forces to meet tightening world emission standards. Many countries, including the United States, have adopted new standards that will be costly for manufacturers to meet. Automakers have responded by creating partnerships to develop more powerful batteries, multispeed transmissions, techniques to improve engine efficiency, and other technological advances. Along these lines, BMW and Toyota have agreed to jointly develop fuel cell technology. Growing U.S. interest in diesel-powered vehicles. About half of all the passenger cars sold in Europe have diesel engines, which are more efficient than gasoline engines and emit a lower level of some greenhouse gases. Many automakers believe that offering diesels (as well as higher-performing gasoline, electric, and hybrid vehicles) will be necessary to meet higher U.S. fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards currently projected between now and 2025. Having similar standards for diesel engines in the two regions could reduce design and manufacturing costs.

In the United States, private standards and state regulation prevailed until the 1960s and 1970s, when federal legislation was passed. Since then, Congress has delegated vehicle regulation to federal agencies, occasionally providing specific direction through legislation. In Europe, a system of governmental control over autos was more prevalent, first in each country and later through the EU.

Writing about this era, one author noted that", "Regulating either driver conduct or vehicle design at the national level did not conform to existing political ideas about the appropriate federal division of responsibilities or to contemporary jurisprudential understandings of the federal government's constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce.... The only useful and politically acceptable action Congress might take was to help the states and localities construct more and better roads.", "The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), a professional association founded in 1905, became the primary source of vehicle safety and emission rules for many decades. State governments often used SAE recommendations to enact requirements for vehicle equipment, such as dual brakes, headlamps, and windshield wipers. Other SAE standards were adopted directly by manufacturers. ", "The first step toward a nationwide system of vehicle regulation came in 1926, when a voluntary Uniform Vehicle Code was drafted to replace the many different state rules. Among other things, the code specified the types of lighting, reflectors, brakes, mirrors, and tires that cars should have. These ideas were widely accepted by the states: by 1946, 30 of the then 48 states (plus the District of Columbia) had adopted the Uniform Vehicle Code; 13 had implemented portions and only six had taken no action. ", "With the start of the Interstate Highway system in the 1950s, greater automobile travel, and rising highway deaths, the interest in vehicle safety grew. Between 1962 and 1964, Congress passed three safety bills into law, including a seat belt regulation. These laws set the stage for more ambitious legislation a few years later. For example, the legislation establishing safety requirements for federal fleet vehicles led to the promulgation of 17 standards by 1966, prompting some in Congress to question why similar standards did not apply to vehicles purchased by average consumers.", "The most significant change in U.S. vehicle safety regulation came with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. Senator Abraham Ribicoff, one of the advocates of the new legislation, said during floor debate that \"this problem is so vast that the Federal Government must have a role. It is obvious the 50 states cannot individually set standards for the automobiles that come into those 50 States from a mass production industry.\" Curtailing auto-related highway deaths was a major impetus.", "As passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed by President Johnson, the legislation had two parts:", "the Highway Safety Act of 1966 mandated that each state put in place a highway safety program in accordance with federal standards that would include improving driver performance, accident records systems and traffic control; and the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 directed the Secretary of Commerce (later changed to the Secretary of Transportation when that agency was established in 1967) to issue safety standards for all motor vehicles beginning in January 1967. A National Traffic Safety Agency was established to carry out the provisions; it was renamed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 1970.", "Senator Warren Magnuson, chairman of the Commerce Committee, argued that Congress was implementing a limited type of regulation, saying in his floor statement,", "The committee also recognizes that the broad powers conferred upon the Secretary, while essential to achieve improved traffic safety, could be abused in such a manner as to have serious adverse effects on the automotive manufacturing industry.

This measurement procedure allows heavier cars to have higher emissions than lighter cars while preserving the overall fleet average.

For example, the EU and the U.S. test cycles differ in terms of average speed, duration, distance, acceleration and deceleration characteristics, and frequencies of starts and stops\u2014all factors which significantly affect the data returned by the tests. Further, the U.S. standard regulates all the GHG emissions from the vehicle (e.g., CO 2 , NO x , CH 4 ) in terms of CO 2 -equivalents; the EU regulates only carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the EU sets fleet-average GHG emissions standards in relationship to the mass of a vehicle, whereas the United States sets fleet-average standards based on the vehicle \"footprint.\" Finally, the EU and United States use varying definitions of vehicle categories and weight classes, with proposed targets based on projected sales of vehicles in different size and/or weight classes within each region.", "In general the EU GHG standards\u2014and by extension, fuel economy standards\u2014return a greater sales-based and fleet-wide emission reduction than those in the United States.

The regulatory bodies did not agree to any changes, however, because the data-driven review process made it difficult to prove functional equivalency of even a standard component such as a seat belt. ", "This experience suggested that obtaining functional equivalency determinations from regulatory agencies might be difficult. An alternative approach was developed in the 1998 UN agreement on global technical regulations, which created a global registry of processes and common technical standards. This initiative, resulting in the creation of the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, has resulted in agreement on only 13 global technical regulations to date.", "Simultaneously, there has been a transatlantic dialogue on autos since the mid-1990s through the U.S.-EU High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Forum. In 1995, President Clinton signed an action plan which sought to move the United States and Europe toward regulatory conformity and to encourage collaborative testing and certification. The 1996 TransAtlantic Automotive Industry Conference on International Regulatory Harmonization produced a report on the auto sector, including ten principles to guide steps toward convergence.

From the viewpoint of auto manufacturers, it means minimizing unnecessary differences in regulations so that a \"single vehicle standard can be built to satisfy all requirements.\" C omprehensive mutual recognition . This approach would permit automakers to sell vehicles in either market if they meet either a U.S. standard or a standard accepted in the EU. A car certified as compliant with U.S. safety, emission, and fuel efficiency standards would be accepted as compliant in the EU, and vice versa. This approach is how the EU certification process works. S elective mutual recognition . This approach would identify certain major standards for which TTIP could provide mutual recognition, rather than providing mutual recognition of all standards. U.S. and European automakers have identified occupant crash protection, side impact protection, child restraint systems, and some emissions standards as priorities for selective mutual recognition. F orward-looking rules . A fourth option would be to forge an agreement on emerging regulations, such as those dealing with electric and fuel cell vehicles, rather than focusing on existing regulations. Under this approach, the United States and the EU would commit to jointly develop standards covering new issues or technologies.", "The pending free trade agreement between the EU and Canada may influence the direction of TTIP. The full text of the agreement has not been released, but according to an EU statement, \"Canada will recognise a list of EU car standards and will examine the recognition of further standards. This will make it much easier to export cars to Canada.\" The agreement is also said to allow Canadian vehicles to be certified in Canada for the EU market. ", "Convergence of vehicle standards has potential drawbacks. One aspect pertains to the lack of speed with which governmental agencies\u2014whether in the United States or Europe\u2014can address new technologies and vehicle innovations. The rule-making process is already lengthy, and the need for international coordination could make it even longer. This raises the prospect that technologies that could reduce accidents\u2014such as new types of headlamps that can illuminate the road better without blinding oncoming drivers\u2014may be delayed in reaching the market. Additionally, the EU acknowledges that if vehicle standards become international, there could be less room for legislative scrutiny and for involvement by regional and national interest groups .", "U.S. consumer advocacy groups have raised similar concerns, writing U.S. and EU leaders in July 2013 that TTIP \"must not limit the United States or the EU (or its member states) from adopting and enforcing standards that provide higher levels of consumer, worker, and environmental protection.\"", "Congress could play an important role if a TTIP agreement contains significant provisions related to auto safety, emissions, and fuel economy regulations. Congress established the U.S. government agencies whose regulations are the focus of the negotiations on automobile standards, and it has retained a strong oversight interest in vehicle safety and emissions. If the TTIP effort to obtain mutual recognition or harmonization affects agencies' authority or changes the ways in which automotive regulations are developed and implemented, Congress may well be asked to modify the underlying statutes that govern motor vehicle safety, emissions, and fuel efficiency.

Separate sets of standards were defined for each vehicle category, with more relaxed limits for heavier vehicles. The CAAA also required EPA to study the need for more stringent \"Tier 2\" emission standards. Subsequently, EPA promulgated \"Tier 2\" standards on February 10, 2000.", "The Tier 2 regulations introduced more stringent numerical emission limits and a number of additional changes that tightened the standards for larger vehicles. Under the Tier 2 regulations, the same emission standards apply to all vehicle weight categories. Further, the same emission limits apply to all vehicles regardless of the fuel they use. Since light-duty emission standards are expressed in grams of pollutants per mile, vehicles with large engines (such light trucks or SUVs) were required to use more advanced emission control technologies than vehicles with smaller engines. To provide flexibility to vehicle manufacturers, the Tier 2 emission standards were structured into eight permanent and three temporary certification levels of different stringency, called \"certification bins.\" Manufacturers had a choice to certify particular vehicles to any of the available bins, but were required to meet a fleet-average requirement for NO x emissions in any given model year.", "U.S. emissions standards are shown in Table A-1 .
