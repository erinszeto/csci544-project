The VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans through the nation's largest integrated health care system. Veterans generally must enroll in the VA health care system to receive medical care. Eligibility for enrollment is based primarily on previous military service, disability, and income. VA provides free inpatient and outpatient medical care to veterans for service-connected conditions and to low-income veterans for nonservice-connected conditions.", "On February 26, 2009, the President submitted a preliminary budget outline for FY2010, and submitted his full FY2010 budget proposal to Congress on May 7. The Administration requested a total of $45.1 billion for VHA (excluding collections). This is a 7.5% increase over the FY2009 enacted level. Including total available resources (including medical care collections), the President's budget would provide approximately $48 billion for VHA.", "Based on the President's preliminary budget outline, on April 29, 2009, the House and Senate agreed to the conference report to accompany the FY2010 budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 13, H.Rept. 111-89). The conference agreement provides $53.4 billion in discretionary budget authority and $53.1 billion in mandatory budget authority for VA programs. Sections 402 and 424 of the conference agreement included language exempting the medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities accounts from a point of order against advance appropriations. Furthermore, the conference agreement states that VHA is not and should not be authorized to bill private insurance companies for treatment of health conditions that are related to veterans' service-connected disabilities.", "On July 10, the House passed its version of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2010 (H.R. 3082, H.Rept. 111-188). The House-passed bill provided a total of $45.1 billion for VHA. H.R. 3082 also provided $48.2 billion in advance appropriations for VHA to be available in FY2011. On November 17, the Senate passed H.R. 3082 as amended. H.R. 3082 as amended by the Senate provided a total of $45.2 billion for VHA, a $160.0 million increase over the House-passed amount, and $157.6 million over the President's request.", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on December 16, 2009 (P.L. 111-117, H.Rept. 111-366).

From FY1995 to FY2005 the average annual increase was 6.7% whereas average annual increase between FY2006 and FY2009 was 12.7% ( Figure 1 ). The growth in funding could be attributed to aging of many World War II and Korean War veterans with a greater need for health care services, veterans' increasing reliance on VHA's pharmaceutical benefits, and more recent veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) accessing the VA health care system. Veterans from OEF and OIF account for a rising proportion of VA's total patient work load. In FY2010 OEF and OIF patients will represent about 7% of the overall VA patient population, compared to about 3% in FY2006. ", "The remainder of this report is organized as follows.

On October 25, 1988, President Reagan signed legislation ( P.L. 100-527 ) creating a new federal cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs to replace the Veterans Administration effective March 15, 1989. ", "The VA provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules including hospital and medical care, disability compensation and pensions, education, vocational rehabilitation and employment services, assistance to homeless veterans, home loan guarantees, administration of life insurance as well as traumatic injury protection insurance for servicemembers, and death benefits that cover burial expenses. ", "The Department carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for health care services and medical and prosthetic research programs. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is responsible for, among other things, providing compensations, pensions, and education assistance. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is responsible for maintaining national veterans cemeteries; providing grants to states for establishing, expanding, or improving state veterans cemeteries; and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons, among other things.", "The VA's budget includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, pension benefits, education, vocational rehabilitation, and life insurance, among other benefits and services. Discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services including medical care. Figure 2 provides a breakdown of FY2009 budget allocations for both mandatory and discretionary programs. In FY2009 the total VA budget authority was approximately $96 billion; discretionary budget authority accounted for about 51.2% ($49.2 billion) of the total, with about 85% of this discretionary funding going toward supporting VA health care programs.

While Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are also publicly funded programs, most health care services under these programs are delivered by private providers in private facilities. In contrast, the VA health care system is a truly public health care system in the sense that the federal government owns the medical facilities and employs the health care providers. ", "The VA's health care system is organized into 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) (see Figure 3 ). Although policies and guidelines are developed at VA headquarters to be applied throughout the VA health care system, management authority for basic decision making and budgetary responsibilities are delegated to the VISNs. Congressionally appropriated medical care funds are allocated to the VISNs based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system, which generally bases funding on patient workload. VISNs, in turn, allocate funds to the medical centers within their networks. Prior to the implementation of the VERA system, resources were allocated to facilities based primarily on their historical expenditures. While a thorough description of VERA is beyond the scope of this report, generally VERA has two types of funds known as General Purpose funds and Specific Purpose funds. ", "General Purpose funds encompass about 83.5% of VHA total budget allocations to the VISNs. General Purpose funds are distributed to the 21 VISNs at the beginning of each fiscal year and are comprised of 8 elements. These elements include basic care, complex care, adjustments for high cost patients, geographic price adjustment, research support, education support, equipment, and non-recurring maintenance. ", "The Specific Purpose funds are given to the 21 VISNs during the year for specific activities including prosthetics, mental health, homeless grants and per diem program, state home per diems, transplants, clinical trainees, readjustment counseling, and medical facility activations. Under VERA each network is provided an allocation that takes into account its unique characteristics, and that is also adjusted to account for those veterans who receive care in more than one network. ", "As seen in Table 2 the largest allocations of funds in FY2009 were to VISNs: 8 (Florida and Puerto Rico), 16 (Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, some parts of Texas), 22 (some parts of California and Nevada), 7 (Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina), and 21 (some parts of California, and Nevada, Hawaii and Philippines). While VISNs 8, 16, 7 , and 4 have the greatest number of unique veteran patients, VERA funding is not driven by veteran patient population alone, but is adjusted for differences in patient mix, high cost patients, and geographic costs, among other factors.

Inpatient and outpatient care are also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). The VHA also provides grants for construction of state-owned nursing homes and domiciliary facilities and collaborates with the Department of Defense (DOD) in sharing health care resources and services.", "Apart from providing direct patient care to veterans, VHA's other statutory missions are to conduct medical research, to serve as a contingency back up to the Department of Defense (DOD) medical system during a national security emergency, to provide support to the National Disaster Medical System and the Department of Health and Human Services as necessary, and to train health care professionals in order to provide an adequate supply of health personnel for VA and the Nation.

It is also the second largest federal payer (after Medicare) for health care training. In FY2008, a total of 109,882 health professionals had part or all of their clinical training at VA medical facilities (see Figure 4 ). This included 34,075 physician residents rotating through 9,545 funded graduate medical education (GME) slots (about 8.5% of total U.S. resident positions). It should be noted here that about 3.5 individual physician residents rotate through each of the 9,545 funded positions. Of the total U.S. physician residents about 31% (34,075) receive some or all of their training from the VA annually. Although a majority of VA's residency positions are in primary care, the Department also supports GME in recognized medical specialties and subspecialties. ", "In late 2004, VA's Advisory Committee on GME initiated a review of VA's resident education program. The Advisory Committee was charged with examining the philosophy and deployment of VA's residency training positions (including the total number of positions, the specialty mix of resident physician training positions, and the geographic distribution of positions). The Advisory Committee undertook a broad assessment of graduate medical education in relationship to veterans' future health care needs. The Advisory Committee's recommendations called for increasing the number of residents in geographic areas and at sites of care where there are increased capacities to train; expanding training in areas of high relevance to VA; expanding training in areas of new and emerging specialties; and expanding affiliations with new VA sites of care. ", "As a result of this Advisory Committee's recommendation, in 2006 (academic year 2007-2008) VA began a GME enhancement program. The purpose of this multi-year program is to increase VA's share of U.S. resident positions from its low of 8.5% to the range of 10-11%. The five-year plan is designed to add approximately 2,000 positions to VA's pre-existing physician resident positions.

VA health care is not an entitlement program. Contrary to numerous claims made concerning \"promises\" to military personnel and veterans with regard to \"free health care for life,\" not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from the VA. Prior to eligibility reform in 1996, provisions of law governing eligibility for VA care were complex and not uniform across all levels of care. All veterans were technically \"eligible\" for hospital care and nursing home care, but eligibility did not by itself ensure access to care.", "The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, P.L. 104-262 , established two eligibility categories and required the VHA to manage the provision of hospital care and medical services through an enrollment system based on a system of priorities. P.L. 104-262 authorized the VA to provide all needed hospital care and medical services to veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, veterans exposed to toxic substances and environmental hazards such as Agent Orange, veterans whose attributable income and net worth are not greater than an established \"means test,\" and veterans of World War I. These veterans are generally known as \"higher priority\" or \"core\" veterans (see Appendix A , and discussed in more detail below). The other category of veterans are those with no service-connected disabilities and with attributable incomes above an established means test (see Appendix C ).", "P.L. 104-262 also authorized the VA to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care. As stated in the report language accompanying P.L. 104-262 , \"the Act would direct the Secretary, in providing for the care of 'core' veterans, to establish and operate a system of annual patient enrollment and require that veterans be enrolled in a manner giving relative degrees of preference in accordance with specified priorities. At the same time, it would vest discretion in the Secretary to determine the manner in which such enrollment system would operate.\"", "Furthermore, P.L. 104-262 was clear in its intent that the provision of health care to veterans was dependent upon the available resources. The committee report accompanying P.L. 104-262 states that the provision of hospital care and medical services would be provided to \"the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations acts for these purposes.

Some veterans are exempt from the enrollment requirement if they meet special eligibility requirements. A veteran may apply for enrollment by completing the Application for Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ) at any time during the year and submitting the form online or in person at any VA medical center or clinic, or mailing or faxing the completed form to the medical center or clinic of the veteran's choosing. Once a veteran is enrolled in the VA health care system, the veteran remains in the system and does not have to reapply for enrollment annually.
