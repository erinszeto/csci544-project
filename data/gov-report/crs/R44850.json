Congress over the decades has varied the list of products covered by the law. Under the Kissell Amendment (6 U.S.C. \u00a7453b), textile, apparel, and footwear products purchased by certain Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agencies\u2014namely, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the U.S. Coast Guard\u2014must be manufactured in the United States with 100% U.S. inputs.", "The Berry and Kissell Amendments have created niche markets for domestic producers. DOD's Defense Logistics Agency purchased about $2.4 billion of Berry-applicable products in FY2016. DOD's annual Berry Act purchases equal approximately 2% of domestic textile and apparel shipments and around 1% of domestic production of footwear, food, and hand or measuring tools. Annual purchases of textiles, clothing, and shoes by the TSA and the Coast Guard pursuant to the Kissell Amendment are approximately $30 million.", "Proponents of the Berry and Kissell Amendments assert the laws serve to keep certain U.S. production lines operating, provide jobs to American factory workers, and shield the U.S. military from dependence on foreign sources for critical items that could lead to supply problems during times of war or military mobilization. Critics of the amendments point out the laws may undercut free-market competition and can result in higher costs to DOD and DHS because they must pay more for protected products than the free market requires. They also argue the laws are inconsistent with modern practices in manufacturing, which often rely on supply chains that source components and raw materials from multiple countries. Another concern is that these requirements can potentially provoke retaliation and harm foreign sales.", "In recent Congresses, legislative action has centered on the scope of the Berry and Kissell Amendments. For example, in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Congress extended the Berry Amendment to athletic footwear, ending a voucher program that had allowed new recruits to purchase foreign-made running shoes. Beginning on October 1, 2018, DOD is scheduled to provide 100% U.S.-made running shoes to recruits. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 1811 has been introduced to widen the scope of the Kissell Amendment to all DHS agencies.", "A related issue for Congress is the use of prison labor to manufacture Berry-compliant apparel by DOD. A mandatory source provision in law gives an advantage to prison factories if they can provide the desired product within the required time frame at a competitive price. In the 114th Congress, the Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act of 2015 (H.R. 1699) would have eliminated Federal Prison Industries' no-bid contract status.", "Requirements for obtaining waivers are another congressional concern. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is currently auditing DHS's compliance with the Kissell Amendment. The audit is expected to be finished in summer 2017.", "Congress is also considering the effectiveness of the laws. To address this issue, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) is conducting an assessment of the defense industrial base for textiles, apparel, and footwear, which will include a review of the usefulness of the Berry and Kissell Amendments.

The Kissell Amendment is more limited, applying to textiles, apparel, and footwear procured by certain Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agencies. Under these two laws, the purchased items must be 100% domestic in origin, unless exemptions laid out in the laws apply. ", "The two laws are controversial. Proponents argue the amendments are important to the U.S. economy by helping to preserve the U.S. industrial base and creating manufacturing jobs for American workers. They also claim domestic preference laws may lessen dependence on foreign sources for certain critical U.S. military and nonmilitary needs, and that these laws encourage some foreign manufacturers to invest within the United States so that their products can be sold to the U.S. government. On the other hand, opponents believe the laws give monopolies to certain companies, raise the government's procurement costs, and fail to fully utilize the international supply chains that many U.S. manufacturers rely on to meet their production needs.

It has been amended numerous times. It became a permanent part of the U.S. Code when it was codified by the FY2002 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 107-107 ). Proposals to alter the Berry Amendment typically are advanced during consideration of defense appropriations acts and the National Defense Authorization Act. DOD implements the Berry Amendment through its Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). ", "The Berry Amendment specifies that affected products purchased directly by DOD must be \"entirely grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States.\" Unless DOD grants a waiver because domestic firms do not make the product or because other exceptions in the law are met, the entire production process of an affected product, from the production of raw materials to the manufacture of all components to final assembly, must be performed in the United States. As an example, when DOD purchases a military uniform, it must be sewn in the United States using fabric, thread, buttons, and zippers made in the United States from raw materials of U.S. origin. ", "The Berry Amendment mandates a much higher level of domestic content than the Buy American Act of 1933, which generally governs the procurements of other federal agencies. Under the Buy American Act, the final product must be mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and if manufactured, either at least 50% of the cost of its components, by value, must be manufactured in the United States, or the end product must be a commercially available off-the-shelf item.

However, the agreement expressly does not apply to DOD procurements involving textiles, clothing, food, and hand or measuring tools. This Berry Amendment restriction also applies to most U.S. free-trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, as well as to bilateral free-trade agreements with Australia, Morocco, Peru, South Korea, and Colombia.

It applies to the Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), both of which are within DHS. It is implemented through the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation, which imposes domestic content restrictions on certain clothing, textile, and footwear products acquired by particular DHS agencies when an item is directly related to national security.", "In introducing the amendment, Representative Lawrence Kissell noted he was particularly interested in supporting the domestic textile industry. Thus, the narrowly defined purpose of the Kissell Amendment is to ensure that DHS purchases of textile, apparel, and footwear products are wholly produced in the United States. The law covers clothi ng (including materials and components), canvas or textile products, natural and synthetic fabrics, individual equipment items, and footwear products. If these items are related to \"the national security interests of the United States,\" they must be \"domestically grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States\" to the greatest extent possible. Unlike the Berry Amendment, the Kissell Amendment does not apply to food or to hand or measuring tools. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Obligations", "paragraphs": ["Although the Kissell Amendment as enacted applies to all agencies of DHS, in practice its restrictions apply only to the Coast Guard and TSA. The reason for this is that, prior to the Kissell Amendment's passage, the United States had entered into commitments under various trade agreements to open U.S. government procurement to imported goods. However, the WTO GPA entitles the United States to exempt agencies critical to national security from its international procurement obligations. The United States has applied this exemption to those two agencies, so the Kissell Amendment governs their procurement. ", "Other DHS agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Secret Service are not covered by the exemption, and the Kissell Amendment therefore does not apply. Like many other agencies, these agencies' procurement is subject to the less stringent Buy American Act. However, under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, if a procurement is covered under a trade agreement, then Buy American Act restrictions are waived. Thus, DHS can purchase textile and apparel products from more than 100 countries if certain conditions are met. ", "The United States has also entered into commitments under various free-trade agreements to open U.S. government procurement to imported goods. As a result of these trade agreements, manufacturers in Mexico, Canada, and Chile are treated as \"American\" sources under the Kissell Amendment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Exceptions to the Berry and Kissell Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Berry Amendment includes several exemptions, which may apply at the discretion of DOD.

But there are also some notable differences. For example, the Kissell Amendment has \"national security\" limiting language that is not included in the Berry Amendment. This restricts Kissell Amendment coverage to purchases intended for or used by DHS to protect against internal or external threats to the United States. Thus, if an item, such as curtains for a DHS office, is not related to activities to protect the United States from internal or external national security threats, its procurement most likely would not be subject to the Kissell Amendment.

The number of active-duty personnel fell to 1.38 million in 2016 from 1.51 million in 2010, when the U.S. military was more actively engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan. If there is a higher level of defense spending in coming years, this could result in increased DOD demand for Berry-applicable products.

Among the large private contractors benefiting from the Berry Amendment market were American Apparel, a producer of military uniforms, in Alabama; Ceradyne, a major supplier of military body armor, in California; Campbellsville Apparel, a large supplier of undergarments to the military, in Kentucky; and contractors that sell textile fabrics to DOD, such as the International Textile Group's Burlington Industries of North Carolina.

Several large private suppliers operate Berry-compliant manufacturing facilities there, including Propper International, M&M Manufacturing, and Bluewater Defense. Government supply sources, including those that operate under the AbilityOne program, such as the National Industries for the Blind, the Travis Association of the Blind, and Goodwill Industries, are also significant suppliers of apparel for the military market.", "Federal Prison Industries (FPI), also known as UNICOR, delivers prison-manufactured apparel compliant with the Berry Act. FPDS reports that action obligations of clothing from UNICOR to the Department of Defense totaled nearly $100 million in FY2016. As of September 30, 2016, 18 U.S. penitentiaries and federal correctional institutions produced clothes and textiles, including facilities in Atlanta, GA; Beaumont, TX; Jesup, GA; Talladega, AL; and Butner, NC. FPI/UNICOR buys raw materials and component parts from private industry. ", "DOD's awarding of clothing contracts to this government-owned supplier has proven controversial in both Congress and the apparel industry. Critics have voiced concern that prison industrial programs hurt private industry and provide jobs for inmates rather than residents who are not incarcerated. Among other issues, critics have challenged FPI/UNICOR's mandatory source provision, which requires DOD to purchase from FPI/UNICOR factories if they can provide the desired product within the required time frame and at a competitive price. The mandatory source requirement is waived when the prison share of federal purchases of a product rises above 5% of total DOD purchases of that product. In FY2016, DOD accounted for more than 90% of FPI/UNICOR's textile and apparel sales. In that year, FPI/UNICOR also sold about $250,000 in apparel to the U.S. Coast Guard.", "Over the years, Congress has considered various bills to eliminate FPI's mandatory source clause and require FPI/UNICOR to compete for federal contracts. For example, in the 114 th Congress, the Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act of 2015 ( H.R. 1699 ) would have eliminated FPI's no-bid contract status.

In the more highly automated textile manufacturing industry, employment fell from 700,000 in 1990 to about 230,000 in 2016. Many of the remaining textile industry workers are involved in producing fabrics for industrial applications, such as conveyor belts and automotive floor coverings, rather than for apparel. ", "The Berry and Kissell Amendments require apparel manufacturers to construct supply chains separate from those used in commercial apparel production, relying exclusively on domestic manufacturers of components such as buttons and zippers.

These firms employed about 10,800 workers in 2015. DOD's direct purchases of footwear, such as combat boots and military dress shoes, totaled about $157 million in FY2015.

Combined, the three companies employ more than 1,600 people. For AmeriQual, sales of MREs to the U.S. military account for approximately 85% of revenue. ", "Under Berry Amendment requirements, DOD, with certain exceptions, must purchase food and ration kits for the military services from sources that manufacture, grow, or process food in the United States. Meeting this standard is generally easier with food than other manufactured products because there is a large domestic agricultural sector that supplies the overwhelming majority of food purchased by U.S. consumers. The food industry's output contains a larger share of domestic content than the output of any other manufacturing industry. ", "Affecting the purchase of food under the Berry Amendment are certain distinctions between food types and considerations of where the food was grown, caught, and/or harvested. For example, DOD interprets the Berry Amendment to provide that if a food item is processed in the United States, it may contain food grown or harvested in other countries. Thus, DOD may buy corn canned in the United States even if the corn was grown abroad. The same logic applies to many other items, such as potato chips, boxed cereals, and juices; as long as these items are processed in the United States, they are deemed compliant with the Berry Amendment. ", "The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide exemptions for a list of items that are generally not available from U.S. growers, such as bananas, capers, cashew nuts, coffee, cocoa beans, olive oil, bulk spices and herbs, raw sugar, tea in bulk, and vanilla beans. In addition, in 2008, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions, Technology, and Logistics issued a Domestic Non-Availability Determination affecting seasonal fresh fruits and vegetables, which allows DOD to purchase fruits and vegetables from foreign producers during off-season.

The rule applies to both fresh and frozen products whether sold whole, in parts, or as fillets. American Samoa's tuna fishing and processing industry, which comprises the majority of private-sector employment in this unincorporated territory of the United States, has benefited from the domestic preference provisions for food items in the Berry Amendment.

A hand or measuring tool is defined as wholly U.S.-made if it is assembled in the United States out of components, or otherwise made from raw materials into the finished product. For example, DOD is generally prohibited from buying a wrench not forged in the United States. The Kissell Amendment contains no provision related to hand or measuring tools.

Domestic supply of certain hand or measuring tools may be very limited; according to one estimate, in 2016, imports of hand tools accounted for more than 40% of domestic demand.
