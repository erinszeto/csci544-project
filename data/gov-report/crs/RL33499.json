Other provisions place financing and licensing conditions on sales to these countries. Those that apply to Cuba, though, are permanent and more restrictive. TSRA also gives Congress the authority in the future to veto a President's proposal to impose a sanction on the sale of agricultural or medical products.", "Codifying the food and medical sales exemption for Cuba generated much debate. Exemption proponents argued that prohibiting sales to Cuba harmed the U.S. agricultural sector, and that opening up limited trade would be one way to pursue a \"constructive engagement\" policy. Opponents countered that an exemption would undercut U.S. policy to pressure the Castro government to make political and economic reforms. Though top Cuban officials initially stated no purchases would be made with TSRA's conditions in place, food stock losses due to a hurricane and a shift in Cuban strategy led to almost $1.25 billion in cash purchases by Cuba of U.S. food and farm commodities from December 2001 to April 2006. Agricultural sales to Iran, Libya, and Sudan under TSRA have totaled $313 million.", "Congressional opponents of TSRA's prohibitions on private U.S. financing of agricultural sales, public financing of eligible exports, and tourist travel to Cuba have introduced bills since 2000 to repeal these provisions. Though several amendments to repeal or relax TSRA provisions relative to Cuba were adopted by committees or passed during floor debate, all were dropped in conference action. The Bush Administration's policy is to allow sales under TSRA, but not to change any aspect of the embargo until political and economic reforms occur in Cuba.

Fearing lost sales, farm groups and some congressional opposition to this rule has led to ongoing debate on this issue. Responding to congressional pressure, the Bush Administration in July 2005, revised this rule slightly to allow for goods to be shipped from a U.S. port once a third-country bank receives payment for the U.S. exporter from the Cuban purchaser. In recent floor action, the House on June 14, 2006, adopted an amendment to the FY2007 Transportation-Treasury spending bill (section 950 of H.R. 5576) to prohibit implementation of this rule.

The Administration's decision reflected its view that food should not be used as a foreign policy tool and officials' acknowledgment that U.S. sanctions policy had hurt the U.S. farm economy.

Leading commodities imported in 2002 were rice, chicken meat and products, wheat and flour, whole dry milk, lentils and corn. Food and agricultural imports in recent years have represented 17% of total Cuban merchandise imports, and have declined as a share of total imports since the early 1990s. Top suppliers in 2002 (as Cuba took advantage of the U.S. embargo exemption under TSRA) based on preliminary data were Canada, the United States, France, China, and Brazil. In addition, Cuba's tourism industry reportedly imports an additional $100 to $250 million in food products to cover the needs of visiting tourists.", "U.S. agricultural interests argued that exempting agricultural exports from the U.S. embargo on Cuba would result in an opening that yields substantial sales. Various studies projected annual sales could range from $100 million to over $1 billion, depending on the time frame looked at and the extent of liberalization that occurred in U.S.-Cuban trade. These interests also held that such a policy change will give U.S. exporters (particularly of rice and wheat) a competitive edge if Cuba takes advantage of its proximity to buy from its nearest supplier in order to save the cost of transporting commodities and food from its more distant current suppliers (France, Canada, Argentina). Cuba reportedly could save up to $100 million in transportation costs if officials decided to buy primarily from U.S. agricultural exporters.", "Expectations in 2000 of large immediate U.S. sales to the island were viewed as unrealistic, according to other analysts. Analysts pointed to Cuba's limited financial resources, its reliance on barter and credit transactions to finance agricultural imports, its denial of access to U.S. government programs and to all U.S. public and private financing, and the possible application of other restrictive rules under current embargo regulations that could hamper such sales. They also suggested that it was uncertain that Cuba would purchase from the United States, pointing out there may be pressure to maintain trade ties with some of its \"socialist partners\" supplying such key commodities as rice, as well as resistance to relying on just one single supplier. Some also observed that the Cuban government may not have been prepared for, or interested in taking advantage of, this possible U.S. trade opening. Top Cuban officials, including Castro himself, initially rejected the enacted measure. They strongly criticized its financing, travel, and other prohibitions as \"unworkable\" and \"insulting.\" They viewed it as a tightening rather than an easing of the embargo, and stated that Cuba will not buy any U.S. product with such conditions in place."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sales Activity to Date", "paragraphs": ["Notwithstanding this position, the Cuban government on November 13, 2001, signaled interest in buying U.S. agricultural commodities to quickly rebuild food reserves damaged or lost due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Michelle.

Opponents of the rule have signaled their intent to continue to work with Congress to overturn it. This slight shift in policy prompted Senator Baucus to lift his hold on six Treasury nominees, who were then confirmed by the Senate later that day. Though exports in the first four months after OFAC's rule change (April to July 2005) were below 2004 levels, exports since August 2005 have been higher in all months but one compared to year-earlier levels.
