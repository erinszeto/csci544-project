Under permanent law, eligible commodities would be supported at levels much higher than they are now, and many of the currently supported commodities might not be eligible (including soybeans and peanuts). Permanent law for the commodity programs is so radically different from current policy and inconsistent with today's farming, marketing, and trade agreements\u2014as well as costly to the federal government\u2014that Congress was unlikely to let it take effect. Lack of new legislation would have reduced or eliminated some conservation, domestic nutrition assistance, trade and foreign food aid, and rural development programs.", "Six temporary extensions continued the authority of most programs in the 2002 farm bill until May 23, 2008. A new farm bill was enacted on May 22, 2008 (P.L. 110-234), when the Senate joined the House in overriding the presidential veto of H.R. 2419. However, a clerical error omitted Title III, the trade and foreign aid title from the enrolled version sent to the President. To resolve the absence of Title III, another complete version of the farm bill (H.R. 6124) was passed, vetoed and overridden. The final enacted version of the 2008 farm bill is P.L. 110-246.", "Prior to enactment of the farm bill, programs that were not extended in the temporary extensions included the direct, counter-cyclical, and marketing loan programs for the 2008 crop year for the major crops (such as corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice), peanut storage, community food projects authorized under the Food Stamp Act, the rural broadband program, value-added market development grants, and certain renewable energy programs. However, the dairy, sugar, and wool and mohair programs were extended.", "Most of the long-standing USDA conservation programs were permanently authorized and had a current appropriation. Other conservation programs that pay farmers to remove fragile crop land from production were authorized and received mandatory funding from the 2002 farm bill but awaited renewal. Two conservation programs that pay farmers for adopting resource stewardship practices (the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Security Program) were extended beyond FY2007 by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171).", "USDA's domestic food assistance programs (for example, food stamps) generally were permanently authorized, and, in most cases, they were not affected by the possible expiration of the farm bill, since they received a full-year FY2008 appropriation.

Would programs authorized by the expiring legislation have ceased to operate, or would they have continued under non-expiring provisions of permanent law? Where there is permanent law, would the design and funding have changed?", "The 2002 omnibus farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ) included a wide range of program authorities, some of which were mandatory and others discretionary. Mandatory, in this context, means that the authority to spend necessary funds is provided by statute. This mandatory category includes the commodity support programs, export programs, some conservation programs, and food stamps. Discretionary programs are authorized, but annual funding is subject to congressionally approved appropriations. Discretionary programs in the farm bill include some conservation programs, federal farm loan programs, rural development programs, agricultural research, and some foreign food aid, among others.", "In nearly all cases, a farm bill supersedes permanent authorizing law for a period of four to six years. The farm bill is important because it may substantially change program design from what is in the permanent law, as is the case with commodity support programs. Typically, with regard to appropriated programs, the farm bill sets policy parameters and upper limits on program activity levels and appropriations authority.", "Without an extension, most appropriated programs (also referred to as discretionary programs) in the 2002 farm bill and some mandatory programs, such as food stamps, would have faced the prospect of not having statutory authority for the appropriations committees to provide funding in FY2008 and subsequent years.

The first extension was in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. It extended the authority for many expiring farm bill programs for nearly three months until March 15, 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 , Division A, Sec. 751). The second extension in P.L. 110-196 lasted for about one month until April 18, 2008.

Because no further temporary extension was passed, the trade provisions in Title III of the 2002 farm bill expired. To deal with the omission of Title III, both chambers repassed the farm bill conference agreement (including the trade title) as H.R. 6124 . The President vetoed the measure on June 18, 2008, and both chambers again overrode the veto, which made H.R. 6124 law as P.L. 110-246 , superseding P.L. 110-234 .", "While the 2008 farm bill was being completed in Congress, the temporary extensions stated that, unless otherwise excepted, 2002 farm bill provisions in effect on September 30, 2007, shall continue until the new expiration date. The extensions funded three conservation programs at specific levels (Farmland Protection Program at $97 million/year, Ground and Surface Water Conservation at $60 million/year, and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program at $85 million/year). For the commodity title, the dairy and sugar programs were included in the extension, as were price support loan programs for wool and mohair.", "Programs that specifically were not extended included the direct, counter-cyclical, and marketing loan programs for the 2008 crop year for all other supported commodities (e.g., feed grains, oilseeds, wheat, rice, cotton, and peanuts), peanut storage payments, agricultural management assistance for conservation, community food projects in the food stamp program, the rural broadband program, value-added market development grants, federal procurement of biobased products, the biodiesel fuel education program, and the renewable energy systems program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Commodity Support Programs6", "paragraphs": ["The mandatory commodity support programs authorized in the 2002 farm bill cover the 2007 crops. So, all subsidy obligations related to 2007 crop production are covered by the law, even if spending occurs in FY2008. For commodity support programs, there was little reason to enact a farm bill before the end of calendar year 2007. In fact, past farm bills generally have been enacted late in the year, after the end of the fiscal year. The 1981 and 1985 farm bills were enacted in late December, and the 1990 farm bill was enacted in late November. What was expected to be a 1995 farm bill was not enacted until April 4, 1996, another case of belated action. Even in that case, payments were made on the 1995 crops and farmers went ahead with planting operations for their 1996 crops.", "Policy officials and the agriculture community expected a 2007 farm bill to be enacted before the end of calendar year 2007. However, lack of new commodity support legislation before harvest in 2008 did little harm other than leaving producers of \"covered commodities\" uncertain about the size of payments they might receive. The uncertainty about future policy could have affected some farmers' ability to acquire production loans from commercial lenders. But even if Congress had deemed a one-or two-year extension necessary for the commodity support programs beyond the 2007 crop year, that action likely could have waited until June 2008, when winter wheat\u2014the first of the 2008 crop year commodities\u2014was harvested."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Possible Reversion to Permanent Law", "paragraphs": ["If Congress had not enacted the 2008 farm bill before the beginning of the 2008 harvest, then the non-expiring provisions of primarily the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938 and the Agriculture Act of 1949 would have taken effect.

The commodity support provisions of permanent law are so radically different from current policy\u2014and inconsistent with today's farming, marketing, and trade agreements, as well as potentially costly to the federal government\u2014that Congress was unlikely to let permanent law take effect.", "Permanent law provides mandatory support for basic crops through nonrecourse loans, but without the option of settling the loan obligations at posted county prices or receiving loan deficiency payments. The only settlement options in permanent law are forfeiture of the commodities used as loan collateral or full repayment of the loans. Permanent law does not authorize counter-cyclical payments or decoupled direct payments. Also, nonrecourse loan rates could be as high as 90% of parity but not less than 50% of parity for corn, wheat, and rice, and 65% of parity for cotton. Acreage allotments and marketing quotas could be implemented for wheat and cotton. Milk support would be between 75% and 90% of parity. Support for soybeans, other oilseeds, and peanuts would not be mandatory. Other commodities now receiving mandatory support but not identified in permanent law are: sugar beets, sugar cane, wool, mohair, small chickpeas, dry peas, and lentils.", "For wheat and cotton, permanent law requires USDA to announce acreage allotments and marketing quotas during the prior crop year, and to hold producer referenda on whether to implement marketing quotas. A two-thirds or more affirmative producer vote for marketing quotas results in the highest levels of support, but also mandatory restrictions on planted acreage and therefore on the quantity eligible for support. For this analysis, it is assumed the Secretary announces no marketing quotas, and thus no producer referenda. Therefore, the only requirement is to announce wheat acreage allotments prior to the 2008 harvest. Table 1 summarizes the support estimates based on these assumptions.", "As shown in Table 1 , not all commodities currently receiving federal support would be covered by mandatory provisions in permanent law. The commodities losing mandatory support include peanuts, wool, mohair, sugar beats and sugar cane, soybeans and other oilseeds, dry peas, lentils, and small chick peas. Any and all of these commodities could receive support under discretionary authority given the Secretary of Agriculture in the Agriculture Act of 1949 and the CCC Charter Act. For budgetary and other reasons, that discretionary authority has been seldom used and was unlikely to be applied in 2008. Important to this supposition is the fact that, with few exceptions, market prices for agricultural commodities are high and there would be little economic justification for federal support to be implemented.", "Milk is supported currently and in permanent law through the offer of USDA to purchase manufactured dairy products (nonfat dry milk, cheddar cheese, and butter) at prices equivalent to the mandated support price for manufacturing grade milk. Under permanent law those purchase prices (based on January 2008 data) would be about three times as high a currently mandated and nearly 50% higher than market prices. Such high USDA purchase prices could result in the government outbidding commercial markets for a sizeable share of processor output. Under the 2002 farm bill, permanent law would have taken effect on January 1, 2008. However, temporary extensions continued the dairy price support program.", "Under permanent law, nonrecourse loan rates for wheat, corn, and other feed grains, and cotton function as USDA purchase prices. Unless commercial markets pay more than the nonrecourse loan prices, farmers simply put their crops under loan and forfeit the commodities to USDA when the nine-month loans come due. Thus loan prices effectively are government purchase prices. When market prices are lower than the nonrecourse loan rates, commercial buyers have to raise their prices to outbid the USDA to acquire wheat, feed grains, and cotton.

The cost of these programs largely relates to agency personnel who provide specialized technical training, cost-sharing with farmers, and administrative overhead. Conservation program spending recently has averaged about $5 billion annually.", "While most of the larger conservation programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill and would have expired the end of FY2007, several mostly older programs, with total spending about $1 billion, are permanently authorized and appropriations committees are to provide such sums as necessary to meet program needs. Thus, there is no constraint on appropriators in future years. As with most appropriated (discretionary) programs, funding depends heavily on budget requests from the administering executive agency. So, the future of these programs, short of a change in the permanent authorizing law, largely is in the hands of the appropriators. These programs are listed at the top of Table 2 .", "The Food Security Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-198 ) and subsequent amendments have become the legal foundation for another set of programs that now account for almost $4 billion, 80% of USDA conservation spending. Most of these programs are administered by NRCS, while the largest (the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)) is administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA), with support from NRCS. The original authorizing legislation expired in 1990, but has been extended and amended by periodic farm bills. Many of these programs were extended by the 2002 farm bill and most of the programs expired September 30, 2007. However, the temporary farm bill extensions continued these programs.", "The absence of new mandatory program authority likely would mean that no new contracts could be signed with farmers. All existing contracts would stay in force for their specified lives, and payments would continue to be made on the existing contracts. Three mandatory conservation programs were funded at specific levels by the temporary extensions\u2014the Farmland Protection Program ($97 million), the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program ($85 million), and the Ground and Surface Water Conservation Program ($60 million). Also, two programs, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Security Program (CSP), have been extended in earlier legislation to FY2010 and FY2011, respectively.
