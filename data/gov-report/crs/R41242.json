In 2012, a beneficiary who is below FRA and will not attain FRA during the year is subject to a $1 reduction in benefits for each $2 of earnings above $14,640. A beneficiary who will attain FRA in 2012 is subject to a $1 reduction in benefits for each $3 of earnings above $38,880. The annual exempt amounts ($14,640 and $38,880 in 2012) generally are adjusted each year according to average wage growth.", "If a beneficiary is affected by the RET, his or her monthly benefit may be reduced in part or in full, depending on the total applicable reduction. For example, if the total applicable reduction is greater than the beneficiary's monthly benefit amount, no monthly benefit is payable for one or more months. If family members also receive auxiliary benefits based on the beneficiary's work record, the reduction is pro-rated and applied to all benefits payable on that work record (including benefits paid to spouses who are above FRA). For example, in the case of a family consisting of a worker beneficiary who has earnings above the annual exempt amount and a spouse and child who receive benefits based on his or her work record, the benefit reduction that applies under the RET is charged against the total family benefit.", "The RET has been part of the Social Security program in some form throughout the program's history. The original rationale for the RET was that, as a social insurance system, Social Security protects workers from certain risks, including the loss of earnings due to retirement. Therefore, benefits should be withheld from workers who show by their earnings that they have not \"retired.\" The RET does not apply to Social Security disability beneficiaries who are subject to separate limitations on earnings.", "If a beneficiary is affected by the RET, his or her monthly benefit is recomputed, and the dollar amount of the monthly benefit is increased, when he or she attains FRA. This feature of the RET, which allows beneficiaries to recoup benefits \"lost\" as a result of the RET, is not widely known or understood. The benefit recomputation at FRA is done by adjusting (lessening) the actuarial reduction for retirement before FRA that was applied in the initial benefit computation to take into account months for which benefits were reduced in part or in full under the RET. Any spousal benefits that were reduced because of the RET are recomputed when the spouse attains FRA. For a spouse who has already attained FRA, however, there is no subsequent adjustment to benefits to take into account months for which no benefit or a partial benefit was paid as a result of the RET.", "The Social Security Administration estimates that elimination of the RET for individuals aged 62 or older would have a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund in the amount of $81 billion from 2012 to 2018, although it would have no major effect on Social Security's projected long-range financial outlook.", "This report explains how the RET works under current law.

Benefit reductions under the RET apply both to the worker beneficiary and to any family members (auxiliary beneficiaries) who receive benefits based on the worker beneficiary's record. This would include, for example, a dependent child and a spouse who may have already attained FRA. When a worker beneficiary and family members are subject to a benefit reduction under the RET, the reduction is pro-rated and applied to each person's benefit in proportion to each person's original entitlement amount. (The total amount of the reduction remains the same, but the reduction is pro-rated across more people.) An auxiliary beneficiary may be subject to a reduction in benefits under the RET both on the basis of the worker beneficiary's earnings above the exempt amount and on the basis of his or her own earnings above the exempt amount. Benefits \"lost\" as a result of the RET may be recouped by the beneficiary. When a beneficiary attains FRA and is no longer subject to the RET, his or her benefits are adjusted upward to take into account months for which no benefit or a partial benefit was paid as a result of the RET. The Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates that elimination of the RET for individuals aged 62 or older would have no major effect on Social Security's projected long-range financial outlook. In the short run, however, SSA estimates that eliminating the RET would have a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund in the amount of $81 billion from 2012 to 2018.

Instead, the board recommended a specific monetary amount to simplify administration. In 1939, Congress incorporated these recommendations in amendments to the Social Security Act. Starting with the first benefits paid in 1940, benefits were withheld for months in which covered earnings were $15 or more.", "The RET has evolved from a monthly test to an annual one (with the exception of the \"grace year\" as discussed below) and from a provision that initially affected all worker beneficiaries to one that affects beneficiaries who are below the FRA. The most recent legislative change to the RET was in 2000 when Congress eliminated the RET for beneficiaries beginning with the month they attain FRA.

As noted previously, if a beneficiary has benefits withheld under the RET, his or her benefit is recomputed when he or she attains FRA to take into account months for which no benefit or a partial benefit was paid due to the RET.

In contrast, claimants with no earnings who have other forms of income, such as private pensions or investment income, can receive full Social Security benefits. Supporters of the RET counter that eliminating the RET would provide a bonus to people who are fortunate enough to be able to continue working after becoming entitled to retirement benefits, and the additional Social Security benefits may allow or encourage some individuals to reduce their work hours."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Financial Effect of Repealing the RET on the Social Security Trust Fund", "paragraphs": ["Under current law, the RET has no major effect on Social Security financing over the long run because, on average , the RET has \"no significant effect\" on lifetime benefits. Therefore, the Social Security Administration's Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) estimates that elimination of the RET for individuals aged 62 or older would have no major effect on Social Security's projected long-range financial outlook. ", "In the short run, however, OCACT estimates that elimination of the RET would have a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund in the amount of $81 billion from 2012 to 2018. The trust fund would experience a projected cash-flow deficit of $12.1 billion in 2012, and a projected cash-flow deficit of $10.4 billion in 2018. OCACT notes: \"In the first several years after elimination of the retirement earnings test, benefit payments are projected to increase substantially, because benefits are paid under the proposal where such payments would be withheld, or the individual would have not applied for benefits yet, under current law.\"", "In summary, OCACT notes that the projected financial effects for the Social Security program of eliminating the RET are due to \"(1) some individuals no longer having their benefits withheld, (2)\u00a0some individuals who would apply for Social Security benefits earlier because of the earnings test elimination, and (3) a small net increase in earnings for individuals currently subject to the earnings test.\"", "Appendix A. Computation of the Social Security Retired-Worker Benefit", "To be eligible for a Social Security retired-worker benefit, a person generally needs 40 earnings credits, or 10 years of Social Security-covered employment (among other requirements). A worker's initial monthly benefit is based on his or her 35 highest years of earnings which are indexed to historical wage growth (earnings through the age of 60 are indexed; earnings thereafter are counted at nominal value). The 35 highest years of indexed earnings are divided by 35 to determine the worker's career-average annual earnings. The resulting amount is divided by 12 to determine the worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). If a worker has fewer than 35 years of earnings in covered employment, years of no earnings are entered as zeros.", "The worker's basic benefit amount (i.e., before any adjustments for early or delayed retirement) is the primary insurance amount (PIA). The PIA is determined by applying a formula to the AIME as shown in Table A -1 . First, the AIME is sectioned into three brackets, or levels, of earnings. Three progressive factors\u201490%, 32%, and 15%\u2014are applied to the three different brackets of AIME. The three products derived from multiplying each factor and bracket of AIME are added together. For workers who become eligible for retirement benefits (i.e., those who attain age 62), become disabled, or die in 2012, the PIA is determined as shown in the example in Table A -1 .", "Adjustment to Benefits Claimed Before or After FRA", "A worker's initial monthly benefit is equal to his or her PIA if he or she begins receiving benefits at FRA (i.e., FRA is the earliest age at which full (unreduced) retirement benefits are payable). A worker's initial monthly benefit will be less than his or her PIA if he or she begins receiving benefits before FRA, and it will be greater than his or her PIA if he or she begins receiving benefits after FRA. As noted previously, FRA ranges from the age of 65 to 67 depending on the person's year of birth.", "Retirement benefits are reduced by five-ninths of 1% (or 0.0056) of the worker's PIA for each month of entitlement before FRA up to 36 months, for a reduction of about 6.7% a year. For each month of benefit entitlement before FRA in excess of 36 months, retirement benefits are reduced by five-twelfths of 1% (or 0.0042), for a reduction of 5% a year. Workers who delay filing for benefits until after FRA receive a delayed retirement credit (DRC). The DRC applies beginning with the month the worker attains FRA and ending with the month before he or she attains the age of 70. Starting in 1990, the DRC increased until it reached 8% per year for workers\u00a0born in 1943 or later (i.e., starting with those who attained age 62 in 2005 or age 66 in 2009).", "Appendix B.

A monthly survivor benefit equal to 100% of the deceased worker's PIA is payable to the surviving spouse or surviving divorced spouse of a worker who was fully insured at the time of death. Benefits for spouses, divorced spouses and surviving spouses are reduced if claimed before FRA. In addition, these benefits are reduced or fully offset if the beneficiary receives his or her own Social Security retired-worker benefit or a pension from a job that was not covered by Social Security (such as certain federal, state or local government jobs).", "The child of a disabled or retired worker is eligible for 50% of the worker's PIA. The child of a deceased worker is eligible for 75% of the worker's PIA.
