Their interest was stimulated by debate over the proposed South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) and the question of whether the agreement could lead to increased imports from North Korea. Some observers, particularly many opposed to the agreement, have argued that the KORUS FTA could increase imports from North Korea if South Korean firms re-export items made in the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), a seven-year-old industrial park located in North Korea, where more than 100 South Korean manufacturers employ over 45,000 North Korean workers. Two concerns expressed by critics are (1) that South Korean firms could obtain low-cost KIC-made goods or components, incorporate them into finished products and then reship the goods to the United States with \"Made in [South] Korea\" labels so that they would receive preferential treatment under the KORUS FTA; and (2) that such exports would benefit the North Korean government.", "At present, North Korea's relative economic isolation and an array of U.S. restrictions have resulted in less than $350,000 in U.S. cumulative imports from North Korea since 2000. Thus, the issue of U.S. imports from North Korea is essentially about what might happen in the future.", "This report examines the issue of U.S. imports from North Korea in three parts:", "U.S. rules and practices governing imports from North Korea. The United States does not maintain a comprehensive embargo against North Korea. However, imports from North Korea require approval from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This restriction includes finished goods originating in North Korea as well as goods that contain North Korea-made components. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for reviewing an importer's OFAC license as the goods enter the United States. North Korea's exports to South Korea (via the KIC) and China, its dominant export markets. In 2010, over three-quarters of North Korea's export shipments went to China and South Korea. Most of North Korea's $1.2 billion in exports to China in 2010 were mineral resources or primary products (such as fish, shellfish, and agro-forest products). An increasing proportion of North Korea's exports to South Korea have become attributable to activities in the KIC, where factories manufactured more than $320 million in goods in 2010, a 25% increase over 2009. The present South Korean government has halted plans for a major expansion of the complex. If a future South Korean government resumes these plans, or if China and North Korea significantly boost bilateral economic integration, more North Korean goods and components could enter global supply chains and test U.S. restrictions against North Korean imports. The KORUS FTA's potential effect on U.S. imports of North Korean content. The KORUS FTA appears likely to have only a minimal impact on whether U.S. sanctions on North Korean imports are put to the test. At present, the agreement would not give preferential treatment to finished products made in the KIC. The agreement would establish a binational committee to discuss whether zones such as the KIC should be given preferential treatment in the future. The committee would operate by consensus, and Congress would need to pass a law to extend any KORUS FTA tariff benefits to products made in the KIC. Moreover, the KORUS FTA contains provisions that make it highly unlikely the agreement would constrain the United States' ability to maintain its restrictions on North Korean products. Many critics of the KORUS FTA argue that the agreement's rules of origin would make it possible for South Korean exports with North Korean components to receive preferential treatment. However, the KORUS FTA's rules of origin do not appear to limit the United States' ability to enforce its restrictions on imported products that contain North Korean inputs.", "The issue of how best to handle imports from North Korea appears to center on customs controls, cooperation, and enforcement. The complex nature of many types of goods, such as automobiles and electronics, poses a particular challenge for Customs and Border Protection officials to determine the origin of these products. There is no means to determine with one hundred percent certainty that there are no goods or components originating in North Korea entering U.S. commerce without proper authorization. This will be true regardless of whether the KORUS FTA is in effect. Thus, perhaps the most important factor that will determine whether U.S. restrictions on North Korean imports are tested appears to be the degree to which North Korean goods enter global supply chains."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["A number of groups and individuals have recently focused attention on U.S. rules governing imports from North Korea. Their interest has been sparked by the debate over the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA), which would lower or eliminate U.S. tariffs and non-tariff barriers on most imports from South Korea. Some, particularly the agreement's opponents, argue that the agreement could lead to increased U.S. imports of goods or components made in North Korea. The KORUS FTA will not enter into force unless Congress approves implementation legislation, which Obama Administration officials have said they expect to send to the 112 th Congress.", "As a result of North Korea's relative economic isolation, the undeveloped state of its export sector, and U.S. trade restrictions, the United States imports virtually no finished goods from North Korea. Between 2000 and 2010, cumulative U.S. bilateral imports of finished North Korean goods totaled $335,700, which is equivalent to a rounding error in annual U.S. trade flows with most countries. Nearly half of this amount consisted of stamps, with another 40% or so consisting of women's clothing. Since 2005, according to U.S. trade data, the only finished imports that have entered the United States from North Korea have been $8,363 worth of stamps, which were imported in June 2010. Imports of finished North Korean goods have literally been zero in four of the past five years. ", "Those concerned that the KORUS FTA would change this situation focus considerable attention on the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), a seven-year-old industrial park located in North Korea just across the demilitarized zone, where more than 100 South Korean manufacturers employ over 45,000 North Korean workers at relatively low wages. Critics argue that South Korean firms could obtain low-cost Kaesong-made goods or components, incorporate the latter into finished products such as electronics or automobiles, and then reship the final goods to the United States with \"Made in [South] Korea\" labels. If the KORUS FTA were in effect, the argument runs, these goods might receive preferential treatment, to the benefit of the North Korean government, which receives revenue from the KIC.

The second section analyzes the two main portals through which North Korea conducts its minimal economic interaction with the outside world: the KIC and China. The third section addresses the issue of how, if at all, the KORUS FTA would affect potential U.S. imports of North Korean content, including whether the agreement could result in legal action against the U.S. government if it kept out imports of North Korean content.

The Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and Transportation issued new regulations a year later that implemented the new policy.

Security Council resolutions, presumably sinking a South Korean naval vessel (the Cheonan ), and launching artillery shells at the South Korean island of Yeongpyeong.

This phenomenon accelerated in 2010, when South Korea halted virtually all non-KIC trade with North Korea following the Cheonan 's sinking in March 2010.

Light industry and other manufacturers that depend on low labor costs and low-level technology products (e.g., textiles and apparel, general machinery, some electronics, and furniture) are among those most likely to move facilities into the complex, particularly given concerns about the level of intellectual property rights protection in North Korea.

On the one hand, it has halted plans for a major expansion of the complex, due in part to the marked deterioration in inter-Korean relations since early 2008. On the other hand, the complex has continued to expand incrementally under Lee, and his government did not close it down despite the Cheonan 's sinking and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010. Lee's reluctance to shut down the KIC reflects not only the financial cost of doing so\u2014a closure could make South Korea's government liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance payments to the South Korean companies that use the complex\u2014but also the political support that the KIC enjoys within South Korea.

Recently, North Korea has increased its exports of primary products (such as fish, shellfish and agro-forest products) and mineral products (such as base metallic minerals). Pyongyang reportedly has imported aquaculture technology (mainly from China) to increase production of cultivated fish and agricultural equipment to increase output of grains and livestock. North Korea also has imported equipment for its coal and mineral mines. Much of the coal and mineral exports have resulted from partnering with Chinese firms, through which the Chinese side provides modern equipment in exchange for a supply of the product being mined or manufactured.

The United States adamantly opposed this position. In the final KORUS FTA agreement, the two sides reached a compromise on the KIC by creating a special committee to handle the issue. As discussed below, incorporating the KIC into the KORUS FTA would require the U.S. executive branch and Congress to approve such a move.", "The KORUS FTA's KIC-related provision is Annex 22-B, titled \"Committee on Outward Processing Zones on the Korean Peninsula.\" It sets out a process under which the United States and Korea may \"review whether conditions on the Korean Peninsula are appropriate for further economic development through the establishment and development of outward processing zones.\" An \"outward processing zone\" (OPZ) would be an area outside the FTA territory in which a certain amount of manufacturing or processing of a good could take place for purposes of deeming the good \"originating\" under the agreement and thus be eligible for preferential tariff treatment and other agreement benefits.", "To this end, the United States and South Korea would establish a Committee on Outward Processing Zones on the Korean Peninsula comprising officials of both countries. The kinds of people who will serve on the committee has not yet been determined. The committee would initially meet on the first anniversary of the entry into force of the KORUS FTA and at least once annually thereafter or at any other time mutually agreed upon by the committee. The committee is to identify geographic areas that may be designated OPZs and establish various political and economic criteria, including labor and environmental standards, that must be met before \"goods from any outward processing zone\" may be considered originating goods for FTA purposes. The committee would also determine whether the proposed OPZ has met the committee's criteria. In addition, the committee \"shall also establish a maximum threshold for the value of the total input of the 'originating final good' that may be added within the geographic area of the outward processing zone.\"", "Committee decisions reached by \"unified consent\" would be recommended to the United States and South Korea. The two countries would then be responsible \"for seeking legislative approval for any amendments to the Agreement with respect to outward processing zones.\" In March 2011, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) issued a statement that \"Congress would need to pass, and the President would need to sign, a law to extend any KORUS tariff benefits to products made in Kaesong or any OPZ.\"", "To the extent that the United States maintains an import embargo on finished goods of North Korea and goods made elsewhere with North Korean components, the United States would first need to deem OPZ goods admissible before the question of applicable tariff treatment arises. Further, because Congress has express constitutional authority to impose duties under Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, of the U.S. Constitution, Congress must either itself authorize specific tariff rates to be imposed on particular products or grant the President the authority to proclaim them.", "As discussed earlier, goods from countries that are subject to Title IV of the Trade Act, such as those of North Korea, may only be accorded NTR (MFN) treatment under the specific requirements of that title. Unless Congress by statute removes a country from the Title IV regime, as it has done with regard to countries entering the World Trade Organization, the President must abide by Title IV requirements in order to grant NTR tariff status to a Title IV country. Further , because Congress has provided that imports that are not subject to Title IV or other statutory restrictions are entitled at most to NTR tariff status under \u00a7 136 of the Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2136, the extension of preferential tariff rates to imports from any country must be expressly authorized. Any grant of presidential proclamation authority in KORUS FTA implementing legislation will likely apply only to \"originating goods\" of the territory of South Korea as that term is defined in the implementing legislation. Thus, presidential authority to proclaim preferential rates with regard to goods other than those that would currently qualify as \"originating\" under the FTA would need to be provided in a separate enactment.", "Some observers, particularly U.S. opponents of the KORUS FTA, have criticized the agreement for including Annex 22-B and have called for the agreement to be renegotiated so that the annex is deleted and/or products made in the Kaesong Industrial Complex are explicitly excluded from the terms of the agreement.

The obligation covers prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes, or other charges and includes such measures as quotas or import licenses. Import prohibitions or restrictions may not be applied to \"the goods of the other Party,\" a category that would include not only originating goods, but also any good that qualifies as a good of South Korea under U.S. non-preferential rules of origin. Thus, goods covered by Article 2.8.1 could include final goods of South Korea manufactured with components from a third country. The obligation in Article 2.8.1 would apply, however, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided\" in the agreement.", "One such exception may be found in Article 2.8.4(a), which provides that, in the event that \"a KORUS Party adopts or maintains a prohibition on the importation from \u2026 a non-Party of a good, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Party from \u2026 limiting or prohibiting the importation of the good of the non-Party from the territory of the other Party.\" This provision contemplates that a country may impose or maintain an import embargo against the goods of a non-signatory country and that the embargo may be implemented without violating the agreement even though it may affect trade with the other KORUS FTA Party. Thus, in the event that the United States were to prohibit the importation of a good from North Korea, the KORUS FTA would not preclude the United States from prohibiting the importation of that North Korean good from the territory of South Korea as well. Further, because Article 2.8.4 would apply with respect to restrictions or prohibitions on the importation of goods of any third country, it would apply with respect to all U.S. import embargoes, including, among others, those with Cuba and Iran.", "The United States has long taken the position that an FTA provision of this type protects U.S. trade sanctions programs. Although Article 2.8.4 does not expressly state that a \"good of the non-Party\" includes a non-Party component used in the manufacture of a finished good in another country, the United States has traditionally understood the term \"good\" in this context to include not only final products of the non-Party but also non-Party components used in third-country production. For example, when the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) was submitted to Congress for approval in 1988, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations\u2014as they continue to do today\u2014made it unlawful for a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction, unless authorized by the Treasury Department, to import merchandise of Cuban origin or merchandise \"made or derived in whole or in part of any article that is the growth, produce or manufacture of Cuba.\" In submitting the agreement to Congress, the Administration emphasized that the CFTA would not affect the existing Cuban sanctions program, stating that the CFTA rules of origin \"would not operate to override\" the above-quoted regulation and adding that the CFTA contained a provision\u2014similar to Article 2.8.4 of the KORUS FTA\u2014that permitted the United States and Canada to impose restrictions on the importation of products of a third country. The United States took the same position with respect to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), noting that a similar NAFTA provision \"permits the United States to ensure that Cuban products or goods made from Cuban materials are not imported into the United States from Mexico or Canada.\"", "Chapter 6 of the KORUS FTA further separates admissibility from tariff treatment by providing that \"whether a good is originating is not determinative of whether the good is also admissible.\" This statement appears in a note to Article 6.1, the KORUS FTA provision containing the basic requirements for what constitutes an \"originating good.\" Thus, it would appear that if a good with some North Korean content were to qualify as an \"originating good\" under the agreement, this status would not necessitate that it be admitted into the territory of the United States or South Korea.", "Further, given that national security considerations may be a factor in restricting imports from North Korea, the \"essential security\" exception of the KORUS FTA, set out at Article 23.2 of the agreement, may also come into play. Indeed, the United States considered that the security exceptions of the CFTA and the NAFTA could be used to justify its import embargo against Cuba in the event of a challenge. The KORUS FTA security exception states, in pertinent part, that \"[n]othing in this Agreement shall be construed \u2026 (b) to preclude a Party from applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration or international peace or security or the protection of its own essential security interests.\"", "Although the United States has considered clauses of this type to be self-judging\u2014that is, not subject to third-party or arbitral scrutiny \u2014the breadth of such a clause may lead it to be invoked in situations that adversely affected trading partners might not necessarily view as security-related. The KORUS FTA provides, however, that if the essential security exception is invoked as a defense by a country in a KORUS FTA dispute settlement proceeding\u2014be it a dispute between the United States and South Korea under the State-State provisions of Chapter 22 or a dispute brought against a Party by an investor of the other Party under the investor-State dispute provisions of Chapter 11\u2014\"the tribunal or panel hearing the matter shall find that the exception applies.\" In other words, assume that South Korea or a South Korean investor alleged in a dispute settlement proceeding that the United States had implemented a particular sanction against North Korea in a manner that violated a KORUS FTA obligation owed either South Korea or the investor. If the United States defended its measure before the panel or tribunal on the ground that it was covered by the agreement's \"essential security\" exception, the arbitral tribunal or dispute panel presumably could not examine whether the U.S. measure fell within the scope of the exception. Rather, it would instead be required to find that the exception could be used to justify the measure in question. Further, it is also possible that dispute settlement proceedings may not be instituted at the outset if, in informal consultations, the responding Party conveys to the complainant that it intends to invoke this exception in any such proceeding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rules of Origin (ROO)42", "paragraphs": ["A number of U.S. critics of the KORUS FTA have argued that under the agreement's rules of origin (ROO), South Korean manufacturers will be able to incorporate North Korean components into their exports to the United States.

Customs officials use them to enforce trade restrictions, properly assess tariffs, apply trade remedies, and collect statistics. Other commercial trade policies are also linked to ROO, such as country-of-origin marking and government procurement. ROO are fairly straightforward when a product is \"wholly obtained\" from one country. However, when a finished product's component parts are manufactured in many countries, as is often the case in today's global trading environment, determining origin can be a complex process. The automotive sector is a prime example because the global supply chain is extensive. A single passenger vehicle can incorporate as many as 15,000 individual components.", "For the present discussion of imports from North Korea, the KORUS FTA's ROO are relevant only in those cases where an importer has received permission from OFAC to bring in a South Korean good that contains North Korean components.

One of the primary trade policy goals of preferential ROO is to exclud e products from countries that are not signatories of the FTA. A second goal is to limit the impact of the FTA on any domestic industry sector that either FTA signatory regards as particularly import-sensitive. Therefore, in order for goods to receive favorable tariff treatment, importers must be prepared to demonstrate that their products meet certain criteria. Preferential rules of origin are individually negotiated and tailored to meet the needs of each party to the agreement; they vary from FTA to FTA.", "Regional value content rules in the KORUS FTA specify that a percentage of inputs must be sourced from either the United States or South Korea. Thus, the KORUS FTA contains incentives that could encourage manufacturers to use parts, labor, and other inputs from either the United States or South Korea rather than buying components from North Korea (assuming they are admissible), China, or other markets. The strength of these incentives depends, in part, on the size of the two countries' tariffs before the FTA goes into effect. When external tariffs are low, the cost for an FTA manufacturer of not meeting the ROO is small; when a tariff is higher, there is a greater incentive for a manufacturer to satisfy the ROO to save on tariffs.", "As one example, under the KORUS FTA, a specified subset of costs of producing a passenger car or truck must originate in either the United States or South Korea in order to benefit from the lower (preferential) tariffs. If the FTA's ROO requirements are met, cars imported from South Korea would no longer be subject to the 2.5% U.S. NTR duty on these products. South Korean light truck manufacturers could gain an even greater price advantage if they meet the KORUS FTA rules of origin, while manufacturers located in China, Japan, or Europe would still be obligated to pay the higher 25% U.S. NTR tariff rates. There might also be similar gains for manufacturers in other industrial sectors.", "CBP officials note that Chapter 7 of the KORUS FTA, \"Customs Administration and Trade Facilitation\" enhances an already mutually beneficial cooperation between U.S. and South Korean customs officials. This chapter mandates the sharing of information and intelligence, including confidential information when either signatory suspects unlawful activity. Chapter 7 also provides for sharing technical advice, conducting joint training programs, and enforcing regulations that would make the enforcement of the mutual trading relationship more efficient. Since goods from the KIC must also pass through South Korean customs, to the extent that the KORUS FTA (1) further assists in the establishment of rules-based trade between the United States and South Korea, (2) continues to deepen the U.S.-South Korea economic relationship, and (3) continues to provide grounds and methods for customs cooperation and ongoing dialogue between officials of the two countries, one could argue that the proposed FTA may serve to further limit the entrance into the United States of North Korean-manufactured inputs.", "If Members of Congress are not satisfied with these provisions, they might seek to direct CBP officials to discuss with South Korean customs officials the possibility of requiring additional certification from South Korean exporters to the United States. Congress could also consider directing the CBP to conduct a greater percentage of audits of importers that apply for preferences under the KORUS-FTA, either during the transition period or for the life of the agreement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The KORUS FTA appears likely to have only a minimal impact on whether U.S. sanctions on North Korean imports are put to the test. The KORUS FTA's preferential terms would not apply to finished goods made in the KIC, and the provisions for bringing the KIC into the agreement include multiple opportunities for the United States, including Congress, to block such a move by a future South Korean government. The agreement also contains provisions that aim to help preserve the United States' ability to maintain its restrictions on imports of North Korean goods and components. As long as U.S. sanctions on North Korean imports remain in place and are adequately enforced, the KORUS FTA's rules of origin\u2014which are used to determine the country of origin of imported products\u2014would apply only in cases where an importer has received a license from OFAC to bring in a South Korean good that contains North Korean components.", "Thus, the issue of how best to handle imports from North Korea appears to center on customs controls, cooperation, and enforcement. At present, because North Korea exports a minimal amount of manufactured goods to the outside world, the application of U.S. restrictions against North Korean imports has not been significantly challenged. However, this situation may change if at some future date North Korean industry revives and its manufacturers become more integrated into the global economy. The most likely ways this integration would occur would be through increased economic ties between the North Korean and Chinese provinces straddling the DPRK-Chinese border or through a decision by the South and North Korean governments to significantly expand the Kaesong Industrial Complex.", "If either or both of these events occur, the possibility of circumventing U.S. import restrictions against North Korea could become a bigger problem than it is today. There is no means to determine with one hundred percent certainty that there are no goods or components originating in North Korea entering U.S. commerce without proper authorization. An example of the challenge faced is the automobile supply chain, in which Chinese or South Korean producers could source one of thousands of components from a low-wage North Korean producer and then seek to evade U.S. customs authorities by not reporting the item to OFAC or CBP. In the case of South Korea, these imports could receive preferential treatment if the KORUS FTA is passed and if the imports meet the agreement's rules of origin. The ability of the United States to enforce its restrictions would then depend to a large extent upon the level of U.S.-South Korea customs cooperation\u2014which arguably would be enhanced by the KORUS FTA\u2014and the severity of the penalties charged for non-compliance with U.S. import restrictions."], "subsections": []}]}}
