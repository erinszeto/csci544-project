Potential tools the Federal government might use to address these issues include research and development, regulation, and international engagement.", "Some of the properties of nanoscale materials (e.g., small size, high surface area-to-volume ratio) that have given rise to great hopes for beneficial applications have also given rise to concerns about their potential adverse implications for the environment, and human health and safety. With more than 1,000 nanotechnology products reportedly commercially available, there is great interest in protecting the health and safety of the scientists working with nanoscale materials, workers who manufacture the products, consumers who use the products, and members of the general public who may be exposed to nanoparticles, as well as in understanding the environmental impact of nanomanufacturing processes and the use and disposal of nanotechnology products.", "Nanoscale particles can result from a variety of different processes. While nanoscale particles can occur naturally (e.g., some particles produced by forest fires, sea spray, volcanoes) and as an incidental by-product of human activities (e.g., some particles contained in welding fumes, diesel exhaust, industrial effluents, cooking smoke), EHS concerns have focused primarily on nanoscale materials that are intentionally designed and produced, often referred to as engineered nanomaterials.", "Issues surrounding the potential EHS implications of nanotechnology emerged with the launch in 2000 of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). The NNI is a multi-agency federal effort to coordinate and expand federal nanotechnology research and development (R&D) efforts. Between FY2001 and FY2011, the federal government has invested approximately $14.2 billion in nanotechnology R&D, including approximately $1.8 billion in FY2011 funded under the current continuing resolution ( P.L. 111-322 ). In addition, by one estimate, U.S. private investment in nanotechnology\u2014$2.7 billion in corporate R&D and $1.0 billion in venture capital investments\u2014exceeded U.S. government funding of $1.9 billion in 2008. Many governments around the world have followed the U.S. lead and established their own national nanotechnology programs. The private sector has invested heavily as well. Global nanotechnology R&D investments\u2014public and private\u2014are estimated to have totaled more than $17 billion in 2008 alone.", "Such large investments and intensified efforts to capitalize on these public and private investments have caused some observers (as detailed later in this report) to suggest that there is insufficient information about the potential effects nanotechnology products and manufacturing processes may have on human health, safety, and the environment. They assert a variety of uncertainties, including: how nanoscale particles might be transported in air, water, and soil; how they might react with the environment chemically, biologically, or through other processes; how they might be distributed and deposited; and whether they might accumulate in plants or animals.", "Others express the view that concerns about nanotechnology EHS implications are often overgeneralized and overstated. Among the arguments they put forth are that nanoscale materials are frequently embedded in other materials as part of the manufacturing process; that some nanotechnology products, such as semiconductors, have nanoscale features but do not contain nanoscale particles; that nanotechnology materials may replace other materials that have significant and known risks; that some nanoscale particles tend to aggregate or agglomerate in the environment into larger particles that no longer have nanoscale dimensions; and that people are regularly exposed to nanoscale particles produced naturally and as incidental by-products of human activities.", "Congressionally-mandated reviews of the NNI by the National Research Council (NRC) and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) have concluded that additional research is required to make a rigorous risk assessment of nanoscale materials.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):", "nanoscale cerium oxide has been developed to decrease diesel engine emissions; iron nanoparticles can remove contaminants from soil and ground water; and nano-sized sensors hold promise for improved detection and tracking of contaminants.", "In the area of human health, scientists assert nanotechnology has the potential for improving disease diagnostics, sensing, monitoring, assessment, and treatment. In particular, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) views nanotechnology as likely to provide revolutionary tools to extend and improve lives. In July 2004, NCI launched a five-year, $145 million initiative focused on applying nanotechnology to the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer and amelioration of its symptoms. At the initiative's launch, then-NCI Director Andrew von Eschenbach identified nanotechnology as a key component of the agency's strategy for ending death and suffering from cancer by 2015 (see text box, \"Potential Nanotechnology Cancer Applications\"). The NCI has reissued the program for an additional five years and expects to complete an updated plan by the end of 2010.", "Some characteristics of nanoscale particles could produce both positive and negative consequences. According to E. Clayton Teague, director of the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO),", "the unique properties of these [nanotechnology] materials are a double-edged sword: they can be tailored for beneficial properties, but also have unknown consequences, such as new toxicological and environmental effects.", "The following examples illustrate how the same nanotechnology material may be both potentially beneficial and potentially harmful:", "Nanoscale silver is highly effective as an antibacterial agent in wound dressings, clothing, and washing machines, but some have expressed concerns that widespread dispersion of nanoscale silver in the environment could kill microbes that are vital to waste water treatment plants and to ecosystems. Some beneficial bacteria, for example, break down organic matter, remove nitrogen from water, aid in animal digestion, protect against fungal infestations, and even aid some animals in defense against predators. Some nanoscale particles may have the potential to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, a structure that protects the brain from harmful substances in the blood but also hinders the delivery of therapeutic agents. The characteristics of certain nanoscale materials may allow pharmaceuticals to be developed to purposefully and beneficially cross this barrier and deliver medicine directly to the brain to treat, for example, a brain tumor. Some critics are concerned, however, that nanoscale particles might unintentionally pass through the blood-brain barrier causing harm to humans and animals. Certain nanoscale materials are highly chemically reactive due to their high surface-to-volume ratio. This is a property that might be positively exploited in catalysis, treatment of groundwater contamination, and site remediation. This property also is being explored for use in protective masks and clothing as a defense against chemical and biological agents. However, some research results indicate that the reactivity of some nanoparticles potentially can result in cell damage in animals. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have potential uses in a wide range of applications (e.g., materials, batteries, memory devices, electronic displays, transparent conductors, sensors, medical imaging). However, some scientists have expressed concerns that some CNTs exhibit properties similar to asbestos fibers and might become lodged in organs (e.g., lungs, kidneys, livers), harming humans and animals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Importance of Addressing EHS Issues", "paragraphs": ["Nanotechnology covers a wide swath of scientific fields, engineering disciplines, and technological applications. Sufficient knowledge has been developed about the useful properties of certain nanomaterials, how they can be manufactured, and how they can be applied in useful ways to enable commercial product development. In other areas of nanotechnology, fundamental research on nanoscale phenomena and processes is under way that may lead to greater understanding and beneficial applications in the years ahead. In general, however, nanotechnology is still an emerging field and there is a dearth of information about how nanoscale particles and devices might adversely affect human health, safety, and the environment. Accordingly, there is widespread agreement on the need for more research to better understand such implications.", "In reviews of the NNI, both the 2006 National Research Council and the 2008 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) reports concluded that assessment of potential nanotechnology EHS risks was not possible due to the absence of information and tools. According to the NRC,", "it is not yet possible to make a rigorous assessment of the level of risk posed by [engineered nanomaterials]. Further risk assessment protocols have to be developed, and more research is required to enable assessment of potential EHS risks from nanomaterials.", "Similarly, PCAST found that", "it is premature to rigorously assess the levels of risk posed by engineered nanomaterials. Adequate tools are being developed but are not yet in place.", "Subsequently, in its third assessment of the NNI, the NRC alluded to potential EHS risks, stating:", "Research to date suggests that some products of nanotechnology have the potential to present new or unusual risks to human health and the environment. For instance, nanoscale particles may penetrate to places in the body that are inaccessible to larger particles; radical changes in behavior at the nanoscale may render harmful materials considered to be safe in larger-scale and more conventional forms.", "Leaders of the NNI have argued strongly that to achieve the economic, societal, and EHS benefits of nanotechnology the nation must concurrently address its potential adverse effects. According to then-Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology Phillip J. Bond, a leading Bush Administration advocate for the NNI,", "Addressing societal and ethical issues is the right thing to do and the necessary thing to do. It is the right thing to do because as ethically responsible leaders we must ensure that technology advances human well-being and does not detract from it. It is the necessary thing to do because it is essential for speeding technology adoption, broadening the economic and societal benefits, and accelerating and increasing our return on investment.", "The NRC's third assessment of the NNI reinforces the perspective that EHS-related uncertainty may stymie nanotechnology innovation and commercialization:", "In the absence of more detailed scientific evidence\u2014and effective assessment and communication of the evidence that does exist\u2014the distinction between plausible and implausible risks remains unclear. The resulting uncertainty threatens to undermine confidence and trust amongst investors, businesses, and consumers, and could jeopardize the success of nanotechnology. This is not a hypothetical threat. Consumer and advocacy groups already have raised concerns over the use of engineered nanomaterials in products as diverse as clothing, fuel additives, and sunscreens. Businesses have been hampered by regulatory uncertainty. A number of industries have shied away from nanotechnology for fear of consumer rejection in the face of speculative concerns.", "According to the NRC, the nanotechnology industry and a variety of environmental and public-health interest groups agree that an adequate evaluation of the potential health and environmental effects of engineered nanomaterials is necessary", "to ensure that the future of nanotechnology is not burdened by uncertainties and innuendo about potential adverse health and environmental effects of engineered nanoscale materials.", "A 2006 survey of business leaders in the field of nanotechnology indicated that nearly two-thirds believed that \"the risks to the public, the workforce, and the environment due to exposure to nano particles are 'not known,'\" and 97% believed that it is very important or somewhat important for the government to address potential health effects and environmental risks that may be associated with nanotechnology.", "The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) has warned that bad practices in nanotechnology research or production may result in a nanotechnology accident that would", "chill investment, galvanize public opposition, and generally lead to a lot of hand wringing on the part of governments who are betting large sums of money on the nanotech revolution.", "Successfully addressing EHS issues is seen as vital for those potentially exposed to nanoscale materials (e.g., consumers, researchers, manufacturing workers, the general public), businesses, and investors for a variety of reasons:", "protecting and improving human health, safety, and the environment; enabling accurate and efficient risk assessments, risk management, and cost-benefit trade-offs; ensuring public confidence in the safety of nanotechnology research, engineering, manufacturing, and use; preventing a problem in one application area of nanotechnology from having negative consequences for the use of nanotechnology in unrelated application areas due to public fears, legislative interventions, or an overly-broad regulatory response; and ensuring that society can enjoy the widespread economic and societal benefits that nanotechnology is believed by many to offer.", "In addition, the U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology could be an enabler for innovation and contribute to a strong, sustainable economy by creating predictability, accurately assessing risks and benefits, and fostering the swift movement of safe products into the market. Such an environment is likely to favor nanotechnology-related investments and innovative activities in the United States by domestic and foreign stakeholders, as opposed to nations where such regulatory conditions do not exist.", "Conversely, if the U.S. regulatory environment is not handled effectively (i.e., if it lacks predictability, if regulatory approaches do not accurately assess risks and benefits, or if approval processes are too long or expensive) it could prove a major impediment to innovation, economic growth, and job creation, as well as posing a potential threat to health, safety, and the environment. In such a regulatory environment, investment capital may be driven away from nanotechnology, potentially beneficial products may not be developed, safe products may be denied regulatory approval, or unsafe products may be allowed to enter the market.", "Alternatively, nanotechnology investments, research, and production may be driven to other nations with preferable regulatory environments. On the one hand, such a regulatory system might be more desirable to investors and companies because it is more predictable, more efficient, and less costly. In such a case, the United States might miss out on nanotechnology's potential economic benefits. On the other hand, if other nations' regulatory systems are more attractive to investors and producers because those systems under-regulate or do not regulate at all, then nanotechnology research, development, and production could present increased EHS risks worldwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Issues for Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Given the widespread agreement that nanotechnology EHS concerns must be addressed, discourse on how best to do so has focused on three main issues:", "federal investment in EHS research; federal regulation; and international engagement.", "These issues are closely interrelated. For example, reliable EHS research is required by regulatory bodies to determine whether and how to regulate nanotechnology products. Since all nations face the same fundamental health, safety, and environmental issues, international coordination on EHS research could help accelerate development of a common body of knowledge through the sharing of results and reduction in redundant research. This shared knowledge could, in turn, inform regulatory decision making and perhaps improve the consistency of regulations among nations. Regulations, standards, and enforcement might need to be coordinated worldwide to protect workers and consumers as intermediate and final products are frequently produced along global supply chains and sold in industrial and commercial markets around the world. In addition, one nation's policies governing nanotechnology production, use, and disposal may have implications for nearby nations and, perhaps, for all nations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Investment in EHS Research", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Funding Level", "paragraphs": ["There is not a single, centralized source of EHS research funds that is allocated to individual agencies.

PCAST agreed with this assertion in its 2008 assessment, arguing that", "In many instances, nanotechnology EHS research cannot be separated from the particular application(s) research and from the context for which a specific nanomaterial is intended. Such division is unproductive and neglects the whole benefit of research. Consequently, [PCAST] expects that a substantial fraction of nanotechnology research related to EHS will continue to take place under the auspices of agencies that fund applications R&D and may not be uniquely or exclusively identified as nanotechnology EHS research.... Furthermore, detailed reporting on the degree of relevance to EHS of such research is not necessarily critical to (and may actual hinder) overall prioritization and coordination.", "This undercounting was evidenced in part by a one-time OMB request in 2007 to all NNI research agencies to report FY2006 funding data on research related to the five categories identified in the NSET document, Prioritization of Environmental, Health, and Safety Research Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials . Totals for EHS implications research spending identified in each of the five categories is shown below in Table 2 . Preliminary analysis of this data by the NEHI working group indicated that NNI agencies spent nearly twice as much on EHS research in FY2006 than was previously reported ($67 million identified by the OMB data-call versus $37.7 million in the President's budget.", "Critics (as detailed in the following section) assert that the current level of federal nanotechnology EHS research is too low and represents too small a share of the overall NNI budget. These critics argue that the current allocation of NNI funding may produce a flood of products for which there is inadequate information to assess and manage their EHS risks.", "However, executive branch officials stress that the United States leads the world in EHS funding and, by inference, that the current funding level is adequate. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) director John Marburger asserted that the United States", "leads the world not only in spending for nanotechnology development, but also, by an even larger margin, in its investment in research to understand the potential health and safety issues.", "Similarly, NNCO director E. Clayton Teague asserted U.S. leadership in nanotechnology EHS research:", "During fiscal years 2005 through 2008, it is estimated that NNI agencies will have invested nearly $180 million in research whose primary purpose is to address the EHS implications of nanomaterials. With these investments, the United States leads all other countries by a wide margin in support of such research.", "In early reviews of the NNI, both the NRC and PCAST concluded that federal EHS research funding should be expanded. According to the NRC assessment,", "To help ensure the responsible development of nanotechnology ... research on the environmental, health, and safety effects of nanotechnology [should] be expanded.", "PCAST acknowledged potential EHS risks in its first review of the NNI but found the federal government was \"directing appropriate attention\" and \"adequate resources\" to EHS research. In its second assessment, PCAST termed the current federal investment level in EHS \"appropriate,\" but added that", "expanded EHS research, broad-based protocol development, and particularly standardization are necessary.... the funding level for EHS [should] continue to grow consistent with the needs identified in the NNI research strategy for nanotechnology EHS as well as the available capacity for quality research.", "Under President Obama, PCAST struck a different tone. In its third assessment of the NNI, PCAST acknowledged the importance of adequate funding and appropriate accounting, but emphasized that", "appropriate and targeted funding for strategic nanotechnology EHS research is more important than absolute dollar amounts. To ensure that emerging EHS issues are addressed effectively and in a way that yields useful information for regulators and policymakers, the NNI needs to help the scientific community establish a substantial core of exploratory research into biological and environmental interactions with nanomaterials. In addition, the Federal Government needs to ensure sufficient funds are available to mission-driven agencies to address specific issues that are arising.", "In this regard, PCAST credits the NNI's \"substantial funding increases for nanotechnology EHS research\" for agencies such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), noting that:", "Significantly, this will be the first time that FDA and CPSC will have had a specific allocation of funds to cover nanotechnology, a welcome move and one that the NNAP hopes is sustained over a number of years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Approaches", "paragraphs": ["Various alternatives have been suggested for addressing the perceived shortcoming in EHS funding. One recommendation is requiring a fixed percentage of the NNI's total funding be devoted to EHS research.

If this proposal had been in effect in FY2010, the NNI would have been required to spend $178.1 million on EHS research, nearly twice as much as the NSET-reported level of $91.6 million. In testimony before the House Committee on Science and Technology, Sean Murdock, executive director of the NanoBusiness Alliance, agreed with the level of funding represented by the 10% figure but argued the need for cross-agency flexibility in achieving it:", "The NanoBusiness Alliance believes that environmental, health, and safety research should be fully funded and based on a clear, carefully-constructed research strategy. While we believe that 10 percent of the total funding for nanotechnology research and development is a reasonable estimate of the resources that will be required to execute the strategic plan, we also believe that actual resource levels should be driven by the strategic plan as they will vary significantly across agencies.", "Others have suggested a different approach, proposing fixed dollar amounts or minimum levels. For example, the Environmental Defense Fund has called for $100 million or more in federal nanotechnology EHS research funding.", "In its 2008 assessment, PCAST disagreed with both approaches:", "growing research in nanotechnology EHS must be strategic, guided by ... a comprehensive set of scientifically determined priorities and needs rather than arbitrary percentages or funding figures.", "By establishing a 10 percent requirement (or setting a specific dollar figure), the United States could accelerate the growth in EHS research spending. However, in testimony before Congress in 2007, then-PCAST co-chair Floyd Kvamme warned against a rapid increase:", "In general, increasing funding too rapidly does not lead to equivalent increases in high quality research. It is crucial to note that EHS research also depends on advances in non-EHS areas, such as instrumentation development and basic research on nanomaterials.", "Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have advocated for a more restrained approach to nanotechnology research and development. They assert that the federal government is pushing ahead too quickly in developing nanotechnology and encouraging its commercialization and use without sufficient knowledge and understanding of EHS implications and how they might be mitigated. They argue that the very characteristics that make nanotechnology promising also present significant potential risks to human health and safety and the environment. Some of these groups argue for application of the \"precautionary principle,\" which holds that regulatory action may be required to control potentially hazardous substances even before a causal link has been established by scientific evidence. In 2006, Friends of the Earth warned that", "The early warning signs surrounding nanotoxicity are serious and warrant a precautionary approach to the commercialization of all products containing nanomaterials ... there should be a moratorium on the further commercial release of sunscreens, cosmetics and personal care products that contain engineered nanomaterials, and the withdrawal of such products currently on the market, until adequate public, peer-reviewed safety studies have been completed, and adequate regulations have been put in place....

Some argue that it is unlikely that OMB would commit to a multi-year, multi-agency roadmap accompanied by specific funding levels. Such an approach would depart from the current executive branch annual budget development process and reduce OMB's flexibility in future years. In addition, agencies often have to respond to new requirements based on emergent circumstances, Congressional direction, or other factors. Agency funding is often redirected from planned efforts to new, often imminent, priorities. The need for such redirection of funding could impede the achievement of roadmap milestones and metrics or, conversely, impede the movement of funding to new priorities.", "To overcome the obstacles associated with the development of a roadmap by the agencies, some have suggested the National Academies produce such a roadmap. Some experts assert that this approach worked well with respect to the development of a federal research roadmap to reduce EHS uncertainties associated with airborne particulate matter. Others argue that the particulate matter effort focused only a narrow field and covered research conducted by only a single agency (EPA); in contrast, nanotechnology spans a broad range of materials and applications across many fields, and requires EHS research efforts by several agencies.", "In February 2007, 19 environmental and business organizations, large and small companies, and research organizations signed a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies requesting $1 million be appropriated for the development of a federal roadmap and research strategy.

Speed-to-market has become a driving factor in competition for many industries as a result of the entry of new and nimble competitors in the global marketplace, increased public and private investments in R&D, global models of innovation, increased flows of scientific and technical knowledge, and greater numbers of scientists and engineers around the world. In addition, growing global markets enable companies to recoup their investments faster and enable earlier investments in subsequent generations of technology, further accelerating the pace of innovation. The increased pace, scope, and complexity of technological innovation may pose challenges to the existing regulatory system. While these factors may affect a broad range of technologies, nanotechnology may be especially affected due to the rapid growth in public and private R&D investments in the field since the year 2000 and the potential for nanomaterials to be used in a wide array of products.", "Nanotechnology also may pose unique challenges to the regulatory system. For example, historically, regulatory agencies have defined a chemical by its chemical composition, usually without regard to its particle size. In contrast, the essence of nanotechnology is that a material may exhibit different properties at the nanoscale than it does at a bulk, molecular, or atomic scale. (See text box, \"Unique Properties Emerge at the Nanoscale.\") Accordingly, questions are being raised by representatives of the scientific, advocacy, and regulatory communities about how an EHS research portfolio might be structured when particle size may affect a material's properties, whether it may be necessary to incorporate particle size into regulatory regimes, and how this might be accomplished given the vast spectrum of particle sizes that might affect the characteristics of a particular material.", "Some experts argue that EHS concerns about nanotechnology products can be handled under existing laws and regulations, while others see legal obstacles to adequate EHS regulation. In both of its assessments of the NNI, PCAST concluded that existing regulatory authorities were adequate for the current activities; that appropriate regulatory mechanisms should be used to address instances of harmful human or environmental effects of nanotechnology; and that new regulatory policies related to nanotechnology should be rational, science-based, and consistent across the federal government. Similarly, Sean Murdock, then-executive director of the NanoBusiness Alliance, asserted that", "The apparatus for effective nanotechnology regulation is largely in place through various statutes and agencies, but it lacks data and resources. To enable these agencies and for the nanotech regulation effort to succeed we must increase the level of funding available to them for nanotech environmental, health and safety research; coordinate efforts between agencies; establish metrics and standards that can be used to characterize nanomaterials; conduct ongoing research; and more.", "Others believe that new laws and regulations, or modifications to existing ones, may be required. J.

There are a number of existing laws\u2014notably the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; and the major environmental laws (Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act)\u2014that provide some legal basis for reviewing and regulating [nanotechnology] materials. However, all of these laws either suffer from major shortcomings of legal authority, or from a gross lack of resources, or both. They provide a very weak basis for identifying and protecting the public from potential risk, especially as nanotechnologies become more complex in structure and function and the applications become more diverse.", "A new law may be required to manage potential risks of nanotechnology. The law would require manufacturers to submit a sustainability plan which would show that the product will not present an unacceptable risk.", "In a 2008 PEN report, Oversight of Next Generation Nanotechnology , Davies asserted that nanotechnology, along with other advanced technologies, have characteristics that challenge conventional methods of risk assessment, standard setting, and oversight implementation, severely hampering the effectiveness of the existing regulatory structure.", "Since 1980, the capability of the federal agencies responsible for environmental health and safety has steadily eroded. The agencies cannot perform their basic functions now, and they are completely unable to cope with the new challenges they face in the 21 st century.", "As an alternative, Davies put forward a concept for a Department of Environmental and Consumer Protection, \"a scientific agency with a strong oversight component, in contrast to the current regulatory agencies, which are primarily oversight bodies.\" The agency would incorporate six existing regulatory and science agencies and establish new units for risk assessment, forecasting, technology assessment, health monitoring, and collection of environmental statistics.", "Davies also stated that new mechanisms and institutional capabilities\u2014including research programs, tax breaks, acquisition programs, and regulatory incentives\u2014are needed to encourage beneficial applications of nanotechnology. ", "In developing the regulatory structure, some in the business and financial communities argue that stability and predictability are key characteristics for attracting investment and spurring commercial applications. According to Matthew Nordan, then-vice president of Lux Research, the", "ambiguity surrounding environmental, health, and safety regulation of nanoparticles is hampering commercialization. Firms do not want to play a game whose rules may change at any time.... That doesn't mean they want more regulations or more onerous regulations. They're just looking for a roadmap on how federal agencies such as the EPA or OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] plan to approach nanoparticles.", "Some tension exists between the goals of promoting the development of nanotechnology, ensuring the global competitive position of the United States, addressing potential EHS implications of nanotechnology, and coping with the unique challenges nanotechnology poses to the current regulatory regime. To prevent health and safety concerns from becoming an impediment to innovation, some suggest that health and safety research and regulation must be done near-concurrently with product development, keeping pace with the speed of innovation. Alternatively, others argue that the potential health, safety, and environmental implications are either unknown or of such significance that EHS research and regulation must precede nanotechnology development and commercialization. \"By the time monitoring catches up to commerce the damage will already have been done,\" asserted Ian Illuminato, health and environment campaigner for Friends of the Earth.

This perspective is shared by many industry advocates who argue that regulatory decisions must balance the potential risks associated with a nanotechnology product against the benefits it delivers and the risk it displaces. Further, they maintain that nanotechnology products should not be held to a higher standard than non-nanotechnology products.

For example, transparency and/or harmonization of standards and regulations may contribute to assurance of global supply chains and market confidence in nanotechnology products. Increased globalization of production and markets means that companies and consumers around the world are increasingly part of a common network. Manufacturers of final products generally rely on inputs from multiple suppliers in their global supply chains. The reliability of a final product often depends on the reliability of inputs, such as materials or components. Transparent and common standards and regulations may help to ensure the integrity of supply chains and final products. While this is an issue for a variety of non-nanotechnology products (e.g., the recent discovery of lead-tainted toys and other products imported from China), nanotechnology may present a unique challenge in that at least some nanoscale particles can be incorporated into materials and products in ways that cannot be easily detected or detected at all. Thus, producers and the consumers they serve must rely, in large measure, on standards and regulatory systems to ensure that nanoscale materials are properly produced and represented throughout the supply chain. In the absence of such standards and regulatory systems, producers may not be able to rely on inputs or may incur additional costs for testing and verification; substandard inputs may be incorporated in final products making them underperform or unsafe, and possibly resulting in loss of market confidence and/or potential litigation; or nanotechnology materials may be incorporated without disclosure.", "Internationally agreed upon standards could also contribute to greater comparability of research results, improving understanding of EHS-related aspects of nanotechnology, and promoting regulations that help protect human health and the environment. Common standards and nomenclature also may contribute to more effective global R&D collaboration, accelerating the realization of nanotechnology's economic and societal potential.", "Global engagement may help to establish a common environment for the development and production of nanotechnology products and to promote access to global markets. In the absence of such an environment, some nations may seek to attract investments in their markets by adopting lower environmental, health, and safety standards and regulations.", "Finally, while much remains unknown about the transport and fate of nanoscale materials released into the environment, it is possible that countries and populations other than those where research and production activities take place may be affected.

For example, while some advocates assert the need for swift action in advancing EHS research, international engagements often entail slow processes. Also, given the strong U.S. position in nanotechnology, broadly, and in nanotechnology EHS research, specifically, some may argue that other countries have little to contribute, that such efforts tax limited federal EHS financial and human resources, and that such diffusion of resources may slow overall EHS progress.

", "Important issues have been raised about the application of EPA's authorities to regulate nanotechnology. Several issues revolve around TSCA, which authorizes regulation of chemical commerce. Under the provisions of TSCA, producers of a \"new\" material must provide EPA with a premanufacture notification (PMN). EPA then has 90 days to approve manufacture, to require information from manufacturers, or to restrict chemical use. Other TSCA provisions permit EPA regulation of existing chemicals already in commerce, but these rely on EPA fact-finding and rulemaking before EPA can require testing or restrict uses. Several NGOs have urged EPA to consider all nanoscale materials \"new\" regardless of whether the material is on the EPA inventory list in its bulk form. However, some nanotechnology materials have the same chemical composition as materials that are already in commerce, raising the question of whether the nanotechnology materials are \"new\" and thus subject to PMN requirements.", "When nanomaterials are intended to control pests, including microbes, FIFRA may offer EPA more authority to regulate nanotechnology than TSCA, according to Lynn Bergeson, chair of the American Bar Association's Section on Environment, Energy, and Resources:", "Under TSCA, once a substance is on the approved inventory list, any use is legitimate, but FIFRA is use-specific. The EPA always has the authority to assess the risk of pesticides, regardless of the use.", "Applicability of FIFRA to nanotechnology products was one aspect of a November 2006 EPA ruling that a device that \"incorporates a substance intended to prevent, destroy or mitigate pests\" is considered a pesticide and is required to be registered under FIFRA. While the ruling is not unique to nanomaterials, it came in the context of advertising claims for a washing machine containing nanoscale silver ions that kill microbes. EPA's ruling made this appliance the first nanotechnology product to be regulated under FIFRA. However, claims for the pesticidal effectiveness of the washing machine have been removed from advertisements, possibly limiting EPA's ability to regulate the device as a pesticide under FIFRA.", "In a May 2010 review of EPA's role in regulating nanotechnology, the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that EPA was missing opportunities to collect additional information under TSCA, FIFRA, the Clean Water Act and other environmental statutes.", "Food and Drug Administration", "A variety of current and future products that incorporate nanotechnology fall, or may fall, under the regulatory auspices of the FDA, including cosmetics, medical devices, foods, drugs, biological products, and combination products. FDA anticipates that many of the nanotechnology products that the agency is likely to regulate will be combination products, such as drug-device, drug-biological, or device-biological products. According to FDA, it regulates products based on their statutory classification rather than the technology they employ, thus the agency may not provide regulatory consideration to a nanotechnology product until well after its initial development. Also, some critics maintain that FDA's limited regulatory authority over certain categories of products may limit its authority to regulate nanotechnology products.", "With respect to the need for unique tests or requirements for regulating nanotechnology products, FDA states that its existing requirements may be adequate for most nanotechnology products it expects to regulate. FDA asserts that nanotechnology products are in the same size-range as the cells and molecules its reviewers and scientists deal with every day. The agency says that every degradable medical device and injectable pharmaceutical generates particulates that pass through the nanoscale size range during the processes of their absorption and elimination by the body. FDA says that it has no knowledge of reports of adverse reactions related to the \"nano\" size of resorbable drug or medical device products. New tests or other requirements may be needed, according to FDA, if new risks are identified arising from new materials or manufacturing techniques. Others, in particular consumer groups, counter that FDA's resources are insufficient to adequately address the safety of emerging technologies in general, and that the agency's regulatory approach, particularly for cosmetics, dietary supplements, and other products for which pre-market review is not required, would not detect any problems until such products had been in use. ", "FDA does not provide grants for nanotechnology research but does conduct research in several of its centers to understand the characteristics of nanomaterials and nanotechnology processes. FDA is collaborating with NIEHS on studies, as part of the interagency National Toxicology Program.", "FDA says that there currently is no international regulation of nanoproducts or the underlying nanotechnology. FDA participates in multinational organizations where cooperative work on nanotechnology has been proposed, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ASTM International, and the International Organization for Standardization. ", "National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/National Toxicology Program", "While not a regulatory agency, NIEHS, a part of the National Institutes of Health, is conducting nanotechnology EHS research that will support the missions of regulatory agencies. In particular, NIEHS serves as home to the interagency National Toxicology Program (NTP). The NTP's mission is to coordinate toxicological testing programs, develop and validate improved testing methods, develop approaches and generate data to strengthen scientific knowledge about potentially hazardous substances, and communicate with stakeholders. In 2006, the NTP established the Nanotechnology Safety Initiative (NSI), a broad-based research program to address potential human health hazards associated with the manufacture and use of nanoscale materials. The goal of this research program is to evaluate the toxicological properties of major nanoscale materials that represent a cross-section of composition, size, surface coatings, and physical and chemical properties, and to use these as model systems to investigate fundamental questions concerning whether nanoscale materials can interact with biological systems and how they might do so.", "According to NTP, the NSI is focused on three areas of research with respect to specific types or groups of nanoscale materials:", "non-medical, commercially relevant and available nanoscale materials to which humans are intentionally being exposed, such as cosmetics and sunscreens; nanoscale materials representing specific classes (e.g., fullerenes and metal oxides) so that information can be extrapolated to other members of those classes; and subsets of nanomaterials to test specific hypotheses about a key characteristic (such as size, composition, shape, or surface chemistry) that might be related to biological activity.", "NSI research activities are focused on metal oxides, fluorescent crystalline semiconductors (also known as quantum dots), fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nanoscale silver, and nanoscale gold.", "Occupational Safety and Health Administration/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health", "The mission of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency of the Department of Labor, is to ensure the safety and health of America's workers by setting and enforcing standards; providing training, outreach, and education; establishing partnerships; and encouraging continual improvement in workplace safety and health. OSHA has not yet taken any regulatory actions with respect to nanotechnology.", "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a part of the Centers for Disease Control, is the lead federal agency conducting research and providing guidance on the occupational safety and health implications and applications of nanotechnology. NIOSH co-chairs the NSET's NEHI working group together with EPA. NIOSH is not a regulatory agency, but its work directly supports OSHA and other regulatory agencies. NIOSH and OSHA are considering new risk management approaches that seek to maximize flexibility for innovation while ensuring the health and safety of workers.", "NIOSH states that its nanotechnology efforts are building on its experience in defining the characteristics, properties, and effects of ultrafine particles\u2014such as welding fumes and diesel particulates\u2014as well as its experience in conducting advanced health effects laboratory studies and in fostering industrial hygiene policies and practices. ", "NIOSH has developed interim guidelines for working with nanomaterials. The agency asserts that these guidelines are consistent with the best scientific knowledge of nanoparticle toxicity and control. NIOSH also maintains a Nanoparticle Information Library with information on the health and associated properties of nanomaterials as an online resource for occupational health professionals, industrial users, worker groups, and researchers.", "Consumer Product Safety Commission", "The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of serious injury or death from certain types of consumer products. CPSC has asserted that potential safety and health risks of nanomaterials can be assessed under existing CPSC statutes, regulations and guidelines. Since the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.) and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.) do not require pre-market registration or approval of products, CPSC does not evaluate a product's risk to the public until it has been distributed in commerce.", "In August 2005, CPSC commissioners approved a nanotechnology statement which notes that nanotechnology presents challenges that \"may require unique exposure and risk assessment strategies.\" The CPSC statement identified regulatory challenges, including identification of the specific nanomaterial in a product; the need to characterize the materials to which a consumer is exposed during product use, including an assessment of the size distribution of the materials released; and the application of toxicological data of appropriate particle sizes to assess health risks. The CPSC takes the position that it is unable to make any general statements about potential consumer exposure to nanomaterials or the health effects that may result from exposure to nanomaterials during consumer use and disposal due to the wide variation in potential health effects and the dearth of exposure and toxicity data for specific nanomaterials."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
