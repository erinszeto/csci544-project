Having a greater understanding of the nonprofit and charitable sector as a whole may help policymakers evaluate proposals that may impact the sector.", "The first section of this report provides a formal definition of the nonprofit and charitable sector. The term \"nonprofit sector\" is generally intended to refer to organizations with federal tax-exempt status; \"charitable sector\" refers to the subset of these organizations that have 501(c)(3) public charity status.", "The next section reports on the size and scope of the charitable sector. Charitable organizations are estimated to employ more than 7% of the U.S. workforce, while the broader nonprofit sector is estimated to employ 10% of the U.S. workforce. In 2009, the charities filing Form 990 with the Internal Revenue Service reported approximately $1.4 trillion in revenue and reported holding nearly $2.6 trillion in assets. Nonprofit institutions serving households (largely charities) constituted more than 5% of GDP in 2008.", "The third section of this report examines how charities are funded. Revenue comes from a variety of sources, including private contributions, payments (fees for service), government grants, and investment income. Revenue sources vary significantly across different types of charities: charities involved in health care (including nonprofit hospitals) and educational institutions rely heavily on private payments while arts, culture, and humanities charities and environment and animals charities are more reliant on private contributions. Private contributions to charities are of particular interest as charitable giving may respond to changes in the tax code. As the recent economic downturn has increased the demand for goods and services provided by a number of charities, the impact of the business cycle on funding is also discussed.", "The fourth section provides an overview of the charitable sector's relationship with government. From a theoretical perspective, economics suggests that the government should subsidize activities that are either public goods or have positive external effects. It can be argued that some charitable activities possess these qualities. The costs to the government of providing grants, allowing charitable contributions to be tax deductible, exempting investment income of charities from tax, and providing property and sales tax exemptions are presented. The oversight role of the government is also reviewed.", "Finally, the report concludes with policy considerations. This section opens by surveying what policy options are considered most important by charitable organizations themselves. Building on this, a number of policy options are examined, including (1) increasing government grants and subsidies to charitable organizations; (2) creating an oversight agency within the federal government to gather data, conduct research, and advocate for the charitable sector; (3) implementing policies designed to help charities and foundations in economic downturns; (4) changing the itemized deduction for charitable contributions by limiting, converting to a credit, or making the deduction more widely available; and (5) a variety of other tax issues."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["As this report illustrates, the nonprofit and charitable sector represents a significant, highly diverse component of the U.S. economy. Currently, there are a number of policy issues that could affect, either directly or indirectly, the structure and functioning of nonprofit and charitable organizations. President Barack Obama has turned toward the nonprofit sector while seeking solutions to social problems via the Social Innovation Fund. The recent economic downturn increased the demand for many of the goods and services provided by charitable organizations, while simultaneously placing the same organizations under increased financial constraints. The treatment of nonprofits in health care reform has also been a major issue, as the tax code cannot provide the same incentives to nonprofits (nonprofit health care providers and nonprofit employers providing insurance) that are available to for-profit organizations. Finally, the tax treatment of nonprofits and their contributors raises issues of efficiency, equity, and fairness.", "To assist policymakers in evaluating reforms that will potentially affect nonprofit and charitable organizations, this report provides a broad overview of the charitable sector.

While the term nonprofit tends to be used loosely in the literature, nonprofit here is used to identify the broad array of organizations with federal tax-exempt status. Charitable organizations are defined as organizations with 501(c)(3) public charity status, and are a subcategory of the broader nonprofit sector.

The charitable sector's role in the broader economy is evaluated by comparing the charitable sector to other major industrial sectors. ", "Third, the finances of charitable organizations are explored. Specifically, various revenue sources, both government and nongovernment, are examined. The amount of revenue coming from private contributions, government grants and transfers, private payments, and investment income is identified. The differences in revenue sources across charitable sectors are also analyzed. Finally, the impact of the economic downturn on revenue for charitable organizations is briefly addressed.

To evaluate the relationship between the charitable sector and the federal government, the economic rationale for subsidizing charities is presented. After presenting the theoretical underpinnings for interaction between charities and government, direct evidence on the cost of the relationship as it presently exists is discussed.

The first is employment in the nonprofit sector. In 2005, the estimated total employment in the nonprofit sector was 12.9 million. The second is employment in the charitable sector. The estimated number of paid workers employed by charities in 2004 was 9.4 million. At the end of 2004, there were 132.5 million employees nationwide.

More than half of nonprofit employment (approximately 54%) is involved in health care and social assistance. In 1998, nearly 23% of nonprofit employees were involved in other services.

Specifically, education charities hold nearly 33% of assets held by charitable institutions, while only 18% of charitable organizations filing Form 990 are in the education sector.

", "While the Bureau of Economic Analysis's data provide the best representation of the nonprofit sector's share in the economy, some care should be taken in interpretation. First, the NPISH classification represents a subset of all nonprofits, and therefore represents a share of economic activity smaller than that of the entire nonprofit sector. The NPISH classification also is not synonymous with what is typically thought of as the charitable sector 501(c)(3) organizations. Social welfare organizations and labor unions, for example, may be included in the BEA's NPISH category but are not 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. On the other hand, some 501(c)(3) organizations may not fall within the NPISH classification, such as those that sell goods or services in a manner similar to businesses. Overall, it is likely that the NPSIH's share in GDP is greater than that of the charitable sector, but less than that of the nonprofit sector. ", "Other cautions include the fact that there are difficulties in placing a value on much of the output of charitable organizations. Since pricing the value of charitable output is difficult, the BEA estimates the value of output by using the cost of the inputs. Determining the cost of inputs, however, presents its own set of problems. Employee wages are the largest component of charitable organizations' costs. As was noted above, the data on the number of employees in the charitable sector are not precise. A final issue is the fact that the BEA's method for measuring the nonprofit sector's output only includes measurable costs of inputs. However, many nonprofit and charitable organizations are supported via volunteer efforts. Since these efforts do not represent a cost they are not included in the measure of output.

When looking at employment figures, the charitable sector appears to be larger than the construction, manufacturing, finance and insurance, real estate and rental and leasing, and educational services sectors. However, only the construction and educational services sectors had contributions to GDP below the contributions of NPISHs in 2008.

While establishment data do not provide information regarding the overall size of nonprofit firms to for-profit firms, the establishment data do allow for a couple of observations. First, relatively speaking, there are fewer very large establishments in the nonprofit sector. Only 6% of nonprofit establishments have more than 1,000 employees on site, while 14.6% of all establishments (for-profit and nonprofit) have more than 1,000 employees on site.

In 2008, giving as a percentage of GDP by individuals was 1.61%, down from its peak of 1.78% in 2005. Throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s giving by foundations never exceeded 0.15% of GDP.

Corporate giving relative to GDP was lower (0.07% - 0.08%) in the 1970s and higher (0.12% - 0.13%) in 2005 and 2006. Bequests relative to GDP were 0.16% in 2008, lower than they were in the early 2000s (when the ratio was 0.20%).

Figure 5 illustrates that the largest source of funding for arts, culture, and humanities as well as for environment and animals charities is private donations. Both of these types of charitable organizations received more than 40% of their revenue from private donations in 2005.", " Figure 8 plots giving to different types of charitable organizations in 2008, 2007, and 1998. When looking at data from the giving perspective, it is clear that religious organizations are the recipients of the largest share of gifts. Further, religious organizations were one of the few categories to experience an increase in giving between 2007 and 2008. Overall, giving fell by 5.7% between 2007 and 2008, with the largest declines in gifts to grantmaking foundations (-22%); human services (-16%); and arts, culture, and humanities (-9%).

The sectors that experienced the largest increases in giving over the course of the decade were international affairs (98%), environment and animals (42%), and education (30%). Giving to religion grew over the course of the decade, but the rate of growth was relatively low (19%). Giving to arts, culture, and humanities decreased by 2% between 1998 and 2008. This is particularly noteworthy since the arts, culture, and humanities charitable sector receives the largest share of revenue from private contributions. ", "There are a number of issues which may affect giving by individuals. These include whether or not individuals can deduct contributions, fluctuations in personal income, and broader economic conditions. Individuals who itemize deductions have a greater incentive to give, as the price of giving is reduced by the marginal tax rate. In 2005, those itemizing gave on average 3.54% of their adjusted gross income. Non itemizers gave on average 1.34% of their adjusted gross income. It is important to note, however, that those choosing to itemize deductions tend to have higher incomes and thus perhaps a greater ability to give. Individual charitable deductions are subject to various restrictions, which include being generally limited to 50% of modified adjusted gross income.", "Individual giving to charity is also responsive to income. Table 10 shows how giving and the amounts given vary across three different income groups. In 2004, 56.3% of households with less than $50,000 in income gave to charity, 81.4% of households with income between $50,000 and $99,999 gave to charity, and 93.3% of households with income greater than $100,000 gave to charity. In 2004, the average household gave just over $2,000. This figure appears to be driven by a few households making relatively large gifts as the median charitable gift was $775. The average giving for households making $100,000 or more per year was more than three times the average giving of households making less than $50,000. The median gift by households making more than $100,000 was more than four times as much as the median level of giving by households making less than $50,000 per year.", "Economists have also made attempts to measure the elasticity of charitable giving with respect to income, which is the percentage change in giving relative to the percentage change in income. Empirical work that has attempted to estimate the elasticity of charitable giving with respect to income has produced a wide range of results. While many studies have found an income elasticity of less than one, the fact that individual contributions relative to GDP have remained relatively constant over time (see Figure 7 ) suggests that income elasticity is more likely unit elastic. If the income elasticity were in fact less than one, as income increased over time one would expect charitable giving relative to income to decline.", "Charitable bequests are given by estates upon an individuals' death. It is estimated that about 120,000 estates leave bequests each year. Most bequests come from small to mid-sized estates, where the estate is small enough in size that filing of estate tax returns is unnecessary. Only about 8,000 estates filed estate tax returns in 2008. These 8,000 estates were responsible for about 85% of all giving via bequests, illustrating that giving via bequests is highly concentrated amongst the most wealthy decedents. Concern is often expressed that a reduction in or elimination of the estate tax would lead to reduced giving to the charitable sector. Recent work has found that bequests are responsive to changes in estate taxes as well as overall wealth. ", "Corporate giving can be made in one of two ways. The first way is as a direct gift from the corporation. The second way is via a corporate foundation. A typical corporation is estimated to give about 1% of its domestic pre-tax income to charitable organizations, or about 0.08% of corporate sales. Corporations' charitable deductions are generally limited to 10% of taxable income, among other restrictions.", "The final source of private contributions or charitable gifts comes from foundations. As noted above, in relative terms, giving by foundations has increased more than giving by individuals, bequests, and corporations over the past decade. In 2008, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave $2.8 billion in grants (giving by all foundations was $41.2 billion in 2008). Giving by the Gates Foundation increased by $0.8 billion between 2007 and 2008, contributing to the overall stability of foundation giving between 2007 and 2008 as grantmaking by other foundations fell.

The BEA data does not separate these transfers by type of charitable organization.", "The data presented here do not separate state and local government funding from federal government funding. Government funding to charitable organizations may come directly from the federal government, from state and local governments that have received the funding from the federal government (rather than raised the revenue themselves), or directly from state and local governments. One study finds that, for 2001, only 12% of grants and fees originate with state and local governments; 37% are financed by the federal government but flow through to nonprofits via state and local programs, and the remaining 51% are provided directly by the federal government. If Medicare and Medicaid, the main fee-related items, are excluded, the states continue to supply only a small share (9% of their own funds) but administer a much larger share of federal funds (61%).

Economists have also postulated that the warm glow model can be useful in explaining why individuals give to charity. In the warm glow model, individuals not only care about the total amount of the public good provided, but also about their individual contribution to the total. Individuals are expected to contribute to a charitable cause up to the point where their contributions cease to make them better-off.

The contribution of appreciated assets has particularly beneficial treatment, as the value of most appreciated assets can be deducted without including the capital gains in income which would be subject to tax. (Some contributions of property are limited to the smaller of basis or fair market value, such as business inventory.) For that reason, gifts of appreciated property are limited to 30% of a donor's adjusted gross income for most general charitable donations, and to 20% for donations to organizations with more restricted giving limits, such as non-operating private foundations. Deductions for inventory property used in a business are generally limited to the cost of production and not market value.", "Individuals can also deduct costs of volunteering for charitable purposes, including out-of-pocket expenditures, costs of using a vehicle, and travel costs when there is no significant personal element. In lieu of calculating costs of operating an automobile, volunteers may deduct 14 cents per mile.

These latter rates are adjusted for changes in costs.", "Like individuals, corporations are subject to restrictions on their ability to deduct charitable contributions. For example, corporate contributions are generally limited to 10% of taxable income. In some cases, the tax code encourages the donations of certain types of property: for example, there is an enhanced deduction for donations of food inventory to organizations serving the needy.", "There are a number of temporary provisions, referred to as extenders, that allow more generous tax treatment for certain contributions. The most important, in revenue terms, is the IRA rollover provision allowing individuals who are 70\u00bd to contribute amounts in individual retirement plans directly to charity without including the distribution in income. This provision is advantageous to those who do not itemize deductions and benefits taxpayers because certain provisions (such as the taxation of social security benefits) are triggered by adjusted gross income. Other major extenders relate largely to gifts of inventory.", "A number of difficulties arise in administering the charitable deduction tax provision. For example, there is no third-party reporting to help confirm that deductions are legitimate.

For FY2007, total increases of university endowments were $88 billion; with 30% projected to be unrealized capital gains, income was about $53 billion, as compared to the $34 billion reported the previous year. As the economy fell into recession, however, earnings fell precipitously. These fluctuations in earnings make it difficult to determine a steady state rate of growth, but had the BEA estimate increased by a normal growth rate of 5% or so per year, endowment income would be $55 billion for 2009.

Investment income is 9% for arts, culture, and the humanities, but less than 3% for environment and animals, health, human services, and international. The lesser importance of investment income for health stems from the fact that the majority of the health revenue comes from fees for services (whether private or public). In health care, investment income is similar in size to charitable contributions while in the education sector investment income is about twice as large as charitable contributions. In other sectors, investment income represents a much smaller share of overall income than do charitable contributions.

The level of crowding out determines how much the government must spend to increase the supply of the public good. Most economists expect that crowd-out is partial. Crowd-out would be full, meaning that each additional dollar of government spending on the public good corresponds to a dollar decrease in private funding, when individuals only care about the total amount of the good provided (as opposed to caring about where the funding for providing a good comes from). When non-contributors are taxed to provide the public good, crowd-out will be partial. Crowd-out will also be partial when there is a warm glow associated with giving. ", "The empirical evidence on the existence and magnitude of crowd-out provides mixed results. A number of studies find significant, although mostly partial, crowding-out effects. Other studies find empirical evidence of crowding-in. (Crowding-in occurs when government spending leads to additional private-sector spending. Why this may occur is discussed below.) It spite of these seemingly inconsistent findings, there are some trends that appear to be emerging. The first is that the degree of crowding-out varies by charity type. While crowd-out has been found for public radio, shelter, and human services, crowd-in has been found for crime and legal-related charities; food, agriculture, and nutrition charities; and other specific human services charities. Other work has found that government grants crowd-in donations for libraries, hospitals, scientific research, and higher education. Some of this could have to do with the fact that different types of charities generally rely on different funding sources. The second is that crowding-out also depends on levels of support and where the money is coming from (what level of government). Empirical work looking at American theaters found that theaters with low levels of public support tended to experience crowding-in, while crowding-out was more common for theaters with larger levels of government support. Federal support appears to have a crowding-in effect at any level, while local support initially crowds in at low support levels but begins to crowd out at higher levels of support. Considering the possibility of crowding-out is important for policymakers looking to boost charitable activity within a given sector.", "Recent work has found that governments should not only be concerned with the fact that government spending can potentially crowd out private support for charities, but also that government grants can cause charities to reduce their fund-raising efforts. Empirical work shows that crowd-out via reduced fund-raising is partial, but at least one study has found that crowd-out of fund-raising is greater than crowd-out of private donations. There is also evidence that private contributions and fund-raising efforts both increased in the arts when the government cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. This observation may have implications for policy. Governments providing grants to charitable organizations may want to consider matching grants, where receiving organizations are required to show increased fund-raising efforts in order to receive the grant. Alternatively, government grants could be accompanied by a maintenance of fund-raising effort clause. On the flip side, when the government reduces funding to charitable organizations the loss may be mitigated by increased fund-raising efforts leading to greater levels in private funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government Funds and Private Funds as Complements", "paragraphs": ["At other times, the government and charities work together and their efforts to provide goods and services are complementary in nature. One reason for this relationship may be that in those instances, it is more efficient for the government to hire an outside organization than to provide goods and services themselves. With large bureaucratic organizations, such as the government, providing additional services may not be cost effective. Nonprofits and charitable organizations may also have better information with respect to the needs of the communities they serve, leaving these institutions equipped to meet the needs of specific communities. The government may be more inclined to partner with nonprofit as opposed to for-profit institutions since monitoring costs are lower. Since nonprofits do not face a profit incentive, the motivation may be tilted more toward providing quality services rather than minimizing costs. When the government's relationship with nonprofit and charitable organizations is complementary in nature, it is not expected that additional government spending would crowd out private support. Over the past few decades, social welfare spending by governments has increased dramatically, while the rate of charitable giving has remained relatively constant. This fact alone lends support to the argument that the government and nonprofit or charitable sectors complement one another in aggregate, rather than act as substitutes.

The main lesson is that government support can either be a complement to or substitute for private funding, depending on circumstances. Circumstances that may matter, for example, might be the initial level of funding and the source of the government spending.

It is useful for policymakers to understand how much charitable giving is induced by the tax code, and the revenue losses associated with these provisions.", "The relationship between the amount of contributions and the revenue cost of the subsidy depends on the price elasticity of giving. The price elasticity of giving is defined as the percentage change in quantity given divided by the percentage change in price (in this case, the price of charitable giving is 1- t , where t the marginal tax rate). This relationship is always expected to be negative, as an increase in the price of giving (decrease in tax rate) should be associated with decreased giving. Since the relationship is expected to be negative, elasticities here are referred to in absolute value. If this elasticity is less than one (in absolute value), the induced giving will be less than the cost of the charitable contribution deduction. When this is the case, more funds for the charitable sector could be generated by spending government funds using alternative means, such as grants (absent crowding-out). The most recent estimates of the price elasticity of charitable giving by living individuals (inter-vivos giving) suggest that the elasticity is below one. A recent CRS report uses a value of 0.5 as a central estimate. This price elasticity suggests that a dollar of revenue loss induces $0.50 of giving.

Giving from estates is affected by both the estate tax rate and the wealth of individuals. The percentage change in giving relative to the estate tax rate is the price elasticity.

Recently, the President proposed a cap on all itemized deductions to finance health-care reform, which would have automatically affected charitable deductions and resulted in some concerns being expressed. However, a CRS report indicated the effects on charities would be small. This report reviewed the evidence on price elasticities which suggests that the response of charitable contributions to tax incentives is small. It also reviewed some survey evidence and evidence on the response to matching gifts, as well as historical data, which all point to a small response as well. As noted above, more recent evidence on price elasticities suggests that charitable contribution deductions are not very efficient, in that the government spends more than a dollar to induce a dollar of contributions. Using the elasticity of 0.5, which was identified as a central estimate, a dollar of revenue loss results in 50 cents of contributions.", "The itemized deduction has also been criticized because it favors the charities preferred by high-income taxpayers, who tend to be those claiming the deduction, since only about 30% of taxpayers itemize their deductions. Some have suggested allowing all taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions on top of the standard deduction or converting the deduction to a credit available to all taxpayers. Converting the deduction to a credit could be designed to be revenue neutral which would reduce the benefit for current itemizers while extending it to non-itemizers.", "There are other policy options that could potentially address the concern that the current system tends to direct more donations towards charities preferred by those with higher incomes. For example, a floor on charitable contributions could be imposed. Specifically, only charitable contributions in excess of 2% of adjusted gross income could be deducted, and this deduction made available for all taxpayers. Revenue gains from such a policy could be used to finance deductions from non-itemizers or to provide grants. ", "Imposing a floor alone would likely raise revenue and increase the efficiency of the charitable deductions without having much of an effect on giving. According to the 2004 Statistics of Income Public Use File, 96% of contributions are made by taxpayers who contribute at least 1% of income and 88% are made by those who contribute at least 2% of income. According to the Congressional Budget Offices Options Report, a 2% floor would raise an average of $22 billion, per year, over the next 10 years. ", "There is some evidence that price elasticities are smaller for lower-income individuals, although the evidence is not definitive. Many of these individuals' contributions go to religious organizations where donors may not be very sensitive to price. In any case, extending the deduction for non-itemizers would likely cost more than it induced in additional deductions. Converting to a credit might also reduce charitable contributions. But it could increase the equity between charitable preferences of higher-income and lower-income individuals.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Channeling Benefits Through the Federal Income Tax System (Including Health Insurance Credits)", "paragraphs": ["The use of the tax system to provide incentives or benefits generally excludes nonprofits since they are generally exempt from federal income tax. This effect occurred for the stimulus proposals to provide investment incentives, and it is also in some versions of the health reform bills ( H.R. 3200 ). Specifically, the use of tax credits to assist small businesses in obtaining health insurance coverage for employees provides no assistance for tax-exempt organizations. Nonetheless, it is possible to provide a separate credit (or grant) for nonprofits. The current Senate Finance Committee proposal provides a credit for small nonprofits to provide health insurance for low-income employees as it did for profitable firms, although the credit rate is 35% rather than 50%. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions proposal did not use the tax system as the mechanism for health insurance subsidy.", "As noted above in the discussion of economic downturns, other tax subsidies, even deductions, could be converted into equivalent credits and provided to nonprofits. Job tax credits, which have recently been proposed by some, would not automatically be available if credited against the income tax, but would be if credited against payroll taxes. For provisions that are not related to the tax structure but rather use the tax system as a convenient delivery mechanism, there might not be a reason to deny benefits to nonprofits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restrictions on Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs), Supporting Organizations, and Endowments", "paragraphs": ["The two basic issues associated with donor-advised funds and supporting organizations are the possibility of receiving private benefits by donors and payout rates. While some changes were enacted, others remain possible. Although payout requirements are planned for certain type III supporting organizations, there are no payout requirements for donor-advised funds and for other supporting organizations. These issues might be revisited when Treasury completes its studies.", "The Treasury was directed to study specific issues: whether deductions for contributions to donor-advised funds and supporting organizations are appropriate given the use of the assets or benefits to the donor, whether donor-advised funds should have a distribution requirement, whether the retention of rights by donors means that the gift is not completed, and whether these issues apply to other charities or charitable donors. Thus, it is possible that results of the studies could also have implications for charities in general.", "As noted earlier, concerns have also been raised about college endowments, and the Senate Finance Committee received testimony on college endowments in connection with hearings held on offshore funds in 2007.

A more restrictive proposal for charitable gifts would be to allow only the basis (generally the cost of the property) rather than the fair market value to be deducted. The CBO estimates the revenue gain from that change to raise an average of $2 billion per year over the next 10 years. An alternative could be to require taxpayers to sell the asset and donate the proceeds to charity. This would likely result in a revenue loss to the government but might address valuation problems. Taxpayers could avoid payment of the capital gains tax if donations were made in a timely fashion. Other approaches for valuation have included proposals for \"baseball arbitration\" where the court may only choose either the IRS or the taxpayer's valuation, which would provide an incentive to the taxpayer to state a value closer to market value."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonprofit Hospitals", "paragraphs": ["Some in Congress have also been interested in nonprofit hospitals. A major concern raised by some is the degree of charity care provided by these hospitals and whether they are providing benefits that justify their tax-exempt charitable status.

The Senate Finance Committee held hearings on the topic, \"Taking the Pulse of Charitable Care and Community Benefits at Nonprofit Hospitals,\" on September 13, 2006, and the House Ways and Means Committee held hearings on \"The Tax Exempt Hospital Sector,\" on May 26, 2005.", "The following concerns have been raised about nonprofit hospitals: establishing and publicizing charity care, the amount of charity care and community benefits provided, conversion of nonprofit assets for use by for-profits, ensuring an exempt purpose for joint ventures with for-profits, governance, and billing and collection practices. In July 2007, the IRS released an interim report on nonprofit hospitals, where they found that the median share of revenue spent on charity care was 3.9% and almost half of hospitals spent 3% or less. The average was 7.4%.", "Another concern that has been expressed is that, since a 1969 revenue ruling issued by the Internal Revenue Service, nonprofit hospitals are no longer required to provide charity care to qualify for exempt status as a charitable organization; rather they must meet a \"community benefit\" standard that does not require charity care and is not precisely defined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extenders", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, there are several charitable provisions that are temporary, with the major one being the IRA rollover deductions.

President Obama has proposed to maintain the estate tax permanently at current rates and exemptions. The empirical evidence suggests that the response of bequests to tax incentives is larger than that of lifetime giving and that charitable contributions could fall. If so, the charitable deduction for estate taxes is an efficient method of providing benefits, but, of course depends on the retention of the estate tax and the magnitude depends on its features."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.", "paragraphs": [" Table A-1 contains data on the sources of revenue across various sectors of charitable organizations.
