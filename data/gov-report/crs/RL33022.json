In general, persons eligible for IHS services must be in IHS service areas and belong to federally recognized tribes.", "The IHS-served population generally has a higher incidence of illness and premature mortality than the U.S. population as a whole. Several IHS publications compare the health conditions and causes of death of the IHS service population with those for the entire U.S. population. According to the latest of these, the average life expectancy at birth for the IHS service area population in 1999-2001 was 74.5 years, or 2.4 years less than the 76.9 years for the total U.S. population.", "IHS appropriations are separated into two budget categories: health services and health facilities. For FY2008, the total appropriation for IHS was $3.35 billion, of which $2.97 billion (89%) was for health services and $374.6 million (11%) was for health facilities. Other sources of IHS funding include a special diabetes program and reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. Total IHS \"program-level\" funding, including all sources, was $4.28 billion in FY2008. Indian health advocates argue that IHS funding falls short of the need.", "Although a number of legislative issues concerning IHS face the 111th Congress, the primary focus has been on the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). Two bills (S. 1200 and H.R. 1328) were introduced in the 110th Congress to reauthorize the IHCIA. Both reauthorization bills would have expanded health services, eased processes for reimbursements from Medicaid and other federal programs, coordinated behavioral health programs, and authorized other actions. S. 1200 was reported, amended, by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on October 17, 2007 (S.Rept. 110-197). S. 1200 was passed, amended, by the Senate February 28, 2008, and sent to the House. H.R. 1328 was reported, amended, by the House Natural Resources Committee on April 4, 2008 (H.Rept. 110-564, part 1). Separately H.R. 1328 was forwarded, amended, by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee to the full Committee on November 7, 2007. H.R. 1328 was discharged by the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees on June 6, 2008, and the Natural Resources version reported in April was placed on the calendar. Concerns continue about many issues in the IHCIA bills, including provisions on Medicaid and other issues listed in a January 2008 Statement of Administration Policy on S. 1200, which threatened a veto of that bill. Neither S. 1200 nor H.R. 1328 were passed by Congress.

Health services are available to eligible residents of reservations, of non-reservation areas of those counties that overlap or abut reservations, and of some urban areas with a significant AI/AN population. Eligible Indians receive free IHS health services regardless of their ability to pay (except in certain urban programs, or when a tribe chooses to charge for services). The federal government considers its provision of these health services to be based on its trust responsibility for Indian tribes, a responsibility derived from federal statutes, treaties, court decisions, executive actions, and the Constitution (which assigns authority over Indian relations to Congress). Congress, however, has only a moral obligation, not a legal one, to provide Indian health care. The Supreme Court has rejected the idea (absent congressional statement to the contrary) that IHS is under an obligation to provide any specific health program to Indians.", "This report provides an overview of the Indian Health Service and how it provides for the health care problems and needs of AI/AN.

IHS has stated that its funding does not allow it to provide all the needed care for eligible Indians. As a result, according to Indian health organizations, some services are \"rationed,\" with the most critical care given first. IHS regulations require that, when resources or funds are insufficient, the agency must set priorities for both direct and contract health care based on \"relative medical need.\" In addition, the drugs and medicines available from IHS pharmacies may not include all drugs and medicines needed, although IHS says its pharmacies will stock most drugs that have proven to be cost-effective and beneficial.", "IHS shortfalls in medical personnel contribute to this unevenness in health care delivery.

She would be eligible for care during the pregnancy and six weeks following birth, as long as paternity is acknowledged. The IHS also serves non-Indians in specific circumstances particularly when an acute infectious disease is involved.", "Most IHS services are intended for members of federally recognized tribes. Since federal law does not restrict state recognition of tribes, some states grant recognition to Indian groups that are not recognized by the federal government. Members of such state-recognized tribes are ineligible for most IHS health services, but are eligible for services at IHS-funded urban Indian health projects.", "For the most part, tribal membership is determined by the tribe. Many tribes require recognized descent from a particular tribal roll for membership. In tracing descent, tribes follow paternal or maternal. bloodlines, or both. Some tribes require minimum percentages of genealogical descent, and others require only proof of descent. For a few tribes, Congress has set membership criteria in statute.", "The IHS service population (as calculated by IHS) is not evenly distributed throughout Indian country. In 2003, approximately 35% of the population served by IHS resided in two IHS regions: 14.4% lived in the Navajo region (northwestern New Mexico, southeastern Utah, and northeastern Arizona, excluding the Hopi Reservation), and 20.7% lived in the Oklahoma region (Kansas, Oklahoma, and part of Texas)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Population Data", "paragraphs": ["Determining the actual number of people eligible for IHS services is problematic. There is no U.S. census of members of federally recognized tribes (or, for that matter, of members of terminated and state-recognized tribes who might be eligible for UIHP services). IHS makes annual estimates of its eligible \"service population\" based on decennial census data, adjusted for birth and death rates and for the areas IHS serves (see Figure 1 ). The census, however, asks respondents only to identify themselves by race, not by confirmed membership in a federally recognized tribe. Hence IHS service population data are based on self-identification as AI/AN by race, not on tribal membership. Not all persons self-identifying as AI/AN are members of federally recognized tribes, so not all AI/AN counted by the census are eligible for IHS services. The IHS also estimates its \"user population,\" based on registered AI/AN patients who used IHS-funded services at least once in the most recent three years, but this figure does not include all eligible AI/AN. The BIA publishes biennial estimates of its own service population, based on estimates received from BIA agencies and federally recognized tribes, but these estimates are not based on actual censuses and cover only persons on or near reservations. The BIA also lists tribes' reports of their enrollment totals, but the BIA conducts no census to confirm these figures, and its publication does not show whether the enrollees enumerated live on or near reservations or inside or outside IHS service areas. Table 2 compares recent IHS, BIA, and census population figures.", "Determining the urban Indian population eligible for UIHP services is equally inexact. As noted above, UIHPs serve a wider range of eligible persons, including members of terminated or state-recognized tribes and their children and grandchildren. They are not, however, authorized to serve anyone who merely identifies themselves as racially Indian. BIA figures for service population and tribal enrollment do not help determine the urban UIHP population, because, in addition to the problems already mentioned, the BIA data are not broken down by urban or metropolitan residence, nor do they cover terminated or state-recognized tribes. Nor is an answer provided by Census Bureau data on Indians, since, although the data are broken down by urban, metropolitan, city, and other types of residence, they are still, as noted above, based on self-identification by race, not on tribal membership, whether in federal, state, or terminated tribes. IHS figures for urban Indian populations are based on these Census data.", "While IHS, Census, and BIA figures for Indians, whether resident in urban areas or not, may not be definitive for the IHS-eligible population, they provide useful approximations of the population that IHS serves. Census data suggest that most AI/AN live outside reservations and other census-identified Indian areas, that the movement out of these areas is many decades old, and that a majority of census-identified Indians live in census-identified urban areas. Many urban areas are within CHSDAs, however, so further analysis may be needed to determine what proportion of census-identified urban Indians are eligible for general IHS services."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Health Status", "paragraphs": ["IHS comparisons of mortality measures indicate that the IHS service population has historically had a greater incidence of illness and higher mortality rates than the general U.S. population.

The funding has enhanced patient care and education and created a needed infrastructure for diabetes programs. With SDPI funding, IHS, Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), and tribes are able to support prevention programs which have been shown to delay the onset of the disease through lifestyle changes or use of medication. The program's disease performance measures have tracked the success of the SDPI efforts to fight diabetes. So far the program's efforts have seen an increase in the percentage of Indian diabetics maintaining blood sugar control from 25% in FY1997 to 34% in FY2004. In addition, there are other decreases in the number of health incidents related to diabetes including kidney disease and retinopathy. Other programs are tying diabetes screening with other diseases.

If Congress makes appropriations above the adjusted base to increase particular services or meet unmet needs, IHS allocates such increases using formulas, which have been developed in consultation with tribes. Some IHS programs or parts of programs are allocated solely by formulas, such as routine maintenance of facilities, some SDPI grants, some sanitation facilities funds, the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (discussed below), and others.

Major methodology problems also became apparent, including how to measure health status and health care needs, determine the services provided, and define the IHS-eligible population whose needs must be met. Congress established a permanent equity fund in 1988, the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF), to provide additional funding to operating units that are most in need. (The FDI is the most recent methodology developed to allocate these funds.) But when IHS had attempted in 1987 to apply needs-based allocation formulas to part of areas' base funding, some tribes and IHS areas had lost funding and objected strongly.

One of the major issues addressed in the IHCIA reauthorization bills before Congress is the tension between (1) the choices that must be made under the constraints of a finite annual appropriation and (2) the view of many Indians that their health care services are (or should be) an entitlement and, as such, are the sole responsibility of the federal government under trust or treaty obligations.", "To its proponents, the advantage of an entitlement program for Indians would be that federal spending on eligible Indians' health care would not be limited to a specific appropriated amount. Spending controls on entitlement programs are done either by reducing benefits, limiting the conditions covered, changing the eligibility requirements for beneficiaries, or generating new revenues, so among the issues to be considered would be whether and how to limit the entitlement's level of spending. Entitlement proponents argue that Indians' loss of land and resources justifies making Indian health care an entitlement program, despite the cost. Some advocates are concerned about how a \"beneficiary\" would be defined, and whether Congress would require \"means testing\" as part of the eligibility criteria. These supporters argue that if Congress imposed means testing, those Indians not meeting the means test would have their treaty rights abrogated.

Despite these actions and further appropriations increases, criticism of BIA health services continued, including suggestions to transfer BIA medical services to the Public Health Service (PHS). In 1926 a PHS surgeon was assigned to supervise the BIA medical division. In 1929 Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to permit state agents to inspect AI/AN health and education conditions and to enforce sanitation and quarantine regulations (P.L. 70-760), and in 1934, through the Johnson-O'Malley Act (P.L. 73-167), Congress gave the BIA authority to contract for medical services from states, local governments, and private organizations.", "Indian health problems were still severe, however. In 1955, under authority of the Transfer Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-568), the BIA's Indian health programs were transferred to the PHS in the then-new Department of Health, Education and Welfare, now HHS (see \" Statutory Authority ,\" above). Indian Health Service appropriations increased markedly after the transfer, and Indians' health status improved greatly in the next 20 years. It still lagged behind that of the American population, however, and in 1976 Congress enacted the Indian Health Care Improvement Act ( P.L. 94-437 ), authorizing new programs and IHS access to Medicaid and Medicare funds (see \" Statutory Authority \"). A year earlier, Congress had enacted the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-638 ), whose authorization of self-determination contracts and, through amendments, self-governance compacts has led to tribal operation of a majority of IHS facilities.", "Printed Sources", "Kappler, Charles J., comp.
