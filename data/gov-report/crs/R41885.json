His military construction appropriations request for $14.7 billion in new budget authority fell approximately $9.9 billion below the amount enacted for FY2010 and $3.0 billion below that enacted for FY2011. Much of that reduction came from military base closure accounts. Initiated in late 2005, the current base realignment and closure (BRAC) round is expected to conclude in September 2011. Funding needed in FY2010 and FY2011 for construction and movement of organizations will not be needed in FY2012 and subsequent years. In addition, the President requested less regular military construction for FY2012 than in earlier years. Finally, funding for construction supporting Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO, or active military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan), appropriations for which totaled $1.4 billion in FY2010 and $1.3 billion in FY2011, has been virtually eliminated, with only $217 million in the regular FY2012 appropriation requested for construction within U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The first military construction bill (H.R. 2055) was passed by the House on June 14, 2011.", "Construction issues within the United States center on relocations associated with BRAC movements; the proposed transfer of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier from Norfolk, VA, to Mayport, FL; the potential to move detainees from Naval Station Guantanamo; and the possible expansion of the Army's Pi\u00f1on Canyon Maneuver Site.", "In the Pacific region, topics of major interest include planned relocations of U.S. Marine forces within the Japanese Prefecture of Okinawa and from Okinawa to the U.S. Territory of Guam; movement of U.S. garrisons in the Republic of Korea; and normalization of duty there, which will lengthen tours and bring many more military families to Korea.", "Troops are also moving within Europe and redeploying to the United States. Active duty military personnel stationed in Europe now number only one-quarter of the force present in 1980, and garrisons in Germany are being concentrated into two large military communities near Landstuhl and Vilseck. At least one major combat formation scheduled to move to the United States during the past few years has been retained at its garrison in Germany pending a military basing review.", "Military responsibility for much of Africa is now exercised by U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM). Though headquartered in Germany, AFRICOM has one enduring military garrison site on the continent, at Camp Lemonier, Djibouti. Press accounts have indicated that a new permanent home for AFRICOM headquarters might be located in southeastern Virginia.", "Southwest Asia, the area of responsibility for CENTCOM, has seen ongoing military operations for almost a decade. Since FY2004, Congress has given DOD special authority to use some operations and maintenance funds for military construction outside of the normal appropriations process. Both House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2012 would extend that authority into FY2012. Funds for military construction had been provided through special emergency supplemental appropriations, but beginning in FY2010, these funds were folded into the base budget\u2014though still categorized separately from normal construction requests.

The Family Housing Improvement Fund (FHIP) finances the DOD portion of the various public-private partnerships resulting from the privatization of much of the inventory of domestic military family housing under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) begun during the late 1990s. A separate account, the Unaccompanied Housing Improvement Fund, performs the same function for the barracks or dormitories that house single service members or those whose families do not relocate with a change of duty stations. The Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF) was created during the mid-1960s to assist DOD family homeowners who are forced to sell their houses in markets depressed by base closures, but eligibility to apply for such assistance was temporarily expanded to include military members who purchased homes during the so-called \"housing bubble\" and who were ordered to change duty stations during the subsequent \"housing crisis.\" The Secretary of Defense terminated this temporary eligibility late in 2010, as permitted under the enabling statute.", "A final subaccount funds the construction of facilities at several chemical munitions depots.

This would be a reduction of $0.6 billion (4.1%) below the presidential request, but this figure does not count $237.1 million in budget authority from previous appropriations that would be rescinded, effectively recycling funding into the new fiscal year.

The announced reasoning for the move is strategic. Currently, the naval station at Norfolk is the sole Navy facility along the nation's eastern or southern coasts with the needed facilities and capacity to service a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The Navy became concerned that stationing all Atlantic Fleet carriers at a single port facility could offer a vulnerability to potential adversaries and decided to build a second facility at Mayport, estimating the cost of the project at $580 million. Thus far, Congress has not appropriated the necessary construction funds, although the budget request includes some ancillary items that would support future facility construction. The FY2012 request does not include funding to build the needed facilities, though there is a $15.0 million request for \"Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements\" and a like amount for planning and design that are seen as supporting the eventual construction of a carrier home port.

The Committee therefore directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a comprehensive master plan for Camp Lemonier that can serve as a baseline to measure progress, total costs, and total funding requirements for all current and future projects associated with Camp Lemonier.", "Since its creation, AFRICOM headquarters has been located in Germany. Press reports have mentioned discussions concerning its potential movement to the Norfolk, VA, area. In its report on the NDAA for FY2012, the House Committee on Armed Services noted that Commander, U.S. Africa Command, has studied various alternatives for moving his headquarters to the United States and directed the Secretary of Defense to report the conclusions of that study not later than April 1, 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Central Command (CENTCOM)", "paragraphs": ["The area of responsibility assigned to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) includes Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and much of South and Southwestern Asia.

The House versions of both military construction appropriations and authorization support that funding. The Senate versions would strike the funding of the two projects on Bahrain Island, with Senate authorizers citing concerns that the Navy could not execute them during the fiscal year.", "Nevertheless, since FY2004, Congress has annually renewed a temporary authority permitting the Secretary of Defense to use operations and maintenance (O&M) funding in the defense appropriation for military construction in support of overseas contingency operations. This discretion, referred to as \"Section 2808 authority\" for the provision originally granting it in the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 108-136 ), has varied over the years in the amount of funding available and the locations where it may be used, rising as high as $500 million for FY2009. Section 2804 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act, 2011 ( P.L. 111-383 ) limited funding to $100 million and restricted its use to Afghanistan.

That language has prevented funds from being used for the \"permanent stationing\" of forces and stressed that construction is to support \"operational requirements of a temporary nature.\"", "Nevertheless, this stance has softened somewhat in recent years. Section 2806 of P.L. 110-417 , the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009, exempted construction in Afghanistan from the existing ban on the use of O&M funds \"deemed as supporting a long-term presence.\"", "A detailed discussion of war-related construction funding may be found in CRS Report R41232, FY2010 Supplemental for Wars, Disaster Assistance, Haiti Relief, and Other Programs , coordinated by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FY2011 Continuing Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Federal funding for FY2011 was provided through a series of eight continuing appropriations of varying lengths.

This original act, rather than merely extending existing appropriations into the new year, adjusted the amounts available to several appropriations accounts from their prorated FY2010 levels. The most substantial adjustment to military construction accounts was the reduction of the BRAC 2005 account from the $8.0 billion needed near the height of BRAC construction in FY2010 to $2.4 billion.
