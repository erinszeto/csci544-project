This act reauthorizes federal surface transportation programs through the end of FY2009. The reauthorization was long overdue, given that the previous long term authorization, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) (P.L. 105-206) expired on September 30, 2003.", "The reauthorization debate was primarily characterized by two interrelated issues, money and how that money would be distributed among the states. The 108th Congress came close to a bill with a surface transportation Conference Committee in place. In the end, however, conferees were unable to reach agreement either among themselves or with the Bush Administration as to how large the six-year reauthorization package would be in dollar terms. The Conference was also unable to agree on a solution to the long standing donor-donee state funding distribution question, with donor states insisting on a 95% return on fuel tax revenues and donee states insisting that increased funding for donor states not come at their expense.", "In the 109th Congress, the same issues threatened to undermine a Conference Committee that began meeting in June 2005. This time, however, all parties found ways in which to compromise. Most importantly, the Administration allowed total funding in the bill to rise to $286.4 billion for the six-year authorization period (in actuality the act provides $244.1 billion for the five years remaining before FY2009). This increase allowed the conferees to ultimately guarantee all states an eventual 92% rate of return, an improvement on the existing 90.5% rate, while at the same time holding 27 states harmless (meaning they will not receive less actual money than they have in the past). With these key compromises in place many of the objections to the bill disappeared and the conference report was agreed to on July 29, 2005.", "In addition to money issues, the act addressed a number of other issues. These included the creation of a new consolidated safety program, enhanced environmental streamlining regulations, changes in clean air conformity regulations, funding for transit new starts, expanded reliance on innovative financing and tolls, and spending on congressional high priority projects (earmarks).", "This report will be updated as warranted by congressional actions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Federal surface transportation programs are a major component of national spending on transportation capital infrastructure. According to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, 46% of all U.S. highway capital spending in FY2002 was attributable to federal funding. Likewise, it is the availability of federal transit funding that has provided the possibility of bus and rail transit projects in many communities during the last few decades.", "Structurally, surface transportation legislation normally consists of multiple separate legislative titles which can be viewed as the principal programs and their funding mechanism; highways, highway safety, transit, motor carrier safety, research, planning, hazardous materials transportation, rail, and finance. Additional titles are sometimes included in reauthorization legislation, that are often unrelated to transportation (as is the case of certain tax provisions in SAFETEA). It should be pointed out that the term \"program\" has multiple meanings in a discussion of federal surface transportation policy. The larger federal-aid highway program, for example, consists of a number of separate programs, such as the surface transportation program (STP). Funds in the various programs are distributed on the basis of formulas (known as apportioned programs in highway parlance) and on a discretionary basis (also referred to as the allocated programs in the highway program).", "The majority of funding in the overall surface transportation bill, and the vast majority of highway funding, goes to the so-called \"core\" highway programs. SAFETEA increases the number of these core programs from five to six: interstate maintenance (IM), national highway system (NHS); surface transportation program (STP); bridge and bridge maintenance; congestion, mitigation, and air quality (CMAQ); and the new highway safety improvement program (HSIP) are all apportioned programs. A seventh program, called the equity bonus (EB) (which replaced the TEA-21 minimum guarantee program), is sometimes also referred to as a core program. Most remaining highway funding goes to the allocated programs, such as federal lands highways, which are ostensibly under the control of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), but in recent practice have been largely earmarked during the annual appropriations process.", "The structures of the highway safety, research, and transit programs also include a mix of formula and discretionary programs. In the transit program, for example, about half of all funding is distributed directly to transit operators by the urbanized area formula program and the non-urbanized area formula program. Each of the major programs also includes planning, environmental, and other elements that are major subjects of discussion during reauthorization debates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major SAFETEA Provisions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Authorization Period", "paragraphs": ["Federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs are subject to periodic reauthorization. Prior to passage of SAFETEA, the most recent authorization was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21, P.L. 105 - 278 ), which provided funds for the period FY1998-FY2003. After October 1, 2003 all federal surface transportation programs continued to operate on the basis of 11 short term extension acts.", "Although there have been numerous short term reauthorizations in the history of these programs, there is a consensus in the surface transportation community that long-term reauthorizations, such as that afforded by TEA-21, better accommodate the long-term planning needs and construction horizons associated with the provision of highway and transit infrastructure. Reauthorization by short-term extensions created a great deal of uncertainty about the likelihood of future funding in the highway and transit community. Highway and transit interests at the state and local level, and in the private sector, have, therefore, welcomed passage of SAFETEA even though delays in its passage have converted it from a six-year bill to a just over a four-year bill expiring in FY2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Surface Transportation Finance", "paragraphs": ["Federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream provided by the highway trust fund. The trust fund is in fact two separate accounts\u2014highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources for these accounts are the 18.4 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cent per gallon tax on diesel fuel. Although there are other sources of revenue for the trust fund, these fuel taxes provide about 90% of the income to the funds. Of these amounts, the transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon and 0.1 cent per gallon is reserved for an unrelated leaking underground storage tank (LUST) fund. Over the almost 50 year life of the trust fund there have been several increases in the level of taxation. The last increase in the fuel tax occurred in 1993 (all of these funds were not actually deposited into the trust fund initially, but were deposited in the Treasury general funds for deficit reduction purposes until FY1998).", "For almost 50 years the trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation. In FY2004, for example, the highway account received tax revenues of $31 billion, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. For most of its history the trust funds have collected more than has been expended relative to the size of the program defined by Congress. This situation has been changing in the last few years. The FY2004 limitation on obligations was set at $33.6 billion and the FHWA total appropriation was $34.5 billion, both amounts of which are higher than the revenues collected for the fiscal year. For a number of reasons, however, the trust fund's unexpended balance remains substantial, but is declining. Because of this trend there is some uncertainty at the moment about the long term outlook for the financial health of the trust fund. This is in spite of the fact that the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108 - 357 ), passed in the closing days of the 108 th Congress, provided the trust fund with additional future income by changing elements of federal gasohol taxation. These changes could provide the trust fund with an additional $4 billion per year starting in FY2005.", "As mentioned earlier, both the House and Senate had passed reauthorization legislation in the 2 nd Session of the 108 th Congress and a Conference Committee was formed. The Conference Committee, Congressional Leadership, especially in the House, and the Administration were unable to reach agreement about total program funding for the next reauthorization period. This was largely because some Members of Congress backed a level of project funding larger than the Bush Administration was willing to support. Part of the Administration's objection related to the above debate about the future health of the trust funds vis-\u00e0-vis the Administration's adamant objection to raising fuel taxes either now or in the future. Some Members of Congress, on the other hand, had identified a number of mechanisms, including the now adopted gasohol changes, other tax changes, and rescissions that they felt would support a larger program. The gasohol changes by themselves, however, would not have been sufficient to fund the program size desired by many Members.", "Conferees on SAFETEA considered a number of tax and other changes that would increase revenues to the trust fund and/or offset additional highway and transit spending. Several of these provisions are included in the finance title of the act. The revenue increases in this title are viewed as quite modest and derive mostly from cutting back on tax fraud and by transferring some Treasury general fund revenues associated with transportation related activities to the trust fund. It was believed at time of passage, that the changes identified in SAFETEA when combined with the changes in gasohol legislation enacted in 2004, and enhanced by expected economic growth, would be sufficient to finance the $286.4 billion program created by the act. (CRS contacts: John Fischer and Robert Kirk)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trust Fund Budgetary Treatment", "paragraphs": ["TEA-21 changed the way the highway trust fund relates to the Federal Unified Budget in two ways: first by creating new budget categories and second by setting statutory limitations on obligations. The act amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to create two new budget categories: highway and mass transit. The act further amended the budget process by setting the limitation on obligations for each fiscal year from FY1999 to FY2003 in authorizing rather then appropriations legislation. In addition, TEA-21 provided a mechanism, Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA), to adjust these amounts in the highway account, but not the transit account, so as to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in highway generated revenues. The provision also adjusts the highway program authorization level to correspond with this change. It should be pointed out, all of the above notwithstanding, that annual revenues and expenditures affecting the balances in the trust fund accounts remain part of the overall annual federal deficit calculation.", "The net effect of the changes was to set a predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs, referred to in TEA-21 as a discretionary spending guarantee. These categories are separated from the rest of the discretionary budget in a way that prevents the use of funds assigned to these categories for any other purpose. These so called \"firewalls\" were viewed, in the TEA-21 context, as guaranteed and/or minimum levels of funding for highway and transit programs. Additional funds above the firewall level could be made available for highway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process, but for the most part this did not occur except in FY2003. SAFETEA has retained this budget format largely unchanged."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guaranteed Funding", "paragraphs": ["Most of the debate about SAFETEA was about money and its distribution. At the end of the day, SAFETEA provides quite a bit of additional money, $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority, for the six-year period FY2004-FY2009. This is a significant increase over the level in TEA-21 which provided $218 billion over the six-year period FY1998-2003. A direct comparison between the two bills, however, is difficult for a number of reasons that are beyond the scope this report. Suffice it to say that SAFETEA represents a significant funding increase for all federal surface transportation programs, though not as much of an increase as many of the legislation's original authors had hoped for.", "In reality, SAFETEA is a five-year bill, FY2004 is history and, at time of passage, only two months remained in FY2005. A more useful representation of SAFETEA, therefore, is that it provides just over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009. As Table 1 shows, all major programs affected by the legislation receive significant new funding (the exempt obligation category is provided for equity bonus and emergency funding purposes and does not reflect a program per see). Total annual spending increases occur in each year and total spending in FY2009 is almost 23% higher than spending in FY2005. A summary of funding for major programs and activities can be found at the end of this report in Appendix . Even more detailed programmatic information, to the subprogram level, can be found at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ safetealu/ fundtables.htm", "The House version of what became SAFETEA contained a so-called \"re-opener\" provision that would have required that Congress reconsider the total amount of funding available at a specified later date. The Bush Administration strongly objected to this provision and it was not included in the final act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA)", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned earlier, TEA-21 created a spending mechanism intended to adjust annual highway program obligations to reflect changes in revenue in the highway trust fund. The expectation was that this would provide for increases in obligational authority, although the law did allow for reductions in funding if trust fund revenues decreased. In its first three years, RABA provided significant additional spending authority. In FY2003, however, the RABA computation called for a program reduction. Congress choose, through the appropriations process, not to reduce spending and instead increased it.", "As a result of this experience there was a push to change the way RABA was calculated to make revenue swings less dramatic, especially in the negative direction. SAFETEA changes how RABA is calculated primarily by using a two year calculation rather than the single year called for in TEA-21. In addition, it puts off RABA calculations until FY2007 and reduces the likelihood of spending reductions by requiring that no reductions occur so long as the unexpended balance in the highway trust fund exceeds $6 billion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Donor-Donee State Remedies", "paragraphs": ["Historically, transportation policy battle lines have often formed along regional rather than partisan alignments. The regional character of transportation policy is evident in the debate over the so-called \"equity\" of distribution of federal highway aid among the states. Since 1982 Congress has included legislative provisions in every surface transportation reauthorization act to remedy these perceived funding distribution concerns through a variety of minimum guarantee provisions. For many years, some states (mostly Southern as well as some midwestern and western states) have complained that they receive significantly less federal highway aid than their highway users pay in federal highway taxes to the highway trust fund (HTF). These states, referred to as donor states, have pressed for legislative remedies that would assure them a higher share rate-of-return, most recently 95%, on their tax payments to the Treasury. Donee states, states that receive more federal highway aid than they pay in federal highway taxes, have not opposed equity provisions per se but have opposed any reduction in their existing shares.", "The basic donor state argument is a relatively straightforward call for equity or fairness. Donor state advocates generally contend that for too many years they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure, especially the older highway infrastructure in the Northeast. Most also argue that they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending to the same degree as some donee states. Southern and western donor states also argue that they are fast growth areas, relative to most donee states, and that, consequently, their needs are as great or greater. Finally, they argue that with the completion of the Interstate Highway System there is no valid rationale for the donor-donee disparity. Donee state advocates argue that fairness should not be separated from needs. They assert that the age of their highway infrastructure, especially in the Northeast, the high cost of working on heavily congested urban roads, and the limited financial resources in large sparsely populated western states justify their donee status. They also argue that there are needs that are inherently federal rather than state and that a national highway network cannot be based solely on state or regional boundaries. Donee states also argue that Midwestern and southern states spend less local and state money on highways than donee states, and chide them for pleading for federal funds when they are unwilling to ante up their own resources.", "In a broader sense, the debate over equity remedies has implications for a number of overarching issues. An equity guarantee of a 95% rate of return could, in the minds of some, leave little room for addressing other or additional transportation needs that are uniquely federal, such as the Federal Lands Highway program. Also, the role of the federal government vis-\u00e0-vis the states comes into question as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%. At what point does the federal role become so limited that converting the Federal aid highway program to a revenue sharing or a block grant program make sense? Another controversial issue is whether the MG should be broadened, as some states have proposed, to include Federal Transit Administration programs.", "The 109 th Congress faced a difficult policy problem in resolving the seemingly contradictory goals of meeting donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless at a time when the HTF revenue base was expected to be insufficient to easily fund both goals. Part of the problem was that a bill that simply reduced the shares of donee states to increase the shares of donor states would have had difficulty overcoming a filibuster by donee states in the Senate. To construct a minimum guarantee (MG) mechanism that could overcome this obstacle, previous reauthorization bills had included \"hold harmless\" provisions that maintained certain base shares for all states. This meant that part of the process of bringing donor state shares up to the MG percentage required increasing the overall federal highway program size, usually by a significant amount (since donee state funding could not be reduced). In other words, providing equity remedies that keep both donor and donee states reasonably content has been accomplished by giving more money to all states but giving even more to donor states to bring their shares up to a designated per cent share, 90.5% during TEA21. Providing equity in this way has been very expensive in dollar terms, the minimum guarantee program under TEA21, in fact, became the largest highway program. In the end, the constraints of limited funding availability and the practical politics of getting the surface transportation legislation through both houses of Congress, resulted in a modest and gradual increase in the guaranteed rate-of-return to the states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SAFETEA's \"Equity Bonus\" Innovation", "paragraphs": ["SAFETEA replaces the entire TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program (EB). Basically, the individual program formulas will determine the initial apportionments and then the equity bonus funding will be added to these levels to bring donor states up to their guaranteed rate-of-return levels. The act directs the Secretary of Transportation to allocate to the states for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009 sufficient funds to ensure that each state receives at least a return of 90.5% for FY2005-2006, 91.5% for FY2007, and 92% for FY2008-2009, on their estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. The act keeps nearly all the programs subject to MG under TEA-21 (IM, NHS, STP, CMAQ, HBRR, Recreational Trails, Appalachian Development Highway System, High Priority Projects, and metropolitan planning) subject to the equity provision, as well as three new formula programs, the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program, the Safe Routes to School Program, the Highway Safety Improvement Program, and the existing rail-highway grade crossing program.", "The EB program also includes a number of hold harmless provisions that provide that certain states will receive the greater of the annual percent return described above or their share of total apportionments over the six-year life of TEA-21. To be held harmless the state must meet one or more of the following criteria, the state must: have a population density of less than 40 people per square mile and at least 1.25% of their total acreage must be under federal jurisdiction; have a population less than one million people; have a median household income less than $35,000; have a fatality rate on Interstate Highways in 2002 of greater than 1.0 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled; or have an indexed state motor fuel excise tax rate that is more than 150% of the federal motor fuel excise tax rate.

In effect, this sets an annual percentage floor, relative to a state's TEA-21 average apportionment, beneath which no state can fall. The annual percentage floors are as follows: 117% for FY2005, 118% for FY2006, 119% for FY2007, 120% for FY2008, and 121% for FY2009.", "The programmatic distribution of Equity Bonus Program funds to the states is as follows. Each year the first $2.639 billion is apportioned to the STP, except that certain set-asides such as for Transportation Enhancements and some population-based sub-state allocations do not benefit from this distribution. Any Equity Bonus funds above $2.639 billion are distributed to the six core programs: IM, HBRR, NHS, STP, CMAQ, and the HSIP. The distribution among these programs is based on the ratio of each program's apportionment to the total apportionment of all six programs for each state.

In terms of the transportation budget, two of the largest efforts of RD and TD pertain to ITS and FHWA's RD and TD program (discussed below). This section deals primarily with funds used to support FHWA-administered programs.", "FHWA conducts an extensive RD and TD program that involves all aspects of the highway system. For these activities, Title V of SAFETEA authorizes roughly $295 million per year, up from roughly $200 million annually under TEA-21. For each of the years FY2005-FY2009, SAFETEA authorizes the following amounts for transportation research and education: $169.4 million for surface transportation research, development, and deployment; $26.7 million for training and education, $27 million for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and $69.7 million for the University Transportation Research Program. (SAFETEA also authorizes research, development, and testing funds for transit and motor carrier activities as well as for a variety of other technological objectives.) Research funds are used primarily to advance and deploy technologies intended to improve highway pavements, structures, roadway safety, and study highway policies. Some of the technology deployment funds are earmarked for specific types of research or projects, and much of the university-oriented funds are earmarked for specific institutions.

In light of increasing international trade volumes and growing congestion on certain parts of the nation's highway system, Congress has been considering the capability of the freight railroads to expand their infrastructure capacity to handle more freight. Freight railroads primarily finance their infrastructure needs without government aid. Congress has been evaluating how, and under what circumstances, it might be appropriate for the federal government to assist the railroads in expanding their networks. Another rail issue is the increasing frequency of freight train traffic through the middle of some towns and city neighborhoods. More frequent trains have increased delays for motor vehicle traffic at grade crossings. While railroads have reduced the total number of railway miles they maintain in service, they are utilizing their remaining track more intensely in an effort to improve operating efficiency. A further congressional issue of a perennial nature since price deregulation of the rail industry in 1980 is the captive shipper question. Some Members of Congress, who have rail shippers in their district served by only one railroad, are concerned with the high rail rates and poor rail service they contend these shippers receive.", "All of these rail issues have been debated in the context of stand alone legislation introduced in the 109 th Congress but SAFETEA also reflects these issues in title IX of the act.

NEPA requires all federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of proposed federal actions. To ensure that environmental impacts are considered before final decisions are made, NEPA requires DOT to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for any federally funded action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment. Projects for which it is not initially clear whether impacts will be significant require the preparation of an environmental assessment (EA). If, it is determined, at any time during the assessment, that a project's impacts will be significant, an EIS must be prepared. Projects that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant social, economic, or environmental effect, and which DOT has determined from past experience have no significant impact, are processed as categorical exclusions. (For more detailed information about the NEPA process, see CRS Report RL32024, Background on NEPA Implementation for Highway Projects: Streamlining the Process , by [author name scrubbed].)", "Another requirement that is generally carried out within the context of the NEPA process is compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966. Section 4(f) requirements apply to the use of publicly owned parks and recreation areas, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and to publicly or privately owned historic sites of national, state, or local significance. The law prohibits the use of a Section 4(f) resource for a transportation project unless there is no \"prudent and feasible\" alternative to do otherwise, and the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the resource.", "Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns that the environmental review process for large, complex highway and transit projects can be inefficient, leading to delays in completion of those projects. To address this concern, \"Environmental Streamlining\" provisions were included in TEA-21. Although not defined by the statute, FHWA defines environmental streamlining as the timely delivery of federally funded transportation projects, while protecting and enhancing the environment. Because major transportation projects may be affected by dozens of federal, state, and local environmental requirements, administered by multiple agencies, improved interagency cooperation was identified by Congress as a critical element to the success of environmental streamlining. The streamlining provisions of TEA-21 required the Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop and implement a \"coordinated environmental review process\" for highway projects that either do have, or may have, a significant impact on the environment (approximately 9% of all highway projects fall into one of these categories). This coordinated review process encouraged full and early participation by all relevant federal and state agencies required to participate in a highway project.", "Since the passage of TEA-21, numerous administrative activities have been undertaken to facilitate streamlining. However, some Members of Congress expressed the need for further legislation to expedite the environmental review process required of highway construction and transit projects. As a result, SAFETEA includes provisions intended to further streamline the environmental review process. The provisions deal primarily with NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements, but could also be used to expedite compliance with other environmental requirements. (For detail about the NEPA process, Section 4(f) requirements, and streamlining provisions in SAFETEA, see CRS Report RL33057, Surface Transportation Reauthorization: Environmental Issues and Legislative Provisions in SAFETEA-LU (H.R. 3) , by [author name scrubbed].)", "Unlike TEA-21, the term \"streamlining\" is not used in SAFETEA.

In particular, it authorized funding for programs and projects intended to reduce carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone. Specific types of projects eligible for CMAQ funds include, but are not limited to: transportation control measures; inspection and maintenance programs for auto emission controls; the purchase of publicly owned, alternative fuel vehicles; traffic flow improvements; and pedestrian and bicycle facilities and programs.", "ISTEA established a formula to apportion CMAQ funds based largely on a state's population and pollution reduction needs.

States with no maintenance or nonattainment areas for ozone or CO are guaranteed a minimum apportionment of 0.5 percent of each year's authorized CMAQ funds. TEA-21 expanded the program to allow the use of CMAQ funds for projects and programs intended to reduce certain types of particulate matter (PM).

As of May 2005, at least 124 areas with a combined population of 159 million people were subject to the SIP requirements. Section 176 of the Clean Air Act prohibits federal agencies from funding projects in these areas unless they \"conform\" to the SIPs. Specifically, projects must not \"cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard,\" \"increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation,\" or \"delay timely attainment of any standard.\" Because new highways generally lead to an increase in vehicle miles traveled and related emissions, both the statute and regulations require that an area's Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), which identifies major highway and transit projects an area will undertake, demonstrate conformity each time it is revised (i.e., at least every two years). Highway and transit projects cannot receive federal funds unless they are part of a conforming TIP.", "While conformity has been required for more than a decade, the impact of the conformity requirements is expected to grow in the next few years for several reasons. The growth of emissions from SUVs and other light trucks and greater than expected increases in vehicle miles traveled have both made it more difficult to demonstrate conformity; recent court decisions have tightened the conformity rules; and the implementation over the next three years of more stringent air quality standards (both for ozone and for fine particles such as those found in diesel exhaust) will mean that additional areas are subject to conformity. Thus, numerous metropolitan areas could face a temporary suspension of highway and transit funds unless they impose sharp reductions in vehicle, industrial, or other emissions. In a 2003 survey, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that, over the previous six years, only 5 metropolitan areas had had to change transportation plans in order to resolve a conformity lapse; but about one-third of local transportation planners surveyed expected to have difficulty demonstrating conformity in the future. (See U.S. GAO, Environmental Protection: Federal Planning Requirements for Transportation and Air Quality Protection Could Potentially Be More Efficient and Better Linked , April 2003.)", "The Clean Air Act provides no authority for waivers of conformity, and the only grace period allowed has been for one year following an area's designation as nonattainment. Only a limited set of exempt projects (mostly safety-related or replacement and repair of existing transit facilities) can be funded in lapsed areas. The rules do not even allow funding of new projects that might reduce emissions, such as new transit lines. These limitations are among the issues of concern. In addition, many have raised concerns about a mismatch between the SIP, TIP, and long range transportation planning cycles, and have called for less frequent, but better coordinated demonstrations of conformity. In its 2003 report, the GAO recommended that \"relevant federal agencies ... consider extending the three-year time frame between required [long range] transportation plan updates and asking the Congress to amend the Clean Air Act to change the conformity rules to match ....\" This recommendation was generally supported by transportation planners and highway builders, but opposed by environmental groups and air quality planning officials.", "As enacted, P.L. 109 - 59 requires less frequent conformity demonstrations (at least every four years instead of every two years), and will shorten the planning horizon over which conformity must be demonstrated to 10 years in many cases, instead of the former requirement of 20 years. The local air pollution control agency will need to be consulted and public comments solicited if the planning horizon is to be shortened. The law also establishes a 12-month grace period following a failure to demonstrate conformity before a lapse would be declared.
