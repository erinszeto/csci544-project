Cybersecurity risks against the power and pipeline sectors are similar, as both use similar control systems, and there appears to be a broad consensus that cyber threats to this infrastructure are on the rise. Furthermore, with ever-greater physical interdependency between electricity generators and the natural gas pipelines that supply their fuel, many in Congress recognize that grid and pipeline cybersecurity are intertwined. In 2015, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (the FAST Act) provided the Secretary of Energy with new authority to protect or restore the power grid during a grid security emergency, including a cyber incident. Congress is considering additional legislation to fund and expand the Department of Energy's cybersecurity programs.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) is the lead agency for the protection of electric power, oil, and natural gas infrastructure\u2014cooperating with the Department of Homeland Security, the lead agency for pipelines. DOE's cybersecurity activities are led by its Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) and structured around three areas: (1) cybersecurity preparedness, (2) cyber incident response and recovery, and (3) research, development, and demonstration. Although nominally applicable to energy delivery systems across the electric power, oil and natural gas, and pipeline sectors, OE's cybersecurity activities to date appear to have been focused primarily on the grid. Publicly available examples of DOE-supported activities specifically focused on pipeline cybersecurity are limited. Rather, pipeline cybersecurity efforts appear to be included as part of broader national cybersecurity efforts.", "Several bills potentially affecting DOE's cybersecurity activities for power grid and pipeline infrastructure have been introduced in the 115th Congress. These include the Defense, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water Development National Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3219) and the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (S. 1609), both of which would modestly increase funding for OE in FY2018. The Energy and Natural Resources Act of 2017 (S. 1460) would establish and fund a DOE program for energy sector cybersecurity research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) to be carried out for advanced applications to identify and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities. The Enhancing State Energy Security Planning and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2017 (H.R. 3050) would authorize DOE to provide financial and technical assistance to states for assessing cybersecurity threats to energy infrastructure.", "As federal cybersecurity oversight and legislative debate continue, Congress may focus on several key issues. Given the ever-changing cybersecurity environment in the energy sector, Congress may continue to examine OE's cybersecurity resources to ensure that they are adequate and being deployed appropriately to address the most important energy delivery risks. Congress may also seek a more-informed basis for considering whether to adjust the provisions of the FAST Act or clarify the authorizations it contains. How OE's programs and expertise could best be used to inform analysis of electric power and natural gas infrastructure interdependency from a cybersecurity perspective may also be of interest to Congress. Finally, Congress may examine how OE's cybersecurity activities fit in, and coordinate with, the other various roles in energy cybersecurity for electricity, oil and natural gas pipelines. In particular, Congress may examine how OE's RD&D programs and work with the National Labs in electric power sector cybersecurity supports federal and private sector efforts in pipeline cybersecurity."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. electric grid consists of over 700,000 miles of transmission lines and over 55,000 substations linking over 7,000 power plants to around 150 million customers.

These operators can send computerized commands from SCADA workstations to control geographically dispersed equipment such as electric switches, pipeline valves, pumps, and many other network components. The SCADA system provides continuous feedback about conditions throughout the network, generating safety alarms when operating conditions fall outside prescribed levels. Communications links may employ dedicated telephone landlines, wireless communications (satellite, microwave, and radio), cellular telephone service, Wi-Fi, and the Internet. As SCADA technology has matured, system control has become more intelligent and more automated, requiring less human intervention.", "Historically, SCADA systems employed highly customized proprietary software and were physically isolated from outside communications and computer networks. Because many of these systems were largely unique to a specific operator, it would have been difficult for malicious individuals outside the company to access a SCADA system and know what to do with it. However, due to advancements in computer technology and the ongoing development of communications and Internet-based control system applications, SCADA systems have become much more vulnerable to outside intrusion and manipulation. Specific SCADA security weaknesses include the adoption of standardized control system technologies with known vulnerabilities, increased connection to external networks, insecure communication connections, and the public availability of sensitive information about control systems and infrastructure. ", "Once accessible to a knowledgeable attacker, a SCADA system can be exploited in a number of specific ways to carry out a cyberattack:", "issuing unauthorized commands to control equipment; sending false information to a control-system operator that initiates inappropriate actions; disrupting control system operation by delaying or blocking the flow of information through the control network; making unauthorized changes to control system software to modify alarm thresholds or other configuration settings; and rendering resources unavailable by propagating malicious software (e.g., a virus, worm, Trojan horse) through the control network.", "Depending upon the configuration of a particular system, such cyberattacks could potentially disrupt service, cause a hazardous release into the environment, or damage equipment. An example of the latter was a proof-of-concept attack hosted by the DHS in 2007 known at the Aurora Project. In this experiment, researchers working with DHS sent two sets of commands to a diesel-fueled electric generator. The first set of commands told the generator to repeatedly open and then rapidly close circuits in a manner that would cause failure. The second set of commands sent outputs to the operator-readable control panel that the generator was operating normally. The result was that the generator spun in such a manner that it destroyed itself without the operators knowing. ", "Recently, reports of harmful software (malware) known as CrashOverride emerged as the latest example of destructive malware that can be used against the energy sector. CrashOverride reportedly includes capabilities allowing an attacker to disrupt ICS operations by opening and closing electric circuit breakers (degrading operations), denying access to communication ports on devices, and wiping modules to render devices inert. While there is no reported case of CrashOverride residing on U.S.-based systems, an updated version of the malware reportedly was used in a 2016 attack against the Ukrainian electric grid.", "Most of the cyberattacks that have been made public in the past few years have been against electricity generation and delivery infrastructure. However, in March 2012, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) within DHS identified an ongoing series of cyber intrusions among U.S. natural gas pipeline operators dating back to December 2011. According to the agency, various pipeline companies described targeted spear-phishing attempts and intrusions into multiple natural gas pipeline sector organizations that were \"positively identified \u2026 as related to a single campaign. \"", "In 2010, the Stuxnet computer worm was first identified as a threat to industrial control systems. The Stuxnet software initially spreads indiscriminately, but the software includes a highly specialized industrial process component targeting specific Siemens industrial SCADA systems.

For the first time in executive branch operations, PDD-63 established national policy for critical infrastructure protection from both physical and cyber threats. The directive discussed using a public-private partnership to reduce vulnerability to critical infrastructure from attacks, with lead federal agencies responsible for coordinating government efforts for specific sectors. PDD-63 established 15 critical infrastructure sectors and four special functions. DOE was assigned responsibility for (1) the electric power, and (2) the oil and natural gas production and storage sector. ", "The George W. Bush Administration built on the work of PDD-63, superseding it in 2003 with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) on \"Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection.\" HSPD-7 shifted the doctrine by removing \"special functions\" and expanding the sectors. In some cases, the expansion also included the addition of subsectors, as in transportation and energy. The transportation sector identified pipelines as a subsector; the energy sector identified an electric power subsector, and an oil and natural gas subsector. Lead agencies were replaced by Sector Specific Agencies (SSA), which had to collaborate with other federal agencies in a similar way as in PDD-63, but were also given responsibility for vulnerability assessments and assisting in risk management. In HSPD-7, DHS was named as the SSA for the transportation sector, including pipelines; DOE was assigned responsibility for the energy sector, as well as being the federal coordinator for all critical infrastructure protection efforts. In implementing HSPD-7, DHS pursued a risk-based approach to focus federal resources in areas of greatest risk, based on assessments as well as stakeholder (e.g., companies and state officials) input. ", "Congress passed legislation on the cybersecurity of energy delivery systems during the George W. Bush Administration with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT). EPACT included the Electricity Modernization Act of 2005, which directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish an \"Electric Reliability Organization\" (ERO, a role which the North American Electric Reliability Corporation [NERC] currently fulfills) to develop \"reliability standards\" for the \"reliable operation\" of the bulk power system. The authority allowed for standards to address \"cybersecurity protection\" and also defined a \"cybersecurity incident\" as a unique incident which disrupted the \"programmable electronic devices and communications networks ... essential to the reliable operations of the bulk power system.\" FERC's authority under EPACT applies only to the bulk power system, and that authority is limited to review of the ERO's standards. FERC cannot author standards independently, but can remand ERO-drafted standards back for reconsideration. While FERC also has regulatory authority over interstate natural gas pipelines under the Natural Gas Act (P.L. 75-688), its role is limited to siting and rate regulation, not safety or security.", "The Obama Administration superseded HSPD-7 with Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) on \"Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience\" in 2013. \"Resilience\" was a term adopted in the Obama Administration as a way of recognizing that critical infrastructure is inherently vulnerable and will be disrupted at some point (historically, by severe weather, and potentially by an intentional attack), and that the infrastructure's degree of resilience will affect response time and eventual recovery. PPD-21 sought to further integrate cybersecurity as part of critical infrastructure protection by clarifying federal roles for security and resilience; establishing baseline information exchange requirements; and integrating analysis to inform planning, operations, and critical infrastructure decisions. PPD-21 retained the SSAs from HSPD-7, with DOE continuing as the SSA for the energy sector (electric power, and oil and natural gas). DHS was named the co-chair with the Department of Transportation (DOT) on the transportation sector and its subsectors, including pipelines.", "Congress further legislated on energy sector cybersecurity in 2015 with the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act). Division F of the FAST Act on \"Energy Security\" included the designation of DOE as the SSA for cybersecurity for the energy sector.

However, effectively transferring general cyber practices or technology across sectors typically requires consideration or adaptation of cyber capabilities to fit the distinctive needs of a particular sector\u2014such as \"smart grid\" metering requirements in electric power, or providing real-time operating pressure data in refineries and pipelines. Such sector customization, in turn, usually involves program participation by asset owners in a given sector, and pilot projects or demonstration in sector-specific installations.

As noted above, OE modified a version of its C2M2 model specifically for use in oil, gas, and pipeline operations. The Safe Active Scanning for Energy Delivery Systems (SASEDS) project included the pipeline sector in its literature survey.

Other OE-funded projects (e.g., Chess Master , a research and development program to identify next generation cybersecurity tools) have been led by technology developers serving multiple energy delivery sectors or in collaboration with industry partners that own multiple types of assets (e.g., the San Diego Gas & Electric utility company). In such cases, new technology may be transferred from the electric sector to the oil and gas or pipeline sectors by the vendor as a commercial product or service, or could potentially be transferred from the electric side of a utility to its natural gas operations.
