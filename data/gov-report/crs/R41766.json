Most reports acknowledge that Japan's current production and supply shortages, along with rising food safety concerns and possible longer-term radiation threats to its food production, could limit Japan's food exports while possibly increasing its need for food imports in the future.

Import restrictions vary by country but broadly cover milk and milk products, vegetables and fruit, and seafood and meat from those prefectures with a perceived risk of contamination, specifically Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma. Several international organizations, including the various organizations of the United Nations, are closely monitoring global concerns about the safety of foods produced in Japan.", "The Japanese government has taken steps to monitor and restrict, if necessary, the distribution of contaminated foods.

In March 2011, Japan's government made a series of announcements restricting the distribution and consumption of certain vegetables harvested in Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures, and fresh raw milk produced in Fukushima prefecture. In April 2011, there were additional announcements regarding possible contaminated fish products, and also an announcement restricting spinach and leafy greens from Chiba prefecture.", "In the United States, the two principal agencies that regulate U.S. food imports\u2014the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014have taken steps to address these concerns.

However, if ingested and accumulated in the body, radioactive iodine has been associated with certain types of cancers.
