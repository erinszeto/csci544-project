The law, among other things, reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (P.L. 94-437, IHCIA), which authorizes many programs and services provided by the Indian Health Service (IHS). In addition, it makes several changes that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in and receiving services from the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)\u2014also called Social Security Act (SSA) health benefit programs. The ACA also includes changes to private health insurance that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives and may affect tribes that offer private health insurance.", "IHCIA authorizes many IHS programs and services, sets out the national policy for health services administered to Indians, and articulates the federal goal of ensuring the highest possible health status for Indians, including urban Indians. In addition, it authorizes direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party insurers. Prior to the ACA, IHCIA was last reauthorized in FY2000, although programs continued to receive appropriations in later years. The ACA reauthorizes IHCIA and extends authorizations of appropriations for IHCIA programs indefinitely. It amends a number of sections of IHCIA in general, to permit tribal organizations (TOs) and urban Indian organizations (UIOs) to apply for contract and grant programs for which they were not previously eligible; to create new mental health prevention and treatment programs; and to require demonstration projects to construct modular and mobile health facilities in order to expand health services available through IHS, Indian Tribes (ITs), and TOs. It also made several organizational changes to IHS. It requires IHS to establish an Office of Direct Service Tribes to serve tribes that receive their health care and other services directly from IHS as opposed to receiving services through IHS-funded facilities or programs operated by ITs or TOs. In addition, the law requires IHS to develop a plan to establish a new area office to serve tribes in Nevada and requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to appoint a new IHS Director of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment.", "In addition to reauthorizing IHCIA, the ACA includes a number of provisions that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives who have private insurance coverage or who receive services through SSA health benefit programs. With regard to private insurance coverage, the ACA provides a special enrollment period for American Indians and Alaska Natives who may enroll in private insurance offered through an exchange and exempts certain American Indians and Alaska Natives from the requirement to obtain insurance coverage. Under regulation, additional American Indians and Alaska Natives may also be exempt from the ACA requirement to obtain insurance coverage. With regard to SSA health benefit programs, the new law permits specified Indian entities to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and extends the period during which IHS, IT, and TO services are reimbursed for all Medicare Part B services, indefinitely, beginning January 1, 2010. Prior to the ACA, authority for these facilities to receive Medicare Part B reimbursements for certain specified services had expired on January 1, 2010.", "This report, one of a series of CRS products on the ACA, summarizes some of the key changes made in the reauthorization of IHCIA and summarizes other changes included in the ACA that may affect American Indian and Alaska Native health and health care.

Each Area is administered by an Area Office; Areas, in turn, are further subdivided into service units that consist of one or more facilities. IHS may provide services directly, or Indian tribes (ITs) or tribal organizations (TOs) may operate IHS facilities and programs themselves through self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts negotiated with IHS.

The IHS does not have a defined medical benefit package that excludes or includes specific conditions or types of health care. Besides providing general clinical health services, the IHS also focuses on health conditions prevalent among American Indians and Alaska Natives such as infant mortality, diabetes, and hepatitis B. In addition, IHS provides mental health and alcohol and substance abuse services because, compared to the overall U.S. population, American Indians and Alaska Natives are more likely to die from alcoholism-related diseases or to commit suicide. ", "In addition to health services, the IHS funds projects related to health care facilities and sanitation. Specifically, the IHS funds the construction, equipping, and maintenance of hospitals, health centers, clinics, and other health care delivery facilities, both those operated by the IHS and those operated by tribes. In order to improve the health of, and reduce the incidence of disease among, American Indians and Alaska Natives, the IHS also funds the construction of water supply and sewage facilities and solid waste disposal systems, and provides technical assistance for the operation and maintenance of such facilities.

The priority system also permits new facilities to be nominated at least every three years, but protects the priority of facilities at the top of the current lists for construction.

It also authorizes the Secretary to donate excess or surplus property to such UIOs and to permit the UIOs to use HHS facilities. The ACA also expands to UIOs the authorization for a number of programs currently only at IHS, IT, or TO facilities. For example, the ACA authorizes UIOs to employ Community Health Representatives (CHRs) trained under the CHR program authorized under current IHCIA Title I, and authorizes the Secretary to establish programs for UIOs that are identical to IHS programs for prevention of communicable diseases, for behavioral health prevention and treatment, and for youth multi-drug abuse prevention and treatment.

", "The ACA includes amendments to the SSA, although these amendments are not included in the \"Indian Health Care Improvement\" part of the law. Rather, amendments to the SSA are included in Title II, Subtitle K, \"Protections for American Indians and Alaska Natives.\" This subtitle does the following: (1) it designates facilities operated by IHS, an IT, a TO, or a UIO as the payor of last resort notwithstanding federal or state law to the contrary; (2) it includes IHS, ITs, and TOs as entities that are permitted to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility; (3) it prohibits cost sharing for Indians whose incomes are at or below 300% of the federal poverty level and who are enrolled in a qualified health benefit plan in the individual market through the exchange (as established by the ACA), and (4) it extends the period for which IHS, IT, and TO services are reimbursed by Medicare Part B for all services, indefinitely, beginning January 1, 2010. Prior to the ACA, authority for these facilities to receive Medicare Part B reimbursements for certain specified services had expired on January 1, 2010. In addition, the ACA, in Title III, amended the Medicare Part D program to permit costs paid by IHS for prescription drugs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to count toward the beneficiaries' out-of-pocket threshold for catastrophic protection. In order for a Part D beneficiary to receive catastrophic protection, a certain level of out-of-pocket costs must be incurred; prior to the ACA, expenses incurred by IHS, on behalf of a Part D beneficiary, did not count toward this threshold."], "subsections": []}]}}
