For individuals who do not claim to be U.S. citizens but attest to be lawfully present in the United States, the attestation will be considered substantiated if it is consistent with DHS data.

The system only verifies that the name, SSN, and date of birth match the SSA's records and that immigration documents match DHS records; as a result, a person (e.g., a U.S. citizen, an unauthorized alien) who is using the documents of an eligible person would not necessarily be denied access to an exchange or premium and cost-sharing subsidies. Nonetheless, while all lawfully present noncitizens have documents with biometric identifiers, U.S. citizens do not necessarily have such documents, and, as a result, requiring such biometric identifiers may make it more difficult for some eligible U.S. citizens to gain access to an exchange and the premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies.", "In a recent evaluation of the E-Verify system for employment, a system that is often compared to the new system under PPACA because it electronically verifies both U.S. citizens and noncitizens, researchers estimate that 6.2% of all queries relate to unauthorized aliens, and that in about half (54%) of these queries the unauthorized aliens receive an inaccurate finding of being work-authorized primarily due to identity theft. Thus, the researchers estimate that about 3.3% of all queries receive a false positive verification. In other words, it is estimated that of the unauthorized aliens that are run through the system, approximately 54% who are using false documents are not identified by the system.

Noncitizens are slightly less likely to have Medicaid coverage (15.4%) than native-born citizens (15.9%), while naturalized citizens are the least likely to have Medicaid coverage (12.4%).
