{"id": "R43542", "title": "How Social Security Benefits Are Computed: In Brief", "released_date": "2019-05-03T00:00:00", "summary": ["Social Security, the largest program in the federal budget (in terms of outlays), provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members as well as to the family members of deceased workers. In 2018, benefit outlays were approximately $989 billion, with roughly 63 million beneficiaries and 176 million workers in Social Security-covered employment. Under current law, Social Security's revenues are projected to be insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits after 2035.", "Monthly benefit amounts are determined by federal law. Social Security is of ongoing interest both because of its role in supporting a large portion of the population and because of its long-term financial imbalance, and policymakers have considered numerous proposals to change its benefit computation rules.", "The Social Security benefits that are paid to worker beneficiaries and to workers' dependents and survivors are based on workers' past earnings. The computation process involves three main steps", "First, a summarized measure of lifetime earnings is computed. That measure is called the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). Second, a benefit formula is applied to the AIME to compute the primary insurance amount (PIA). The benefit formula is progressive. As a result, workers with higher AIMEs receive higher Social Security benefits, but the benefits received by people with lower earnings replace a larger share of past earnings. Third, an adjustment may be made based on the age at which a beneficiary chooses to begin receiving payments. For retired workers who claim benefits at the full retirement age (FRA) and for disabled workers, the monthly benefit equals the PIA. Retired workers who claim earlier receive lower monthly benefits, and those who claim later receive higher benefits.", "Retired worker benefits can be affected by other adjustments. For example, the windfall elimination provision can reduce benefits for individuals who receive a pension from non-Social Security-covered earnings, and benefits can be withheld under the retirement earnings test if an individual continues to work and earns above a certain amount. Although not an adjustment, Social Security benefits can be subject to income tax, thereby affecting the beneficiary's net income.", "Benefits for eligible dependents and survivors are based on the worker's PIA. For example, a dependent spouse receives a benefit equal to 50% of the worker's PIA, and a widow(er) receives a benefit equal to 100% of the worker's PIA. Dependent benefits may also be adjusted based on the age at which they are claimed and other factors."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Social Security, which paid about $989 billion in benefits in 2018, is the largest program in the federal budget in term s of outlays.

Benefits are also paid to workers' dependents and survivors, based on the earnings of the workers upon whose work record they claim.", "Social Security has a significant impact on beneficiaries, both young and old, in terms of income support and poverty reduction. Under current law, Social Security's revenues are projected to be insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits after 2035. For both of those reasons, Social Security is of ongoing interest to policymakers. Most proposals to change Social Security outlays would change the benefit computation rules.

Insured status is based on the number of quart ers of coverage (QCs) earned. In 2019, a worker earns one QC for each $1,360 of earnings, and a worker may earn up to four QCs per calendar year. The amount needed for a QC increases annually by the growth in average earnings in the economy, as measured by Social Security's average wage index.", "To be eligible for most benefits, workers must be fully insured , which requires one QC for each year elapsed after the worker turns 21 years old, with a minimum of 6 QCs and a maximum of 40 QCs. A worker is first eligible for Social Security retirement benefits at 62, so to be eligible for retirement benefits, a worker must generally have worked for 10 years. Workers are permanently insured when they are fully insured and will not lose fully insured status when they stop working under covered employment, for example, if a worker has the maximum 40 QCs.", "Benefits may be paid to eligible survivors of workers who were fully insured at the time of death. Some dependents are also eligible if the deceased worker was currently insured , which requires earning 6 QCs in the 13 quarters ending with the quarter of death. ", "To be eligible for disability benefits, workers must also satisfy a recency of work requirement. Workers aged 31 and older must have earned 20 QCs in the 10 years before becoming disabled. Fewer QCs are required for younger workers.", "In the case of workers having work history in multiple countries, international totalization agreements allow workers who divide their careers between the United States and certain countries to fill gaps in Social Security coverage by combining work credits under each country's system to qualify for benefits under one or both systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Average Indexed Monthly Earnings", "paragraphs": ["The first step of computing a benefit is determining a worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), a measure of a worker's past earnings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wage Indexing", "paragraphs": ["Rather than using the amounts earned in past years directly, the AIME computation process first updates past earnings to account for growth in overall economy-wide earnings.

For example, the Social Security average wage grew from $32,155 in 2000 to $41,674 in 2010. So if a worker earned $20,000 in 2000 and turned 60 in 2010, the indexed wage for 2000 would be $20,000 x ($41,674/$32,155), or $25,921.

For example, the AIME for a worker who died at 61 is based on 34 computation years.", "For disabled workers, the number of computation years depends primarily on the age at which they become disabled, increasing from 2 years for those aged 24 or younger to 35 years for those aged 62 or older.

Those amounts are indexed to the national average wage index, so they generally increase each year. ", "Three factors, which are fixed by law at 90%, 32%, and 15%, are applied to the three brackets of AIME. For workers with AIMEs of $926 or less in 2019, the PIA is 90% of the AIME. Because the other two factors are lower, that share declines as AIMEs increase, which makes the benefit formula progressive. For workers who become eligible for retirement benefits, become disabled, or die in 2019, the PIA is determined as shown in the example in Table 1 and in Figure 1 .", "Benefits are based on covered earnings. Earnings up to the maximum taxable amount ($132,900 in 2019) are subject to the Social Security payroll tax.

Because people who claim earlier receive more payments over a lifetime, the overall effect of claiming at different ages depends on how long the beneficiary lives. For example, someone who dies at 71 years old would be better off claiming early, but someone who survives to 95 would be better off claiming late.", "An increase in the FRA can result in lower benefits in two ways. First, monthly benefits will be different for individuals who have identical work histories and the same age of claiming benefits, but who have different FRAs. For example, someone with an FRA of 66 and who claims at age 62 will receive a monthly benefit equal to 75% of the PIA. For someone with an FRA of 67, claiming at 62 will result in a monthly benefit that is 70% of the PIA. Depending on the claim age, the scheduled increase in the FRA from 66 to 67 will reduce monthly benefits by between 6.1% and 7.7%. Second, lifetime benefits will be different for workers who have identical work histories and identical age of death, but different FRAs. For example, consider two workers who have FRAs of 65 and 67, respectively, both of whom claim at their FRA, and thus receive identical monthly benefits. If both workers die at age 75, the worker with an FRA of 65 will have received monthly benefits for 10 years, compared with the worker with an FRA of 67, who will have received monthly benefits for 8 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Dependent Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Social Security benefits are payable to the spouse, divorced spouse, or dependent child of a retired or disabled worker and to the widow(er), divorced widow(er), dependent child, or parent of a deceased worker.
