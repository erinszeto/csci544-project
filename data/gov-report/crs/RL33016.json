The United States created the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) as a direct response to India's test, halted nuclear exports to India a few years later, and worked to convince other states to do the same. India tested nuclear weapons again in 1998. However, President Bush announced July 18, 2005, he would \"work to achieve full civil nuclear energy cooperation with India\" and would \"also seek agreement from Congress to adjust U.S. laws and policies,\" in the context of a broader partnership with India.", "U.S. nuclear cooperation with other countries is governed by the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954 (P.L. 95-242). However, P.L. 109-401, which President Bush signed into law on December 18, 2006, allows the President to waive several provisions of the AEA. On September 10, 2008, President Bush submitted to Congress, in addition to other required documents, a written determination that P.L. 109-401's requirements for U.S. nuclear cooperation with India to proceed had been met. President Bush signed P.L. 110-369, which approved the agreement, into law October 8, 2008. Then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and India's then-External Affairs Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee signed the agreement two days later, and it entered into force December 6, 2008. Additionally, the United States and India signed a subsequent arrangement in July 2010 which governs \"arrangements and procedures under which\" India may reprocess U.S.-origin nuclear fuel in two new national reprocessing facilities, which New Delhi has not yet constructed.", "The NSG, at the behest of the Bush Administration, agreed in September 2008 to exempt India from some of its export guidelines. That decision has effectively left decisions regarding nuclear commerce with India almost entirely up to individual governments. Since the NSG decision, India has concluded numerous nuclear cooperation agreements with foreign suppliers. However, U.S. companies have not yet started nuclear trade with India and may be reluctant to do so if New Delhi does not resolve concerns regarding its policies on liability for nuclear reactor operators and suppliers. Taking a step to resolve such concerns, India signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, which has not yet entered into force, October 27, 2010. However, many observers have argued that Indian nuclear liability legislation adopted in August 2010 is inconsistent with the Convention.", "The Obama Administration has continued with the Bush Administration's policy regarding civil nuclear cooperation with India.

Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-401 ), which then-President Bush signed into law December 18, 2006, provided the President with the means to waive a U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement with India from several requirements of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended. India and the United States announced July 27, 2007, that they had reached agreement on the text of such an agreement. President Bush submitted the text of the proposed agreement to Congress September 10, 2008. Additionally, the President submitted a written determination, also required by the AEA, \"that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security.\" President Bush also submitted several documents, including classified and unclassified versions of a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement, required by the AEA.

India signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC), which has not yet entered into force, October 27, 2010. In 2008, the State Department described India's decision to \"become a party\" to the convention as \"an important step in ensuring that U.S. nuclear firms can compete on a level playing field with other international competitors\" because many other countries' nuclear firms \"have other liability protections afforded to them by their governments.\" However, as discussed below, Russia and France are also discussing with India means of resolving their concerns about the liability issue.", "Shrikumar Banerjee, chair of India's Atomic Energy Commission, argued September 16, 2010, that India's Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, which both houses of India's Parliament adopted in August 2010, is compatible with the CSC. Many observers, however, have disagreed, citing the provisions that make reactor suppliers, as well as operators, liable for damages caused by a reactor accident. U.S. officials have argued that India's law should be consistent with the convention. Blake stated in a June 9, 2010, interview with India Abroad that the U.S. interest is to \"ensure that the bill that ultimately is enacted is compliant\" with the CSC. Although Under Secretary of State William Burns described New Delhi's signing of the CSC as a \"very positive step\" during an October 27, 2010, press briefing, he also indicated that India will need to take additional steps in order to resolve U.S. concerns regarding India's liability policies. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton indicated during a July 19, 2011, press conference that the United States wants India to ratify the CSC by the end of 2011, as well as adopt a liability regulatory regime that \"fully conforms with the international requirements\" under the CSC. India's then-Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao stated in a July 29, 2011, interview that India would ratify the CSC \"before the end of the year.\" She also explained that \"the rules and regulations concerning the civil nuclear liability bill ... are in the process of being framed and in this process we are consulting with both the domestic companies and the foreign companies concerned.\"", "The Indian government published the regulations November 11, 2011, but they have not yet taken effect. The United States, however, has argued that the regulations may not satisfy U.S. concerns; State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland told reporters November 22 that \"this is an issue we have not yet resolved with the Government of India, and we're continuing to work on it.\" In addition, some observers have argued that the regulations are not compatible with the CSC and that suppliers' concerns may not be assuaged by the regulations. During a November 17 meeting with President Obama, Singh told him that India would \"address any specific [U.S.] grievances\" within the parameters of the 2010 law, the Prime Minister told reporters. Singh also stated that New Delhi would ratify the CSC. Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai told a Washington audience February 6, 2012, that \"we will provide a level playing field to U.S. companies, and are prepared to address specific concerns of U.S. companies within the framework of that law.\" Referring to an early February meeting, Mathai said that the two countries \"have just had a round of discussions between our legal experts,\" adding that \"[t]he commencement of discussions between the Indian operator, NPCIL, and U.S. companies in regard to an Early Works Agreement is an encouraging development.\" Westinghouse Electric Company announced June 13, 2012, that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NPCIL agreeing to negotiate such an agreement. According to a Westinghouse press release, the agreement is to \"include preliminary licensing and site development work.\" Nevertheless, Assistant Secretary Blake stated the next day that Washington still has \"some concerns about the liability law.\"", "Washington and New Delhi are also discussing necessary monitoring arrangements for U.S. nuclear exports.

New Delhi made such a request February 3, 2009, and the two governments held meetings in July and October of that year. India and the United States completed negotiations on the agreement March 29, 2010; Indian Ambassador Meera Shankar and Under Secretary of State William Burns signed the agreement July 30, 2010. India had reportedly insisted that New Delhi and Washington conclude an agreement on a reprocessing facility in India before New Delhi would sign contracts with U.S. nuclear firms.", "The agreement describes the \"arrangements and procedures under which such reprocessing or other alteration in form or content may take place in India at two new national reprocessing facilities,\" which will reprocess safeguarded spent nuclear fuel from both U.S.-supplied and other reactors.

Chu also certified that the Administration is pursuing \"efforts to ensure\" that other countries entering into similar arrangements with New Delhi do so under \"similar arrangements and procedures\" as the United States (see \" Procedures for Subsequent Arrangements \"). The arrangement would not have taken effect if Congress had adopted a joint resolution of disapproval within 30 days of continuous session; Congress did not adopt such a resolution. The July 30, 2010, agreement indicates that India may construct additional facilities to reprocess fuel from U.S.-supplied reactors.

The agreement, which entered into force January 14, 2010, does not, however, include the transfer of enrichment or reprocessing technology, according to French Ambassador to India Jerome Bonnafont. France would like India to reprocess spent nuclear fuel in an IAEA-safeguarded facility, Bonnafont said in late January 2009, but added that France would consider reprocessing the spent fuel for India. According to a December 17, 2008, agreement between the French company AREVA and India's Department of Atomic Energy, AREVA agreed to supply the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) with 300 metric tons of uranium; AREVA has supplied the fuel, according to a March 28, 2012, statement from the Prime Minster's office. Those two companies also signed a memorandum of understanding February 4, 2009, expressing their \"willingness to build up to six\" nuclear reactors. Both parties \"intend to discuss the elements of a commercial contract to supply\" two reactors \"as a first step,\" according to the memorandum. AREVA and NPCIL took another step on this project by signing several agreements December 6, 2010, for the construction of these reactors, including a \"General Framework Agreement\" for the supply of the reactors and associated fuel. However, several steps remain before construction on the reactors can begin. As noted, press reports and French nuclear energy executives have indicated that France still has concerns about India's nuclear liability policies. According to a December 6, 2010, joint statement, \"both countries stand ready to further exchange views\" on India's nuclear liability legislation \"so as to ensure the appropriate framework for the sound development of their cooperation.\"", "Russia and India signed a nuclear cooperation agreement December 5, 2008.

Notably, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev reportedly amended in February 2009 a 1992 presidential decree on nuclear export controls in order to permit Russian nuclear exports to a country without comprehensive IAEA safeguards. However, the decree now states that ", "nuclear materials, as well as technologies, equipment and special non-nuclear materials intended for their processing, utilization or production may be exported from the Russian Federation to India only if they are used in nuclear installations placed under IAEA guarantees.", "The Russian TVEL Corporation also reportedly signed a nuclear fuel supply contract in February 2009 with India's Department of Atomic Energy. The two countries initialed another agreement December 7, 2009, which expands on the 2008 agreement. According to a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs, the agreement includes cooperation on research and development, the construction of additional nuclear power plants, and fuel-supply arrangements. The agreement also grants \"up-front consent\" for India to reprocess spent reactor fuel and says that Russia would continue to supply fuel even if the agreement is terminated in the future.", "Russian and Indian officials indicated in December 2010 that Moscow, as noted, still has concerns about New Delhi's nuclear liability policies. Medvedev stated December 20 that \"[a]s for civil liability for nuclear damage ... and we seek to solve the relevant problems in a constructive way through negotiations with our Indian partners.\" India's minister of external affairs stated the previous day that the two governments are still attempting to resolve concerns over the liability issue.

NPCIL and KazAtomProm, a Kazakh national company, signed a memorandum of understanding January 24, 2009, that includes a provision for Kazakhstan to supply uranium to India. Kazakhstan has been supplying natural uranium ore concentrate to India pursuant to this agreement, which is to last for six years. The two countries also signed on April 16, 2011, what an Indian official described that day as \"an umbrella agreement for cooperation in the peaceful uses of civil nuclear energy.\" The agreement \"covers the area of R&D, science and technology and various things associated with nuclear energy,\" the official added.

The scope and terms of the agreement are unclear, but the statement \"resolved to encourage Indian investments\" in the Namibian uranium sector. Similarly, India and Mongolia signed a \"Memorandum of Understanding on Development of Cooperation in the Field of Peaceful Use of Radioactive Minerals and Nuclear Energy\" in mid-September 2009. The agreement would reportedly enable India to explore for uranium in Mongolia. Additionally, India and Canada signed an \"Agreement between India and Canada for Co-operation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy\" June 27, 2010, which provides for cooperation in nuclear reactor design and construction, as well as the \"supply of uranium.\"", "New Delhi has concluded other nuclear agreements unrelated to nuclear fuel supply.

On the first, the President cited the Constitution's \"commitment to the presidency of the authority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs;\" on the second, the President raised the question of whether the provision \"unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to an international body.\" In other words, the President was questioning whether Congress was ceding authority to approve U.S. exports to the NSG.

However, India refused to join the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), arguing that it was discriminatory. The NPT defines a nuclear-weapon state as \"one which has manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device\" prior to January 1, 1967. These states are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The treaty allows these states to retain their nuclear weapons, although they are also to pursue negotiations \"in good faith\" on nuclear disarmament by an unspecified date. All other parties to the NPT, are non-nuclear-weapon states. Although India conducted a \"peaceful\" nuclear test in 1974 and tested nuclear weapons in 1998, it is not a recognized nuclear-weapon state. ", "India's 1974 nuclear test reinforced the notion that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes could be used to produce nuclear weapons. Congress responded to that test by passing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA, P.L. 95-242 ), which imposed tough new requirements for U.S. nuclear exports to non-nuclear-weapon states. These included a requirement that recipients of nuclear exports must have full-scope safeguards on their nuclear facilities, as well as a requirement that the United States terminate nuclear exports if a recipient state detonates a nuclear explosive device or engages in activities related to acquiring or manufacturing nuclear weapons. The United States created the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a voluntary nuclear export regime, in 1975. The NSG published guidelines in 1978 \"to apply to nuclear transfers for peaceful purposes to help ensure that such transfers would not be diverted to unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activities.\"", "The full-scope safeguards requirement created a problem for U.S. fuel supplies to India's reactors at Tarapur, which were built by U.S. firms and fueled by U.S. low-enriched uranium, pursuant to a 1963 nuclear cooperation agreement. After passage of the NNPA, the Carter Administration exported two more uranium shipments under executive order after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission refused to approve an export license on nonproliferation conditions. Although the House voted to disapprove the President's determination, the Senate voted 46-48 on a resolution of disapproval. After 1980, all nuclear exports from the United States to India were cut off under the terms of the NNPA. France supplied fuel under the terms of the U.S. agreement with India until France also adopted a full-scope safeguards requirement in 1995. After the NSG adopted the full-scope safeguards condition in 1992, China supplied the reactor. Russia supplied fuel from 2001 to 2004.", "Although the NPT requires safeguards on items going to non-nuclear-weapon states, it does not explicitly prohibit nuclear commerce with states outside the NPT. However, the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, NPT states-parties supported the principle that non-NPT parties should not be eligible for the same kinds of assistance as NPT parties in good standing. Nevertheless, as noted, India tested several nuclear weapons in 1998; Pakistan followed suit shortly thereafter. Later that year, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1172, which called upon those countries to \"stop their nuclear weapon development programmes, to refrain from weaponization or from the deployment of nuclear weapons, to cease development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and any further production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.\"", "Bush Administration Policy", "The Bush Administration had been considering a strategic partnership with India as early as 2001.

He asserts that nuclear power is the least leveraged of India's options to meet India's energy needs, given that it currently provides only 2.7% of installed electrical capacity. India's projections of its nuclear energy needs are predicated on an estimated annual growth rate of 8%, which some observers believe may be unrealistic.

According to this reasoning, India should become an ally for three reasons: past policies have not worked; India has a relatively good nonproliferation record; and India could be a useful ally in the nonproliferation regime.", "Some observers, however, are concerned that India may not support U.S. nonproliferation policies sufficiently to warrant nuclear cooperation, particularly where the United States faces its greatest nuclear proliferation threat: Iran.

First, India has a growing strategic relationship with Iran, not limited to its interest in a proposed $7.4 billion, 2800-km-long gas pipeline between Iran, Pakistan, and India. Second, India has a strong tradition of foreign policy independence, as a long-time leader of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) states and as a vigorous opponent of the discriminatory nature of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. One witness before the House International Relations Committee hearing on November 16, 2005, suggested that opposition from the United States on the gas pipeline project is considered to be \"interference with India's autonomy in foreign relations, as well as disregard for its security and energy needs.\"", "On Iran's nuclear program, Indian officials have stated they do not support a nuclear weapons option for Tehran.

When the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution (GOV/2005/77) on September 24, 2005, finding Iran in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement, India voted with the United States, provoking significant domestic dissent.

In the early 1990s, when Iran actively sought nuclear-related assistance and technology from many foreign sources, India appears to have played only a minor role in contrast to other states. India signed an agreement in November 1991 to provide a 10 megawatt research reactor to Tehran, but cancelled under pressure from the United States. Nonetheless, India reportedly trained Iranian nuclear scientists in the 1990s. ", "In September 2004, the United States imposed sanctions on two Indian nuclear scientists, Dr. Y.S.R.

As noted, the NSG has followed the U.S. lead on requiring full-scope safeguards as a condition of nuclear supply.

P.L. 109-401 states that the NSG should decide \"by consensus to permit supply to India of nuclear items covered by\" the NSG guidelines.", "Dissent within the NSG could be counterproductive to achieving other U.S. nuclear nonproliferation objectives, such as discouraging enrichment and reprocessing, persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, and constraining Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program, all of which rely on the considerable support of friends and allies. Moreover, harmonizing export controls has played a key role in U.S. counter- and non-proliferation policies and is particularly important for interdiction efforts. U.S.-India cooperation could prompt other suppliers, like China, to justify supplying other non-nuclear-weapon states, like Pakistan. China, which joined the NSG in 2004, has reportedly favored an NSG decision based on criteria, not just an exception for India. Indeed, Beijing has apparently agreed to construct two additional nuclear power reactors in Pakistan. Russia, which only halted fuel supplies to the Indian Tarapur reactors in December 2004 at the insistence of the NSG, agreed in 2006 to resume fuel supplies to Tarapur under the guise of the safety exception, reportedly to the dismay of many NSG members.", "Effect on NPT Member States", "India has complained for years that it has been excluded from regular nuclear commerce because of its status outside the NPT. Some observers believe this is a good thing and shows that the treaty works. Others believe that a new paradigm is needed for India because it will not join the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon state.", "The NPT is basically a two-way bargain. Non-nuclear-weapon states under the NPT give up the option of developing nuclear weapons in exchange for the promise of peaceful nuclear cooperation. Nuclear weapon states under the treaty commit to eventual disarmament. India, as a state outside the NPT, is bound by neither of these commitments. Some observers may see the offer of nuclear cooperation previously reserved for states under the NPT with full-scope safeguards not only as undermining the agreements made by non-nuclear-weapon states, but also the commitments made by nuclear weapon states to disarm. In this view, India's continued unilateral testing moratorium is insufficient, compared with signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Similarly, its support for Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT) negotiations is insufficient, compared with capping its nuclear weapons fissile material production now, as four of the five nuclear weapon states formally have done. Some have suggested that the absence of an Indian cap on fissile material production for weapons may make it difficult for China to declare it has halted fissile material production for weapons. Others have suggested that, absent a cap on fissile material production, it would be difficult to ensure that peaceful nuclear cooperation was not indirectly assisting or encouraging India's nuclear weapons program.", "The revelations during the early 1990s of the Iraqi and North Korean clandestine nuclear weapons programs led to the strengthening of the NPT and export control regimes. At the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, NPT parties affirmed the NSG's decision to require full-scope safeguards for nuclear exports, supporting the principle that non-NPT parties should not be eligible for the same kinds of assistance as NPT parties in good standing. At the 2000 Review Conference, NPT parties again supported that principle. According to the U.S. ambassador to the conference at that time, \"reinforcement of this guideline is important given some who have questioned whether this principle should be relaxed for India and Pakistan, which have not accepted full-scope IAEA safeguards. The answer from NPT parties is clearly no.\"", "In the past 10 years, virtually all states agreed to strengthen the nonproliferation regime, sacrificing some sovereignty by allowing additional, intrusive inspections under the Additional Protocol. In the wake of 2004 revelations about Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan's nuclear black market sales, non-nuclear-weapon states under the NPT are also being asked to consider further restrictions on their sovereignty by voluntarily restricting their access to sensitive nuclear technologies like uranium enrichment and reprocessing. If some states view the U.S.-Indian nuclear cooperation agreement as a breach of faith in the basic bargain of the NPT, they might be less inclined to accept additional sacrifices, to the detriment of the nonproliferation regime.", "Missed Opportunities", "Then-Ambassador Joseph described the nuclear initiative as representing \"a substantial net gain for nonproliferation. It is a win for our strategic relationship, a win for energy security, and a win for nonproliferation.\" Joseph said he was \"convinced that the nonproliferation regime will emerge stronger as a result.\"", "However, some experts have suggested the United States asked for too little. For example, Fred McGoldrick, Harold Bengelsdorf, and Lawrence Scheinman argued in the October 2005 issue of Arms Control Today that", "It is open to serious doubt whether the proposed Indian concessions were significant enough to justify the accommodations promised by the United States and whether the steps the United States and India agreed to take in the civil nuclear area will, on balance, be supportive of global nonproliferation efforts.... If the Bush Administration is able to implement the joint declaration without significant modification, it will have given the Indians a great deal\u2014acknowledgment as a de facto nuclear weapon state and access to the international nuclear energy market\u2014in return for largely symbolic concessions in the nonproliferation area.", "Special Advisor for Nonproliferation and Arms Control to the Secretary of State Robert Einhorn, then of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Members of the House International Relations Committee on October 26, 2005, that several of the steps pledged by India are \"simply reaffirmations of existing positions.\" The Indian embassy itself has downplayed the depth and breadth of its nonproliferation commitments, describing all but its safeguards commitments under the July 2005 statement in the following way:", "A number of existing policies were also reiterated by India, among them a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing, working towards conclusion of a multilateral Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, non-transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technologies, securing nuclear materials and technology through export control, and harmonisation with MTCR and NSG guidelines.", "India has had a self-imposed nuclear test moratorium for years, although supporters of this agreement note that this agreement would bind India bilaterally to honoring that pledge. India has supported FMCT negotiations for years, despite continuing to produce fissile material for use in nuclear weapons. Since the pace of the Conference on Disarmament's discussions regarding an FMCT has been glacial, support for negotiations could allow India to continue producing fissile material indefinitely. Prime Minister Singh told his Parliament on August 17, 2006, that \"India is willing to join only a non discriminatory, multilaterally negotiated and internationally verifiable FMCT.\" ", "The most far-reaching of the commitments is to separate civilian and military facilities, declare civilian facilities, and place them under safeguards. Administration officials have pointed to this aspect of the agreement as a nonproliferation \"plus.\" Yet, allowing India broad latitude in determining which of its facilities to put under international safeguards is a privilege accorded currently only to nuclear weapon states under the NPT. Although the United States has said that it does not recognize India as an NPT nuclear-weapon state, excluding military facilities from inspections is a tacit recognition of their legitimacy.", "Then-IAEA Director General Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei said that he has \"always advocated concrete and practical steps towards the universal application of IAEA safeguards.\" In remarks to the Carnegie Endowment's Nonproliferation Conference in November 2005, Dr. ElBaradei cited additional safety benefits of putting more Indian facilities under safeguards. However, it should be noted that the NSG already has an exception to its full-scope safeguards requirement for safety-related items.", "The Bush Administration asserted that India has an \"exceptional\" record of nonproliferation and, despite a few isolated sanctions, most of the evidence supports the view that India has exercised restraint in export controls. As such, however, New Delhi's promise to refrain from transferring enrichment and reprocessing technologies to states that do not have them, as well as its promise to adhere to NSG guidelines, may be little more than a formality.", "Many observers have noted that India has not taken any measures to restrain its nuclear weapons program. For example, India has not agreed to end fissile material production for nuclear weapons. Although then-Ambassador Joseph stated in 2005 that the United States remained \"committed to achieving Indian curtailment of fissile material production,\" he added that the Bush Administration would \"not insist on it for purposes of this civil nuclear initiative.\" Moreover, Indian officials to pointed out that \"there is no commitment at all to cease production of fissile material ahead of the conclusion of such a multilateral [FMCT] treaty.\" Prime Minister Singh told the Parliament in August 2006 that \"our position on this matter is unambiguous. We are not willing to accept a moratorium on the production of fissile material.\" Furthermore, although India committed to a moratorium on testing nuclear weapons, New Delhi did not commit to signing the CTBT.", "U.S. NPT Article I Obligations/Aiding India's Nuclear Arsenal", "Article I of the NPT states that", "each nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; and not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over such weapons or explosive devices.", "Given that India will continue to make nuclear weapons, but is considered under the NPT to be a non-nuclear-weapon state, the question arises as to whether U.S. assistance might in any way violate Article I. In testimony before the House International Relations Committee, David Albright of ISIS stated that \"without India halting production of fissile material for its nuclear weapons programs, nuclear assistance, particularly any in the areas involving the fuel cycle, would likely spill over to India's nuclear weapons program.\"", "Three areas raise potential concerns: whether the separation plan is adequate to ensure that cooperation does not in any way assist in the development or production of nuclear weapons; whether cooperation confers nuclear weapons state status on India, with an unintended consequence of encouraging the Indian nuclear weapons program; and whether opening up the international uranium market frees up India's domestic uranium for use in its weapons program.", "Separation Plan Credibility", "Bush Administration officials repeatedly have stressed that India's separation plan must be credible, transparent, and defensible from a nonproliferation standpoint, and that \"the resultant safeguards must contribute to our nonproliferation goals.\" To those observers who interpreted that statement to mean that a separation plan would need to take into account India's past commitments (e.g., use of purportedly \"peaceful\" nuclear reactors like CIRUS to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons) and the impact on its nuclear weapons program (e.g., capping India's fissile material production), the separation plan may not appear credible. To those observers who interpreted \"credible\" to mean that all power reactors that supplied electricity would be declared civilian because they have a civilian use, the separation plan also may not appear credible. ", "Bush Administration officials defended the separation plan as credible and defensible because it covers more than just a token number of Indian facilities, provides for safeguards in perpetuity, and includes upstream and downstream facilities. However, although IAEA safeguards ensure that nuclear material is not diverted, there are no procedures or measures in place to ensure that information, technology and know-how are not transferred from the civil sector to the military sector. This issue, which the September 2008 NPAS does not appear to address, could become a key loophole. For example, U.S. assistance to one of the eight indigenous power reactors, whether focused on nuclear safety, improving operational efficiency, or extending its lifetime, could easily be applied by Indian personnel to one of the similar, but unsafeguarded indigenous power reactors. Some Indian commentators, however, have suggested that the United States has little technology to offer India, and others have doubted whether U.S. assistance would be provided to those indigenous power reactors.", "Conferring Nuclear Weapon-State Status", "A second area that raises concerns is whether nuclear cooperation confers nuclear weapon state status on India, which could encourage its weapons program. Senator Lugar noted in a hearing on November 2, 2005, that ", "prior to the July 18 joint statement India had repeatedly sought unsuccessfully to be recognized as an official nuclear weapons state, a status the NPT reserves only for the United States, China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom. Opponents argue that granting India such status will undermine the essential bargain that is at the core of NPT, namely, that only by foregoing nuclear weapons can a country gain civilian nuclear assistance.", "Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Dr. Ashton Carter, then of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, stated during the same hearing that", "India obtained de-facto recognition of its nuclear weapons status. The United States will behave, and urge others to behave, as if India were a nuclear weapons state under the NPT. We won't deny it most civil nuclear technology or commerce. We won't require it to put all of its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards\u2014only those it declares to be civil. Beyond these technicalities, nuclear recognition confers an enormous political benefit on India.", "Secretary Rice, in response to a question for the record in April 2006 on India's nuclear weapon state status, stated that \"while India has nuclear weapons and we must deal with this fact in a realistic, pragmatic manner, we do not recognize India as a nuclear weapon state or seek to legitimize India's nuclear weapons program.\" However, other officials' statements appear to lend more support to India. Then-Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns told reporters on March 2, 2006, that \"India is a nuclear weapons power, and India will preserve part of its nuclear industry to service its nuclear weapons program.\"", "Former IAEA Director General ElBaradei argues that the U.S.-India deal is \"neutral\" because \"it does not confer any 'status,' legal or otherwise, on India as a possessor of nuclear weapons.\" Nonetheless, the successful U.S. effort to create an exemption in its nuclear cooperation law for New Delhi has placed India in the company of only four other nations\u2014the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia\u2014all de jure nuclear weapon states. Many observers believe that this legitimizes India's nuclear weapons program by providing de facto recognition. Indian official statements repeatedly have used the term \"advanced nuclear states\" as synonymous with nuclear weapon states; Prime Minister Singh told the Parliament in August 2006 that", "The July Statement did not refer to India as a Nuclear Weapons State because that has a particular connotation in the NPT, but it explicitly acknowledged the existence of India's military nuclear facilities. It also meant that India would not attract full-scope safeguards such as those applied to non-nuclear weapon states that are signatories to the NPT and there would be no curbs on continuation of India's nuclear weapon related activities. In these important respects, India would be very much on par with the five Nuclear Weapon States who are signatories to the NPT. Similarly, the Separation Plan provided for an India specific safeguards agreement with the IAEA with assurances of uninterrupted supply of fuel to reactors together with India's right to take corrective measures in the event fuel supplies are interrupted. We have made clear to the US that India's strategic programme is totally outside the purview of the July Statement, and we oppose any legislative provisions that mandate scrutiny of our nuclear weapons programme or our unsafeguarded nuclear facilities.", "Offsetting India's Uranium Shortage", "Finally, critics of U.S.-Indian civil nuclear cooperation have argued that giving India access to the international uranium market would free up New Delhi's domestic uranium resources for use in its weapons program. India has limited indigenous uranium reserves and apparently has difficulty producing reactor fuel from these reserves. New Delhi has reportedly reduced its power reactors' electricity output because of fuel shortages. Since the NSG's 1992 adoption of the full-scope safeguards condition for exports, New Delhi has not had access to the international uranium market. Foreign Secretary Saran pointed out on February 18, 2008, that \"a major expansion in nuclear power in the medium term\" would require India to import \"higher capacity reactors and uranium fuel.\" Similarly, the NPAS states that \"India must import fuel, reactors, and other technologies ... to meet its nuclear electricity-generating targets.\"", "India's current fuel situation means that New Delhi cannot produce sufficient fuel for both its nuclear weapons program and its projected civil nuclear program. A panel of nuclear experts concluded in 2006 that", "India's production of weapon grade plutonium is currently constrained by the competing demands of India's nuclear-power reactors for its limited domestic supply of natural uranium. If India could import fuel for its civilian nuclear reactors, it could use more domestic uranium for the production of weapon materials.", "Acknowledging the country's uranium limitations, a leading Indian nuclear strategist K. Subrahmanyam suggested December 12, 2005, in The Times of India , that New Delhi should use imported nuclear fuel to preserve its domestic uranium reserves for nuclear weapons:", "Given India's uranium ore crunch and the need to build up our minimum credible nuclear deterrent arsenal as fast as possible, it is to India's advantage to categorize as many power reactors as possible as civilian ones to be refueled by imported uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for weapon-grade plutonium production.", "Proponents of U.S.-Indian nuclear cooperation have made several arguments regarding the Article I issue. None of these claims, however, refute the fact that India's access to the international uranium market will result in more indigenous Indian uranium available for weapons because it will not be consumed by New Delhi's newly safeguarded reactors. For example, proponents of the deal argue that India already has sufficient uranium to increase its nuclear arsenal and that New Delhi does not plan to increase that arsenal. The NPAS states that \"India is capable of maintaining and expanding its existing nuclear arsenal within the limit of its indigenous resources and capabilities.\" Secretary Rice made a similar argument during an April 5, 2006, House International Relations Committee hearing. But these arguments do not address the constraints India faces in pursuing its civilian and military nuclear programs using only indigenous uranium.", "The NPAS also addresses New Delhi's intentions regarding its future nuclear arsenal. First, the statement says that Washington has \"no evidence indicating that India plans to use additional domestic uranium reserves in its nuclear weapons programs as a consequence of implementing\" the nuclear cooperation agreement. Second, the NPAS argues that New Delhi has \"a posture of nuclear restraint,\" citing India's stated no-first-use nuclear weapon policy and need for only a \"credible minimum deterrent.\" India, however, has never defined what it means by such a deterrent; Saran stated during an April 2006 television interview that \"there is no responsibility on part of India to declare what its minimum deterrent is.\" Moreover, New Delhi's intentions are irrelevant to determining U.S. compliance with its Article I obligations.", "Furthermore, the NPAS appears to argue that the agreement may reduce India's potential to produce additional fissile material for weapons, because the additional indigenous Indian reactors placed under safeguards \"will no longer be available for this purpose.\" However, the statement characterizes the reactors' potential to produce fissile material for weapons as \"theoretical.\" Moreover, as noted, India is not obligated to place future reactors under safeguards.", "The State Department report submitted with the agreement notes that IAEA safeguards will prevent India from using its civil nuclear facilities for its nuclear weapons program. It also describes the ways in which U.S. export control policies prevent exported U.S. dual-use nuclear technologies from being used for military purposes.", "Appendix B. India's September 5, 2008, Statement on Disarmament and Nonproliferation", "Statement by External Affairs Minister of India Shri Pranab Mukherjee on the Civil Nuclear Initiative.", "To reiterate India's stand on disarmament and nonproliferation, EAM has made the following statement:", "A Plenary meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to consider an exception for India from its guidelines to allow for full civil nuclear cooperation with India is being held in Vienna from September 4-5, 2008.", "India has a long-standing and steadfast commitment to universal, non-discriminatory and total elimination of nuclear weapons. The vision of a world free of nuclear weapons which Shri Rajiv Gandhi put before the UN in 1988 still has universal resonance.", "We approach our dialogue with the Nuclear Suppliers Group and all its members in a spirit of cooperation that allows for an ongoing frank exchange of views on subjects of mutual interest and concern. Such a dialogue will strengthen our relationship in the years to come.", "Our civil nuclear initiative will strengthen the international non-proliferation regime. India believes that the opening of full civil nuclear cooperation will be good for India and for the world. It will have a profound positive impact on global energy security and international efforts to combat climate change.", "India has recently submitted a Working Paper on Nuclear Disarmament to the UN General Assembly, containing initiatives on nuclear disarmament. These include the reaffirmation of the unequivocal commitment of all nuclear weapon States to the goal of complete elimination of nuclear weapons; negotiation of a Convention on the complete prohibition of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons; and negotiation of a Nuclear Weapons Convention prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and on their destruction, leading to the global, non-discriminatory and verifiable elimination of nuclear weapons within a specified timeframe.", "We remain committed to a voluntary, unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. We do not subscribe to any arms race, including a nuclear arms race. We have always tempered the exercise of our strategic autonomy with a sense of global responsibility. We affirm our policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons.", "We are committed to work with others towards the conclusion of a multilateral Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament that is universal, non-discriminatory and verifiable.", "India has an impeccable non-proliferation record. We have in place an effective and comprehensive system of national export controls, which has been constantly updated to meet the highest international standards. This is manifested in the enactment of the Weapons of Mass Destruction and their Delivery Systems Act in 2005. India has taken the necessary steps to secure nuclear materials and technology through comprehensive export control legislation and through harmonization and committing to adhere to Missile Technology Control Regime and Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines.", "India will not be the source of proliferation of sensitive technologies, including enrichment and reprocessing transfers. We stand for the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. We support international efforts to limit the spread of ENR equipment or technologies to states that do not have them. We will work together with the international community to advance our common objective of non-proliferation. In this regard, India is interested in participating as a supplier nation, particularly for Thorium-based fuel and in establishment of international fuel banks, which also benefit India.", "India places great value on the role played by the IAEA's nuclear safeguards system. We look forward to working with the IAEA in implementing the India-specific Safeguards Agreement concluded with the IAEA. In keeping with our commitment to sign and adhere to an Additional Protocol with respect to India's civil nuclear facilities, we are working closely with the IAEA to ensure early conclusion of an Additional Protocol to the Safeguards Agreement."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
