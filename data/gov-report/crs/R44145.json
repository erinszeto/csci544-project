Second, EPA determined the amount of renewable energy generation (pursuant to building block 3) that would not be needed to achieve the emission rate targets. This \"excess\" renewable energy generation is available because EPA chose the least stringent of the three regional CO 2 performance rates as the national CO2 performance rate. EPA calculated the CO 2 emissions associated with this \"excess\" generation and allocated the CO 2 emissions to all of the states based on their 2012 generation, increasing their annual mass-based targets.
