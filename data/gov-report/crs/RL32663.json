For example, a measurement tool that is subjectively applied may yield resultsthat, if repeated, are not consistent or do not seem reliable.

Nonetheless, some previousassessments of the PART suggest areas of particular concern. For example, in its study of the PART,GAO reported that one of the two reasons why programs were designated by the Administration as\"results not demonstrated\" (nearly 50% of the 234 programs assessed for FY2004) was that OMBand agencies disagreed on how to assess agency program performance, as represented by \"long-termand annual performance measures.\" (72) Different officials in the executive branch appeared to havedifferent conceptions of what the appropriate goals of programs, and measures to assess programs,should be -- raising questions about the validity of the instrument. It is reasonable to conclude thatactors outside the executive branch, including Members of Congress, citizens, and interest groups,may have different perspectives and judgments on appropriate program goals and measures. UnderGPRA, stakeholder views such as these are required to be solicited by statute. Under the PART,however, the role and process for stakeholder participation appears less certain. ", "Other issues that GAO identified could be interpreted as relating to the PART instrument's validity in assessing program effectiveness (e.g., OMB definitions of specific programs inconsistentwith agency organization and planning); its reliability in making consistent assessments anddeterminations (e.g., inconsistent application of the instrument across multiple programs); and its objectivity in design and usage. To illustrate with some potential examples of objectivity issues,subjectivity could arguably be resident in a number of PART questions, including, among others,when OMB conducted its assessment for FY2005: (73) ", "whether a program is \"excessively\" or \"unnecessarily\" ... \"redundant orduplicative of any other Federal, State, local, or private effort\" [question 1.3, p. 22]; (74)", "whether a program's design is free of \"major flaws\" [question 1.4, p. 23]; (75)", "whether a program's performance measures \"meaningfully\" reflect theprogram's purpose [question 2.1, p. 25]; (76) and", "whether a program has demonstrated \"adequate\" progress in achievinglong-term performance goals [question 4.1, p. 47].", "Use of such terms that, in the absence of clear definitions, are subject to a variety of interpretationscan raise questions about the objectivity of the instrument and its ratings.", "In one of its earliest publications on the PART, OMB said that \"[w]hile subjectivity can beminimized, it can never be completely eliminated regardless of the method or tool. (77) OMB went on to say,though, that the PART \"makes public and transparent the questions OMB asks in advance of makingjudgments, and opens up any subjectivity in that process for discussion and debate.\" That said, thePART and its implementation to date nevertheless appear to place much of the process for debatingand determining program goals and measures squarely within the executive branch.
