Since then, the normalization process has accelerated and bilateral ties have expanded, particularly on the economic side of the relationship.

The decision to sign the BTA appears to have fashioned a new consensus in favor of a new economic reformist push. In short order after signing the BTA, the government enacted a series of measures, including passing a new Enterprise Law, passing constitutional amendment giving legal status to the private sector, reducing red tape, creating unprecedented transparency rules for prior publication of new rules and regulations, and, for the first time, giving party members the green light to engage in private business. Adhering to the BTA's implementation deadlines and achieving the government's goal of joining the WTO have helped galvanize the Vietnamese bureaucracy toward enacting many of these and other steps.", "Some U.S. industry officials have expressed concern that the government has not met deadlines to implement in law and/or in practice some of concessions, particularly in the services sector. Many of these critics, however, tend to accept the argument that the slippages often are due more to weak capacity than to protectionist intentions, and in 2005 Vietnam passed more than 20 laws and regulations that belatedly address some of these concerns.

Although the dollar amount of its clothing exports to the United States is far less than that of China, Vietnam is the sixth largest exporter of apparel to the United States at about the same order of magnitude of such exporters as India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh, whose clothing exports to the United States also have been rising rapidly.

Thus, trousers, coats, jackets, and other lightweight outer garments accounted for more than half of Vietnamese exports of clothing to the United States in 2005 (see Appendix B ).

In practical terms, this means that in most cases a country cannot apply a higher import tariff to a good from one member country than it applies to like goods from any other member country. National treatment : Imports of goods and services are treated no less favorably than like goods and services produced domestically. In practical terms this means that governments cannot discriminate against imports in the application of laws and regulations, such as regulations to protect consumer safety or the environment. Transparency: Government laws and regulations that affect foreign trade and investment are to be published and available for anyone to see. Procedures to implement the laws and regulations are to be open. Lowering Trade Barriers Through Negotiations: Since the GATT's creation, its members have conducted eight rounds of negotiations to lower trade barriers. At first these negotiations focused on lowering tariffs. Over time, the rounds have broadened GATT/WTO coverage to include nontariff barriers, such as discriminatory government procurement practices, discriminatory standards, and trade-distorting government subsidies. The last completed round, the Uruguay Round (1986-1994), resulted in the most ambitious expansion of rules to cover, for the first time, trade in agricultural products and services and government policies and practices pertaining to intellectual property rights protection and foreign investment regulations that affect trade. The current round, the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), was launched in November 2001. Reliance on tariffs: In order to promote predictability and openness in commerce, the WTO requires member countries to use tariffs and avoid using quotas or other nontariff measures when restricting imports for legitimate purposes, such as on injurious imports. Dispute settlement: As part of its function to administer the rules established under the agreements, the WTO provides a mechanism for the settlement of disputes between members where the dispute involves alleged violations of WTO agreements.

Additionally, Vietnam's relatively low wages and highly educated population appeal to some U.S. multinational corporations that see Vietnam as an important site for foreign direct investment (FDI), often as a way to avoid an over-reliance upon factories and suppliers in China.

In 2005, the apparel industry's contribution to Vietnam's total exports was about 15%. WTO entry is expected to give a boost to inward FDI, by further entrenching and expanding not only Vietnam's integration into the global economy but also its own domestic economic reforms.

(See Table 2 and Table 3 ) In the 1990s and early 2000s, as Vietnam deepened its integration into the global economy and as global trade rules expanded, Vietnam was forced to commit to an \"open market industrialization\" strategy. By entering into a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the United States (a condition for obtaining conditional NTR from the United States), by pushing to join the WTO, and by participating in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), Vietnam is attempting to achieve its goal of becoming an industrialized country by 2020 in effect without the benefits of protectionism and subsidization that the East Asian tigers employed in an earlier era.

Hanoi's decision to sign the BTA in 2000 appears to have been a cathartic moment for domestic debates about economic policy. Prior to the signing of the BTA, the reformist momentum was widely observed to have dissipated, in large measure due to perhaps the worst infighting and political deadlock Vietnam had experienced since reunification. The deadlock can be simplified as disagreements between reformers and conservatives over how far to continue the economic reforms and concomitant integration into the international community. Many conservatives feared that economic rationalization would increase unemployment, in particular by forcing the government to curtail subsidies to state-owned enterprises. Conservatives also felt that economic reform would affect Vietnam's sovereignty and undermine the \"socialist foundations\" of the country's economic and political systems and thereby erode the VCP's monopoly on power. Vietnam's consensus-based decision-making style, combined with the absence of any paramount leader, only exacerbated the effect of these divisions.", "These arguments were brought to a head during the debate over whether to sign the BTA with the United States, a decision that took more than a year after an agreement in principle had been reached. The BTA broke the policymaking logjam a new political consensus emerged in favor of reform that new leaders endorsed at VCP's 9 th Party Congress in 2001. In short order after signing the BTA, the government enacted a series of measures, including passing a new Enterprise Law to give a boost to privately-owned businesses, passing a constitutional amendment giving legal status to the private sector, reducing red tape, creating unprecedented transparency rules for prior publication of new rules and regulations, and for the first time giving party members the green light to engage in private business.
