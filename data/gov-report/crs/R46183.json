{"id": "R46183", "title": "The National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard: Overview and Select Considerations", "released_date": "2020-02-07T00:00:00", "summary": ["In July 2016, Congress enacted P.L. 114-216 (2016 Act), comprehensive legislation to govern the labeling of bioengineered foods. The 2016 Act required the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard ( the Standard ) . The Standard regulates labeling of bioengineered foods, a term defined in the 2016 Act. The act does not address or define other terms that some members of the public might associate with bioengineered foods, such as genetically engineered (GE), genetically modified , and genetically modified organism (GMO). The Standard guides the mandatory labeling of foods to indicate the presence of GE ingredients. As such, foods meeting requirements identified in the Standard must bear a bioengineered disclosure. Implementation began on January 1, 2020, and mandatory compliance begins on January 1, 2022.", "The Standard provides details under the three key issues of applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions:", "Applicability discusses the definition of bioengineered food and the USDA-maintained List of Bioengineered Foods (List). The Standard applies to foods that are or may be derived from bioengineered ingredients, with some exclusions and exemptions. It does not apply to refined products, such as oils or sugars, that derive from GE plants but no longer contain detectable modified deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Many groups interpret the Standard as not applying to foods derived from gene editing and other new technologies that do not use recombinant DNA. The Standard exempts from disclosure foods served in restaurants. Some have endorsed such exclusions and exemptions, and others have criticized them. Disclosure Options outlines acceptable disclosure options for regulated entities, as well as additional options available for specific entities and types of food packages. Most regulated entities may disclose by text, symbol (pictured above), electronic or digital link, or text message. In some cases, a telephone number or website address may be acceptable. Some groups have praised the flexibility that this range of options provides regulated entities, while others have criticized these options as confusing. Administrative Provisions reviews compliance dates, recordkeeping requirements, and enforcement mechanisms, which include audits, examinations, hearings, and release of public findings. The 2016 Act provided few enforcement mechanisms to promote compliance. The Standard establishes how USDA may investigate accusations of non-compliance and how it may publicly release its findings.", "The Standard does not affect how foods derived from biotechnology are regulated for safety and approval for human consumption. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology , a policy the White House issued in 1986, continues to govern how federal agencies, including USDA, evaluate and approve products developed using modern biotechnology. More generally, USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continue to ensure that foods sold in the United States are safe and properly labeled.", "USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) developed the Standard within a broader societal context. Before the 2016 Act, some members of the public had demanded mandatory labeling of the presence of GE ingredients in foods, based on the consumer's right to know. Other members of the public had opposed any GE labeling because of the scientific consensus that GE foods are safe to eat and concern that labeling may introduce unwarranted doubts about food safety. Before the 2016 Act, several states had enacted GE labeling laws, creating concerns among industry and consumer groups. In response, Congress debated this and other federal GE labeling legislation. GE labeling programs may be voluntary or mandatory and may indicate the presence or absence of GE ingredients. Several voluntary labeling programs predate the Standard's mandatory labeling requirements. Public and private programs for the voluntary labeling of foods continue to indicate the absence of GE ingredients in foods. These include the Non-GMO Project and the USDA National Organic Program.", "Future considerations for Congress may include ongoing questions consumers may have concerning what it means for a food to be labeled as bioengineered , how regulated entities will respond to the Standard's new requirements, how USDA will implement its responsibilities under the Standard, potential market impacts as demand for GE versus non-GE foods may change, and how the Standard aligns with international labeling requirements. Congress may choose to monitor implementation of the new Standard in accordance with its oversight responsibilities."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The United States has been a global leader in developing advanced genetic technologies and applying them to crops and livestock.

Today, about 90% of canola, corn, cotton, soybean, and sugarbeet acres in the United States are planted with GE varieties. GE foods predominantly enter commerce as processed foods and food ingredients (e.g., soybean oil, corn syrup, and sugar). Some members of the public seek to avoid consuming GE foods, as advances in biotechnology have outpaced their acceptance.", "In July 2016, Congress enacted P.L. 114-216 (the 2016 Act), requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (the Standard) within two years. The 2016 Act followed decades of societal debate about genetic engineering, and it marked the first time that the federal government would require the disclosure of GE foods to consumers. (The 2016 Act defined these as bioengineered foods .) With the 2016 Act, the United States joined more than 60 countries that require some form of GE labeling , or on-package disclosure of GE foods or food ingredients.", "The Standard provides a mandatory national standard for disclosure of the presence of bioengineered foods and food ingredients to consumers. It details who is responsible for making disclosures, what they must look like, and when they are and are not required. The Standard provides U.S. food manufacturers, importers, and retailers with a voluntary compliance period and a mandatory compliance deadline. The more than 126,000 comments that USDA received during the rulemaking process demonstrate significant public interest in its formulation. USDA released the final rule in December 2018, and phased implementation began in January 2020.", "Stakeholder reactions to the final Standard have been mixed. Several organizations immediately criticized the final rule, while others supported it. The Organic Trade Association (OTA), the Center for Food Safety (CFS), the Non-GMO Project, and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) each released statements with critical comments. OTA remarked that it is \"deeply disappointed in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's final GMO labeling rule and calls on companies to voluntarily act on their own to provide full disclosures on their food products about GMO content.\" CFS stated that \"the USDA has betrayed the public trust by denying Americans the right to know how their food is produce[d].\" The Non-GMO Project commented that it \"is disappointed by the content of the final rule, which jeopardizes GMO transparency for Americans.\" IATP stated that \"unfortunately, the final rule fails to fix the most egregious provisions of the draft rule and is practically useless in conveying accurate information about food ingredients to consumers while they are shopping.\" ", "In contrast, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), the American Soybean Association (ASA), and the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) provided supportive comments. NCGA commented that \"America's corn farmers need a consistent, transparent system to provide consumers with information without stigmatizing important, safe technology. Thus, we are pleased with the issuance of these rules and look forward to reviewing the details in the coming days.\" ASA stated, \"we believe that it allows transparency for consumers while following the intent of Congress that only food that contains modified genetic material be required to be labeled bioengineered under the law, with food companies having the option of providing additional information if they choose.\" FMI stated, \"the rule provides a consistent way to provide transparency regarding the foods we sell and allow[s] our customers across the country the means to learn more about grocery products containing bioengineered ingredients.\"", "This report provides background information on agricultural biotechnology; reviews major provisions of the Standard (related to applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions); and concludes with potential considerations for Congress.

Before people planted crops and raised farm animals, hunting and gathering changed the genetic composition of species. The pace of these changes accelerated with the onset of agriculture. Selective breeding helped create and improve agricultural varieties to meet farmer and consumer needs. Conventional (traditional) breeding created hybrid varieties with enhanced size, growth rate, and other valuable characteristics. Since the mid-20 th century, laboratory-based breeding techniques have further strengthened the ability to modify agricultural varieties. In recent decades, genetic engineering has allowed for increasingly specific genetic manipulation. These techniques can change plants and animals in ways that, with conventional breeding, would not be possible or could take decades to achieve. ", "The public has come to recognize plants and animals altered through modern biotechnology and genetic engineering as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) . Scientific and federal government experts identify the term g enetically modified as more general than genetically engineered , and as such genetically modified may include conventional breeding. In this report, genetic engineering refers to genetic modification techniques other than conventional breeding. ", "The Standard addresses food labeling, and it does not change how foods derived from biotechnology are regulated for safety and approval for human or animal consumption. The federal government's 1986 Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (the Coordinated Framework) governs how USDA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) apply existing statutes to evaluate biotechnology products. USDA regulates plants under the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a77701 et seq.). FDA regulates food, animal feed additives, and human and animal drugs, primarily under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7301 et seq.) and the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7201 et seq.). EPA registers and approves the use of pesticides, including those incorporated into plants through biotechnology, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7136 et seq.). A key principle of the Coordinated Framework is to regulate products according to their characteristics and unique features rather than the processes used to develop them.", "More generally, FDA and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have responsibilities for assuring that foods sold in the United States are safe, with respect to human and agricultural health, and properly labeled. FDA released a policy statement on GE foods in 1992, indicating that in most cases they are \"substantially similar\" to non-GE foods and do not require additional regulation or labeling beyond what is required for comparable non-GE foods. A legal decision in 2000 upheld this policy. FDA requires labeling of GE foods that (1) have nutritional characteristics that differ from comparable non-GE foods, (2) contain GE material from known allergenic sources, or (3) have elevated levels of toxic compounds. This labeling is not required to indicate the GE status of the food.", "APHIS reviews GE organisms on the basis of whether they pose plant pest risks to agriculture. In 2019, the agency issued a proposed rule to exempt several categories of GE plants from review, citing 30 years of evidence indicating that \"genetically engineering a plant with a plant pest as a vector, vector agent, or donor does not in and of itself result in a GE plant that presents a plant pest risk.\" The proposed rule further stated that new GE technologies, such as gene editing, do not engage with plant pests in any way."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard", "paragraphs": ["The Standard provides a mandatory national standard for disclosure of the presence of bioengineered foods and food ingredients to consumers.

The RIA estimates that implementation will cost between $570 million and $3.9 billion in the first year, and between $52 million and $118 million in each following year. It attributes most first year costs to those incurred by manufacturers analyzing the applicability of the rule and their compliance with the rule ($401 million to $3.1 billion). After the first year, the RIA attributes most ongoing costs to regulated entities avoiding mandatory disclosures by verifying that foods are not subject to the Standard ($0 to $59 million) and replacing bioengineered ingredients with non-bioengineered ingredients ($41 million to $44 million). The RIA estimates annual financial benefits of $190 million to $565 million, mostly attributed to costs avoided: the costs of complying with a patchwork of state laws, which are avoided and by implementation of the federal Standard. The RIA does not anticipate that the new Standard will provide any benefits to human health or the environment.", "Key provisions of the Standard, along with associated issues raised by stakeholders, are identified below within three categories: (1) applicability, (2) disclosure options, and (3) administrative provisions.

Other groups contend that the Standard's language is precise.", "Gene editing and n ew genetic technologies. The Standard's definition of bioengineered food does not identify specific technologies used to create such foods. AMS states that the Standard's definition \"focuses primarily on the products of technology, not the technology itself.\" During rulemaking, some stakeholders had called for the Standard to explicitly address the status of foods derived from new genetic technologies that may not meet the statutory definition of bioengineering . For example, foods derived from gene editing may not meet the statutory definition of bioengineering if (a) they do not contain recombinant DNA or (b) AMS considers that that their modifications could be achieved through conventional breeding or found in nature. Other new genetic technologies may arise that do not meet the Standard's definition of bioengineering for these or other reasons.", "Because the Standard does not address specific technologies, consumers and regulated entities may lack clarity about whether or not foods derived from new genetic technologies must be disclosed under the Standard. In the absence of this information, many have interpreted the bioengineering definition as broadly excluding foods derived from gene editing. Under this interpretation, gene-edited foods would not require disclosure. Other interpretations of the Standard simply note that the final rule does not explicitly address gene editing or other new genetic technologies. Advocates of stricter GE labeling requirements contend that even though gene-edited foods seem to be excluded from the Standard's definition of bio engineering , such foods meet the common understanding of genetic engineering and therefore should be required to bear disclosures.", "R efined foods exclusion. The Standard excludes refined food products that do not contain detectable amounts of modified DNA from required disclosure. Food without detectable modified genetic material does not meet the statutory definition of bioengineered . Examples include soybean oil, canola oil, and refined sugar. The Standard does not require regulated entities to test every product for the presence of detectable modified genetic material. Rather, manufacturers, importers, and retailers can demonstrate the absence of modified genetic material with records of a validated refining process. Some groups that favor a more expansive definition of bioengineered foods argue that consumers want to know whether the foods they eat derive from GE plants and animals, and thus the Standard should have required disclosures for these refined foods. In contrast, some industry groups, including the Consumer Brands Association (formerly the Grocery Manufacturers Association), commended the Standard for providing regulated entities with the option to voluntarily disclose such foods if desired.", "Disclosure threshold. The Standard does not require disclosures for foods with up to 5% presence, per ingredient, of unintentional or technically unavoidable bioengineered substances. In comparison, the European Union applies a threshold of 0.9% per ingredient, and Australia and New Zealand use a threshold of 1% per ingredient. Foods in Japan must be labeled if a GE ingredient is among the top three ingredients and accounts for more 5% of the total product by weight. AMS selected the 5% threshold for the Standard to \"appropriately balance providing disclosure to consumers with the realities of the food supply chain.\" Some advocates of stricter GE labeling, such as OTA, argue that the threshold in the Standard is too high and is \"inconsistent with accepted private standards, most of our major global trading partners and unacceptable to consumers.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Disclosure Options", "paragraphs": ["The Standard identifies permissible options for on-package disclosure of bioengineered foods.

The entity may then request a hearing if it objects to the findings.

Before release of the Standard, advocates of strict GE labeling had called for an early start to the mandatory compliance period. However, some industry groups supported the delay of mandatory compliance, citing the need to allow sufficient time for regulated entities to adjust labels and recordkeeping procedures.

State-level approaches to GE labeling predated the federal 2016 Act. These were driven by public interest in knowing the GE status of their foods. In addition, some private and federal voluntary labeling programs that provide information on the GE status of foods are expected to continue after implementation of the Standard. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Opinion and State-Level GE Labeling Before the Standard", "paragraphs": ["When foods containing GE ingredients were first introduced in the 1990s, some members of the public called for banning them based on concerns about potential harm to human health. Research has repeatedly found no difference between foods developed with and without genetic engineering, in terms of the health and safety of the people consuming them.", "Even so, some consumers remain concerned about genetic engineering, citing health, personal preference, religious, economic system, and other objections. Moving on from calls to ban GE foods for human health reasons, many consumers began to demand a government role in making GE foods easily identifiable via GE labeling. Before establishment of the Standard, some surveys reported that the majority of consumers wanted GE foods to be labeled. Various proposed GE labeling laws and initiatives at the state and federal levels provided for mandatory or voluntary labeling. Mandatory labeling requires companies to disclose the presence of GE ingredients. Voluntary labeling can allow companies to certify the absence of GE ingredients (as discussed in \" Continuing Voluntary Labeling Programs and GE-Absence Claims \") or to disclose the presence of GE ingredients.", "The 2016 Act preempted state laws and initiatives and instituted mandatory labeling of the presence of GE ingredients in foods. In the years preceding the introduction and passage of the 2016 Act, state laws and ballot initiatives on GE labeling began to proliferate. In 2014, Vermont became the first state to enact a mandatory GE labeling law, with an effective date of July 1, 2016. Other states enacted similar laws, while others still considered similar legislation or voted on state ballot initiatives. Michigan and North Dakota enacted legislation urging the U.S. Congress to pass a uniform GE labeling standard. ", "Most GE labeling proponents strongly supported mandatory labeling standards, citing consumers' right to know, even if safety were not an issue. Some GE labeling opponents argued that no scientific basis existed for requiring mandatory GE labeling, and that such labeling may unnecessarily introduce doubt about the quality or safety of labeled foods and could cause costly and unnecessary market disruption. Before the 2016 Act, some GE labeling proponents and opponents called for a federal law to preempt development of an uncertain and confusing patchwork of state laws with different GE labeling requirements.", "In the absence of federal legislation in 2015, USDA experimented with adapting an existing voluntary USDA labeling program to meet consumer and producer interests in GE labeling. That year, AMS used its Process Verified Program (PVP) to certify the absence of GE ingredients in food products from a single company, which had requested this service. Some anticipated that this would lead to a voluntary USDA program to certify the absence of GE ingredients in foods. GE-labeling proponents responded that, although this would be a step in the right direction, a voluntary program would fail to meet consumer demands, and only mandatory labeling would do so. This application of PVP to certify the absence of GE ingredients in foods did not expand beyond a single company. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continuing Voluntary Labeling Programs and GE-Absence Claims", "paragraphs": ["Voluntary labeling programs that identify the absence of GE ingredients predate legislation to require mandatory labels on foods that contain GE ingredients. On-package symbols from these private and public-private programs indicate to consumers that foods do not contain GE ingredients. They may either make a direct GE-absence claim (certifying that the food does not contain GE ingredients) or indicate that the food was produced with processes that do not include genetic engineering (e.g., certified organic production methods). Food producers and manufacturers may choose to opt into these programs and to bear associated costs. ", "One example is the Non-GMO Project, which a non-profit organization manages to provide third-party verification for processed foods that do not contain GE ingredients. Companies sign agreements with the Non-GMO Project to have their processes reviewed and to have any high-risk products tested by third-party laboratories. Once the Non-GMO Project verifies a company's processes and products, the company can display the Non-GMO Project Verified symbol on its food packaging. This symbol on food packaging makes a GE-absence claim.", "Another example is the USDA National Organic Program (NOP), a public-private program for voluntary labeling that, among other things, indicates the absence of GE ingredients. NOP, which is administered by AMS, certifies that agricultural products have been produced using approved organic methods listed in statute. Genetic engineering is an excluded method: NOP-certified products may not be produced or handled with genetic engineering. The NOP symbol indicates that a food meets diverse criteria, including production methods that exclude genetic engineering. ", "These voluntary labeling programs are expected to continue after implementation of the Standard. They differ from the Standard's voluntary disclosure option , which permits voluntary disclosure of foods that derive from bioengineering yet no longer have the characteristics of bioengineered foods, and is discussed in this report's section on \" Voluntary Disclosure .\" The voluntary labeling programs provide opportunities to identify foods that affirmatively do not derive from bioengineering. The Standard does not address GE-absence claims, and the final rule states that FDA (and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, depending on the food at issue) \"retain authority over absence claims.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Select Considerations for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Implementation of the Standard over the next two years and beyond will affect consumers, regulated entities, and AMS. Many potential issues arising from the Standard will become clear only as implementation continues. The below text summarizes potential and stated concerns related to applicability, disclosure options, administrative provisions, and other issues. Congress may choose to monitor the new Standard's implementation in accordance with its oversight responsibilities.", "A key question for Congress is whether AMS's implementation of the 2016 Act meets congressional intent regarding the scope of applicability and the degree of disclosure required. In the final rule, AMS asserted that it balanced flexibility for regulated entities and information to consumers regarding the bioengineered status of their foods. Stakeholders who question AMS's decisions in the rulemaking process, as described above, may question the extent to which AMS's implementation aligns with congressional intent.", "Applicability. Groups that have criticized the definition of bioengineered in the 2016 Act may call on Congress to amend the definition to include highly refined products derived from GE organisms and/or include products that do not meet the current definition, such as those derived from gene editing and other new technologies. Other interested groups may continue to advocate for a definition that restricts the number and types of foods to which the definition applies. ", "AMS has committed to maintaining and updating the List through annual public reviews, and on an interim basis as needed. Such reviews can provide opportunities to add to the List any bioengineered food products that have entered commerce. Additionally, during these reviews, stakeholders with differing views may encourage the agency to adopt either a more expansive or a more restrictive listing of bioengineered foods. ", "Disclosure. Another issue in the context of disclosure is the degree of familiarity with the required labels that consumers may have. Consumers unfamiliar with the term bioengineered may have questions about what this means on foods bearing disclosure. Public reaction to implementation of the various types of disclosure may generate calls for these options to be revised based on their success or failure to provide consumers with easily accessible and useful information. ", "Administrative provisions. An issue for potential consideration is the extent to which additional federal resources will be required to implement the Standard in both the voluntary and mandatory compliance periods. In its regulatory impact analysis (RIA), AMS broadly estimated that it may need $2 million annually to implement the Standard, without differentiating potential expenses during the voluntary and mandatory compliance periods. AMS proposed that it would use such funds to update the List; conduct audits and hearings; manage complaints and inquiries; and provide training, education, outreach and programmatic support. ", "AMS may need to assign staff and develop new processes to implement the Standard's provisions related to audits, examinations, hearings, and publications of findings. Congress may be asked to consider allocating new resources to support continued implementation of the new Standard. ", "In addition, Congress may assess the cost and administrative overhead that regulated entities expend to identify and maintain records on foods subject to disclosure and to adjust labels on food packaging. Estimates for administrative costs to regulated entities, which AMS presents in its RIA, range from a lower bound of $459 million to an upper bound of nearly $3.6 billion for the first year. AMS anticipates that these costs will greatly reduce in subsequent years as potentially regulated entities replace bioengineered ingredients with non-bioengineered ingredients. ", "Regarding enforcement, the rule largely relies on a public notification mechanism to influence the compliance of regulated entities and correct violations of the Standard. Stakeholders may or may not view this mechanism as successful, depending on the extent and frequency of any such violations. Interested parties may petition Congress to strengthen existing enforcement mechanisms or identify new ones to enhance compliance with the new Standard.", "Market demand for bioengineered versus non-bioengineered products . In the RIA, AMS indicates that it cannot accurately predict how consumers will react to bioengineered disclosures on food labels. Consumers may avoid foods labeled as bioengineered, they may prefer them, or such labels may make no difference to consumer purchasing behaviors. In the RIA, AMS assumes that manufacturers will avoid labeling 20% of their products as bioengineered, by replacing bioengineered with non-bioengineered ingredients, due to potential consumer reactions. AMS selected 20% for purposes of estimating costs and benefits in the RIA following consideration of existing studies and surveys of consumer behavior and consideration of the requirements of the Standard. Depending on how consumers respond, implementation of the Standard may influence manufacturer and retailer demand for bioengineered and non-bioengineered foods. Congress may respond to stakeholder concerns about any market shifts resulting from the Standard. ", "Interactions with international trade. Unexpected issues may arise as implementation begins. For example, AMS states that it does not expect the Standard to impact foreign trade. However, it also notes that the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service is prepared to work closely with foreign countries that export food and agricultural products to the United States, to facilitate their understanding of the Standard. If trade issues arise, Congress may choose to address harmonization of labeling requirements with foreign trading partners by amending applicability, disclosure, or administrative requirements in the 2016 Act, or by other means."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
