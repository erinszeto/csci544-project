These coins are legal tender that celebrate and honor American people, places, events, and institutions. Overall, 152 commemorative coins have been authorized since 1892. Since 1982, when Congress reinstituted the commemorative program, 91 commemorative coins have been authorized. Since 1998, only two coins may be authorized for any given year. To date, Congress has authorized commemorative coins to be issued through 2020.", "The issuance of commemorative coins can be broadly divided into two eras: historical coins and modern coins. Historical commemorative coins were those authorized between 1892 and 1954 and generally celebrated anniversaries, public events, or the construction of new memorials. These coins were sold by the government to the sponsor organization, which then resold the coins to the public at a higher price to earn money to support their mission.", "In 1939, Congress stopped authorizing new coins because a glut of commemorative coins on the market had caused their value to decline, and the U.S. Treasury became concerned that so many coins might facilitate counterfeiting. These sentiments were echoed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who in 1954 vetoed legislation for a half-dollar honoring the tercentennial of New York City and remarked that \"large quantities [of coins] have remained unsold and have been returned to the mints for melting.\" The historical era concluded with the minting of George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington half-dollars between 1951 and 1954.", "The modern commemorative coin era began in 1982, when Congress authorized coins to celebrate the 250th anniversary of George Washington's birth. Between 1982 and 1997, prior to the Commemorative Coin Reform Act (CCRA) of 1996's statutory limitation of two commemorative coins issued per year, 47 commemorative coins were authorized and minted. Between 1998 and 2018, an additional 41 coins were authorized and minted. Three additional coins have been authorized, two in 2019 and one in 2020 (to date).", "Commemorative coin legislation generally has a specific format. Once a coin is authorized, it follows a specific process for design and minting. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coin Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a coin's design. Following the conclusion of a coin program, designated recipient organizations may receive surcharge payments, once the U.S. Mint has recouped all costs associated with producing the coin.", "Should Congress want to make changes to the commemorative coin process, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to which people, places, events, or institutions should be celebrated; which groups should receive potential surcharge payments; and any specific design requirements Congress might want to request or require.

On the other hand, if Congress's intent for a coin is to recognize a person, place, event, or institution, then smaller sales numbers might not factor into legislative decisionmaking. Some commemorations inherently have broader appeal than others and the sale of commemorative coins often reflects the popularity of a particular person, place, event, or institution to coin collectors and the broader general public. ", "To potentially maximize the appeal and sale of commemorative coins to support designated recipient organizations, Congress might consider whether the people, places, events, or institutions to be commemorated have a broad appeal and whether design elements might be specified that would make the coin more appealing to the general public. For example, the 1986 Statue of Liberty commemorative coin (shown in Figure 2 ) sold over 15 million units, while other coins have sold as few as approximately 40,000. For a designated recipient organization to earn surcharges, the U.S. Mint's production costs must be recouped before payments can be made. As a result, coins that sell out of statutory allotments are more likely to generate significant surcharges than those that struggle to find a market beyond commemorative coin collectors.", "Similarly, on at least three occasions, Congress has provided specific requirements to the U.S. Mint on the design of commemorative coins\u2014that the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame coin be curved to represent a baseball; that the 2018 National Breast Cancer Awareness coin be tinted pink, to reflect the color associated with breast cancer awareness efforts; and that the 2019 Apollo 11 50 th Anniversary coin be convex to resemble an astronaut's helmet. Evidence from the coin collecting community suggests that a coin with unique design features may be more attractive for coin collectors and noncollectors alike. For example, a coin-collecting publication reported that the National Baseball Hall of Fame coin was so popular that the U.S. Mint had difficulty meeting demand for orders, especially because it was the \"first U.S. coin to utilize this [curved or dish design] production method and with a baseball theme, [it] ended up being a homerun with collectors.\" ", "The goal of commemorative coins is twofold: to commemorate a person, place, event, or institution and to provide surcharges to groups. As Congress considers future commemorative coins, the ability to appeal to broad segments of the population to purchase coins in support of designated recipient groups might be a consideration. If Congress considers what people, places, events, or institutions might be honored and the coins' designs, the commemorative coin program could create innovative designs that raise significant monies for designated recipient groups. Since not all people, places, events, or institutions have the same appeal to the general public, consideration of which might be the best subject of commemorative coins would ensure that the U.S. Mint dedicates its resources to coins that are more likely to sell out authorized allotments and provide maximum surcharge payments. Alternatively, Congress could recognize important people, places, events, or institutions with a coin without consideration of the potential surcharges. In this case, historically important people, places, events, or institutions could be recognized by the United States regardless of potential amounts raised for these groups.", "Appendix A. Historical Commemorative Coins", "Between 1892 and 1954, 60 commemorative coins were authorized by Congress. Table A-1 provides a list of these coins organized by the year in which they were struck by the mint. The table also includes the type of coin, the subject, and the authorization statute.", "Appendix B. Modern Commemorative Coins, 1982-1997", "Between 1982 and 1997, 47 commemorative coins were authorized by Congress. Table B-1 provides a list of these coins organized by the year in which they were struck by the Mint. The table also includes the coin's subject and authorizing statute. Coin denominations are not provided for modern commemorative coins because authorizing legislation generally provides for more than one denomination per commemorative coin series."], "subsections": []}]}}
