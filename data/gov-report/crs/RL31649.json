The Secretary of Health and Human Services issued the specified declaration, making it effective as of January 24, 2003.", "The reason that the provision just quoted immunizes covered persons from tort liability is that it deems such persons to be employees of the Public Health Service for tort liability purposes. The Public Health Service is a federal agency, and the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) makes all federal employees immune from liability for torts they commit within the scope of their employment. They are immune, that is, from liability under state tort law; they may be held liable for violating the U.S. Constitution or a federal statute that authorizes them to be sued.", "At the same time that the FTCA immunizes federal employees (and those deemed federal employees for liability purposes) from liability for torts they commit within the scope of their employment, it makes the United States government liable for such torts, under the law of the state where the tort occurred, in the same manner that private employers are generally liable for the torts of their employees. The FTCA, however, does not permit awards of punitive damages, and does not allow jury trials. It also contains exceptions under which the United States may not be held liable even though a private employer in the same situation could be held liable under state law. Even when one of these exceptions precludes the United States from being held liable, the FTCA continues to immunize federal employees from liability for torts they commit within the scope of their employment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "No Strict Liability", "paragraphs": ["The exceptions under which the United States may not be held liable include suits by military personnel for injuries sustained incident to service (the Feres doctrine), suits based on the performance of a discretionary function (i.e., a policy judgment), suits for assault or battery or specified other intentional torts, claims arising out of combatant activities, claims arising in foreign countries, and others.", "For present purposes, however, the FTCA's most significant exception to federal government liability is that the United States may not be held liable in accordance with state law imposing strict liability. Strict liability means liability regardless of negligence, and manufacturers and sellers of defective products, including vaccines, may be held strictly liable under state law. A product may be found defective under state law not only when it was defectively manufactured, but when it was defectively designed in the sense that it feasibly could have been designed to be safer, or when a warning that might have prevented injury was not provided. The fact that the FTCA does not permit strict liability apparently means that, under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the government will not be liable for injuries caused by a smallpox vaccine unless the plaintiff proves that the vaccine manufacturer or other \"covered person\" had been negligent, in which case the government may be held liable, if no other exceptions in the FTCA preclude liability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Other Features of Section 304", "paragraphs": ["Section 304 also provides that the United States may be held liable for injuries caused by a smallpox vaccine only if the vaccine was administered by a \"qualified person\" (a person authorized by state law to administer the vaccine) during the effective period of a declaration of a public health emergency by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and only if the person receiving the vaccine \"was within the category of individuals covered by the declaration\" or the person administering the vaccine \"had reasonable grounds to believe\" he was.", "If a person who did not receive the vaccine contracts vaccinia (the smallpox virus), and resides with an individual who did receive the vaccine, then he shall be \"rebuttably presumed\" to have contracted vaccinia from the individual who received the vaccine. This means that, unless the government proves that the person who did not receive the vaccine contracted vaccinia from a source other than the individual who did receive the vaccine, the person who contracted vaccinia may sue the government as if he had contracted vaccinia from the vaccine."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Sellers of Anti-Terrorism Technologies: The SAFETY Act", "paragraphs": ["Section 863 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, titled \"Litigation Management\" is part of the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002, or the SAFETY Act. Section 863 created a federal cause of action against sellers of anti-terrorism technologies for claims arising out of \"an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such an act ....\" Prior to enactment of this section, suits against sellers of qualified anti-terrorism technology would have been brought under state law, but the new federal cause of action apparently precludes suits from being brought under state law. Under the new federal cause of action, liability against qualified sellers of anti-terrorism technologies is more limited than it generally is under state law. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine whether an anti-terrorism technology qualifies for liability protection, and shall place each technology that does on an \"Approved Product List for Homeland Security\" and issue it a \"certificate of conformance.\" The Department of Homeland Security issued a proposed rule to implement the SAFETY Act, then an interim rule, which took effect on October 16, 2003, and then a final rule, which took effect July 10, 2006.", "Under the new federal cause of action, the substantive (as opposed to procedural) law that governs liability is the law of the state in which the acts of terrorism occur, except for the federal liability limitations discussed below. The significance of creating a federal cause of action is that suits may be brought in federal court regardless of the domicile of the parties and regardless of the amount of damages that the plaintiff seeks. In fact, section 863 requires that suits be brought in federal court; though federal causes of action generally may also be brought in state court, this particular cause of action may not be, as section 863 provides that the \"appropriate federal district court\" shall have \"exclusive jurisdiction.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Exceptions to the Application of State Law", "paragraphs": ["Although the substantive law of the state in which the acts of terrorism occur governs the new federal cause of action, section 863 prescribes some rules that preempt state law.", "Section 863 prohibits awards of punitive damages and of interest prior to judgment. Section 863 prohibits joint and several liability for noneconomic damages. Noneconomic damages are damages for pain and suffering and other losses that do not constitute monetary expenses, such as medical bills and lost wages. Joint and several liability is the rule that, if more than one defendant is found liable for a plaintiff's injuries, then each defendant may be held 100 percent liable. (The plaintiff may not recover more than once, but he may recover all his damages from one defendant, with that defendant then entitled to seek contribution from other liable defendants.) The reason for joint and several liability is that the common law viewed it as preferable for a wrongdoer to pay more than his share of the damages than for an injured plaintiff to recover less than the full compensation to which he is entitled. Under section 863, in lieu of joint and several liability for noneconomic damages, \"[n]oneconomic damages may be awarded against a defendant only in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of responsibility for the harm to the plaintiff.\" Joint and several liability will continue to apply to economic damages, except when state law provides otherwise. Section 863 eliminates the collateral source rule. This is the rule that allows an injured party to recover damages from the defendant even if he is also entitled to receive them from a third party (a \"collateral source\"), such as a health insurance company or an employer. The collateral source rule may allow double recovery for the plaintiff, but the common law viewed it as better for the victim than for the wrongdoer to profit from the victim's prudence (as in buying health insurance) or good fortune (in having some other collateral source available). Section 863 provides: \"Any recovery by a plaintiff .... shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation, if any, that the plaintiff has received or is entitled to receive....\" Section 863 permits the government contractor defense. This is a defense, created by the Supreme Court pursuant to \"federal common law,\" that product manufacturers may use in products liability cases that allege a design defect or a failure to warn. These are cases, brought under state law, in which the plaintiff alleges that his injuries were caused by a product that was defective in that the manufacturer failed to use the safest feasible design for the product or failed to provide adequate warnings of a product hazard that could not be eliminated by a feasible safer design. In its defense, the manufacturer may assert that it manufactured the product pursuant to a government contract and that the design or warning it used was required by contract specifications. When it successfully asserts this defense, it may not be held liable. Under section 863, however, as interpreted by the Department of Homeland Security, \"[s]ellers of qualified anti-terrorism technologies need not design their technologies to federal government specifications in order to obtain the government contractor defense under the SAFETY Act. Instead, the Act sets forth criteria for the Department's Certification of technologies [that are eligible for the defense].\"", "Under section 863, that is, the government contractor defense would be available \"when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary\" have been deployed, and \"[t]he Secretary will be exclusively responsible for the review and approval of anti-terrorism technology for purposes of establishing a government contractor defense .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" This indicates that the Secretary's approval of anti-terrorism technology for purposes of establishing a government contractor defense is separate from his determination that anti-terrorism technology qualifies to be subject to suit under section 863 instead of under state law.", "Section 863(d) provides:", "Should a product liability or other lawsuit be filed ... relating to ... qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary ... there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the government contractor defense applies in such a lawsuit. This presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in submitting information to the Secretary ... This presumption of the government contractor defense shall apply regardless of whether the claim against the Seller arises from a sale of the product to Federal Government or non-Federal Government customers.\"", "On its face, this language seems to immunize government contractors from liability for injuries caused by defects that were not necessarily required by contract specifications, including defects that were not even design defects but that occurred in the manufacturing process. In other words, it appears to provide immunity to sellers in all cases in which the seller did not engage in the specified fraud or misconduct. One might argue, however, that, when section 863 says that \"the government contractor defense applies,\" it means only that it applies in the general circumstance in which it ordinarily applies, namely in design defect cases in which the defendant followed government contract specifications. The Department of Homeland Security apparently takes this position when it states that, except when the presumption in favor of the government contract is rebutted, it is \"clear that any Seller of an 'approved' technology cannot be held liable under the Act for design defects or failure to warn claims.... The Department believes that Congress incorporated the Supreme Court's Boyle line of cases as it existed on the date of enactment of the SAFETY Act, rather than incorporating future developments of the government contractor defense in the courts.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Liability Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Section 864(a) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 provides that sellers of anti-terrorism technology to federal and non-federal government customers must obtain liability insurance in such amounts as the Secretary shall require, and such insurance shall protect, in addition to the seller, \"contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, vendors and customers of the Seller,\" and \"contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors of the customer.\" Section 864(b) provides that \"[t]he Seller shall enter into a reciprocal waiver of claims with its contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, vendors and customers, and contractors and subcontractors of the customers ... under which each party to the waiver agrees to be responsible for the losses ... that it sustains ....\" Section 864(c) provides that a seller's liability shall be limited to the amount of liability insurance coverage that it is required to maintain under section 864(a)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Air Transportation Security Companies", "paragraphs": ["Section 890 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 limits the liability of air transportation security companies and their affiliates for claims arising from the September 11, 2001, air crashes.
