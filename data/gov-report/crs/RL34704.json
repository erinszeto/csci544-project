It makes significant changes to federal funding for child welfare programs, which include authorizing new federal support for states that provide kinship guardianship assistance to eligible children leaving foster care; expanding eligibility for federal adoption assistance (by phasing out, over FY2010-FY2018, income and other eligibility criteria that are based on dated cash welfare program rules); extending, as of FY2011, eligibility for federal foster care assistance to youth who remain in care beyond their 18th birthday, up to age 21; and phasing in additional support to states for child welfare related training. Additionally, the bill authorizes tribal child welfare agencies, as of FY2010, to directly access federal funds for foster care, adoption, and guardianship assistance under the Title IV-E program, provided the tribes meet substantially the same requirements made of states.

The 1980 law also stipulated that to be eligible for federal adoption assistance a child must either be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or have been removed from the home of birth parents in which he or she met the income and other eligibility criteria of the federal cash welfare program (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC). AFDC was repealed in 1996 by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA, P.L. 104-193 ).

These changes include fixing each state's baseline adoption numbers at the numbers achieved in FY2007 and allowing (provided sufficient appropriations) a new incentive payment for states that increase the rate of children adopted from foster care. To earn an award for an increased rate of adoptions, the state must increase the share of children adopted out of its foster care caseload (that is its foster child adoption rate) above the highest such rate it previously achieved, in any year, beginning with FY2002 and ending with the year just prior to the award year. The amount of the award is $1,000 times the increased number of adoptions achieved by the state that are attributed to the increased adoption rate.

Accordingly, federal child welfare policy has long focused on ways to better achieve and ensure them. Notably, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-272 ) recognized the critical need for permanence by providing new incentives for case planning for each child in foster care and by authorizing federal support for adoption assistance to children leaving foster care. Further, more than a decade ago, ASFA ( P.L. 105-89 ) asserted the primacy of safety in all child welfare decisions and reinvigorated attention to permanence for children in foster care by establishing new case planning and case review timetables and requirements, and by establishing the Adoption Incentives program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Direct Federal Support to Tribal Programs", "paragraphs": ["The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-351 ) seeks to improve the child welfare services and supports available to Indian children by granting tribes (as of FY2010) the same authority that states have to seek federal reimbursement of a part of all their eligible foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship assistance costs. Indian children may currently be eligible for Title IV-E assistance if they are in the care and placement responsibility of a state. However, children under the care and placement responsibility of a tribe may not receive this assistance unless the tribe's responsibility of the child is \"supervised\" by the state via a state-tribal cooperative agreement.

Tribes with an approved Title IV-E plan are to receive this reimbursement rate directly from the federal government. If a tribe has a cooperative agreement or contract with a state to administer Title IV-E payments, that state is to receive reimbursement at the tribal FMAP for the portion of its Title IV-E foster care maintenance, adoption assistance or kinship guardianship assistance payments that are made under the state-tribal agreement or contract. Further, as of FY2010, P.L. 110-351 requires a state to negotiate \"in good faith\" with any eligible tribal entity in the state if that tribal entity requests to enter into an agreement with the state under which the state would provide Title IV-E funds to the tribe for it to administer all or part of the program on behalf of children under tribal authority. A state will similarly be required to negotiate in good faith with any tribal entity in the state that is not receiving a direct federal allotment of Chafee Foster Care Independence Program and/or Education and Training Voucher funds and which requests an agreement or contract that would allow it to receive funds from the state to administer the program(s) on behalf of Indian children under its authority.", "Finally, to help ensure these new provisions result in improved outcomes for Indian children, the bill appropriates $3 million (for FY2009 and every succeeding year) for technical assistance to tribes and states and for implementation grants to tribes that are preparing to submit a Title IV-E plan for approval to HHS. These implementation grants may be worth as much as $300,000. A tribal entity may receive this grant only once and it must agree to submit a Title IV-E plan to HHS for approval no later than 24 months after receiving the grant funding. If the plan is not submitted within 24 months the tribe must repay the entire grant amount.

For purposes of defining the tribal entities that may apply for direct federal Title IV-E funding, generally defines \"Indian tribe\" as any federally recognized tribe and a \"tribal organization\" as the recognized governing body of any such tribe; and describes a tribal consortium as any two or more Indian tribes or tribal organizations that together submit a single Title IV-E plan for approval. With limited and specific exceptions, requires tribes seeking direct federal support under Title IV-E to meet all the requirements of Title IV-E \" in the same manner \" as they must be met by a state receiving these funds. Provides for calculation of a tribe-specific federal matching rate for foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance payments, and kinship guardianship assistance payments (a \"tribal FMAP\"); provides that tribes with an approved Title IV-E plan receive this reimbursement rate directly from the federal government; also provides that if the tribe has a cooperative agreement or contract with a state to administer IV-E payments, the federal government must pay the state the tribal matching rate for the payments made under that agreement. Stipulates that any currently existing cooperative agreement or contract entered into between a tribe and state for the administration or payment of funds under Title IV-E must remain in effect after the enactment of this bill, subject to the right of either party to revoke or modify the terms of the agreement or contract, and, further, that states and tribes may continue to enter into agreements or contracts under Title IV-E.
