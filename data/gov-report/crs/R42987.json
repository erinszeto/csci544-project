The most salient of these proposals would have (1) required background checks for intrastate firearms transfers between unlicensed persons at gun shows and nearly any other venue, otherwise known as the \"universal background checks\" proposal; (2) increased penalties for gun trafficking; and (3) reinstated and strengthened an expired federal ban on detachable ammunition magazines of over 10-round capacity and certain \"military style\" firearms commonly described as \"semiautomatic assault weapons,\" which are designed to accept such magazines.", "On March 21, 2013, Senator Harry Reid introduced the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 (S. 649).

A final vote was not taken on S. 649.", "Although Members of the House of Representatives introduced similar proposals, none were approved by Committee, nor considered on the House floor. On May 8, 2013, however, the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs approved a bill, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 602), that would have addressed veterans, mental incompetency, and firearms eligibility. This bill would have narrowed the grounds by which beneficiaries of veterans' disability compensation or pensions are determined to be ineligible to receive, possess, ship, or transfer a firearm or ammunition because a fiduciary had been appointed on their behalf. The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs approved a nearly identical bill (S. 572) on September 4, 2013.

Nevertheless, the FBI has taken steps to mitigate false positives. In July 2004, DOJ issued a regulation that established the NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF), which is part of the NICS Index (described above). DOJ was prompted to establish the VAF to minimize the inconvenience incurred by some prospective firearms transferees (purchasers) who have names or birth dates similar to those of prohibited persons. So as not to be misidentified in the future, these persons agree to authorize the FBI to maintain personally identifying information about them in the VAF as a means to avoid future delayed transfers.

Two, in 1994, Congress passed the \"Brady Act\" and amended the GCA to require background checks be completed for all unlicensed persons seeking to obtain firearms from FFLs.

The Veterans' Medical Administration has rarely, if ever, submitted any disqualifying records on VA medical care recipients to the FBI for inclusion in NICS for any medical/psychiatric reason (like PTSD). While veterans with PTSD or any other condition, who have been involuntarily committed under a state court order to a VA medical facility because they posed a danger to themselves or others, are ineligible to ship, transport, receive, or possess a firearm or ammunition under federal law, the Veterans' Medical Administration would not make a related referral about that ineligibility to the FBI.

Those VA files accounted for 98.9% of mental defective files (172,481) referred to the FBI by any federal department or agency. In the view of some Members of Congress, it is probably questionable that other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, that provide similar disability and income maintenance benefits to persons who are mentally incapacitated, refer relatively few, if any, firearms-related disqualifying records about beneficiaries whom they serve to the FBI. Moreover, there are other individuals in the U.S. population who are similarly incapacitated due to their age-related infirmities or mental disabilities, but in many cases there are no mechanisms for state or local authorities to make similar referrals to the FBI. As a consequence, even with the changes put in place by P.L. 110-180 , those Members of Congress may view the VA's continued referral of firearms-related disqualifying records on veterans who have had a fiduciary appointed on their behalf, but who had not behaved in a threatening or dangerous manner, to be an unwarranted indignity placed on individuals who had served their country honorably in the Armed\u00a0Forces. ", "Other Members of Congress would maintain that the VA has dutifully complied with the law and that public safety is enhanced by making those referrals to the FBI. They might also argue that opposition to the VA policy waned between November 1998 and the 2007 congressional debate, demonstrating that veterans who were \"adjudicated mental defective\" rarely, if ever, sought to acquire and were subsequently denied firearms in a manner that could be described as an injustice. Those Members would likely underscore that, in their view, the VA's current policy does not diminish national recognition of those veterans' honorable service. Rather, the VA's policy has been implemented to protect those veterans and others from the harm that might result if they acquired a firearm and used it improperly due to reasons possibly related to their mental incompetency.", "During Senate consideration of S. 649 , the GOP substitute amendment would have amended veterans law to prohibit the VA from turning records on veterans or other beneficiaries who had been deemed mentally incompetent to the FBI for inclusion in NICS without \"the order or finding of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction that such person is a danger to himself or herself, or others.\" Similar language was included in the Manchin-Toomey amendment. And, Senator Richard Burr offered a similar amendment ( S.Amdt. 720 ), but the Senate rejected it by a yea-nay vote: 56-44 (roll call vote no. 102). On May 8, 2013, however, the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs approved by voice vote a bill\u2014the Veterans 2 nd Amendment Protection Act ( H.R. 602 )\u2014that included similar provisions.

Therefore, it follows that the entire GCA is arguably a statutory framework designed to combat gun trafficking domestically, particularly interstate gun trafficking.

Gun trafficking cases include, but are not limited to, the following activities:", "straw purchasers or straw purchasing rings; trafficking in firearms by corrupt federally licensed gun dealers; trafficking in firearms by unlicensed dealers (i.e., persons who deal in firearms illegally as the principal source of their livelihood); trafficking in stolen firearms; and trafficking of secondhand firearms acquired from unlicensed persons at gun shows, flea markets, and other private venues.", "Unlike other forms of contraband, almost all illegal firearms used criminally in the United States were diverted at some point from legal channels of commerce.

Despite its crime-fighting mission, ATF's business relationships with the firearms industry and larger gun-owning community have been a perennial source of tension, which from time to time has been the subject of congressional oversight. Nevertheless, under current law, ATF Special Agents (SAs) and Industry Operations Investigators (IOIs) are authorized to inspect or examine the inventory and records of an FFL without search warrants under three scenarios:", "in the course of a reasonable inquiry during the course of a criminal investigation of a person or persons other than the FFL; to ensure compliance with the record keeping requirements of the GCA\u2014not more than once during any 12-month period, or at any time with respect to records relating to a firearm involved in a criminal investigation that is traced to the licensee; or when such an inspection or examination is required for determining the disposition of one or more firearms in the course of a criminal investigation.", "By inspecting the firearms transfer records that FFLs are required by law to maintain, ATF SAs and IOIs are able to trace crime guns from their domestic manufacturer or importer to the first retail dealer that sold those firearms to persons in the general public, generating vital leads in homicide and other criminal investigations. In addition, by inspecting those records, ATF investigators sometimes discover evidence of corrupt FFLs dealing in firearms \"off the books,\" straw purchases, and other patterns of illegal behavior. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Anatomy of a Firearms Straw Purchase", "paragraphs": ["A \"straw purchase\" occurs when an individual poses as the actual transferee, but he is actually acquiring the firearm for another person. In effect, he serves as an illegal middleman. As part of any firearms transfer from an FFL to a private person, the GCA requires them to fill out jointly an ATF Form 4473. In addition, the FFL is required to verify the purchaser's name, address, date of birth, and other information by examining a government-issued piece of identification, most often a driver's license. Among other things, the purchaser attests on the ATF Form 4473 that he is not a prohibited person, and that he is the \"actual transferee/buyer.\" Hence, straw purchases are known as \"lying and buying for the other guy.\" Straw purchases are illegal under two provisions of the GCA.", "If the purchaser makes any false statement to a FFL with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of a prospective firearms transfer, it is a federal offense punishable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(a)(6). This provision also captures misrepresentations such as presenting false identity documents. Violations are punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7924(a)(2). ", "It is also illegal for any person knowingly to make any false statement with respect to the records that FFLs are required to maintain under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). This provision, however, also captures misrepresentations related to licensure and other benefits under the GCA. Violations are punishable by up to five years of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7924(a)(1)(D).", "Straw purchases, however, are not easily detected, because their illegality only becomes apparent when the straw purchaser's true intent is revealed by a subsequent transfer to the actual buyer (third party). In many cases, the actual buyer may be a prohibited person, who would not pass a background check. Under such a scenario, if the straw purchaser knew or had reasonable cause to know the actual transferee was a prohibited person, he would also be in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 922(d), for which the penalty is up to 10 years of imprisonment. It would also be a violation for the prohibited person to possess or receive the firearm under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g), for which the penalty is also up to 10 years of imprisonment. ", "Alternatively, the actual buyer may not be a prohibited person, but may be seeking to acquire firearms without any paper trail linking him to the acquisition of the firearm. Under such a scenario, however, the straw purchase and subsequent illegal transfer would be even less apparent for several reasons. Under federal law, it is legal for an unlicensed, private person to purchase firearms and then resell them or give them away, as long as the", "transferees are not prohibited or underage persons; transferors do not deal in firearms in a volume that would require licensing; and transfers are intrastate , as generally only federally licensed gun dealers can legally transfer firearms interstate .", "Hence, individuals may buy several firearms at a time with the intention of giving those firearms away as presents to anyone, as long as they do not present those firearms to persons who are underage, out-of-state residents, or prohibited persons. They may also buy firearms and, then, sell those firearms at any time, as long as selling firearms is not the principal objective of their livelihood and profit, in which case they would be required to be federally licensed to deal in firearms. Furthermore, no federal background checks are required for recipients of subsequent intrastate firearms transfers.", "On the other hand, if the suspected straw purchaser were observed departing the licensed gun dealer's place of business and traveling immediately to another locale, where he transferred the firearm(s) to another person, there would be a reasonable suspicion that he was a straw purchaser. However, the actual buyer would not have committed a crime unless it could be proven that he had sponsored the straw purchase. Usually, such illegal arrangements become clear when the straw purchaser is interviewed by agents and admits to having bought the firearms for the third party, non-prohibited person. Moreover, depending on the time that elapses between the initial straw purchases and subsequent transfers to the actual buyer (third party), the illegality of the transfers may not become apparent until the actual buyer's true intent is revealed, when he either transports those firearms across state lines to be sold or bartered, attempts to smuggle them across an international border, or engages in some other illegal act. ", "Sometimes, the behavior of the prospective transferee (straw purchaser) may raise reasonable suspicions. For example, during a controversial ATF Phoenix-based investigation known as \"Operation Fast and Furious,\" several of the individuals under indictment made multiple purchases from the same FFL of multiple semiautomatic firearms. Raising suspicions further, they paid for these firearms with thousands of dollars in cash. Indeed, FFLs contacted ATF about these suspicious transfers, prompting the investigation. They did so, in part, because they realized that these firearms might be traced back to their businesses and they probably wanted to avoid any negative attention that those traces might bring back on them. It is notable that if an FFL believes a firearms transfer to be suspicious, he may choose not to sell those firearms to the individuals in question. If he should proceed with the transfer, however, as long as he had conducted the required criminal background check on the prospective buyer, and he and the prospective buyer had filled out the proper paperwork, his obligations under federal law would have been fulfilled. ", "In summation, with regard to interstate transfers, it is unlawful for any person who is not federally licensed to deal in firearms to transport or receive a firearm into his own state of residence that was obtained in another state. In addition, it is unlawful for any person who is not federally licensed to deal in firearms to deliver a firearm to another unlicensed person who resides in a state other than the transferor's state of residence. Violations of either provision are punishable by a fine and/or not more than five years of imprisonment. It is also unlawful to smuggle firearms, or any other merchandise contrary to U.S. law from the United States.

And, large-scale straw purchasing schemes were at the center of several ATF Phoenix-based gun trafficking investigations, including Operation Fast and Furious. Contributing to the controversy surrounding Operation Fast and Furious, reportedly, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona was reluctant to prosecute straw purchasing cases, even though ATF conducted several investigations involving dozens of firearms and multiple defendants from 2006 through 2010. Some of this reluctance to prosecute referred cases may have stemmed from legal interpretations (and underlying case law) made by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona that \"differed substantially from those of other U.S. Attorney's Offices.\" Other considerations could have included allocation of scarce resources and prosecutorial priorities. Nonetheless, as shown below, federal prosecutions for straw purchasing and related offenses nationally appear to have fallen off significantly in recent years, despite congressional efforts to increase ATF appropriations to combat gun trafficking.

Congress has also considered related proposals to (1) require agencies that manage federal public lands to facilitate access to and use of those lands for the purposes of recreational fishing, hunting, and shooting with certain exceptions set out in statute (e.g., national security, public safety, or resource conservation); and (2) prohibit the Secretary of the Army from banning individuals from firearms possession, including an assembled or functional firearm, while traveling through or visiting water resources development projects (e.g., reservoirs at Corps-operated dams and inland waterways) managed by the Army Corps of Engineers.", "Congress, moreover, has considered other proposals, such as the amendment ( S.Amdt. 719 ) to S. 649 offered by Senator Cornyn, which would have mandated an increased level of reciprocity among states that have laws that allow civilians to carry handguns in a concealed fashion. However, under a unanimous consent agreement that required a 60-vote threshold for passage, the Senate rejected this amendment by a yea-nay vote: 57-43 (roll call vote no. 100).", "As background, 38 states (most recently Wisconsin) have \"shall issue\" concealed carry laws, meaning permits are issued to all eligible applicants. Ten states have more restrictive \"may issue\" laws, meaning state and/or local authorities have discretion whether to issue permits. In those states, applicants usually must demonstrate a need to carry a concealed handgun to the authorities. At one end of the spectrum, Alaska, Arizona, Wyoming, and Vermont allow concealed carry without a permit. At the other end, Illinois and the District of Columbia allow no concealed carry of firearms by civilians. With regard to interstate reciprocity, a handful of states have \"recognition\" statutes that recognize any state-issued concealed carry permit. Other states have \"open\" statutes that allow any resident of the United States, without regard to state residency, to apply for a concealed carry permit. Still other states have \"hybrid\" statutes that include elements of both the recognition and open statutes. Contiguous \"shall issue\" states often extend reciprocity to one another. However, some \"shall issue\" states have opted not to extend reciprocity to other \"shall issue\" states for a variety of reasons, even though they might have extended reciprocity to arguably more restrictive \"may issue\" states. The end result is a complicated array of state laws that arguably makes it challenging for an individual to discern his legal ability to carry a concealed firearm in another state.", "Under the Cornyn amendment, a permit holder from state A would have been able to travel to state B with a concealed handgun as long as state B had a concealed carry law, no matter which type (\"shall\" or \"may\" issue). The permit holder from state A would have been required to comply with all other laws in state B, with the exception of the laws governing eligibility for and issuance of concealed carry permits. Several issues might have arisen, however. First, the amendment made no allowance for the difference between more permissive \"shall issue\" and more restrictive \"may issue\" state laws. Therefore, the amendment could have been viewed as an imposition by \"shall issue\" states over \"may issue\" states. Depending upon the circumstances, the amendment could have also been viewed as an imposition by some \"shall issue\" states over other \"shall issue\" states, according to differences in their respective concealed carry laws. For example, some \"shall issue\" states have good moral character clauses as part of their eligibility requirements, others do not. Some require \"live fire\" training prior to permit issuance, others do not. Some require a mental health evaluation, others do not. Several states issue permits to persons 18 years of age, while most states require applicants to be 21 years of age.", "Also related to concealed carry, Senator John Barrasso offered an amendment ( S.Amdt. 717 ) that would have required the Attorney General to make a 5% reduction in Community Oriented Policy Services grants to state and local governments that release information on gun owners\u2014particularly concealed carry permit holders. The amendment was adopted by a yea-nay vote: 67-30 (roll call vote no. 104)."], "subsections": []}]}}
