The Senate-passed legislation focuses mostly on authorization of a few discrete federal projects and adds reporting requirements for the Bureau of Reclamation, a water resource agency in the Department of the Interior. The House-passed version of S. 2012 incorporates the text of a larger drought relief bill ( H.R. 2898 ), including language that may alter operations of the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) in California. Some of the House provisions drawn from H.R. 2898 have been controversial and have been opposed by the Administration.", "Title X, Subtitle D of the Senate-passed version of S. 2012 includes several provisions that would affect the authorization and management of federal water projects that are owned and operated by Reclamation. The projects are Fontenelle Reservoir (located on the Green River in Wyoming, part of the Colorado River Storage Project), the Yakima Project (located on the Yakima River in Washington), and the Klamath Project (located on the Klamath River in Oregon). Generally speaking, these sections would authorize study and expansion of Fontenelle Reservoir (\u00a7\u00a710301-10302); study and expansion of the Yakima Project (\u00a7\u00a710321-10325); and efforts aimed at reducing power costs for irrigators receiving water from the Klamath Project. Finally, it would also authorize water resource management changes that are more national in scope, such as a process for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study and implement a pilot program for \"forecast-based\" operations to enhance water supply benefits and flood control operations, and a process by which Reclamation (who operates in the 17 western states) would complete an asset management report containing detailed project-level information on documented repair needs for its infrastructure.", "Division C, Title I of the House-passed version of S. 2012 relates to the authorization and management of Reclamation projects. These provisions were not contained in the Senate-passed version. The House provisions were included in another bill ( H.R. 2898 , the Western Water and American Food Security Act, which was passed by the House on July 17, 2015). Many of these provisions have previously been the subject of congressional debate on drought-related issues in the state of California. ", "The provisions included under Division C, Title I of House-passed S. 2012 draw in their entirety from H.R. 2898 and are organized under 11 subtitles. Several of these subtitles address the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) in California; others address drought and western water management more broadly. Subtitles A-C of House-passed S. 2012 (Title I-III of H.R. 2898 ) address project operations and species protections for the CVP, with changes intended to alter CVP operations and water deliveries. For example, the bill proposes to require the Secretary of the Interior to manage the CVP to maximize water deliveries without causing \"imminent\" or \"significant\" negative impacts on the long-term survival of specific species. A controversial provision would set maximum negative flow rates (a measurement of allowed pumping) for California's Old and Middle Rivers based on various inflow scenarios on the Sacramento River. These flow rates could only be overridden if the Secretary of the Interior determines that they create an \"imminent negative impact\" on the long-term survival of species such as the Delta smelt. Opponents of these provisions, including the Administration, have previously noted that they constitute a new standard for jeopardy (compared to that currently used) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA, P.L. 93-205 ), and that such changes would \"invite litigation.\" Supporters point to text that would direct the Secretaries to implement the changes consistent with applicable laws (e.g., ESA), and assert that water managers require more flexibility to address competing water demands during times of drought.", "Other water-related provisions in the House-passed version of the bill would address operations in California and other water management issues more broadly. Among other things, these provisions would: ", "Direct Reclamation to complete certain surface water storage feasibility studies by specified deadlines, authorize Reclamation to partner with local joint powers authorities to advance projects, and authorize construction of such projects pending a favorable feasibility finding and 100% nonfederal financing for construction (Subtitle D); Address certain water rights protections (Subtitle E); Expand the CVP service area, establish an oversight board for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund (CVPRF), and direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into negotiations for the transfer of the New Melones Unit of the CVP to water users (Subtitle F); Create programs to expedite Reclamation project permitting (Subtitle G) and initiate a new process for Reclamation project study and review (Subtitle H); Direct, upon the water contractors' request, accelerated repayment to the federal government of certain construction costs (Subtitle I); Provide for development of additional benefits at dam safety projects (Subtitle J); and Define and address treatment of water rights in connection with use of federal lands (Subtitle J).", "Among the key issues for Congress posed by these provisions is how to address water supply shortages in general and management of federal water supply projects in particular during times of drought and increasing demand. Myriad laws, regulations, contracts, and other obligations affect federal water project management. Balancing these obligations while meeting growing demands for water for multiple purposes poses challenges for western water managers."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
