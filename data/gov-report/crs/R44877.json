Some of the exceptions were ", "the International Trade Administration (-$1 million, 0.2% less than the FY2017 enacted appropriation, but +$40 million, 8.9% more than the Administration's request), ESA (-$8 million, 7.7% less than the FY2017 enacted appropriation, but +$2 million, 2.1% more than the Administration's request), NIST's National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (-$10 million, 40.0% less than the FY2017 enacted appropriation, the same as the Administration's request), DOJ's General Legal Activities account (the same as the FY2017 enacted appropriation, -$2 million, 0.2% less than the Administration's request), DOJ's Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account (-$21 million, 18.9% less than the Administration's request), NASA's Space Operations account (-$199 million, 4.0% less than the FY2017 enacted appropriation, but +$12 million, 0.2% greater than the Administration's request), NASA's Safety, Security, and Mission Services account (+$58 million, 2.1% greater than the FY2017 enacted appropriation, -$3 million, 0.1% less than the Administration's request), and NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account (-$26 million, 12.5% less than the FY2017 enacted appropriation, the same as the Administration's request).", "Congress and the President also provided $492 million for the Office on Violence Against Women, but the entire amount is derived through a transfer from the Crime Victims Fund. ", " Table 1 outlines the FY2017 enacted appropriations, the Administration's FY2018 request, the House-passed, the Senate committee-reported, and the FY2018 enacted amounts for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, the science agencies, and the related agencies.

(More detailed historical appropriations data can be found in Table 2 . ) The data show that nominal appropriations for CJS increased from FY2008 to FY2010. Appropriations for CJS peaked in FY2009 at $76.782 billion if emergency supplemental appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ) are included. (If ARRA funding is not considered, appropriations peaked in FY2010 at $69.146 billion.) ARRA provided a substantial increase in appropriations for FY2009. The $15.992 billion Congress and the President appropriated for CJS under ARRA added approximately 25% to the amount that was provided for CJS through the annual appropriations process that year.", "Nominal appropriations for CJS decreased from FY2010 to FY2013, but they have increased in each subsequent fiscal year. If not for the effects of sequestration, which reduced FY2013 CJS appropriations by nearly $4 billion, funding levels for CJS would have held steady at approximately $61 billion between FY2011 and FY2015. CJS appropriations increased by approximately $4 billion in FY2016, largely made possible by the increase to the discretionary spending caps enacted in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-74 ). CJS appropriations increased marginally in FY2017 ($361 million, or 0.1%).", " Figure 2 shows total CJS appropriations for FY2008-FY2017 by major component (i.e., the Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, and the NSF). Increases in CJS appropriations in FY2009 (not including ARRA funding) and FY2010 largely resulted from Congress and the President appropriating more funding for the Department of Commerce in support of the 2010 decennial census, though there were small increases during that same time in funding for DOJ, NASA, and NSF. ", "Although decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce mostly explain the overall decrease in CJS appropriations from FY2010 to FY2013 (a 47.4% reduction), cuts in funding for DOJ (-8.7%) and NASA (-9.8%) also contributed. Appropriations for NSF held relatively steady from FY2010 to FY2013."], "subsections": []}]}}
