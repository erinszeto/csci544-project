Paraguay's turbulent political history and tradition of political authoritarianism have resulted in international isolation that the country is seeking to overcome. The population of 6.9 million people is one the most homogenous mestizo populations in the hemisphere. Paraguay's largely agrarian economy has grown well in recent years on the strength of global commodity prices. However, in 2009, a severe drought and the impact of the global economic recession sharply reduced growth, but a recovery is anticipated in 2010.", "The April 2008 election of Fernando Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop and leader of the Patriotic Alliance for Change, as President ended 61 years of one-party rule by the still-dominant Colorado Party. The United States has encouraged the strengthening of democracy in Paraguay, and hailed the peaceful transition of power. Known as the \"bishop of the poor\" after a decade of work in an impoverished rural diocese, Lugo pledged to introduce land and agrarian reform, improve education and health services to better serve Paraguay's poor majority, and combat widespread corruption. Yet, as he entered his second year in office, there were more frequent calls for his impeachment. His loose electoral alliance had splintered, and he faced broad opposition in the opposition-dominated Paraguayan Congress that had stymied his center-left agenda at nearly every turn. At the end of 2009, polls indicated that Lugo had one of the lowest popularity ratings of any leader in the region.", "The United States and Paraguay cooperate in a number of areas but especially in the fight against corruption, and on anti-drug, counterterrorism and anti-smuggling initiatives. In 2006 and 2009, the United States and Paraguay signed two Millennium Challenge Corporation threshold agreements totaling more than $60 million dollars to combat corruption and strengthen the rule of law. Paraguay is a major transit country for cocaine and produces the largest crop of marijuana in South America. The United States remains concerned about illegal activities in the loosely controlled tri-border region with neighboring Brazil and Argentina, such as money-laundering, drugs and arms trafficking, and trade in counterfeit and contraband goods.", "The 111th Congress has expressed growing interest in Paraguay. In April 2009, two bills were introduced entitled the \"U.S.-Paraguay Partnership Act of 2009\" (H.R. 1837 and S. 780). On September 14, 2009, the ATPDEA Expansion and Extension Act of 2009 (S. 1665) was introduced in the Senate. Each of these bills would amend the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (Title XXXI of the Trade Act of 2002, P.L. 107-210) to extend unilateral trade preferences to Paraguay. Indicating additional interest in Paraguay, the House Democratic Partnership (formerly the House Democratic Assistance Commission) made a study trip to Paraguay in August 2009.

The Lugo victory was hailed as a step toward strengthening Paraguay's fragile democracy, ending six decades of one-party rule. In many ways, the election of President Lugo raised hopes for a historic break with Paraguay's past and its tradition of authoritarian leadership, political isolation, and widespread corruption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Political Background1", "paragraphs": ["The current political environment in Paraguay has been shaped by the country's turbulent political history. Paraguay was defeated in the War of the Triple Alliance (1864-1870) against Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and lost 25% of its territory and over half of its population. This defeat led to an extensive period of political instability, with three civil wars in the first half of the 20 th century. In the late 19 th century, a two-party political system emerged with the formation of the Colorado Party and the Liberal Party, but the Colorado Party soon became the dominant political force, ruling between 1887 and 1904. The Liberal Party captured control of the government and ruled from 1904 until 1940. A war with neighboring Bolivia between 1932-1935, the Chaco War, further weakened political institutions and hindered economic development until the military assumed control in 1940 and governed through a succession of authoritarian leaders. ", "The Colorado Party returned to power in 1946, consolidating its control through the military, dominant economic groups, and the state bureaucracy. In the late 1940s, the party assumed greater control over state institutions to the point where party membership was a prerequisite for civil service positions and promotion in the military. General Alfredo Stroessner, a member of the Colorado party, staged a coup in 1954, and consolidated power in a repressive military dictatorship. Stroessner, who engineered his \"election\" to complete the unexpired term of his predecessor, was subsequently re-elected seven times, ruling almost continuously under the state of siege provision of the constitution, with support from the military and Colorado Party. Nominally governed by a constitution approved in 1967, Stroessner's rule increased the isolation of Paraguay from the world community. During Stroessner's 35-year rule, (known as the Stronato), political opponents were systematically harassed and persecuted, accused of communist sympathies or posing a threat to state security. ", "The demise of the Stroessner military dictatorship in 1989 initiated a challenging political transition over the next 20 years. Due in large part to the country's authoritarian past, Paraguay's state institutions had remained weak while corruption continued to undercut democratic consolidation and economic development. In 1992, a new constitution was adopted, and in 1993, Paraguay elected its first civilian president in almost 40 years. For the next 15 years, however, Paraguay's democracy alternated between periods of greater and lesser instability, including an attempted military coup, the assassination of a Vice President, and the resignation of a President.", "Observers maintain that corruption is a major impediment to consolidating democratic institutions. President Nicanor Duarte Frutos (2003-2008) took important measures to combat corruption that included increased penalties for tax evasion, other measures to increase tax revenue, greater oversight of government spending, and a crackdown on the trade in contraband and counterfeit goods. He removed members of the Supreme Court after corruption allegations surfaced against them. These measures were partially successful, as suggested by Transparency International's 2006 corruption perceptions index in which Paraguay moved up to 111 out of 163 countries after Paraguay was ranked among the six most corrupt countries in the world in 2004. In both the 2007 and 2008 index, however, Paraguay dropped to 138 out of 180 countries, and in the 2009 index Paraguay ranked 154\u2014ahead of only Venezuela and Haiti in the hemisphere.", "In April 2008, Paraguay took another historic step with the election of former bishop Fernando Lugo to the presidency. For some observers, Lugo's victory is seen as a chance for Paraguay to strengthen its democratic transition. One of President Lugo's central challenges is to establish presidential control over the entrenched government bureaucracy that is still essentially controlled by the Colorado Party."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lugo's 2008 Election", "paragraphs": ["There were three major candidates in the presidential election of April 20, 2008. They were the former minister of education Blanca Ovelar of the long-ruling Colorado Party; Fernando Lugo, then known in Paraguay as the \"bishop of the poor,\" backed by the Patriotic Alliance for Change; and former military commander Lino Oviedo, the leader of a failed 1996 coup who was released from prison in early September 2007, running as a candidate of the party that he founded, the National Union of Ethical Citizens (UNACE).", "In the campaign, Lugo emphasized empowering the poor, agrarian reform, health reform, and ending endemic corruption, which he viewed as the legacy of decades of Colorado Party dominance. Lugo said that he was open to private capital and a consensus-based development model. As a cornerstone of his candidacy, he pushed for renegotiating the Itaip\u00fa and Yacyret\u00e1 hydroelectric power supply treaties with Brazil and Argentina and sought to raise the price of Paraguay's supply of hydro-energy to these countries. ", "Lugo's coalition of opposition parties\u2014the Patriotic Alliance for Change (APC\u2014see text box for the coalition's various parties) won the election with 40.8% of the vote according to the National Election Tribunal, followed by Colorado's Blanca Ovelar with 30.6% and UNACE's Oviedo with 21.9% of the vote. International observation teams from the Organization of American States (OAS) and the U.S.-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) praised the successful conduct of the elections.

He declared his top priorities as fighting widespread corruption and reducing economic inequality. ", "Lugo's election greatly raised expectations among Paraguay's poor majority. The APC coalition that brought Lugo to office, however, fractured in late June 2009 following the congressional leadership elections. The APC lost the support of the influential PLRA (a wing of the Liberal Party and the second-largest party in Congress) when a faction of the PLRA chose to leave the coalition. In July 2009, the entire PLRA split from the electoral alliance and joined the opposition in criticizing Lugo. This defection included his Vice President, Frederico Franco, who accused the President of treason for his inability to make good on electoral promises in a December 2009 news article. In response to political challenges and conflict, President Lugo has reportedly retreated from leadership and has left the problems facing his reform agenda in the hands of his ministers. His inability to manage the growing opposition in Congress has raised questions about his capacity to effectively influence policy, and even the possibility of impeachment. ", "Adding to his perceived weakness, a scandal erupted in April 2009 when the President was accused of fathering children during his years as a priest with three different women. (He has admitted to fathering one boy.) This scandal has further undermined his credibility in some quarters; however, others have argued that the political fallout from the paternity claims may not be so great in a culture where virility is highly valued. In late November 2009, Lugo held a press conference to accuse his detractors of being part of an \"orchestrated campaign\" led by the country's \"powerful mafia groups.\" In December, however, he took steps to address the controversy by agreeing to a DNA test in response to the third paternity suit.", "In his first year in office, President Lugo had very limited success in working with an opposition congress. Lugo's reform agenda is stymied by a number of challenges: his electoral coalition has splintered; he is a political novice and has not acquired the political skills to build bridges with a constitutionally mandated strong Congress; and he faces a political and administrative culture reportedly riddled with corruption, clientelism, and a sympathy for and habituation to authoritarianism.", "Lugo's popular support has dwindled. A December 2009 poll showed less than 18% of respondents thought he was doing a \"good\" or \"very good\" job, down from 38% at the end of 2008. As Lugo entered his second year in office, calls for impeachment became more frequent. Impeachment is allowed by the Paraguayan Constitution and has been used recently (in 1999 and an almost successful attempt in 2003). Although factions within various parties support impeachment and in early December a Colorado Party Congress of 600 delegates voted to consider impeachment, the opposition in Congress does not appear to have the two-thirds majority needed to impeach Lugo. ", "In November 2009, President Lugo shuffled the military leadership for the fourth time since he took office. Although he complained about pro-coup sentiment in the military when he made the announcement, he later released a statement that denied a coup plot had been discovered. The President had been under pressure to improve security since the October 2009 kidnapping of wealthy businessman Fidel Zavala by the Army of the Paraguayan People, (EPP), a small guerrilla group with reported links to some of Paraguay's peasant organizations. In January 2010, his Vice President, Frederico Franco, now in opposition to President Lugo, called for increased security measures in the north of the country, where the kidnapping occurred, and more aggressive action against the EPP. Fortunately for Lugo, Zavala was released unharmed on January 17, 2010, after more than three months of captivity following the reported payment of a ransom by his family. Lugo has pledged to bring the kidnappers to justice and increase security in the area where the EPP operates.", "Despite congressional gridlock and vocal opposition, President Lugo has had some political successes. His focus on increasing social and health expenditures to reduce inequality has resulted in modest reforms of education and healthcare. Progress to reduce poverty included an expansion of the conditional cash transfer program. He enacted policies to provide more poor families with conditional benefits (about $40 per month while their children remain in school) from 50,000 to 70,000 families. ", "In a meeting with the President of Brazil on July 25, 2009, President Lugo obtained an agreement to sharply increase the payments received from Brazil for hydro-electric power from the Itaip\u00fa Dam, one of his campaign promises. The dam, constructed on the Parana River jointly by the Brazilian and Paraguayan governments, is the second-largest hydropower producer in the world. Sale of the power is regulated by a treaty that gives each country the right to 50% of the 14 gigawats of electricity generated by the dam. Paraguay now uses only about 5% of the power from the project. Until 2023, when the treaty expires, the unused electricity generated for Paraguay must be sold to Brazil's state-owned power utility Electrobas at a fixed price. In the July 2009 accord, Brazil agreed to triple the price it paid Paraguay for the energy, and included financing for high-capacity transmission lines to be constructed from the dam to the Paraguayan capital, Asunci\u00f3n. Some analysts see the new agreement as an effort by Brazilian President Lula da Silva to offer President Lugo a hand as his electoral coalition was fracturing. Lugo had pledged during the campaign to use the power sale proceeds to finance poverty relief, health care, school nutrition programs, and ultimately, far-reaching land reform. The Paraguayan Congress quickly approved the new agreement, but it has moved slowly through the Brazilian Congress, where it must also be ratified. The new agreement would boost Paraguay's income from the dam to $360 million and is expected to be approved by the Brazilian Congress in the first half of 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Policy", "paragraphs": ["In terms of foreign policy, Lugo has resisted ideological labels. During the electoral campaign, Lugo refrained from criticizing the United States, and also was careful not to criticize or praise Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.

Bush said he \"stood with\" Lugo in pursuing a \"social justice agenda\" and supported his efforts to fight corruption. Following the 2008 visit, Paraguay received a one-time increase in health and economic growth assistance from the United States of $10 million. The United States has supported anti-corruption and democratization programs in Paraguay including providing more than $60 million in funding from the Millennium Challenge Corporation (see \" U.S. Assistance \"). The two countries collaborate extensively on anti-narcotics and anti-smuggling efforts.", "Some of Lugo's opponents accuse him of maintaining close ties to President Ch\u00e1vez, a charge that Lugo denies. He has maintained friendly relations with President Ch\u00e1vez but has not shown an inclination to join the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), the leftist political alliance organized by Venezuela's President, which includes Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Paraguay is a member of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) along with Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, and has been aligned with the trade group despite being Mercosur's poorest member. In August 2009, Lugo was forced to withdraw his support of legislation allowing Venezuela's membership in Mercosur because he lacked a majority in his Congress. As a full voting member of Mercosur, Paraguay has opposed the elevation of Venezuela to full membership in the customs union because of strong animosity toward Ch\u00e1vez in the Paraguayan Congress.

Approximately 20% of GDP is derived from agriculture, and agricultural activities employ approximately one-quarter of the country's workforce. Other agricultural products include wheat, corn, sugarcane, sesame and other fruits and vegetables. Paraguay's industrial sector is still largely underdeveloped, with much of the population still employed in subsistence agriculture. Economic growth tends to be limited by Paraguay's dependence on imports of manufactured goods, as well as capital goods that are necessary to supply the industrial and investment requirements of the economy.", "The small manufacturing sector includes agricultural goods, leather, textile, automatic data processing (ADP) machine parts, and tobacco products. The service sector is dominated by communications, which has benefitted from strong foreign direct investment (FDI) and electricity production from the Itaip\u00fa hydropower plant co-owned with Brazil and the Yacyret\u00e1 plant co-owned with Argentina.", "Paraguay's informal sector is very large and may be twice the size of the formal sector.

Most of these imported goods are not declared at customs, preventing the government from obtaining substantial tax revenue. Counterfeit trade and smuggling are prevalent in the country's border regions. Increased government enforcement of taxes and custom laws is having an impact on the underground economy as a whole, although much remains to be done.", "Overriding a presidential veto, Paraguay's Congress voted to delay implementation of a personal income tax for a third successive time in June 2009. This was a blow to the Lugo Administration's plans to raise social expenditures and implement a land reform program. The Colorado/UNACE majority in Congress also increased the fiscal deficit by raising the state pension for low income earners and other public sector wages. Members of Lugo's inner circle accused the Congress of sabotaging the President's land and fiscal reform policies. The personal income tax was again due to take effect in early 2010, but opposition in Congress has continued to prevent implementation.", "While promising to address income inequality and land reform, President Lugo has continued the orthodox macroeconomic policies adopted by the predecessor Duarte Administration in 2003. Those policies contributed to a slow and steady economic recovery after a period of recessions and weak recoveries and led to the achievement of positive economic growth. Lugo's appointment of Dionisio Borda as finance minister, and of other centrist politicians to his cabinet, are seen by many observers as an indication of his intent to consolidate macroeconomic stability. Borda is an independent economist, known for implementing fiscal reform. Stricter fiscal controls begun under the prior administration, which Borda also served, continue to increase the number of registered taxpayers and the amount of revenue generated by the business income tax.
