Little detailed open-source information is available about the DPRK's nuclear weapons production capabilities, warhead sophistication, the scope and success of its uranium enrichment program, or extent of its proliferation activities. In total, it is estimated that North Korea has between 30 and 50 kilograms of separated plutonium, enough for at least half a dozen nuclear weapons. North Korea's plutonium production reactor at Yongbyon has been shuttered since its cooling tower was destroyed under international agreement in June 2008. However, on April 1, 2013, North Korea said it would resume operation of its plutonium production reactor. Experts estimate it will take approximately six months to restart. This would provide North Korea with approximately one bomb's worth of plutonium per year.", "While North Korea's weapons program has been plutonium-based from the start, in the past decade, intelligence emerged pointing to a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium. North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, but has said its purpose is the production of fuel for nuclear power. In November 2010, North Korea showed visiting American experts early construction of a 100 MWT light-water reactor and a newly built gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant, both at the Yongbyon site. The North Koreans claimed the enrichment plant was operational, but this has not been independently confirmed. U.S. officials have said that it is likely other, clandestine enrichment facilities exist. Enrichment (as well as reprocessing) technology can be used to produce material for nuclear weapons or fuel for power reactors. An enrichment capability could potentially provide North Korea with a faster way of making nuclear material for weapons and therefore is of great concern to policymakers.", "North Korea has made multiple policy statements in the past year asserting its nuclear weapons status: in May 2012, North Korea changed its constitution to say that it was a \"nuclear-armed state.\" In January 2013, North Korea said that no dialogue on denuclearization \"would be possible\" and it would only disarm when all the other nuclear weapon states also disarm. In March 2013, North Korea stated its goal of expanding its nuclear weapons program.", "Many experts believe that the prime objective of North Korea's nuclear program is to develop a nuclear warhead that could be mounted on North Korea's intermediate-range and long-range missiles. This was confirmed by North Korean official statements in late March 2013. Miniaturization of a nuclear warhead would likely require additional nuclear and missile tests. In January 2013, a North Korean statement said that it would respond with a nuclear test \"of higher level.\" On February 12, 2013, the North Korean official news agency announced a \"successful\" underground nuclear detonation, and seismic monitoring systems measured a resulting earthquake that was 5.1 in magnitude. This is magnitude is slightly higher than past tests, but yield estimates are still uncertain. The South Korean Ministry of Defense estimated that the test yield was between 6 and 7 kilotons, while the U.S. Director of National Intelligence so far has said \"approximately several kilotons.\" North Korea claimed that the February 12, 2013, nuclear test was to develop a \"smaller and light\" warhead. At a minimum, the test would likely contribute to North Korea's ability to develop a warhead that could be mounted on a long-range missile. To date, no open source data on test emissions is available that might show whether the North Koreans tested a uranium or plutonium device. This information could help determine the type and sophistication of the North Korean nuclear warhead design, about which little is known."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the early 1980s, U.S. satellites tracked a growing indigenous nuclear program in North Korea. The North Korean nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union on a nuclear research program near Yongbyon. Its first research reactor began operation in 1967. North Korea used indigenous expertise and foreign procurements to build a small nuclear reactor at Yongbyon (5 MWe). It was capable of producing about 6 kilograms (Kg) of plutonium per year and began operating in 1986. Later that year, U.S. satellites detected high explosives testing and a new plant to separate plutonium from the reactor's spent fuel. In addition, construction of two larger reactors (50 MWe at Yongbyon and 200 MWe at Taechon) added evidence of a serious clandestine effort. Although North Korea had joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1985 under Soviet pressure, safeguards inspections began only in 1992, raising questions about how much plutonium North Korea had produced covertly. In 1994, North Korea pledged, under the Agreed Framework with the United States, to freeze its plutonium programs and eventually dismantle them in return for several kinds of assistance. At that time, Western intelligence agencies estimated that North Korea had separated enough plutonium for one or two bombs. North Korea complied with the Agreed Framework, allowing International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) seals\u2014including the \"canning\" of spent fuel rods at the Yongbyon reactor\u2014and permanent remote monitoring and inspectors at its nuclear facilities.", "When in 2002, U.S. negotiators reportedly presented North Korean officials with evidence of a clandestine uranium enrichment program, the North Korean officials reportedly at first confirmed this, then denied it publicly. The conflict quickly led to the breakdown of the Agreed Framework. The Bush Administration argued that North Korea was in \"material breach\" of its obligations and, after agreement with South Korea, Japan, and the EU (the other members of the Korean Economic Development Organization, or KEDO), stopped the next shipment of heavy fuel oil. In response, North Korea kicked out international monitors, broke the seals at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, and restarted its reactor and reprocessing plant after an eight-year freeze.", "Members of the Six-Party Talks\u2014the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and North Korea\u2014began meeting in August 2003 to try and resolve the crisis. In September 2005, the Six Parties issued a Joint Statement on how to achieve verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which formed the basis for future agreements. Negotiations broke down, and North Korea tested a nuclear device in October 2006. ", "On February 13, 2007, North Korea reached an agreement with other members of the Six-Party Talks to begin the initial phase (60 days) of implementing the Joint Statement from September 2005 on denuclearization. Phase 1 of this agreement included the shut-down of plutonium production at the Yongbyon nuclear complex in exchange for an initial heavy fuel oil shipment to North Korea. Phase 2 steps include the disablement of facilities at Yongbyon and a \"complete and correct\" declaration of DPRK nuclear activities, in exchange for delivery of heavy fuel oil and equivalent, and removal of the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) and State Sponsors of Terrorism (SST) designations. The United States provided funding and technical assistance for disablement activities in North Korea until April 2009. Energy assistance was divided evenly between the Six Parties in Phase 2 of the agreement. North Korea submitted a declaration of its past plutonium production activities in June 2008 as agreed in an October 3, 2007, joint statement on \"Second-Phase Actions.\" Thereafter, President Bush removed North Korea from the TWEA list and notified Congress of his intent to lift the SST designation after North Korea agreed to verification provisions. North Korea did not accept initial U.S. verification proposals, and in September 2008, threatened to restart reprocessing plutonium. U.S. officials announced a bilateral agreement on verification in October 2008, and the Bush Administration removed North Korea from the SST List. The agreement was verbal, and North Korea then said that it had not agreed to sampling at nuclear sites, a key element in verifying past plutonium production. The Six Parties met in December 2008, but did not reach agreement on verification measures. Disablement activities at Yongbyon continued through April 2009, when North Korea expelled international monitors. North Korea then announced it would restart its reprocessing plant and boasted progress in uranium enrichment technology development and soon after tested as nuclear device (see detailed discussions below). ", "The February 2007 Denuclearization Action Plan did not address uranium enrichment-related activities or the dismantlement of warheads and instead focused on shutting down and disabling the key plutonium production facilities at Yongbyon. A third phase, to have begun after disablement was complete and a declaration accepted by the Six Parties, was expected to deal with all aspects of North Korea's nuclear program, including weapons, using North Korea's declaration as a basis for future action. Understanding the scope of the program and the weapons capability would require transparency and careful verification for the pledged \"complete, verifiable, irreversible\" disarmament to be achieved.", "Six Party Talks have not been held since spring 2009, but the United States and other countries have held bilateral talks with the North since then. North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, but has said its purpose is the production of fuel for nuclear power. In November 2010, North Korea showed visiting American experts early construction of a 100 MWT light-water reactor and a newly built gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant, both at the Yongbyon site. The North Koreans claimed the enrichment plant was operational, but this has not been independently confirmed. U.S. officials have said that it is likely other, clandestine enrichment facilities exist. A February 2012 announcement committed North Korea to moratoria on nuclear and long-range missile testing as well as uranium enrichment suspension at Yongbyon under IAEA monitoring. However, an April 2012 satellite launch, which violated UN Security Council resolutions as well as the February missile moratorium, caused a collapse of the February agreement. Following a December 2012 satellite launch and subsequent UN Security Council condemnation, North Korea rejected future denuclearization talks, saying it would only denuclearize when all other nuclear weapons states also did so. A third nuclear test conducted on February 12, 2013, could further complicate diplomatic efforts toward denuclearization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weapons Production Milestones", "paragraphs": ["North Korea is widely believed to have mastered the engineering requirements of plutonium production a decade ago and may now be focusing its efforts on mastering uranium enrichment. Acquiring fissile material\u2014plutonium-239 or highly enriched uranium (HEU)\u2014is the key hurdle in nuclear weapons development. Producing these two materials is technically challenging; in comparison, many experts believe weaponization to be relatively easy. North Korea has industrial-scale uranium mining and plants for milling, refining, and converting uranium; it also has a fuel fabrication plant, a nuclear reactor, and a reprocessing plant\u2014in short, everything needed to produce Pu-239. It has recently been built a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon that could produce HEU for weapons, or LEU reactor fuel which could be irradiated for plutonium production. In its earlier 5 MWe nuclear reactor, North Korea used magnox fuel\u2014natural uranium (>99%U-238) metal, wrapped in magnesium-alloy cladding to produce plutonium for weapons. About 8,000 fuel rods constitute a fuel core for the reactor.", "When irradiated in a reactor, natural uranium fuel absorbs a neutron and then decays into plutonium (Pu-239). Fuel that remains in the reactor for a long time becomes contaminated by the isotope Pu-240, which can \"poison\" the functioning of a nuclear weapon. Spent or irradiated fuel, which poses radiological hazards, must cool after removal from the reactor. The cooling phase, estimated by some at five months, is proportional to the fuel burn-up. Reprocessing to separate plutonium from waste products and uranium is the next step. North Korea used a PUREX separation process, like the United States. After shearing off the fuel cladding, the fuel is dissolved in nitric acid. Components (plutonium, uranium, waste) of the fuel are separated into different streams using organic solvents. In small quantities, separation can be done in hot cells, but larger quantities require significant shielding to prevent deadly exposure to radiation.", "It operated its 5 MWe nuclear reactor, is believed to have separated Pu from the spent fuel, and has reportedly taken steps toward weaponization. In January 2004, North Korean officials showed an unofficial U.S. delegation alloyed \"scrap\" from a plutonium (Pu) casting operation. Dr. Siegfried Hecker, a delegation member, assessed that the stated density of the material was consistent with plutonium alloyed with gallium or aluminum. If so, this could indicate a degree of sophistication in North Korea's handling of Pu metal, necessary for weapons production. But without testing the material, Hecker could not confirm that the metal was plutonium or that it was alloyed, or when it was produced."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Estimating Nuclear Warheads and Plutonium Stocks", "paragraphs": ["Secretary of State Colin Powell in December 2002 stated, \"We now believe [the North Koreans] have a couple of nuclear weapons and have had them for years.\" In February 2005, North Korea officially announced that it had \"manufactured nukes for self-defense.\" Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan has previously said that North Korea possesses multiple bombs and was building more.", "A key factor in assessing how many weapons North Korea can produce is whether North Korea needs to use more or less material than the IAEA standards of 8 kg of Pu and 25 kg for HEU per weapon. The amount of fissile material used in each weapon is determined by the design sophistication. There is no reliable public information on North Korean nuclear weapons design.", "In all, estimates of North Korea's separated plutonium range between 30 kg and 50 kg, with an approximate 5 kg to 6 kg of this figure having been used for the October 2006 test and an additional amount probably used in the May 2009 test. This amounts to enough plutonium for approximately five to eight nuclear weapons, assuming 6 kg per weapon. Taking the nuclear tests into account, North Korean could possess plutonium for four to seven nuclear weapons. A 2007 unclassified intelligence report to Congress says that \"prior to the test North Korea could have produced up to 50 kg of plutonium, enough for at least a half dozen nuclear weapons\" and points out that additional plutonium is in the fuel of the Yongbyon reactor. North Korea claimed to have reprocessed that fuel in the summer of 2009 (see below). ", "Questions arise in determining how much plutonium North Korea produced between 2003, when the IAEA monitors were kicked out of the country and the seals were broken at Yongbyon, and 2007, when international monitoring resumed. A South Korean Defense Ministry white paper from December 2006 estimated that North Korea had made 30 kg of weapons-grade plutonium in the previous three years, potentially enough for five nuclear bombs. The white paper also concurred with U.S. estimates that North Korea's total stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium was 50 kg. ", "The accounting issue was further complicated when North Korea reportedly declared a lower number of 37 kg of separated plutonium in its declaration under the Six-Party Talks. No agreement has been reached on verifying the amount of plutonium stocks through inspections (see discussions on declaration, verification below). In January 2009, an American scholar who had visited Pyongyang said the North Koreans told him that 30.8 kg amount had been \"weaponized,\" possibly meaning that the separated plutonium might now be in warheads. The DPRK officials also told him that they would not allow for warheads to be inspected.

North Korean officials claimed to have separated plutonium in hot cells as early as 1975 and tested the reprocessing plant in 1990. North Korea's 5 MWe nuclear reactor at Yongbyon operated from 1986 to 1994. It is estimated that North Korea produced and separated no more than 10 kg of plutonium prior to 1994. Its plutonium production program was then frozen between 1994 and 2003 under the Agreed Framework. When this agreement was abandoned, North Korea restarted plutonium production at Yongbyon.", "On February 6, 2003, North Korean officials announced that the 5 MWe reactor was operating, and commercial satellite photography confirmed activity in March. In January 2004, North Korean officials told an unofficial U.S. delegation that the reactor was operating smoothly at 100% of its rated power. The U.S. visitors noted that the display in the reactor control room and steam plumes from the cooling towers confirmed operation, but that there was no way of knowing how it had operated over the last year.", "The same delegation reported that the reprocessing \"facility appeared in good repair,\" in contrast to a 1992 IAEA assessment of the reprocessing plant as \"extremely primitive.\" According to North Korean officials in January 2004, the reprocessing plant's annual throughput is 110 tons of spent fuel, about twice the fuel load of the 5 MWe reactor. Officials claimed to have reprocessed all 8,000 fuel rods from the 5 MWe reactor between January and June 2003. Reprocessing the 8,000 fuel rods at that time would have yielded between 25 kg and 30 kg of plutonium, perhaps for four to six weapons, but the exact amount of plutonium that might have been reprocessed is unknown. In 2004, North Korean officials stated that the reprocessing campaign was conducted continuously (in four six-hour shifts).", "In April 2005, the 5 MWe reactor was shut down, this time to harvest fuel rods for weapons. The reactor resumed operations in June 2005. One estimate is that the reactor held between 10 kg and 15 kg of Pu in April 2005, and that North Korea could have reprocessed all the fuel rods by mid-2006. From August 2005 to 2006, the reactor could have produced another 6 kg of Pu. In total, North Korea could have reprocessed enough separated plutonium for another three weapons (in addition to the estimated 4-6 bomb-worth from reprocessing the 8,000 fuel rods). The 5 MWe reactor was again shut down in July 2007, when the IAEA installed containment and surveillance measures and radiation monitoring devices. Its cooling tower was destroyed in June 2008, and it has not been restarted. The IAEA was asked to remove its monitoring equipment and leave the site in April 2009. In early November 2009, the North Korean news agency announced that all 8,000 spent fuel rods in its possession had been reprocessed by the end of August. Reprocessing at that time is estimated to have produced 7-8 kg of separated plutonium or approximately enough for one nuclear warhead. However, even while the reprocessing facility was shut down, North Korea could have built additional warheads with existing separated plutonium because North Korea's plutonium stocks were not under IAEA safeguards. ", "No construction has occurred at the 50 MWe reactor at Yongbyon or at the 200 MWe Taechon reactor since 2002. They were years from completion when construction was halted. The 50 MWe reactor site at Yongbyon is currently being dismantled. The CIA estimated that the two reactors could generate about 275 kg of plutonium per year if they were operating. Dr. Hecker estimated that if the 50 MWe reactor was functioning, it would mean a tenfold increase in North Korea's plutonium production. North Korea agreed to halt work on reactors as part of the Six-Party Talks. From July 2007 to April 2009, when inspectors were asked to leave, the IAEA was monitoring to ensure that no further construction took place at these sites. Significant future growth in North Korea's plutonium-based arsenal would be possible only if the two larger reactors were completed and operating, and would also depend on progress in the reported uranium enrichment program. ", "In December 2010, Governor Bill Richardson went to North Korea on an unofficial visit. Press reports and the governor's website at that time said that North Korea was willing to negotiate the sale of the 12,000 fresh fuel rods in storage at Yongbyon to a third party, such as South Korea. These fuel rods were manufactured for the 50 MWe reactor that was never built, but could be re-clad to be used in the 5 MWe reactor if North Korea chose to restart it. North Korea announced on in April 2013 that it plans to restart the 5 MWe reactor, which experts estimate would take approximately six months."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Uranium Enrichment", "paragraphs": ["In November 2010, North Korean officials showed a visiting unofficial U.S. delegation\u2014led by former Los Alamos National Laboratory Director Dr. Siegfried Hecker\u2014what they claimed was an operating gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. In his trip report, Dr. Hecker estimated that the plant had 2,000 centrifuges (most likely P-2 centrifuges) in six cascades, with a capacity of 8,000 kg SWU/year. ", "North Korea at that time claimed the uranium enrichment facility was built to produce enriched uranium for power reactor fuel. In more recent statements, it has confirmed what the international community suspected, that it could also be used for weapons material production. The North does not have any functioning nuclear power reactors, but said it is in the process of building a 100 megawatt-thermal (25-30 megawatt-electric) experimental light-water reactor. Satellite images, as well as visitors to the site, confirm initial construction. The reported size of the enrichment plant would match the annual fuel needs for the proposed 100 MWT reactor, which would require 3.5% low-enriched uranium fuel. However, the plant could be altered to produce 40 kg of 90% highly enriched uranium per year. Highly enriched uranium can be used for weapons, while low-enriched uranium cannot. ", "While it was known prior to Dr. Hecker's visit that North Korea was pursuing a uranium enrichment capacity, many analysts were surprised at the size and sophistication of the plant. Although North Korea's weapons program has been plutonium-based from the start, in the past decade, intelligence had emerged pointing to it pursuing a second route to a nuclear bomb using highly enriched uranium. Even before North Korea unveiled the facility in November 2010, there was some certainty that North Korea had parts and plans for such a program, but far less certainty over how far this program had developed. ", "In particular, this revelation raises questions about North Korea's domestic capability to manufacture components, as well as how and when Pyonyang obtained any equipment or materials for the facility. Analysts point to a history of cooperation with Pakistan, particularly through the A. Q. Khan network, and multiple reports of transshipments through China. The scale of the plant at Yongbyon could suggest North Korea possesses research level facilities elsewhere in the country. Another concern is that a clandestine facility might exist that is configured to produce HEU for the North Korean nuclear weapons program. U.S. Ambassador to the IAEA Glyn Davies told the IAEA Board of Governors in December 2010 that the United States believes it is likely that other, clandestine uranium enrichment facilities exist in locations other than Yongbyon. A pilot-scale centrifuge plant would likely be needed to serve as a test-bed for the larger plants, perhaps consisting of a few hundred centrifuges. ", "Pakistani President Musharraf revealed in his September 2006 memoir, In the Line of Fire , that Abdul Qadeer Khan\u2014chief scientist in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program who proliferated nuclear weapons technology for profit\u2014\"transferred nearly two dozen P-1 and P-2 centrifuges to North Korea. He also provided North Korea with a flow meter, some special oils for centrifuges, and coaching on centrifuge technology, including visits to top-secret centrifuge plants.\" According to press reports, North Korea said it had imported 150 tons of high-strength aluminum tubes from Russia that could be used in a uranium enrichment program in the 2002-2003 period. ", "It is not known where North Korea develops or manufactures centrifuges itself. As described in the United Nations Panel of Experts on North Korea report of June 2012, there is some debate whether North Korea has the capacity to manufacture the specialized equipment required for centrifuges, such as maraging steel or high-strength aluminum, or whether it could have imported the components. Some experts posit that North Korea could have built a centrifuge based on a less sophisticated design with less stringent quality requirements. Based on what has been reported on procurements of relevant equipment, Former IAEA Safeguards Director Olli Heinonen in an April 2012 article estimated that North Korea was likely developing a 5,000 centrifuge enrichment capacity, plus spares."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "North Korean Statements on Its Enrichment Program", "paragraphs": ["Until May 2009, North Korea denied the existence of a highly enriched uranium program for weapons.

Following the June 12 U.N. Security Council Resolution condemning North Korea's nuclear test, Pyongyang issued a statement: \"The process of uranium enrichment will be commenced.\" The statement also said that \"pursuant to the decision to build its own light-water reactor, enough success has been made in developing uranium enrichment technology to provide nuclear fuel to allow the experimental procedure.\" In the June statement, North Korea was apparently saying it would, at a minimum, start the experimental enrichment of uranium for fuel.

All Intelligence Community agencies judge with at least moderate confidence that this past effort continues. The degree of progress towards producing enriched uranium remains unknown, however.", "In testimony to Congress on February 2008, Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell confirmed this assessment. The confidence level of these assessments may have changed because of a decrease in international procurement by North Korea. Uranium enrichment-related imports would be more easily detected by intelligence agencies than activities inside North Korea itself. Uranium enrichment facilities can be hidden from aerial surveillance more easily than plutonium facilities, making it more difficult for intelligence agencies to even detect\u2014thus, \"degree of progress\" in turning the equipment into a working enrichment program is \"unknown.\" Furthermore, there are significant differences between assembling a small-scale centrifuge enrichment program and operating a large-scale production plant, and reportedly little evidence of procurement for a large-scale plant has emerged.

However, when U.S. scientists analyzed the aluminum tubing provided as sample \"evidence,\" they found traces of enriched uranium on the tubing. Analysts argue that in addition to the possibility that this is proof of a North Korean uranium enrichment program, it is also possible that the uranium traces could have been on the tubing when North Korea received it.

Analysts differ on the likelihood that other production-scale facilities may exist elsewhere in North Korea.", "The DNI's 2012 threat assessment stated that North Korea's announcement of a uranium enrichment program in November 2010 confirmed long-standing intelligence assessments.

James Kelly said that Kang acknowledged the existence of such a program at that meeting.

For example, State Department Spokesman P. J. Crowley said in late December 2010, \"If they meet their international obligations, take affirmative steps to reduce tensions in the region and take affirmative steps to denuclearize, we will respond accordingly.\" Neither the offer to sell the fresh fuel or to invite international monitors to the uranium enrichment plant would have demonstrated a commitment to denuclearization steps by North Korea, demanded by the U.S. and South Korean governments as a condition for reconvening the Six-Party Talks. Officials from both governments have said they want to avoid falling into the diplomatic \"trap\" of being drawn into a lengthy negotiating process in which Pyongyang does not take concrete steps to denuclearize. However, North Korea's offers may have some intrinsic value on technical grounds: removal of the fresh fuel could reduce the amount of ready material to produce plutonium if the 5 MWe reactor was restarted (it would take only six months to do so); the presence of international inspectors at the newly built uranium enrichment site, depending on the degree of access given, could shed light on the extent and type of technical capability of the North Korean enrichment program. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland announced on February 29, 2012, that North Korea had agreed to a moratorium on enrichment activities at the Yongbyon site and a return of international (IAEA) inspectors to verify the pause.

The most time-consuming step was the removal of the irradiated fuel from the reactor to storage in an adjacent cooling pond. A reported 8 out of 11 steps were completed (see Table 2 ).", "North Korea periodically slowed the pace of spent fuel rod removal at Yongbyon to show its displeasure over other aspects of the Six-Party agreements. For example, in June 2008, Pyongyang said that while 80% of the disablement steps had been completed, only 36% of energy aid had been delivered. North Korea again delayed disablement work in August, September, and October 2008, and those instances appear to have been linked to disputes over when the United States would remove the DPRK from its State Sponsors of Terrorism List and negotiations over verification measures. After the United States removed the SST designation, disablement work resumed in October 2008, and continued until North Korea halted the process in April 2009.", "The steps that were not completed in disabling the Yongbyon facilities as part of phase 2 of the Six-Party Talks are completing the removal of the spent fuel rods from the 5 megawatt reactor; removing the control rod drive mechanism (after all rods are removed); and disabling or removing from the country the fresh fuel rods at the site. As of early April 2009, approximately 80% or 6,400 of the 8,000 spent fuel rods had been moved from the reactor to the cooling pond.

Another option discussed was to bend them so they could not be readily used in the reactor. It is not clear whether North Korea had agreed to disablement or removal of the fresh fuel, and then balked, or whether it never had agreed to this measure. North Korea told visiting unofficial American delegations in late 2010 that the North would consider shipping out (and selling) the 12,000 fresh fuel rods, most likely to South Korea, if the United States reaffirmed a 2000 Joint Statement which said the United States held no hostile intent toward the North.

This temporary reversal was corrected and equipment moved back to storage by November 2008. Taking into account the need to test the facility (e.g., for leaks and cracks in the piping) and introduce chemicals, experts estimated that restarting the reprocessing plant could take approximately six to eight weeks, although this timeline might be shorter since some initial work may have been done in September 2008. It would then take approximately three to four months to reprocess the spent fuel rods now in storage at Yongbyon, resulting in 7 kg to 8 kg of plutonium. This would be enough for at least one nuclear weapon.

Timelines for restoring the 5-MWt reactor are uncertain, although experts estimate between six months and one year. Rebuilding the cooling tower, which was destroyed in June 2008, could take approximately six months, but other venting solutions for the reactor could be possible. Additionally, this aging reactor may be in need of additional parts or repair. The fuel fabrication facility would have to be restored to produce additional fuel. Former Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratories Siegfried Hecker has said that while significant work is needed to do so, North Korea could restore operations at the 5 megawatt reactor and fuel fabrication facility without foreign equipment or materials, and could do so in approximately six months. After the facilities were operating, they could produce approximately 6 kg of plutonium per year. Dr. Hecker confirmed this estimate again after his visit to North Korea in November 2010.

Security Council, and have supported only \"discussion\" of light-water reactors in the 2005 Six-Party statement.", "The February 29 announcement was the culmination of several rounds of bilateral talks since summer 2011. After the death of Kim Jong Il in December 2011, U.S. officials were uncertain whether the new leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, would agree to terms that were being discussed. Several questions were still to be resolved even before the agreement's collapse\u2014including to what extent North Koreans would grant the IAEA inspectors access to the Yongbyon facilities, and whether the North Koreans would have agreed to U.S. requirements for monitoring of food aid. ", "Additional questions surrounded the potential impact missile and nuclear testing moratoria would have had on North Korea's weapons programs. Some prominent analysts of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs emphasize that halting progress on North Korea's ability to develop a warhead on a long-range missile should be the United States' top priority, and further missile and nuclear testing would be necessary for North Korea to accomplish this. Others point out that weaponization activities and a clandestine uranium enrichment facility or facilities could continue even if a moratorium of testing and activities at Yongbyon was in place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proliferation Issues150", "paragraphs": ["Concerns persist that North Korea will continue its proliferation of missile and nuclear technology for a variety of motivations, including financial profit, joint exchange of data to develop its own systems, and as part of the general provocative trend. According to DNI Admiral Dennis Blair's testimony to Congress in 2009, North Korea is known to have sold in the past ballistic missiles and associated materials to \"several Middle Eastern countries, including Iran, and, in our assessment, assisted Syria with the construction of a nuclear reactor.\" On the likelihood of nuclear proliferation from the DPRK, the DNI assessed that", "Pyongyang is less likely to risk selling nuclear weapons or weapons-quantities of fissile material than nuclear technology or less sensitive equipment to other countries or non-state actors, in part because it needs its limited fissile material for its own deterrent. Pyongyang probably also perceives that it would risk a regime-ending military confrontation with the United States if the nuclear material was used by another country or group in a nuclear strike or terrorist attacks and the United States could trace the material back to North Korea. It is possible, however, that the North might find a nuclear weapons or fissile material transfer more appealing if its own stockpile grows larger and/or it faces an extreme economic crisis where the potentially huge revenue from such a sale could help the country survive.", "Due to concerns of proliferation and North Korea's past track record, the Security Council deliberations on a resolution condemning the May 2009 North Korean test focused on ways to interdict North Korean shipments of missile and WMD-related technologies and prevent their financing. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 calls on all states to \"inspect, in accordance with their national legal authorities and consistent with international law, all cargo to and from the DPRK, in their territory, including seaports and airports,\" if that state has information that the cargo is prohibited by U.N. Security Council Resolutions. This would include cargo related to heavy arms (see UNSCR 1718 (8)(a)) and nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related, or other WMD-related programs. The resolution also calls on states to inspect suspect vessels on the high seas, with the consent of the flag state, and prohibits \"bunkering services\" for such shipments such as refueling or servicing. This is significant because North Korea reportedly ships most goods under its own flag, and typically uses small vessels that would need refueling. Reportedly due to objections by Russia and China, the resolution does not authorize the use of force if a North Korean vessel resists inspection. The resolution also has strict provisions regarding financial services and transfer of funds through third parties, measures that may also help prevent proliferation-related transfers. Resolution 1874 bans all arms transfers from North Korea, and all arms transfers to North Korea except for small arms and light weapons (which require notification). ", "In addition, the Proliferation Security Initiative is a U.S.-led coordinating mechanism that is meant to guide international cooperation in carrying out interdictions of proscribed WMD and missile-related goods, including to or from North Korea. China does not participate in PSI. Therefore, a key question for implementation of the Security Council resolution will be China's commitment to actual interdiction measures and willingness of others to share sensitive information, particularly if Chinese firms are implicated, as has been the case in the past. Also, there is little emphasis on airspace interdictions, which would be relevant, for example, in the case of North Korean shipments passing over Chinese airspace on their way to the Middle East. However, questions remain about the true commitment of China and others to preventing WMD and missile-related transfers to and from North Korea, in particular because North Korea has stated it views any interdiction as an \"act of war.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding154", "paragraphs": ["Congress will have a clear role in considering U.S. funding for any future dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear facilities, as well as other inducements for cooperation as agreed in the Six-Party Talks.

The State Department paid the North Korean government for the labor costs of disablement activities, and also paying for related equipment and fuel. Approximately $20 million was approved for this purpose. NDF funds may be used \"notwithstanding any other provision of law\" and therefore may be used to pay North Korea. DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has been contributing its personnel as technical advisors to the U.S. Six-Party delegation and as technical teams on the ground at Yongbyon overseeing disablement measures.

Due to this restriction, DOE funds cannot be spent in North Korea without a waiver. Congress passed language in the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 110-252 ) that would allow the President to waive the Glenn Amendment restrictions and that stipulates that funds may only be used for the purpose of eliminating North Korea's WMD and missile-related programs. If the President had exercised the Glenn Amendment waiver authority, then DOE \"will be able to procure, ship to North Korea, and use equipment required to support the full range of disablement, dismantlement, verification, and material packaging and removal activities that Phase Three will likely entail.\" NNSA estimated that this would cost over $360 million in FY2009 if verification proceeded and North Korea agreed to the packaging and disposition of separated plutonium and spent fuel at Yongbyon. Because North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test on May 25, 2009, the waiver may no longer be issued under P.L. 110-252 .

It also directs the department to submit a supplemental budget request if additional resources are required during FY2008. However, due to North Korean withdrawal from the Six-Party Talks, Congress did not fund Administration requests in the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations or the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The State Department's NDF, which did receive funding, could be used for denuclearization assistance in the case of a breakthrough in the talks.", "Beyond the Glenn amendment restrictions, Department of Defense funds must be specifically appropriated for use in North Korea.

However, authorization was given for CTR funds to be used globally. The FY2008 Defense Authorization Act specifically encourages \"activities relating to the denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" as a potential new initiative for CTR work. Senator Richard Lugar has proposed that the CTR program be granted \"notwithstanding authority\" for this work since the Defense Department's experience in the former Soviet Union, expertise and resources could make it well-positioned to conduct threat reduction work in North Korea and elsewhere.

Congress could establish reporting requirements on progress, or condition appropriations or disbursement to North Korea upon verification measures.

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has passed resolutions condemning North Korean missile and nuclear tests and imposing increasingly strict sanctions on the already-isolated regime. The resolutions have condemned the tests, and called for North Korea to abandon its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. UNSC sanctions on North Korea primarily ban all trade in military goods and WMD-related and missile technologies, as well as forms of financial support that could contribute to prohibited DPRK weapons programs. However, the UNSC sanctions are not an embargo, and explicit exclusions are made for humanitarian and denuclearization aid. Several problems arise in implementation especially related to Chinese companies' trade in dual-use goods to North Korea.
