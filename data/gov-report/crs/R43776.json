One or more continuing resolutions (CRs) may be enacted if all regular appropriations bills are not completed by that time. This report provides information on the budget enforcement framework for the consideration of FY2015 appropriations measures, the status of the FY2015 regular appropriations bills as of the beginning of the fiscal year, and the enactment of FY2015 continuing appropriations.", "Budget enforcement for discretionary spending under the congressional budget process has two primary sources. The first is the discretionary spending limits that are derived from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25). The FY2015 levels for those limits are about $521.3 billion for defense spending and $492.4 billion for nondefense spending. The second source is the limits associated with the budget resolution on both total discretionary spending and spending under the jurisdiction of each of the appropriations subcommittees. However, Congress has not adopted a FY2015 budget resolution and has instead used an alternative mechanism for budget enforcement that was enacted as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67). On the basis of this mechanism, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees received the total allocation for spending under their jurisdictions, and each reported 302(b) suballocations to its subcommittees prior to floor consideration of the FY2015 regular appropriations bills.", "In the course of the FY2015 appropriations process that occurred during the 113th Congress, the House Appropriations Committee reported all but one of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2015. The House separately considered eight regular appropriations bills on the floor and passed seven of them. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported eight of the 12 regular appropriations bills. Although the Senate began floor consideration of one of these bills, it did not complete it. The Senate did not separately consider any other regular FY2015 appropriations bills prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.", "Because none of the FY2015 regular appropriations bills were to be enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year, a CR (H.J.Res. 124; P.L. 113-164) was enacted on September 19, 2014. This CR generally extended funding at last year's levels, with a small across-the-board reduction and certain enumerated exceptions, through December 11, 2014. Two additional CRs extended temporary funding for all 12 regular appropriations bills through December 13 and December 17 (P.L. 113-202 and P.L. 113-203, respectively).", "The regular appropriations process for 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills was concluded on December 16, 2014, when the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235), Divisions A-K) was enacted. A fourth CR was enacted as Division L of P.L. 113-235 to extend temporary funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only through February 27, 2015. On February 27, a fifth CR (H.R. 33; P.L. 114-3) was enacted to extend temporary funding for DHS through March 6, 2015, after another CR (H.J.Res. 35) was defeated on the House floor. On March 4, 2015, the FY2015 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act was signed into law (H.R. 240).", "This report will be updated during the FY2015 appropriations process as developments warrant.", "For information on the current status of FY2015 appropriations measures, see the CRS Appropriations Status Table: FY2015, at http://www.crs.gov/Pages/AppropriationsStatusTable.aspx."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress uses an annual appropriations process to provide discretionary spending for federal government agencies. The responsibility for drafting legislation to provide such spending is currently divided among 12 appropriations subcommittees in each chamber, each of which is tasked with reporting a regular appropriations bill to cover all programs under its jurisdiction. The timetable currently associated with this process requires the enactment of these regular appropriations bills prior to the beginning of the fiscal year (October 1). If regular appropriations are not enacted by that deadline, one or more continuing resolutions (CRs) may be enacted to provide funds until all regular appropriations bills are completed or the fiscal year ends. During the fiscal year, supplemental appropriations may also be enacted to provide funds in addition to those in regular appropriations acts or CRs. Amounts provided in these appropriations acts are subject to limits, both procedural and statutory, that are enforced through respective mechanisms such as points of order and sequestration.", "The timing and focus of the FY2015 appropriations process was affected at the outset by at least three significant factors. First, the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-67 ) provided set levels for the FY2015 statutory discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense spending. It also provided an alternative basis for procedural budget enforcement in the absence of a budget resolution. This agreement was enacted on December 26, 2013, about nine months ahead of the start of FY2015. At about the time of its enactment, some observers asserted that the earliness with which funding levels had been provided could contribute to the enactment of some or all of the FY2015 appropriations bills before the fiscal year began. In addition, in establishing levels for defense and nondefense spending, some observers suggested that the debate over FY2015 appropriations would be focused on the specifics of funding various agencies and programs instead of on overall levels of budgetary resources.", "The second and third significant factors that affected the start of the FY2015 appropriations process were the late enactment of FY2014 regular appropriations and the delays in the President's budget submission to Congress. Regular appropriations for FY2014 were not enacted until January 17, 2014, more than three months after the beginning of the fiscal year. The President's budget submission followed about six weeks later, roughly one month after it was due. The bulk of the submission occurred on March 4, with additional details provided the following week. The Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) portion of the submission was not provided until June 26. In response to these delays, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees conducted hearings on a condensed schedule to allow committee action on the draft appropriations bills to begin during the months of April and May.", "None of the FY2015 regular appropriations bills were enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year. In the 113 th Congress, the House Appropriations Committee reported 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills, and the House passed seven of these. During that same Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported eight of the regular bills. Although one of them received floor consideration, none was passed by the Senate. Consequently, on September 19, 2014, a FY2015 CR ( P.L. 113-164 ) was enacted into law to provide temporary funding through December 11, 2014. Two further extensions of this CR were enacted to provide temporary funding for all 12 regular appropriations bills through December 13 and December 17 ( P.L. 113-202 and P.L. 113-203 , respectively). On December 16, 2014, regular appropriations for 11 out of the 12 regular appropriations bills were enacted as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (Divisions A-K of ( P.L. 113-235 ); the FY2015 Consolidated Act). A fourth CR was also enacted in Division L of P.L. 113-235 to extend temporary funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through February 27, 2015. ", "Action on FY2015 appropriations also occurred in the early part of the 114 th Congress. On February 27, a fifth CR was enacted to further extend temporary funding for DHS through March 6, 2015 ( H.R. 33 ; P.L. 114-3 ). Full year appropriations for the DHS were ultimately signed into law on March 4, 2015 ( H.R. 240 ).", "This report provides background and analysis on congressional action related to the FY2015 appropriations process.

Enacted discretionary spending may not exceed these limits , which are enforceable through sequestration. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) evaluates enacted discretionary spending relative to the spending limits and determines if sequestration is necessary to enforce either or both of them. For FY2015 discretionary spending, the first such evaluation and any necessary enforcement are to occur within 15 calendar days after the 2014 congressional session adjourns sine die. For any FY2015 discretionary spending that becomes law after the session ends, evaluation and any enforcement of the limits are to occur 15 days after enactment.", "To achieve additional budgetary savings, the BCA as originally enacted included procedures to lower the amount of the initial spending limits for each of the fiscal years from FY2014 through FY2021. However, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended the BCA to set the FY2014 and FY2015 limits at specific levels.

The Appropriations Committee subsequently divides this allocation among its 12 subcommittees, referred to as a 302(b) suballocation. The 302(b) suballocation restricts the amount of budget authority available to each subcommittee for the agencies, projects, and activities under its jurisdiction, effectively acting as a cap on each of the 12 regular appropriations bills.

This allocation was required to be consistent with the FY2015 discretionary spending limits. Section 116 provided similar authority to the Senate Budget Committee chair. Once filed, the allocation would be enforceable as if it had been associated with a budget resolution adopted by Congress. The House statement was filed in the Congressional Record on April 29; the Senate statement was filed on May 5.", "Based upon the budget enforcement provided via this alternative mechanism, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees each reported 302(b) suballocations to their subcommittees prior to floor consideration of the FY2015 regular appropriations bills.
