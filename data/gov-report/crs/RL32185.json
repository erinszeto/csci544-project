UNCLOS was agreed to in 1982, but the United States never became a signatory nation. This report describes provisions of UNCLOS relating to living marine resources and discusses how these provisions comport with current U.S. marine policy. As presently understood and interpreted, these provisions generally appear to reflect current U.S. policy with respect to living marine resource management, conservation, and exploitation. Based on these interpretations, they are generally seen as not imposing significant new U.S. obligations, commitments, or encumbrances, and are seen as providing several new privileges, primarily related to participation in commissions developing international ocean policy. No new domestic legislation appears to be required to implement the living resources provisions of UNCLOS.", "A possible benefit of U.S. ratification would be the international community's anticipated positive response to such U.S. action. In addition, early U.S. participation in the development of policies and practices of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, and the International Seabed Authority could help to forestall future conflicts related to living marine resources. On the other hand, some U.S. interests view U.S. ratification as potentially complicating enforcement of domestic marine regulations, and remain concerned that UNCLOS's language concerning arbitrary refusal of access to surplus (unallocated) living resources might be a potential source of conflict (in addition to concerns about other provisions of the Convention). These uncertainties reflect the absence of any comprehensive assessment of the social and economic impacts of UNCLOS implementation by the United States.", "The Senate may choose to address the ambiguities of UNCLOS with its power to make declarations and statements, as provided for in Article 310 of the Convention. Such declarations and statements can be useful in promulgating U.S. policy and putting other nations on notice of U.S. interpretation of UNCLOS.", "The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported UNCLOS on December 19, 2007, but no action was taken by the entire Senate. In the 111th Congress, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on January 13, 2009, acknowledged that U.S. accession to UNCLOS would be an Obama Administration priority. Later in this confirmation hearing, then-Senator John Kerry, the committee chair, confirmed that UNCLOS would also be a committee priority. However, the Senate took no action on UNCLOS during the 111th Congress. In the 112th Congress, the Administration continued to encourage Senate action on UNCLOS, and Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, was guardedly optimistic, but no action was taken. In the 113th Congress, there has been little or no mention of UNCLOS and no actions have been taken to ratify the treaty."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["On November 16, 1994, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) entered into force, but not for the United States. UNCLOS was the culmination of more than 10 years of intense negotiation. However, the United States chose not to participate in UNCLOS in the early 1980s because of provisions dealing with deep seabed mineral resources beyond national jurisdiction. After a 1994 agreement amended parts of UNCLOS dealing with deep seabed mineral resources, the UNCLOS, Annexes, and Agreement package was formally submitted to the U.S. Senate on October 7, 1994, for advice and consent to accession and ratification (Senate Treaty Doc. 103-39). However, the Senate took no action. More recently, the George W. Bush Administration reiterated support for U.S. accession to UNCLOS. In the 110 th Congress, UNCLOS was reported on December 19, 2007, by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (S.Exec.Rept. 110-9), but the Senate did not take up the measure for ratification.

", "UNCLOS and a subsequent 1994 Agreement on deep seabed mining are extensive, complex documents touching on a wide range of policy issues and U.S. interests. From the perspective of the United States, some of the most significant areas addressed by the Convention deal with naval power and maritime commerce, coastal state interests, marine environment protection, marine scientific research, and international dispute settlement. A number of issues may arise during Senate consideration of UNCLOS, including the question of whether the 1994 Agreement adequately addresses the deep seabed portions of the Convention that were at the core of U.S. opposition to the original UNCLOS. Policy issues relating to areas beyond living resources that are likely to draw Senate attention are discussed more fully in CRS Report RS21890, The U.N. Law of the Sea Convention and the United States: Developments Since October 2003 , by [author name scrubbed], and include", "the dispute settlement process set forth in UNCLOS and the U.S. declarations on dispute settlement; the relationship between U.S. law and various parts of UNCLOS regarding use of the world's oceans; U.S. acceptance of the UNCLOS/Agreement interpretation and application of the common heritage of mankind concept; the provisional application procedures as a precedent in the U.S. treaty process; the nature of U.S. commitments undertaken by a decision of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) Council\u2014what does a council decision commit the U.S. government to do? should Congress have a role and if so, under what circumstances; and the cost and financing of the ISA and U.S. participation therein, now and in the future.", "The remainder of this report focuses on the living marine resource provisions of UNCLOS."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Living Resources Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The living resources provisions of UNCLOS (i.e., those concerning fish, shellfish, sea turtles, and marine mammals) recognize international interdependence on these resources and provide a framework for their cooperative and sustainable management. These provisions, comprising Articles 61 through 73, deal specifically with:", "conservation (Article 61), exploitation (Article 62), transboundary and straddling stocks (Article 63), highly migratory stocks (Article 64), marine mammals (Article 65), anadromous stocks (Article 66), catadromous stocks (Article 67), sedentary species (Article 68), rights of landlocked nations (Article 69), rights of geographically disadvantaged nations (Article 70), non-applicability of Articles 69 and 70 (Article 71), restrictions on transfer of rights (Article 72), and enforcement by coastal nations (Article 73).", "In addition, sedentary continental shelf species are more specifically addressed in Article 77(4), living resources on the high seas are considered in Articles 116-120, and marine habitat protection is provided by Articles 192-196. As presently understood and interpreted, these provisions generally reflect current U.S. policy with respect to living marine resource management, conservation, and exploitation as reflected primarily in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. However, increasingly complex ocean policy is being formulated within the UNCLOS regime, without strong U.S. participation to address U.S. concerns.", "In support of current U.S. maritime policy, the U.S. government, particularly the U.S. Coast Guard, currently expends considerable resources enforcing U.S. and international fishing and living resources laws in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts as well as Hawaii, Howland-Baker, Guam, Northern Marianas Islands, Puerto Rico, and other remote U.S. EEZ areas and in the high seas driftnet area of the western Pacific. Recognizing the existing level of U.S. commitment and based on current U.S. interpretation, the living resource provisions of UNCLOS are generally not seen as imposing significant new U.S. obligations, commitments, or encumbrances involving living resources and their management. UNCLOS could provide several new privileges, primarily related to participation in commissions developing international ocean policy. Some measure of increased stability in international living marine resource policy can be inferred as a beneficial aspect of U.S. participation in the UNCLOS regime. It appears that no new domestic legislation would be required to implement the living resources provisions of UNCLOS."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conservation and Exploitation", "paragraphs": ["UNCLOS recognizes the broad authority of a coastal nation over living resources within its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) to a maximum of 200 miles seaward from the baselines used to measure the territorial sea. In managing living resources, coastal nations are to determine allowable catches and promote optimal resource use. To this end, drafters of UNCLOS were intentionally ambiguous in their attempt to make UNCLOS acceptable to a broad range of constituents. Thus, the terms maximum sustainable yield (Article 61) and optimum utilization (Article 62) are open to broad interpretation and may require further definition to provide additional guidance on how sustainable management of living marine resources is to be attained.", "Except for Article 65, UNCLOS exhibits bias toward optimal exploitation of the resource, with little explicit recognition of non-consumptive management objectives which might reduce harvests to substantially less than optimal or maximum sustainable yield levels. Articles 61(2) and 61(3) do provide a mandatory obligation to ensure that living resources are not endangered by over-exploitation and that threatened species are restored to levels which can produce their maximum sustainable yield. In addition, the phrase \"as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors,\" appearing in Article 61(3), provides a basis for harvesting at rates both above or below the maximum sustainable yield. However, the subsequent examples of how this qualification is to be interpreted focus on ways to protect against overharvesting or other possible justifications for exceeding the maximum sustainable yield, rather than providing any explicit acknowledgment that valid reasons may exist for refraining altogether from harvesting to achieve non-consumptive goals (e.g., tourism in reef environments or biodiversity conservation) or to respond to moral/ethical concerns (e.g., beliefs that large sharks, dolphins, and whales should not be killed). Regardless, determination of allowable catch within a coastal nation's EEZ is not subject to compulsory procedures leading to binding dispute settlement.", "Under UNCLOS, if a coastal nation is unable to harvest the entire allowable catch, other nations must be given access to these resources, subject to appropriate terms and conditions. Resource populations are to be managed such that they can produce harvests at maximum sustainable yield levels. The U.S. Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71801 et seq., now known as the Magnuson-Stevens Act) was crafted to parallel closely most of the draft UNCLOS's provisions for living resources.", "UNCLOS, in Article 61(4), encourages attention to associated or dependent species . If interpreted narrowly, this might encompass incidental bycatch concerns by calling for consideration of these associated or dependent species so that their reproduction is not seriously threatened. More broadly, however, attention to ocean ecosystems would reflect the highly complex web of biological relationships where food chain and commensal associations create intricate interdependencies. Some marine conservation regimes, such as those under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, are sensitive to these concerns and attempt to manage living marine resources from an \"ecosystem\" approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Straddling and Transboundary Fish Stocks", "paragraphs": ["Straddling fish stocks (ranging between national EEZs and international waters) and transboundary stocks are to be managed cooperatively through bilateral or multilateral international agreements involving coastal nations through whose waters these fish stocks range as well as any nations fishing these stocks in international waters. The United States acted in concert with these provisions by negotiating the multilateral Convention on the Conservation and Management of Pollock Resources in the Central Bering Sea (Senate Treaty Doc. 103-27) to govern harvest and management of fish stocks migrating between international waters in the Bering Sea (the \"donut hole\") and adjacent waters under national jurisdiction. An example of an effective bilateral agreement on a transboundary fish stock is the 1953 Convention for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea between the United States and Canada. Concerns remain over attempts to cooperatively manage anchovy fisheries along the United States-Mexico Pacific boundary. The 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (Senate Treaty Doc. 104-24) more specifically addresses concerns for these stocks in a manner consistent with UNCLOS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Highly Migratory Species", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1990, the U.S. position on certain highly migratory species was contrary to that of UNCLOS in that the United States did not claim national jurisdiction over tunas. However, the Fishery Conservation Amendments of 1990 ( P.L. 101-627 ) modified U.S. policy to be consistent with UNCLOS by amending the Magnuson-Stevens Act to extend national jurisdiction to include tunas. Annex I to UNCLOS provides a list of species designated as highly migratory. Article 64 of UNCLOS calls for cooperative management of highly migratory species to ensure their conservation and promote their optimum harvest, within and beyond the EEZ.", "The United States is party to agreements in both the Atlantic and Pacific consistent with the provisions of Article 64. In the Pacific, the 1950 Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica for the Establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission serves this purpose by involving 21 member nations and 1 cooperating non-party (Cook Islands); a 2003 Convention for the Strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (Antigua Convention) has been ratified by 14 nations. The 1966 International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas involves 48 contracting parties and 5 cooperating non-contracting entities. The 1995 Straddling Stocks Agreement more specifically addresses concerns for highly migratory stocks in a manner consistent with UNCLOS and involves 80 nations. More recently, the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean was signed by 19 nations, and entered into force on June 19, 2004; the commission implementing this convention now has 25 members as well as 11 cooperating non-members.

Whales and dolphins are identified in the list of highly migratory species provided in Annex I to UNCLOS.", "Article 65 calls for cooperation with a view to \"conservation.\" In the case of cetaceans, nations are to work through \"appropriate international organizations\" for their conservation. Protection for most cetaceans is provided currently through a moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) under the authority of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.

However, the \"shall take into consideration\" language of Article 61(4) does not mandate strong protective measures.

Fishing for anadromous stocks is prohibited on the high seas, except in cases where economic dislocation might result. Coastal nations through whose waters anadromous fish migrate are required to cooperate with the nations wherein the anadromous stocks originated.

Coastal nation jurisdiction over sedentary species may extend beyond 200 miles, to the extent of the continental shelf (as defined in Article 76). Although the meaning of sedentary is defined, no listing of exactly which species are to be considered sedentary is provided in UNCLOS. Thus, controversy may arise over access to certain species, and dispute resolution provided by UNCLOS may become necessary. Given the current differences of opinion and limited data, additional scientific research may be required to better understand the sedentary nature of certain shellfish, such as scallops.", "Protection for sedentary species is further promoted by Article 136, which states that the seabed, ocean floor, and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are the common heritage of humankind. This implies an obligation to protect the seamounts and hydrothermal vents that support unique ecosystems. This view receives additional support from Article 145, on protecting the marine environment of the seabed, ocean floor, and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and conserving the natural resources of the seabed and ocean floor to prevent damage to flora and fauna.", "Other concerns may arise where the continental shelf beyond 200 miles is shared between nations.

Preventing intentional or accidental introduction of harmful alien or exotic species by all measures necessary is directed by Article 196. In addition, Article 206 requires an environmental impact assessment where parties to UNCLOS have reasonable grounds for believing that planned activities may lead to substantial pollution or harmful changes to the marine environment.", "The various articles of UNCLOS that address pollution are relevant to marine habitat protection. Parties to UNCLOS are to prevent, reduce, and control pollution of the marine environment (Article 194) from land-based sources (Article 207); seabed activities under their jurisdiction (Article 208); and vessels (Article 211).

However, Article 297(3)(c) prohibits a conciliation commission from substituting its discretion for that of the coastal nation. Conciliation procedures are outlined in Article 7(2) of Annex V, which states that a conciliation commission's report, including its conclusions and recommendations, is not binding.", "The history of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), however, merits scrutiny. Article 292, providing for the prompt release of vessels, allows for application to the ITLOS for the prompt release of any vessel flagged by one member that is detained by another member. The vast majority of the cases ITLOS has heard so far have been applications for the prompt release of fishing vessels that have been accused of unauthorized fishing in the EEZ of a member.

One possible benefit of U.S. ratification would be the international community's anticipated positive response to such U.S. action. In addition, U.S. accession to UNCLOS would provide the United States the opportunity to nominate a representative to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and to seek clarification of U.S. continental shelf boundaries, thus addressing concerns related to shared continental shelf areas such as the Bering Sea's donut hole and the Arctic waters of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Furthermore, accession could benefit the United States by allowing U.S. participation in the International Seabed Authority and appointment of U.S. representatives to its various subsidiary bodies. Moreover, U.S. accession to UNCLOS would provide the United States with the opportunity to nominate national representatives as judges on the ITLOS and to fully participate in developing the practices of this important global body.", "As the status of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) is currently in dispute, some suggest that the United States, if ratifying UNCLOS, might offer a declaration recognizing the IWC as the \"appropriate international organization\" to regulate cetaceans as a means to marginalize any competing organizations that might seek to offer an alternative model of cetacean management. Such U.S. action might empower and energize the IWC, an organization that the United States has worked hard to develop as a key marine conservation body. ", "On the other hand, some U.S. interests view U.S. ratification as potentially complicating enforcement of domestic marine regulations. These uncertainties reflect the absence of any comprehensive assessment of the social and economic impacts of UNCLOS implementation by the United States. Although early ITLOS cases do not indicate a problem, some in the United States remain concerned that UNCLOS's language concerning arbitrary refusal of access to surplus (unallocated) living resources might be a potential source of conflict. Additional concerns surround whether and to what extent the United States could regulate ballast water discharges to combat invasive species, supplemental to and in concert with international action taken by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). If UNCLOS is interpreted such that invasive species are covered under the Convention's broad definition of pollution, the United States (and other coastal nations) could be constrained as to what preventive measures could be imposed on ships operating outside our territorial sea.", "Proponents of UNCLOS maintain that U.S. participation in the development of policies and practices of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, and the International Seabed Authority could help to forestall future problems related to living marine resources. In addition, they indicate that the Senate could choose to address some of the intentional ambiguities of UNCLOS drafters with its power to make declarations and statements as provided for in Article 310. Such declarations and statements can be useful in promulgating U.S. policy and putting other nations on notice of U.S. interpretation of UNCLOS. A range of issues where U.S. interpretive statements might be helpful was discussed at a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing on October 21, 2003."], "subsections": []}]}}
