College costs generally refer to what institutions spend to provide education and educational-related services to students. Price commonly refers to what students and their families are charged for higher education and what they pay. As discussed throughout this report, these amounts are not necessarily the same.", "Three distinctions are frequently made in the definition of price. First, there is sticker price . This is the tuition and fees that institutions charge (e.g., the published price). The second distinction is the total price of attendance , which is often referred to as the cost of attendance (COA). This includes the tuition and fees that institutions charge students as well as other expenses related to attending that institution. These expenses may include room and board for on-campus housing, rent for off-campus housing, books, and transportation. A third distinction in the definition of price involves net price . This is what students pay after financial aid is deducted from the total price of attendance.", "Educators and policy makers commonly look at the effects of net price in two ways. The first is a measure of affordability , subtracting only grants from the total price of attendance. Loans remain in the total price of attendance for this measure, as loans must ultimately be repaid by the student or student's parents. This may affect decisions to attend college if students and their families are considering the overall out-of-pocket (today or future) price of college attendance. The second is a measure of access , subtracting all financial aid, including loans, from the total price of attendance. This measure focuses on the amount of money a student would need to attend college in a given year, without considering how much money will ultimately have to be repaid over time. Students generally are awarded financial aid based on merit or financial need. These awards may take various forms, including grants, loans, and subsidized work opportunities. Thus, financial aid may increase access to postsecondary education but not necessarily reduce the ultimate price students will pay to attend.", "For the purposes of this report, the term price generally refers to the sticker price.

Although tuition and fees are an important source of revenue at all types of institutions, other sources of revenue help defray the total costs, and students are then asked to pay significantly less. As shown in Table 1 , for public institutions, the primary source of subsidy revenue is state appropriations (and local appropriations for some community colleges), and public institutions are increasingly relying on private philanthropic support and endowment income as well. Private non-profit institutions rely heavily on donations, income earned from endowments, supplements from affiliated religious organizations, and other sources of support. Private for-profit institutions, by contrast, are most likely to be tuition dependent and to have few other sources of revenue.

Although state support has grown over the past 25 years, public college budgets have grown faster and have come to depend more heavily on sources other than appropriations. Private support, from donations and endowment income, has grown from 3% of public college revenues in 1980-1981 to 7% in 2003-2004. Even as colleges aggressively seek increased private support, over the past two decades, tuition has accounted for an increasing share of revenue.

The E&G expenditures category includes the majority of institutional expenditures across all types of institutions and is part of total current-fund expenditures ( Table 2 ). The E&G expenditure category includes several subcategories such as instruction, research, public service, academic support, student services, institutional support, operation and maintenance of plant, and scholarships and fellowships.", "In 2003-2004, total expenditures for degree-granting institutions were about $315.5 billion, and\u00a0educational and general expenditures were about $239.2 billion, or about 76% of total expenditures ( Table 2 ).

At public and private not-for-profit institutions, spending on instruction accounted for the largest or nearly the largest proportion of expenditures. While instruction also accounted for 29% of expenditures at private for-profit degree-granting institutions, expenditures for student services, academic support, and institutional support composed the largest proportion of expenditures (60%).", "One aspect of institutional expenditures particularly relevant for net price (after deducting grant aid) are institutional expenditures for student support ( Table 2 ).

At four-year public institutions, 45% of full-time undergraduates attended institutions charging less than $6,000. While $6,000 or $9,000 may still be more than most students can afford to pay, the issue of price may be more productively viewed through this lens rather than one colored by the relatively high prices of the most selective institutions in the country. Only 9% of undergraduates attended institutions charging more than $30,000 for tuition (all of which are private institutions).", "There are also public misconceptions about the price of college. For example, a study conducted for the American Council on Education found that the general public substantially overestimates the price of tuition at public institutions. In answering questions about the price of tuition, the average respondent estimate put the price of tuition more than three times higher than the average actual price.", "Increases and decreases in tuition, fees, and financial aid may affect student access to college, choice of schools, affordability, and, ultimately, the completion of a degree or certificate program.

Institutions make up the difference between what students pay and the actual cost of providing an education through subsidy payments supported by other sources of revenue, such as state appropriations, endowment earnings, private donations, and federal grants. Both public and private institutions provide some level of subsidy to students.", "To illustrate how the subsidy works, assume that the cost of education at a given institution is $10,000. The institution receives $8,000 per student in state appropriations and charges $2,000 in tuition; thus, each student is then facing a tuition level of 20% of the actual cost. Thus, all students, even students who pay the full $2,000 in tuition, are subsidized.", "As some researchers have noted, increases in college price do not necessarily mean that costs have increased but could mean that a source of revenue used to support the subsidy has decreased. Returning to the previous example, suppose the next year that the state appropriation per student is reduced to $7,000, while the cost of providing an education remains at $10,000. Tuition is raised to $3,000 to accommodate the change in state appropriations; thus, each student now pays 30% of the actual cost, but tuition has increased by 50%. As discussed elsewhere in this report, the proportion of revenue that institutions derive from tuition and fees has been increasing over time.", "In the previous example, the subsidy came simply from state appropriations, which is the largest source of revenue for public institutions. The largest source of funds for subsidizing education costs at private not-for-profit institutions, however, is investment income from endowments and annual donations. Even public institutions are increasingly relying on philanthropic support for operations and capital projects. By contrast, private for-profit institutions are tuition-dependent and, in keeping with their business model, price the education they provide higher than cost in order to make a profit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "In-State Versus Out-of-State Tuition at Public Institutions", "paragraphs": ["The majority of this report focuses on in-state tuition. Students and families' tax dollars support public institutions in the form of appropriation subsidies to state colleges and universities. Public institutions then grant their state residents a greater subsidy, in the form of lower tuition, than is provided to out-of-state students (who have not paid state taxes). Further, state leaders contend that it is in the best interest of the state to educate its residents in order to subsequently realize long-term human capital gains. Thus, to encourage attendance and increase access to higher education for state residents, institutions charge a lower price for in-state residents than for out-of-state residents.", "Although out-of-state tuition is higher than that charged to resident students, the differences in these two prices vary from state to state. Several states charge out-of-state students tuition at or near the full cost of instruction. Other states index non-resident tuition to the price charged for resident students. Note that although non-resident students are charged a higher sticker price, they still might be subsidized in other ways.

More simply, adjusting for inflation means that the price of tuition in a given year, such as 1981-1982, has been recalculated to determine what the price of tuition that year would have been in today's dollars.", "When increases in tuition are considered in constant dollars (i.e., dollars adjusted for inflation), the increase in tuition over the past 30 years is substantially lower (see Appendix , Table A-1 ). From 1976-1977 to 2005-2006, the tuition increase in constant dollars for all institutions was 140% compared with an increase of 723% in current dollars.

For example, in constant dollars, the increase in tuition at public four-year institutions over this time period was 153% in constant dollars compared with 767% in current dollars.", "An alternative method of using inflation to analyze price is to consider whether price increases are outpacing inflation\u2014whether annual percentage increases in tuition exceeds annual percentage increases in the CPI-U. Any such increase that exceeds the inflation rate can be thought of as an increase that \"outpaces\" inflation. From 1976-1977 to 2005-2006, average tuition at public and private institutions increased by 723%. At four-year institutions, the growth has been even higher, 744%, while it was 599% at two-year colleges. By comparison, the CPI-U grew 243% from 1976 to 2005.

In general, most institutions use the EFC to determine students' financial need by determining the difference between the price of attendance and the EFC. Since this calculation takes the price of attendance into account, a direct relationship between federal aid and price only would be likely if increased financial need resulted in increased federal aid. However, federal grant and loan aid are capped at specific amounts. These amounts generally are lower than the price of attendance at many institutions.

It functions as a tool to examine the purchasing power of colleges and universities. That is, by reporting only price changes, without quality or quantity changes, the index essentially tells institutions how much it will cost to maintain the status quo.", "Although there are several differences between the CPI-U and the HEPI, two in particular are worth considering. First, as previously discussed, most spending by colleges and universities is for personnel, primarily faculty. Salary increases for postsecondary education personnel are different from those included in the CPI-U, which includes urban wage earners and salaried clerical workers. In addition, the HEPI focuses specifically on goods and services purchased by colleges and universities, while the CPI-U also includes housing, transportation, medical care, and other items.

If a certain percentage increase is set as a limit in price increases, institutions with relatively low tuition may be penalized for making small changes in the actual dollar amount being charged to students, while institutions with already high tuition levels may be able to make relatively small percentage increases resulting in relatively large dollar increases without penalty. Similar problems could arise from establishing a specific dollar increase as a price increase limit. One possible way to address these problems, in part, would be to establish an index by which to evaluate percentage increases in tuition and fees, while including an exception for institutions for whom violation of the established requirement is associated with a relatively small dollar increase in tuition and fees. Another issue to consider is that, depending on the implementation timeline of such a policy, in the years just prior to the policy taking place, institutions nationwide may seize on their last opportunities to have relatively large tuition and fee increases (in dollars, percentages, or both) without being subject to penalties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controlling College Costs", "paragraphs": ["College costs, as previously discussed, refer to what institutions actually expend to educate students.
