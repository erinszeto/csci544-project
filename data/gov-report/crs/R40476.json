In general, property at BRAC installations is first subjected to screening for use by the Department of Defense and by other federal agencies. If no federal use for the property can be found or if an application for transfer is rejected, the property is deemed \"surplus\" to the needs of the federal government and made available for disposal through other mechanisms.", "At this point, BRAC property is subjected to two simultaneous evaluation processes: the redevelopment planning process performed by a local redevelopment authority composed of various interested representatives of the community affected by the BRAC action; and a Department of Defense analysis prepared under the aegis of the National Environmental Policy Act and, eventually, informed by the local redevelopment plan.", "As a part of this process, screening of the property must be performed to determine if a homeless assistance use would be appropriate. There are also a variety of \"public benefit transfers,\" under which the property may be conveyed for various specified public purposes at reduced cost. It is also possible to dispose of BRAC property through the use of a public auction or negotiated sale, for which fair market value or a proxy for fair market value must generally be obtained. Finally the law governing the BRAC process authorizes economic development conveyances, through which a local redevelopment authority may obtain the property for specified purposes, sometimes for no consideration.", "The BRAC property transfer process has been altered, both legislatively and administratively, throughout the numerous authorized closure rounds. Most recently, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (P.L. 111-84) amended the law with respect to economic development conveyances at no cost to local redevelopment authorities. This report provides an overview of the various authorities available under the current law and describes the planning process for the redevelopment of BRAC properties."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The nation's military installations have gone through several rounds of base realignments and closures (BRAC), the process by which excess military facilities are identified and, as necessary, transferred to other federal agencies or disposed of, placing ownership in non-federal entities. Since the enactment of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended (Base Closure Act), transfer or disposal of former military installations has been governed by relatively consistent legal requirements.", "On December 28, 2001, a round of base closures was authorized by Congress. The BRAC process requires the Secretary of Defense to prepare and submit a list of military installations recommended for closure or realignment to the congressional defense committees and an independent commission. The independent BRAC Commission, created by the Base Closure Act, is required to review and analyze the Department of Defense's (DOD) recommendations and submit a report to the President with findings and conclusions that accept, reject, and/or modify the recommendations. The President reviews the BRAC Commission report, and upon acceptance of the recommendations, submits it to Congress. If the President fails to submit the recommendations to Congress within the timeframe required under the Base Closure Act, the BRAC process is terminated. Upon receipt of the report from the President, Congress has the opportunity to disapprove of the recommendations through the enactment of a joint resolution. The 2005 BRAC Commission considered 190 separate DOD recommendations, a number exceeding the number of recommendations considered by all previous BRAC Commissions combined. Ultimately, the BRAC Commission recommended a total of 182 closures or realignments with an estimated savings to the taxpayer of $15 billion over 20 years. The recommendations were accepted by the President and forwarded to Congress. Congress did not disapprove of the report and, therefore, the recommendations became law on November 9, 2005.", "The current BRAC law is similar to the original statute and retains many of the transfer authorities that were available in previous rounds. Significant amendments in 1999 and 2001 altered portions of the law's disposal authorities, including requirements related to economic development conveyances. Consequently, DOD promulgated new regulations to implement the property disposal authorities available for the 2005 round. However, in 2009, Congress amended the law as it relates to economic development conveyances requiring DOD to issue revised regulations. This report provides an overview of the transfer and disposal authorities available under the law for military installations closed during the 2005 round, and indicate how amendments to the Base Closure Act have altered the property transfer and disposal process. It also describes DOD's regulations implementing the amended Base Closure Act.

The Base Closure Act directs the Administrator of the GSA to delegate specified transfer and disposal authorities to DOD for use at BRAC installations, and DOD has, in turn, delegated this authority to the various military departments. Thus, BRAC property transfer and disposal is performed, generally, in accordance with the FPASA and the GSA regulations implementing it. In addition, the Base Closure Act authorizes DOD, with GSA approval, to supersede GSA regulations with BRAC-specific regulations.", "Apart from the transfer and disposal authorities typically available for federal property, the Base Closure Act and other provisions of law authorize a variety of other conveyance mechanisms. The available authorities include: public benefit transfers, economic development conveyances (at cost and no cost), negotiated sales to state or local governments, conservation conveyances, and public sales. In some cases, the analysis and use of particular authorities must precede analysis and use of others. On the other hand, there are many transfer and disposal mechanisms that are given roughly equivalent priority; thus analysis and use of them may occur simultaneously.", "In addition to DOD's role in making disposal and transfer determinations, the Base Closure Act also provides a substantial role for states and communities in the property redevelopment planning process.

However, LRAs are responsible for designing a comprehensive plan for reuse of BRAC property, culminating in a redevelopment plan, which is submitted to DOD and included as part of the proposed federal action. While the redevelopment plan is not binding on DOD, it may have significant influence on its disposal decisions, and, in some instances, DOD is statutorily directed to give the plan considerable weight. Local zoning authorities and state land use regulations may also impact the disposal decisions made by DOD.", "The Base Closure Act does not establish statutory requirements for the formation of LRAs. DOD regulations provide that the LRA should have \"broad-based membership, including, but not limited to, representatives from those jurisdictions with zoning authority over the property.\" The regulations further state that \"[g]enerally, there will be one recognized LRA per installation.\" In the event that a LRA is not recognized by DOD, or if the LRA fails to timely submit a redevelopment plan, the Secretary concerned is required to consult with the state's Governor and heads of local governments before proceeding with the disposal of the property according to applicable laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transfers for Federal Utilization", "paragraphs": ["It is DOD policy to act expeditiously under the BRAC process, whether it is the closing or realigning of an installation, in order to facilitate the transfer of real property for community reuse.

The application must support a variety of transfer requirements, including that the property requested be better suited to the requestor's needs than its existing property or other properties and that the transfer would not create a new government program. During the federal screening, the Secretary concerned is required to keep the LRA informed of the progress and to provide contact information for federal agencies so that the LRA may be involved.

If DOD decides it will not retain the property for one of its components, it issues a Notice of Intent to Relinquish. It is then the responsibility of the BLM to determine if the land is suitable to be returned to the DOI or if it should be disposed of under the Base Closure Act.
