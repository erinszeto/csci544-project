{"id": "RL33492", "title": "Amtrak: Budget and Reauthorization", "released_date": "2010-01-29T00:00:00", "summary": ["Amtrak was created by Congress in 1970 to provide intercity passenger railroad service. It operates approximately 44 routes over 22,000 miles of track, 97% of which is owned by freight rail companies. It runs a deficit each year, and requires federal assistance to cover operating losses and capital investment. Without a yearly federal grant to cover operating losses, Amtrak would not survive as presently configured. The crux of the public policy issue facing Congress has been succinctly stated by the Department of Transportation Inspector General (DOT IG): \"To create a new model for intercity passenger rail, a comprehensive reauthorization that provides new direction and adequate funding is needed. The problem with the current model extends beyond funding\u2014there are inadequate incentives for Amtrak to provide cost-effective service; state-of-good-repair needs are not being adequately addressed; and states have insufficient leverage in determining service quality options, in part because Amtrak receives Federal rail funds, not the states.\"", "Amtrak was reauthorized in 2008. Its previous authorization had lapsed in 2002 because of a policy stalemate involving the Bush Administration and Congress. The Bush Administration advocated significant changes to federal passenger rail policy, involving a reduction of Amtrak's role. Those changes were supported by some in Congress, while others supported increased funding for Amtrak, in line with Amtrak's strategy of maintaining its full current network while restoring its infrastructure to a state of good repair. Interest in alternatives to, and complements to, auto and air transportation, spurred by concerns over gasoline supplies and global warming, as well as the Obama Administration's interest in high-speed rail, suggest that Amtrak policy may receive additional attention in the 111th Congress.", "Appropriations. For FY2010, the Obama Administration requested $1.502 billion for Amtrak, which is $600 million more than the previous Administration requested for FY2009. Amtrak itself requested $1.840 billion, which is $350 million more than Congress appropriated last year. Congress provided $1.584 billion for Amtrak FY2010. Congress also appropriated $2.5 billion for intercity and high speed rail grants, for which Amtrak is among the eligible recipients.", "Congress provided $1.490 billion for Amtrak in the FY2009 transportation appropriations act (Division I of P.L. 111-8), $165 million more than the $1.325 billion provided in FY2008. In addition, Congress appropriated $1.3 billion for capital grants to Amtrak, and appropriated another $8 billion for intercity rail infrastructure projects (for which Amtrak is among the eligible recipients) in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5).", "Reauthorization. Amtrak's previous authorization expired in December 2002. In October 2008, the 110th Congress passed an Amtrak reauthorization bill, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (Division B of P.L. 110-432). This bill authorized nearly $10 billion over the five-year life of the bill (FY2009-FY2013) specifically for Amtrak, including $5.3 billion in capital grants, nearly $3 billion in operating grants, and $1.4 billion for debt service. In addition, Congress authorized a total of $1.9 billion over these five fiscal years in intercity passenger rail capital grants to the states on an 80-20 federal/state matching basis. Congress also authorized $1.5 billion in capital grants to states and/or Amtrak for the development of 11 authorized high-speed rail corridors.

However, putting a proposal into action would require further legislation from Congress.

Amtrak is structured as a private company, but virtually all its shares are held by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). Amtrak was created by Congress in 1970 to maintain a minimum level of intercity passenger rail service, while relieving the railroad companies of the financial burden of providing that money-losing service. Although created as a for-profit corporation, Amtrak, like intercity passenger rail operators in other countries, has not been able to make a profit. During the 35 years from 1971-2006, federal assistance to Amtrak amounted to approximately $30 billion. From FY2007-FY2010, Amtrak has received $7.0 billion in federal assistance.", "Amtrak's approximately 19,000 employees operate trains and maintain its infrastructure. The company operates approximately 44 routes over 21,000 miles of track. Most of that track is owned by freight rail companies; Amtrak owns about 625 route miles of track. The section it owns\u2014the Northeast Corridor (NEC)\u2014includes some of the most heavily used segments of track in the nation. Amtrak \"is distinctly a minority user on certain portions of the NEC. By far, the greatest volume of NEC traffic is represented by\" commuter and freight trains. Amtrak operates corridor routes (covering distances under 400 miles) and long-distance routes (over 400 miles in length). Some of Amtrak's corridor routes are supported in part by assistance from the states they serve. Amtrak also operates commuter service under contract with state and local commuter authorities in various parts of the country.", "Amtrak's FY2005-FY2009 Strategic Plan called for more than $8 billion in federal assistance over five years. The Administration consistently requested significantly less funding than that for Amtrak; in FY2006, no funding was requested for Amtrak. But Congress split the difference, providing an average of around $1.3 billion annually\u2014enough to keep Amtrak operating, but not enough to prevent the deferral of some significant maintenance projects\u2014until midway through FY2009, when, with a new Administration that was more supportive of Amtrak, Congress appropriated a total of $2.8 billion, bringing Amtrak's five-year total to $7.9 billion, very nearly the amount called for in the Strategic Plan. Amtrak has not yet issued a Strategic Plan for the period FY2010-FY2014; its FY2010-FY2014 Financial Plan is based on the funding levels in its current authorization.", "According to the Department of Transportation Inspector General (DOT IG), Amtrak needs about $2 billion a year to restore the system to a state-of-good-repair and develop corridor service, or $1.4 billion simply to keep the system from falling into further disrepair. More fundamentally, the DOT IG has stated that a new federal intercity passenger rail strategy is needed:", "The current model for providing intercity passenger service continues to produce financial instability and poor service quality. Despite multiple efforts over the years to change Amtrak's structure and funding, we have a system that limps along, is never in a state-of-good-repair, awash in debt, and perpetually on the edge of collapse. In the end, Amtrak has been tasked to be all things to all people, but the model under which it operates leaves many unsatisfied.", "On November 3, 2005, the GAO released a report that was highly critical of Amtrak's management and performance. On November 9, 2005, Amtrak's President and CEO, David Gunn, was fired by Amtrak's Board of Directors. Gunn was opposed to some of the more far reaching restructuring proposals sought by the Administration and the Amtrak Board, such as splitting the infrastructure component and the operating component on the Northeast Corridor (NEC) into two separate entities. On September 28, 2006, Amtrak's new CEO, Alexander Kummant, testified before the House Railroads Subcommittee that he was committed to operating a national system of trains and that he believed long-distance trains were an important part of the nation's transportation network. He also testified that the fastest growing service was in rail corridors between city pairs of 300-500 miles and that developing these corridors was going to be the driving force of Amtrak's future. Amtrak has demonstrated that rail can play a significant role in intercity passenger travel in certain corridors. Slightly more people travel by train than fly between New York City and Washington, DC, while slightly fewer people travel by train than fly between New York City and Boston."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Oversight of Amtrak", "paragraphs": ["Congress has included provisions in Amtrak's recent appropriations, beginning in FY2003 ( P.L. 108-7 ; 117 STAT 11), intended to bring greater transparency to Amtrak's finances and to increase DOT's control over Amtrak's use of its appropriation. Amtrak is required to submit a Strategic Plan to Congress, updated annually, and is prohibited from making expenditures not programmed in the Strategic Plan without advance notice to Congress. Amtrak is also required to submit a monthly financial statement to Congress. Also, Congress changed the way Amtrak receives its funding; the funding no longer goes directly to Amtrak, but is allocated to the Secretary of Transportation, who makes quarterly grants to Amtrak. Amtrak is required to submit grant applications to DOT for each route to receive this funding.", "Additional requirements were imposed in the reauthorization legislation in 2008 ( P.L. 110-432 ). These include a requirement for performance improvement plans for Amtrak's long-distance routes, periodic reviews of Amtrak's compliance with accessibility requirements, reports on service delays on certain Amtrak routes, and an assessment of Amtrak management's implementation of the provisions of the reauthorization act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Finances", "paragraphs": ["Amtrak runs a deficit of over a billion dollars each year. Virtually all of Amtrak's 44 or so routes lose money but the long-distance routes lose the most. According to the DOT IG, \"in 2004, long-distance trains cumulatively incurred operating losses of more than $600 million (excluding interest and depreciation).\" However, by his calculation, even eliminating long-distance service entirely would only have reduced Amtrak's operating losses by about $300 million, far too little to make Amtrak profitable. In congressional testimony, the DOT IG stated that long distance trains accounted for only 15% of total intercity rail ridership and that 77% of long-distance train passengers traveled along only portions of the routes, not end-to-end trips. Trips mostly ranged from 500-700 miles, slightly longer than corridor trips. The IG estimated that Amtrak could realize \"annual operating savings of between $75 million and $158 million, and an additional $79 million in planned annual capital expenditures that could be avoided\" by eliminating the highly subsidized sleeper class service from its long-distance trains. Sleeper class service includes a sleeping room and prepaid meals in the train's dining car; coach class passengers on long-distance trains sleep in their seats on overnight trips, and usually buy food in the train's lounge car. On October 10, 2006, the DOT IG reported that Amtrak had begun restructuring sleeper class service and expected to save up to $20 million in FY2007 from this restructuring.", "In addition to its annual deficit, Amtrak has major liabilities due to deferred maintenance and accumulated debt. Lacking money to complete all its capital repair and maintenance projects, Amtrak has deferred many maintenance projects. This has led the DOT IG to observe that Amtrak's continued deferral of maintenance increases the risk of a major failure on its system. Amtrak has an estimated $6 billion in backlogged capital maintenance needs, of which about $4 billion is needed on the NEC. These include replacement of aging bridges, signal equipment, and catenary (the power source for the Northeast Corridor trains), improvements to tunnels and track, repair of wrecked equipment, and overhaul of aging equipment. The IG has criticized some of the capital spending choices Amtrak has made, such as refurbishing sleeper cars instead of replacing aging bridges. The Amtrak Reform Council and the DOT IG both estimated that Amtrak requires around $1.5 billion to $2 billion in federal operating and capital support annually. This is a higher level of federal funding than Amtrak has ever consistently received, though Amtrak's current authorization authorizes funding in this range.", "In recent years Amtrak has stopped borrowing, trimmed its workforce, and cut its expenses, while at the same time achieving increases in ridership. However, the cuts in expenses have been small relative to Amtrak's annual deficit, and increases in ridership have been relatively modest as well. In this context, the DOT IG has observed that \"it is difficult to see how Amtrak can achieve further reductions within its Federal operating subsidy without addressing state-supported routes, route restructuring, and labor contracts.\" Amtrak did not gain any flexibility in work rules in its latest labor agreement. While Amtrak competes with freight and commuter railroads to retain its workforce, it competes with the airlines (on its corridor routes) in terms of labor productivity.", "Amtrak's internal options for significantly reducing its annual deficit in the short term are limited. Its two major cost categories are the operating losses of the long-distance trains and maintenance costs of the Northeast Corridor. Reducing the size of its system could, in the long run, significantly reduce Amtrak's deficit and the long-run cost to the Federal Government, although Amtrak would still run a short-term deficit even if it eliminated all its long-distance trains, because of severance payments to employees. Additionally, the costs of maintaining the Northeast Corridor would remain, whatever the fate of long-distance service. Amtrak interprets 49 U.S.C. 24701 to require it to provide service nationwide, which it takes to mean service that spans the nation, rather than service in different parts of the nation. Thus, Amtrak is unlikely to eliminate or restructure long-distance routes without explicit direction from Congress. Many Members of Congress continue to support a nationwide Amtrak network.", "Amtrak's same-route ridership has grown since FY2004. However, it appears unlikely that Amtrak could increase its revenues enough to eliminate its deficits. Total revenues in FY2008 were $588 million more than in FY2004, but total expenses also increased. Amtrak has narrowed its overall annual loss by $128 million, from $1.331 billion in FY2004 to $1.160 billion in FY2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Amtrak appropriations are provided as part of the Department of Transportation funding.

Although various combinations of those options were possible, the DOT IG stated that the \"status quo\" option was unsustainable and that federal funding for Amtrak of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion would be necessary to prevent cuts in service, but would not be enough to restore the system to a state-of-good-repair nor permit investment in new corridor development. In regard to Amtrak reauthorization, the DOT IG urged Congress to consider three points: (1) without competition, Amtrak has few incentives, other than the threat of budget cuts or elimination, for cost control; (2) states, rather than Amtrak, should decide where and how intercity passenger rail service is provided; and (3) the federal government must be willing to provide adequate funding (but not directly to Amtrak) to bring the infrastructure into a state-of-good-repair."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Senate Proposal", "paragraphs": ["In the 110 th Congress, Senator Frank R.
