The Territories' treatment under the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP), however, differs significantly from that of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Prior to 1970 most of the road construction and maintenance activity was financed and carried out by the territorial governments. In 1970, Congress established the Territorial Highway Program (THP) in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-605). The Act authorized the Department of Transportation (DOT) to assist each of the three territories, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa (the Northern Mariana Islands were added to the program in 1978), in a program for the construction and improvement of a system of arterial highways to be designated by each territory's Governor. DOT was also directed to provide technical assistance to each territory to assist in the creation of an appropriate agency to administer the program.", "During the more than 30 years the program has existed the THP's enacting language (23 U.S.C. 215) has basically remained the same but the level of financing varied with each reauthorization. Program funding varied from a low of $4.5 million annually, in FY1970-FY1973 to a high of $36.2 million in FY2003. Some funding from other program sources has also gone to the territories. The Emergency Relief Program, the High Priority Project Program, and certain safety programs have provided funding for territorial highways over the years.", "The arguments generally made in support of federal aid to the territories, including highway aid, are usually framed in terms of the transportation and development needs of the territories and the benefits the territories provide to the United States. The arguments against expanded territorial eligibility under federal-aid highway programs are framed by the territories' exemption from the taxes that support the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), the implications of the territories limited land area, and their non-state status.", "As reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21) ( P.L. 105-178 ), Congress may address a number of options concerning federal highway funding for the territories. The overall issue for the territories is the appropriate extent of their participation in the FAHP. The options range from elimination of the THP to expanding territorial participation in FAHP programs to equal that of the states. Elimination of the THP appears unlikely given the federal commitments to economic development of the territories. On the other hand, the fact that the territories do not pay the taxes that provide revenue to the HTF will probably preclude them from full participation in HTF programs. The Bush Administration proposal, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA)( H.R. 2088 ), would make a number of changes in the THP and retain its authorization at the TEA21 annual level of $36.4 million.

Locally levied fuel taxes supported road projects. The most significant federal involvement in road construction in the territories was limited to the construction of military roads (especially significant for Guam) and provision of disaster relief. During the 1960s, rapid growth in population and motor vehicle use led to increasing traffic congestion which in turn led to interest in establishing a federally financed territorial road program. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-495) directed the Department of Transportation (DOT) to carry out a highway study of Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.", "The report, Territorial Highway Study: Guam, American Samoa, Virgin Islands , released January 7, 1970, revealed that \"concentrations of people and motor vehicles within the compact areas of these island territories produce large volumes of traffic compelled to move over substandard highways at slower speeds and at greater hazard than drivers ordinarily encounter in the states. Traffic growth is currently several times more rapid than the national average.\" The study, however, recommended against any new federal highway grant programs for the three territories. Instead, the report recommended that the territorial governments should themselves finance an expanded highway development program by raising the territorial gasoline tax rates by five cents. It recommended that additional studies be conducted over the following years in order to develop a suitable highway improvement program for each territory, based on its individual needs. The report also recommended that DOT provide technical guidance for each territorial government. Part of the report authors' reluctance to recommend spending significant amounts of federal funds on territorial roads grew out of the constrained fiscal environment of the time. The most significant restraint, however, had to do with the nature of the financing of the federal highway trust fund (HTF) that supports spending on highways in the United States. The HTF is supported by excise tax revenues (mostly from excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel) paid by highway users in the states. The territories, however, do not pay these federal taxes and therefore do not provide revenues to the highway trust fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Territorial Highway Program (THP)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Founding Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Despite the DOT recommendation against the establishment of a federally financed highway program for the territories, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 (FAHA70)(P.L. 91-605), section 112, established the Territorial Highway Program(THP).

In general, population growth and an increase in the number of vehicles on territorial roads has increased traffic congestion in all the territories. Although significant improvements have been made under the THP, some territorial roads continue to be under stress from inadequate capacity while other roads continue to be substandard and hazardous. Because the territories are all islands, much of the road construction is more expensive than in the 50 U.S. states. Remoteness from suppliers is especially a problem for the Pacific territories. In addition, the territories are significantly less well off than the states, have a lower per capita domestic product, and pay higher prices for many basic goods. Advocates of highway assistance to the territories argue that the territories are not wealthy enough to provide for their road infrastructure needs without federal assistance. Supporters also argue that the goal of bringing the territories into economic parity with the states is an established principle of the federal government. Federal highway assistance is seen as falling under this principle. Advocates of assistance also point out that all the territories were acquired for strategic purposes and contend that they continue to be of current or potential strategic value to the United States. Three of the territories, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands are each represented in Congress by a single non-voting representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has no congressional representative. Some advocates of assistance to the territories see a link between this limited representation and what they see as low levels of federal assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Con", "paragraphs": ["The main objection to full or expanded territorial participation in federal-aid highway program (FAHP) is that the territories do not pay the taxes that support the program. The FAHP is funded from the highway account of the HTF. The HTF is supported by highway user taxes (mostly fuel taxes) paid for by highway users in the 50 states. In addition, under TEA-21, each state's percentage share of the aggregate spending on the \"core\" highway programs is adjusted every fiscal year to ensure that each state's share of the apportionments for these programs is at least a 90.5% return on its estimated contributions to the highway account of the HTF. The link that this \"minimum guarantee\" makes between the amount of taxes paid and the federal assistance received, according to some, strengthens the arguments that most FAHP programs should be restricted to the states whose user taxes support the HTF. Opponents of spending HTF money on territorial roads argue that the territories should raise their own territorial fuel taxes to provide for their highway funding needs. Their small size, both in territory and population, compared with the smallest of the states also forms the basis of arguments against expanded program participation for the territories. All four territories' populations combined are less than the population of the state with the least population, Wyoming, whose land area is much greater. Their combined land areas together are only 532 square miles larger than Rhode Island, whose population is more than 2 \u00c2\u00bd times as large. If the territories were allowed to participate in all or most of FAHP programs, they would qualify for the various program minimums which, because of the territories small size, would actually, some argue, be excessively generous. The final argument is simply that the FAHP is based on the assumption of a federal-state partnership that is different than the federal relationship with the territories. From this perspective, federal highway assistance to the territories should be accomplished outside the existing FAHP programs and should not draw from the HTF for funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TEA-21 Reauthorization Options", "paragraphs": ["As the debate over the reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs continues, Congress may address a number of options concerning federal highway funding for the territories.

These programs are much smaller than the main core highway programs and their grants are competed for on a project by project basis or are designated by congressional earmarking. To make the territories eligible, Congress could pass amending language that would define the four territories collectively as a state under one or more of the program sections in Title 23 U.S.C.

This would qualify THP for the NHS minimum allocation equal to \u00c2\u00bd% of NHS and Interstate Maintenance allocations combined.
