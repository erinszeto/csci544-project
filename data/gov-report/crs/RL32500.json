In the Cold War context of the 1950s, a number ofrecommendations sought aggressively to enhance U.S. covert action and counterintelligencecapabilities.

Some forcefully questioned theviability of secret intelligence agencies within a democratic society. These investigations resultedin much closer congressional oversight and a more exacting legal framework for intelligenceactivities.

In addition,the act provided the CIA with the ability to assume an operational role by charging it with: ", "Perform[ing] such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to timedirect.

These proposals have rangedin scope from basic organizational restructuring to the dissolution of the CIA.", "In 1948 and 1949, two executive branch commissions examined the intelligence and operational missions of the CIA, and identified fundamental administrative and organizational loopholes in P.L.80-253. By the 1950s, however, the physical growth and evolving mission of the IntelligenceCommunity led subsequent commissions to broaden the scope of their proposals to include theenhancement of the DCI's community-wide authority, and the establishment of executive andlegislative branch intelligence oversight committees. Unlike the intelligence investigations of the1970s and 1980s, these early studies were primarily concerned with questions of efficiency andeffectiveness rather than with issues of legality and propriety. ", "Following the Vietnam War and \"Watergate,\" investigatory bodies became increasingly critical of the national intelligence effort. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the impetus shifted to the legislativebranch where investigatory committees led by Senator Frank Church and Representative Otis G. Pikeissued a broad range of proposals, including the separation of the DCI and CIA Director positions,dividing the CIA's analytical and operational responsibilities into two separate agencies, and theestablishment of congressional oversight committees. In 1976 and 1977, respectively,recommendations by the these committees led to the establishment of the Senate Select Committeeon Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). Thesecommittees were heavily involved in the investigations into the Iran-Contra affair of the mid-1980s. ", "With the end of the Cold War, and in the wake of the Aldrich Ames espionage case, both the executive and legislative branches undertook studies to determine the future roles, capabilities,management, and structure of the Intelligence Community. These studies include such issues as theneed to maintain the CIA as a separate entity, the extent and competence of U.S. counterintelligence(CI) efforts, and the managerial structure of intelligence components in the armed services and theDepartment of Defense (DOD). A comprehensive examination of the DCI's roles, responsibilities,authorities, and status was also undertaken. In an era of budgetary constraints and shifting policyconcerns, these studies also examined personnel issues, allocation of resources, duplication ofservices, expanded use of open source Intelligence (OSCINT), and the need for maintaining a covertaction (CA) capability. The results of this effort were reflected in organizational adjustments madeby the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY1997 ( P.L. 104-293 ), but some observers havesubsequently concluded that this legislation did not go far enough and that, in the light of the eventsof September 11, 2001 and the Iraq War, intelligence organization questions need to be reevaluated.", "The history of these investigations has witnessed the gradual transformation of intelligence from a White House asset to one that is shared between the executive and legislative branches.
