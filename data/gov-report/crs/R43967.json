The ACA requires HHS to administer a risk corridor program for qualified health plans offered through health insurance exchanges in calendar years 2014-2016.

However, in May 2014, HHS stated that \"other sources of funding\" would be used to make federal risk corridor payments for program year 2015 if collections from insurers were insufficient to cover federal payments.
