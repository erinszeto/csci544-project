Some stated that they did not receive enough exposure to the role of contractors in military operations in the curriculum at professional military educational institutions. An Army commission found that Contracting Officer's Representatives responsible for managing contractors are generally drawn from combat units and receive little, if any, training on how to work with contractors. Many analysts and officials believe that the military did not have enough trained oversight personnel or an adequate infrastructure to effectively execute and manage contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.

We have not thought holistically or coherently about our use of contractors, particularly when it comes to combat environments or combat training. ", "DOD acknowledges that there was no comprehensive plan for how to use contractors, and to what extent. As a result, the use of contractors was done on an ad-hoc basis, without significant consideration of implications for foreign policy and without putting in place the necessary oversight. Observers believe insufficient resources were dedicated to oversight, often resulting in poor performance, billions of dollars of waste, and failure to achieve mission goals. The Commission on Wartime Contracting found that, \"too often using contractors [was] the default mechanism, driven by considerations other than whether they provide the best solution, and without consideration for the resources needed to manage them.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Versus Peacetime Contract Support", "paragraphs": ["Contract support in operational environments is different, and often more complex, than contract support in peacetime. In peacetime, the goal of contracting is generally to obtain the good or service that is required. The measurements of success are generally getting the right good or service, on schedule, and at a fair price. During operations, however\u2014and particularly in an expeditionary or counterinsurgency environment\u2014cost, schedule, and performance are often secondary to the larger strategic goals of achieving military objectives or denying popular support for the insurgency. For example, in peacetime, the primary purpose of building a road is often to have the road built to specification in the most efficient and least expensive way. Other policy considerations may be factored in (such as small business or environmental concerns), but if the road is built on time, on schedule, and to the required specifications, the contract is usually deemed a success. During operations, however, these may not be the right measures, as other goals may be equally or more important. In a counterinsurgency, winning the support of the local village is often more important than staying on schedule; in responding to a humanitarian crisis, rapidly providing critical supplies may be more important than an increase in cost or meeting some technical specifications. ", "Contract risks can also differ greatly between peacetime and operational environments. Peacetime risks generally include cost overruns, schedule slips, and poor performance. Additional risks must be considered when awarding a contract in an operational environment. As then-Commander, International Security Assistance Force, Afghanistan, General John Allen, stated in his contracting guidance to commanders in Afghanistan, it is important to", "look beyond cost, schedule, and performance. Evaluate the success of a contract by the degree to which it supports the Afghan people and economy and our campaign objectives. Include operational criteria in decisions to award contracts, such as the effect of the contract on security, local power dynamics, and the enemy. ", "For these reasons, contract support in an operational environment is often far more complex to execute and difficult to evaluate than contract support in peacetime.", "The goods and services DOD buys during peacetime are very different from those during operations. In FY2012, 49% of all DOD contract obligations were for goods, 41% for services, and 10% for research and development (R&D). By contrast, in Afghanistan, nearly 80% of DOD contract obligations in FY2012 were for services, 16% for goods, and 5% for R&D (See Figure 2 ). Most analysts believe that buying services is more complex than buying goods, adding further complexity to using contractors to support operations. ", "Some of the weaknesses of the current federal government acquisition process can be exacerbated by, and exploited in, an operational environment, making it more difficult to adhere to best practices. These weaknesses include inadequate acquisition planning, poorly written requirements, use of the wrong type of contract, and an insufficient number of qualified and capable acquisition and contract oversight personnel. For example, in an expeditionary environment, it is more difficult to write a good contract that incorporates the sometimes competing goals of counterinsurgency contracting, more difficult to research and evaluate companies bidding on a contract, and more difficult to conduct oversight of projects being built in dangerous locations. It is also more difficult to protect against contracting fraud and corruption in countries that have weak law enforcement and judicial systems. Corrupt officials and warlords can exploit these weaknesses to divert contracting funds to their own coffers.", "Many of the differences between using contractors in peacetime versus in expeditionary operations were not readily apparent prior to military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. One DOD analysis stated that standard acquisition funding procedures and regulations hindered effective execution of contract support in Iraq and Afghanistan. The report went on to state that, over time, virtually all leaders came to realize how different expeditionary operations are from business as usual in the United States. Given the unique needs of DOD during an operation, peacetime contracting may not adequately prepare government personnel for the use of operational contract support. This has led many analysts and DOD officials to believe that the military needs to change the way it thinks about operational contract support, transforming it from an afterthought to a core competency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consequences of Poor Use of Contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["A number of analysts have attempted to quantify the extent of fraud, waste, and abuse in U.S. government contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Special Inspector for Iraq Reconstruction estimated that waste associated with Iraq relief and reconstruction efforts totaled at least $8 billion. The Commission on Wartime Contracting estimated that between $31 billion and $60 billion was lost to contract waste and fraud in contingency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the total cost of contract fraud, waste, and abuse may never be known, there is general agreement that the billions of dollars squandered by numerous federal agencies as a result of insufficient planning, management, and oversight could have been used to achieve other operational priorities.", "Abuses committed by contractors, including contractors working for both DOD and U.S. civilian agencies, can also strengthen anti-American insurgents. There have been published reports of local nationals being abused and mistreated by DOD contractors in such incidents as the summary shooting by a private security contractor of an Afghan who was handcuffed, the shooting of Iraqi civilians, and the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. ", "Insufficient contractor oversight can also undermine military operations. U.S. government investigations found that U.S. money for contracts in Afghanistan has been used to pay the Taliban in exchange for security. The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Agency for International Development found \"indications that Afghan subcontractors... had paid insurgents for protection in remote and insecure areas of Afghanistan.\" The majority report issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs similarly found evidence that U.S. contractors made protection payments to local warlords to secure safe passage of supply convoys. The investigation further found that protection payments may even have gone to the Taliban.
