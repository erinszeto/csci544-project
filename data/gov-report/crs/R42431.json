Congress delegates rulemaking authority to agencies for a variety of reasons, and in a variety of ways. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, as amended) is a particularly noteworthy example of congressional delegation of rulemaking authority to federal agencies. ACA is a comprehensive overhaul of the health care system that includes such provisions as the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, amendments to Medicare that are intended to reduce its growth, an individual mandate for the purchase of health insurance, and the establishment of insurance exchanges through which individuals and families can receive federal subsidies to help them purchase insurance. A previous CRS report identified more than 40 provisions in ACA that explicitly require or permit the issuance of rules to implement the legislation. ", "The rules that agencies issue pursuant to ACA are expected to have a major impact on how the legislation is implemented. For example, in an article entitled \"The War Isn't Over\" that was posted on the New England Journal of Medicine's Health Care Reform Center shortly after ACA was signed into law, Henry J. Aaron and Robert D. Reischauer wrote:", "Making the legislation a success requires not only that it survive but also that it be effectively implemented. Although the bill runs to more than 2000 pages, much remains to be decided. The legislation tasks federal or state officials with writing regulations, making appointments, and giving precise meaning to many terms. Many of these actions will provoke controversy.... Far from having ended, the war to make health care reform an enduring success has just begun. Winning that war will require administrative determination and imagination and as much political resolve as was needed to pass the legislation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mandatory and Discretionary Rulemaking Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The manner in which Congress delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies determines the amount of discretion the agencies have in crafting the rules and, conversely, the amount of control that Congress retains for itself. Some of the more than 40 rulemaking provisions in ACA are quite specific, stipulating the substance of the rules, whether certain consultative or rulemaking procedures should be used, and deadlines for their issuance or implementation. Other provisions in ACA permit, but do not require, the agencies to issue certain rules (e.g., stating that the head of an agency \"may issue regulations\" defining certain terms, or \"may by regulation\" establish guidance or requirements for carrying out the legislation). As a result, the agency head has the discretion to decide whether to issue any regulations at all, and if so, what those rules will contain. Still other provisions in ACA require agencies to establish programs or procedures but do not specifically mention regulations.", "According to the Fall 2011 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (hereafter, Unified Agenda), at least 23 rules have been finalized pursuant to ACA. Although the legislation specifically required or permitted some of the rules to be published, other rules implemented ACA provisions that did not specifically mention rulemaking.

In order for Congress to oversee the rules being issued pursuant to ACA, it must first know that they are being issued\u2014ideally as early as possible. The Unified Agenda is perhaps the best vehicle to provide that early information, describing not only what rules are expected to be issued, but also providing information regarding their significance and timing. ", "Congress has a range of tools available to oversee the rules that federal agencies are expected to issue to implement ACA, including oversight hearings and confirmation hearings for the heads of regulatory agencies. Individual Members of Congress may also participate in the rulemaking process by, among other things, meeting with agency officials and filing public comments. Congress, committees, and individual Members can also request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluate the agencies' rulemaking activities. ", "Another option is the Congressional Review Act (CRA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7801-808), which was enacted in 1996 to establish procedures detailing congressional authority over rulemaking \"without at the same time requiring Congress to become a super regulatory agency.\" The act generally requires federal agencies to submit all of their covered final rules to both houses of Congress and GAO before they can take effect. It also established expedited legislative procedures (primarily in the Senate) by which Congress may disapprove agencies' final rules by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. The definition of a covered rule in the CRA is quite broad, arguably including any type of document (e.g., legislative rules, policy statements, guidance, manuals, and memoranda) that the agency wishes to make binding on the affected public. After these rules are submitted, Congress can use the expedited procedures specified in the CRA to disapprove any of the rules. CRA resolutions of disapproval must be presented to the President for signature or veto.", "For a variety of reasons, however, the CRA has been used to disapprove of only one rule in the 16 years since it was enacted. Perhaps most notably, it is likely that a President would veto a resolution of disapproval to protect rules developed under his own Administration, and it may be difficult for Congress to muster the two-thirds vote in both houses needed to overturn the veto. Congress can also use regular (i.e., non-CRA) legislative procedures to disapprove agencies' rules, but such legislation may prove even more difficult to enact than a CRA resolution of disapproval (primarily because of the lack of expedited procedures in the Senate), and if enacted may also be vetoed by the President.", "Although the CRA has been used only once to overturn an agency rule, Congress has regularly included provisions in the text of agencies' appropriations bills directing or preventing the development of particular regulations. Such provisions include prohibitions on the finalization of particular proposed rules, restrictions on certain types of regulatory activity, and restrictions on implementation or enforcement of certain provisions. Appropriations provisions can also be used to prompt agencies to issue certain regulations, or to require that certain procedures be followed before or after their issuance. The inclusion of regulatory provisions in appropriations legislation as a matter of legislative strategy appears to arise from two factors: (1) Congress's ability via its \"power of the purse\" to control agency action, and (2) the fact that appropriations bills are considered \"must pass\" legislation. Congress's use of regulatory appropriations restrictions has fluctuated somewhat over time, and previous experience suggests that such use may be somewhat less frequent when Congress and the President are of the same party."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
