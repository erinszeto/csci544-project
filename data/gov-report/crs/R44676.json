In 2000, member states of the United Nations made achieving universal primary education one of the eight Millennium Development Goals meant to serve as a development roadmap for both donors and developing countries from 2000 to 2015. Moreover, in 2015, they included quality education as one of the follow-on 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

", "Historically, participant training has been a significant part of USAID's development strategy. Participant training was especially important in building the capacities of developing country government cadres in the first decades after their independence, when there was a scarcity of almost every skill and expertise. Because established educational institutions were lacking in many countries, most participant training was conducted in the United States. As late as FY1993, 14,382 participants were trained in the United States, 5,640 of whom were in formal academic programs (41% Masters, 21% Ph.D.), largely in development priority fields such as industry and engineering (29%), agriculture (27%), and business and public administration (23%). In FY2015, the number receiving U.S. training was sharply diminished largely due to the high cost\u2014only 1,011 participants received long-term U.S. training, another 1,428 received short-term training. Overall, in FY2015, including U.S., host, and third-country training, there were 365,818 participants on long-term programs and 2,371,482 participants on short-term programs, the latter mostly technical training, study visits, and leadership development programs. ", "One of the few higher education scholarship programs still providing education in the United States is the Scholarships for Education and Economic Development (SEED) program aimed at Latin America and the Caribbean. Under SEED, launched in 2008 as a continuation of much larger programs begun in 1984, over 1,340 participants were expected to complete their studies by end of 2015. A 2012 evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the program, however, noted that the cost per beneficiary was high compared to other development assistance programs\u2014a one-year scholarship of U.S.-based academic training cost $25,000 per participant versus $1,000 for workforce development programs conducted in the Latin American region.", "Most workforce programs are linked in some way to specific development goals. In Afghanistan, for example, the USAID program Promote targets \"the education, promotion, and training of a new generation of Afghan women leaders with the goal of increasing women's contributions to Afghanistan's development.\" Among other activities, it includes the following programs:", "Women in Government provides internships for high school and university graduate students interested in working in government with the goal of bringing more women into public service. Women's Leadership in the Economy focuses on workforce and private sector development with the aim of equipping women with the tools they need to contribute to Afghanistan's economic development and poverty reduction goals. Education provides scholarships to 580 women to complete undergraduate and graduate degrees, as well as professional certification programs at American University of Afghanistan or the American University of Central Asia.", "Several agencies provide vocational training in their workforce development programs. The Department of Labor's Engaged, Educated, Empowered, Ethiopian Youth Project (E4Y) (2014-2018) addresses the existence of child labor in Ethiopia, often due to the large portion (80%) of Ethiopian youth who have left school by age 15. To mitigate child labor growth, E4Y seeks to improve educational attainment and provide greater access to appropriate and safe work opportunities for youth engaged in or at risk of child labor. Among other activities, the program provides vocational and skills training; places youth in apprenticeships and appropriate jobs; and assists with job searches. Ultimately, it aims to work with 12,000 Ethiopian youth between the ages of 14 and 17. Of those selected, at least 6,500 will be female and 400 will have disabilities. ", "After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, USAID launched a vocational scholarship and job training program in Indonesia in a partnership with Chevron Corporation to improve the livelihoods of those most vulnerable following the tsunami. It provided scholarships for more than 300 youth\u2014primarily from the Aceh province and the island of Nias\u2014between the ages of 16 and 27 to attend a three-month vocational skill-building training. It offered courses in masonry, electrical installation, bookkeeping, welding, electronic repair, and carpentry, among others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "School Construction", "paragraphs": ["A number of agencies have been involved in school construction programs. The Department of Defense (DOD) undertakes construction projects particularly in areas affected by natural disasters or conflict. U.S. military forces rehabilitated or reconstructed many schools during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2015, during a deployment to Honduras to assist with hurricane disaster relief, Marines completed the construction of three new elementary schools in Puerto Lempira.", "The MCC's 2005-2007 Burkina Faso Threshold Program, aimed at improving girls' education in the 10 provinces that had the lowest number of girls' primary education completion rates, included a schools construction component that built 132 \"girl-friendly\" schools. These schools were intended to create a safe environment for girls by providing separate girls' and boys' bathrooms, on-site canteens, day care centers, and safe access to water.", "Perhaps the most well-known USAID school construction program is the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad (ASHA) program. In existence since the late 1940s, the program provides educational and medical facilities to U.S. affiliated institutions around the world. In the 2013-2014 period, approximately half of the $42 million appropriated for ASHA was committed to education initiatives. Of that, $7 million was dedicated to 12 construction projects. ASHA projects include initiatives at various levels of education from secondary to university level. Individual FY2015 projects include the following examples: ", "construction of a new facility to expand Ashesi University College's engineering program in Ghana; construction of new middle school classrooms, dining halls, and bathrooms, and installation of new water, power, and waste systems for the Abaarso School of Science and Technology in Somalia; extension of an outdoor recreational area and construction of a new, two-story performing arts building for the Hughes Schools in Bolivia; and construction of a library and multimedia resource center designed to improve access to information and promote gender equality at the Dar al-Kalima University College of Arts & Culture in the West Bank."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
