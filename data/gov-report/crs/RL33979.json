A wide range of new services have become available, offered by a growing list of traditional as well as nontraditional providers. One of the results of this transformation is that the nation's expectations for communications services have also grown. In the past, access to the public switched network through a single wireline connection, enabling voice service, was the standard of communications. Today the desire for simple voice connectivity has been replaced by the demand, on the part of consumers, business, and government, for access to a vast array of multifaceted fixed and mobile services. Consumers are also demanding greater flexibility and may choose to gain access to the same content over a variety of technologies, whether it be a computer, a television, or a mobile telephone. The trend towards sharing information, such as music, movies, or photographs, is also growing, making it necessary to ensure that network upload speeds match download capabilities. These advances require that networks transition into converged next-generation wireline and wireless broadband networks capable of meeting these demands. One of the challenges facing this transition is the desire to ensure that all citizens have access to an affordable and advanced telecommunications infrastructure so that all members of American society may derive the benefits.", "Technological advances such as the ability of the Internet to provide data, voice, and video, the bundling of service offerings, the advancement of wireless services, and the growing convergence of the telecommunications sector have, according to many policy makers, made it necessary to reexamine traditional policy goals such as the advancement of universal service mandates.

During the 20 th century, government and industry efforts to expand telephone service led to the development of a complex system of cross subsidies to expand the network and address universal service goals. The underlying goal of the cross-subsidization policy was to increase the number of subscribers to the network by shifting costs among network providers and subscribers. Profits from more densely populated, lower cost urbanized areas helped to subsidize wiring and operation costs for the less populous, higher cost rural areas. Higher rates and equipment charges for business and long distance customers helped to subsidize the charges for residential local calling. The funding for universal service objectives was built into the rate structure, and effectively most telephone subscribers have contributed to universal service goals for decades.", "With the advent of competition and the breakup of the Bell System, the complex system of cross subsidies that evolved to support universal service goals was no longer tenable. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104 - 104 ; 47 USC) codified the long-standing commitment by U.S. policymakers to ensure universal service in the provision of telecommunications services (\u00a7254). The 1996 act also required that every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services be responsible for universal service support [\u00a7254(d)] and that such charges be made explicit [\u00a7254(e)]. The 1996 act also expanded the concept of universal service to include, among other principles, that elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, libraries, and rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services for specific purposes at discounted rates [\u00a7254(b)(6) and 254(h).]"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Universal Service Fund", "paragraphs": ["Over the years this concept fostered the development of various FCC policies and programs to meet this goal.

Three categories of services are eligible for discounts: internal connections (e.g., wiring, routers and servers); Internet access; and telecommunications and dedicated services, with the third category receiving funding priority.

The FCC established the Rural Health Care Division (RHCD) within the USAC to administer the universal support program to comply with these provisions. Under FCC-established rules only public or non-profit health care providers are eligible to receive funding. Eligible health care providers, with the exception of those requesting only access to the Internet, must also be located in a rural area. Similar to the Schools and Libraries program, this support program went into effect on January 1, 1998, and a funding ceiling, or cap, was established, in this case at $400 million annually. The primary use of the funding is to provide reduced rates for telecommunications and information services necessary for the provision of health care.

Under current rules, a carrier's contributions are assessed based on a percentage of its interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues. This percentage is called the contribution factor. The FCC calculates the contribution factor based on anticipated funding needs of the USF in the upcoming quarter. This information is submitted quarterly, to the FCC, by USAC's universal service administrator. The contribution factor is calculated four times a year, on a quarterly basis, and may increase, decrease, or remain the same depending on the needs of the universal service programs drawing on the USF. The FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau releases a public notice stating the proposed factor. After 14 days, absent any FCC action, the factor becomes final. As shown in Table A -1 , from 2003 to the first half of 2005 the contribution factor generally saw a steady increase. During that period the contribution factor varied from a low of 7.3% in the first quarter of 2003 to a high of 11.1% in the second quarter of 2005. Since reaching that high, the factor had begun to moderate; however, the contribution factors for the second and third quarters of 2007, at 11.7% and 11.3% respectively, were a strong reversal of this trend, resulting in a significant increase from the first quarter 2007 contribution factor of 9.7%. Since reaching a high of 11.7% the contribution factor began to moderate with a first quarter 2008 factor of 10.2%. The contribution factor once again began to climb and reached an historic high of 15.5% for the first quarter of 2011. The contribution factor for the second quarter of 2011 at 14.9% and the third quarter at 14.4% represented a slight moderate downward trend. The contribution factor for the fourth quarter of 2011, however, had a significant increase to 15.3 % and represents the second highest rate on record. The overall growth in the factor over this decade remains a significant policy concern. (See \" Policy Options \" section, below, for a discussion of some of the reasons attributed to this increase.)", "There are some exceptions to this funding process. Under the FCC's rules telecommunications providers are not required to contribute in a given year to universal service if their annual contributions to the program would be de minimis, that is less than $10,000 in that year, or if they provide only international services. Filers are also not required to contribute based on international revenues if their interstate end-user revenues meet the 12% rule, that is, if their interstate end-user revenues represent less than 12% of their combined interstate and international end-user revenues. In other cases the FCC has determined that selected categories of providers, for example, wireless carriers and interconnected VoIP providers, may, but are not required to, base their contributions on an FCC-established revenue percentage, or \"safe harbor,\" that attempts to estimate the percentage of the provider's total revenues that are interstate and international end-user revenues. The current (effective June 2006) safe harbor for wireless carriers and VoIP providers is set at 37.1% and 64.9% of total revenues, respectively.", "Many assessed providers have chosen, but are not required, to recover USF contributions directly from their customers. They pass through universal service payments directly to consumers and earmark a universal service charge on subscriber's bills. This is legal and a common industry practice. However, if an assessed provider does choose to collect USF fees directly from their customers the provider is not permitted to recover, through a federal universal service line item on a customer's bill, an amount that exceeds the universal service charge contribution factor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disbursements", "paragraphs": ["According to USAC, universal service support disbursements for calendar year 2010 totaled $8.0 billion.

Schools and Libraries support represented 28.7% of disbursements, totaling $2.3 billion. Low Income support was 16.5% of disbursements, totaling $1.3 billion. Disbursements for Rural Health Care support were $86.0 million, or 1.1% of disbursements. (It should be noted that \"commitments\" for the schools and libraries support program and the rural health care program are not the same as \"disbursements.\" Commitments authorize beneficiaries to spend up to a total dollar figure of USF money committed for procuring telecommunications services, while disbursements pay for specific activities actually carried out and for which beneficiaries have received \"commitments\" of USF support. In the aggregate, applicants end up spending less than the total amounts of dollars committed. Commitments operate on a school year calendar, July 1-June 30, and disbursements are reported on a calendar year basis.)

The data show that service providers (and their subscribers) in every state, territory, and commonwealth received, to varying degrees, some 2009 USF payments. For example, all received at least some payments from the Low Income program, all received support from the Schools and Libraries program, and all with the exception of the District of Columbia and Connecticut received payments from the High Cost program. Payments from the Rural Health Care program were received by 45 states and 3 territories. The allocation of benefits varies depending on which individual program is examined. However, when overall net dollar flow is examined 25 states and the District of Columbia were net contributors to the 2009 USF program as a whole. The service providers in the remaining 25 states and 5 territories were net receivers, that is they received more payments from the USF, for 2009, than estimated contributions. Although there is some variation within programs and among states in any given year, on the whole whether a particular state is a net receiver of, or contributor to, the USF program, is a fairly stable pattern.

The term universal service, when applied to telecommunications, refers to the ability to make available a basket of telecommunications services to the public, across the nation, at a reasonable price. As directed in the 1996 Telecommunications Act [Section 254(c)], a federal-state Joint Board was tasked with defining the services which should be included in the basket of services to be eligible for federal universal service support; in effect using and defining the term \"universal service\" for the first time. The Joint Board's recommendation, which was subsequently adopted by the FCC in May 1997, included the following in its universal services package: voice grade access to, and some usage of, the public switched network; single line service; dual tone signaling; access to directory assistance; emergency service such as 911; operator services; access and interexchange (long distance) service.", "Some policy makers have expressed concern that the FCC-adopted definition is too limited and does not take into consideration the importance and growing acceptance of advanced services such as broadband and Internet access. They point to a number of provisions contained in the Universal Service section of the 1996 act to support their claim. Universal service principles contained in Section 254(b)(2) state that \"Access to advanced telecommunications services should be provided to all regions of the Nation.\" The subsequent principle (b)(3) calls for consumers in all regions of the Nation including \"low-income\" and those in \"rural, insular, and high cost areas\" to have access to telecommunications and information services including \"advanced services\" at a comparable level and a comparable rate charged for similar services in urban areas. Such provisions, they state, dictate that the FCC expand its universal service definition.", "The 1996 act does take into consideration the changing nature of the telecommunications sector and allows for the universal service definition to be modified if future conditions warrant. Section 254(c) of the act states that \"universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services\" and the FCC is tasked with \"periodically\" reevaluating this definition \"taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services.\" Furthermore, the Joint Board is given specific authority to recommend \"from time to time\" to the FCC modification of the definition of the services to be included for federal universal service support. The Joint Board, in July 2002, concluded such an inquiry and recommended that at that time no changes be made in the list of services eligible for universal service support. The FCC, in a July 10, 2003, order (FCC 03-170) adopted the Joint Board's recommendation, thereby leaving unchanged the list of services supported by Federal universal service. More recently, however, the Joint Board was once again called upon to reexamine this issue and came up with a different conclusion. The Joint Board, on November 19, 2007, recommended that the FCC change the mix of services eligible for universal service support and concluded that \"the universal availability of broadband Internet services\" be included in the Nation's communications goals and hence be supported by Federal universal service funds. The FCC in its national broadband plan, Connecting America: the National Broadband Plan , released March 16, 2010, to Congress, has recommended that access to and adoption of broadband be a national goal and has proposed that the USF be restructured to become a vehicle to help reach this goal. (See the \" FCC National Broadband Plan \" section of this report, below, for more details on how the USF could be transformed to help achieve this recommendation.) ", "Other policy makers caution that a more modest approach is appropriate given the \"universal mandate\" associated with this definition. Also at issue is the uncertainty and costs associated with mandating nationwide deployment of such advanced services as a universal service policy goal. Some have expressed concern that given the pressures currently facing the Fund, and their impact on the contribution factor, the inclusion of broadband services, at this time, is taking on too large a mandate. Current policy concerns regarding both the contribution and distribution mechanisms should be addressed first, they state, prior to any expansion of the USF definition. Furthermore, they state, the USF has already taken on limited broadband deployment responsibilities through the E-rate and Rural Health Care programs, and indirectly through the High Cost program, as funding is used to upgrade existing telephone networks. If ubiquitous broadband deployment is a national policy goal, they state, policymakers should not place further stress on the USF program but should seek out other means of achieving this goal which may be more effective, such as providing economic incentives, easing economic regulation, encouraging municipal ownership, expanding other existing programs or establishing a new program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contribution Methodology", "paragraphs": ["One of the major policy questions surrounding USF reform is to what degree, if any, there should be a change in the way the program is funded.

The FCC has taken a number of actions, over the years, to expand the pool of contributors, thereby broadening the base of entities supporting the Fund. For example, in 1998 the FCC established a revenue percentage, or safe harbor, of 15% of revenues for determining the USF contribution for wireless carriers. That percentage has been increased twice since and is currently set at 37.1%. In a June 2006 decision, the FCC further expanded the pool of contributors by requiring that providers of interconnected VoIP contribute to the USF and established a safe harbor of 64.9%. Some policy makers have recommended that the list of providers be expanded to include broadband providers which were removed from the base when the FCC ruled that Internet access services are information services, not telecommunications services.

Although this would provide an additional source for USF funds, many state that this option may not be available absent congressional action to specifically designate intrastate revenues as a source for federal USF contributions. The recommendation for specific congressional clarification is based, to a large part, on a successful court challenge of an earlier attempt by the FCC to collect support for the E-rate program based on combined interstate and intrastate revenues. In the case of Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel v. FCC (183F.3d; 393;1999) the United States Court of Appeals, 5 th Circuit concluded that \"the agency (FCC) exceeded its jurisdictional authority when it assessed contributions for Section 254(h), 'schools and libraries' programs based on combined intrastate and interstate revenues of interstate telecommunications providers and when it asserted its jurisdictional authority to do the same on behalf of high-cost support.\" Proponents of including intrastate revenues cite technological and marketplace changes which have eroded the distinction between interstate and intrastate services as well as the growth of combined calling plans in support of such action.

Opponents, however, state that using a numbers-based approach shifts the burden of USF from high volume users directly to all subscribers as a regressive fixed charge. This, they state, not only adds a financial burden on low volume subscribers, who may be elderly, and/or on low and fixed incomes, but could possibly lead to subscriber drop-off, thereby defeating the purpose of the USF program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Distribution Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Another major issue facing USF reform concerns the eligibility criteria used to distribute USF funds. Over the past 12 years (1998-2010) annual USF receipts have grown from $2.3 billion to an estimated $8.0 billion and the contribution factor needed to support this growth has almost tripled to reach an all time high of 15.5% for the first quarter of 2011. While this factor had experienced a slight moderation the current (fourth quarter 2011) contribution factor is 15.3%,the second highest rate on record. This significant rise in the funding level, and subsequently the contribution factor, has led to an examination of the Fund's eligibility criteria and distribution methodology. More specifically concerns have been voiced over the long-term sustainability of the Fund and the cost burden it imposes on contributors.", "Examination of USF program revenue flows, since 2003, shows that three of the four programs\u2014Low Income, Schools and Libraries, and Rural Health Care\u2014have been relatively stable. However, the High Cost program has experienced significant growth (30.4%), with disbursements increasing from $3,273.2 million to $4,267.7 million over the most recent seven year (2003-2010) period; and as a result, is the major factor contributing to the USF's recent overall growth. Within the High Cost program the growth can be traced to support given to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers. For example, payments for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers, which are largely wireless carriers, increased from $1 million in 2000 to $126.7 million in 2003, but are estimated by USAC to total slightly more than $1.2 billion for 2010. On the other hand, while incumbent eligible telecommunications carriers still receive a significant majority of funds from the High Cost program, revenues disbursed in 2003 and 2010 decreased from $3.2 billion to $3.1 billion. The FCC's May 2008 decision to place an interim cap on High Cost payments to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers has helped to mitigate this trend. (See \" Capping \" section, below, for a further discussion.) A more recent trend which has added to the overall increase in the USF has been the growth, after years of relative stability, in the Low Income program. Disbursements to the Low Income program have increased from $822 million in 2008 to an estimated $1.3 billion in 2010. This recent growth can be attributed, to some degree, to the entrance of pre-paid wireless providers to the Lifeline program. According to the FCC, pre-paid wireless eligible telecommunications carriers now account for one-third of all Lifeline reimbursements. An increase in eligible households, due to the recession, is also a likely contributing factor. Whether this will become a growing trend, placing further pressure on the Lifeline program, or is a limited uptick, is yet to be determined.", "Hence, most policy discussions regarding the distribution methodology focus on proposals to stem the growth of the High Cost Program by limiting eligibility criteria and/or controlling the amount of funding disbursed. A variety of proposals, to be used on their own or in combination, are being discussed including limiting USF support to a single line per household, eliminating the \"identical support rule,\" using reverse auctions to determine eligibility, placing a cap (or ceiling) on funds, and improving targeting. Improving management of all four funds to eliminate any fraud, waste, or abuse, has also been a focus of reform efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Primary or Single Line Limitation", "paragraphs": ["As presently designed, USF support is available to multiple lines per household. Some policy makers have proposed that one way to curb the increase in funding requirements is to limit eligibility criteria. USF funding, they state, should be limited to a single or primary line, not multiple access. The universal service mandate, they claim, is not to artificially construct a competitive marketplace with multiple carriers in areas that are not able to support a single carrier, but to ensure that high cost areas receive service at a reasonable rate. The use of USF funds to support multiple carriers in high cost areas, they claim, is an abuse of funds and places unnecessary strain on those supporting the program. Others, however, have argued that limiting USF support to a single provider relegates those areas to a lower standard, which does not fulfill the universal service principle to afford consumers in rural, insular and high cost areas, access to telecommunications and information services that are \"reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas\" (\u00a7254 [b] [3]). High cost areas, they state, should have the benefits and choices of competition and the opportunity to select from a variety of providers just like other regions of the nation. Line limitations, opponents state, will only discourage investment in rural infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reverse Auctions", "paragraphs": ["One proposal under consideration for selecting an eligible carrier is the use of reverse auctions, or competitive bidding. Under this method a geographic area would be designated as high cost, providers interested in offering service would be asked how little universal service support they would need to provide service and the provider that submits the lowest bid, all else equal, would receive the funds. This approach, in theory, would result in a decrease in funding for High Cost support since it would be based on low bids submitted by providers instead of on the current method that is based on the embedded costs of the incumbent telecommunications provider in the area. This, supporters claim, will lead to the use of the most efficient technology and will relieve the growing pressure on USF funds. However, there is no single methodology that must be used and the reverse auction concept could be designed in a number of ways and impose a variety of requirements and obligations. For example, some support a phased-in approach to reverse auctions where it is used solely to select a competitive carrier for an area while the designated incumbent eligible telecommunications carrier remains under the present system indefinitely, or for a specific time period. Others suggest that an auction system could reward the lowest bidder with the most support, but still give other participants some limited support. Still others suggest the establishment of a pilot program to test for successes and/or unintended consequences. On the other hand, others have expressed reservations about adopting reverse auctions stating that many questions remain about how to implement reverse auctions, how to administer the costs associated with their adoption, and the long-term impact they would have on consumers as well as providers.

High Cost program fund distribution is based on what is known as the \"identical support rule.\" Under this rule funds are distributed to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers based on the embedded costs, or per line support, of the incumbent carrier. Typically the incumbent carrier is a wireline carrier while the competitive carrier is a wireless carrier. The infrastructure costs associated with the investment and maintenance of a wireline system are generally significantly higher than those associated with a wireless system. Therefore some have questioned whether basing funding levels on the incumbent carrier's costs, particularly when support is based on a more expensive infrastructure, is reasonable, or even fair. Switching to a more refined distribution methodology, more reflective of a carrier's actual costs they claim, would help to alleviate some of the pressure facing funding of the High Cost program.

In turn, they state, this will bring stability to the Fund and the USF contribution factor. They note that both the E-rate and the Rural Health Care programs operate under yearly caps, and with the exception of the Low Income program which has been relatively stable, the High Cost program is the only program with no built-in restraints on its growth. Others, however, are opposed to implementing a cap. They point out that placing a cap on an existing program, such as the High Cost program, could lead to confusion and be very disruptive. The dynamic, they state, is very different than capping programs, such as the E-rate and Rural Health Care, at their inception. The High Cost program, they claim, is an ongoing program responsible for providing basic voice service and connection to the network, a fundamental tenet of the universal service mandate. The placing of a cap on this program, they claim, could have significant unintended consequences which could undermine universal service goals.", "The federal-state Joint Board recommended that the FCC immediately impose an interim cap on a portion of the high cost fund. More specifically the Joint Board, in a May 1, 2007, action, issued a recommendation that the FCC place an interim, emergency cap on the amount of high-cost support that competitive eligible telecommunications carriers receive for each state from the High Cost program. The Joint Board recommended that the support be based on the average level of competitive eligible telecommunications carrier support distributed in that state in 2006 and that the interim cap apply until one year from the date that it makes its recommendation regarding comprehensive USF reform. This is seen as a temporary measure to curb the growth of the High Cost program until more permanent action can be taken to reform the USF.

Under this accounting methodology, the government is precluded from incurring obligations prior to the funds being available. E-rate fund commitment letters, which are issued far in advance of actual funds payment, were considered to be obligations. Therefore ADA compliance requires that the funds be on hand to cover obligations and the program was required to have the cash on hand to cover all of the commitment letters. USAC changed the timing of its funds distribution in order to meet this requirement, leading to a temporary four-month suspension (from August through November 2004) of E-rate funding commitments.

Once again this exemption will expire at the close of the first session of the 112 th Congress and Congress may choose to address this issue in a variety of ways. It may continue to enact legislation to provide short-term relief by extending the temporary exemption. Also it could choose to enact legislation, such as S. 297 pending in the 112 th Congress, to provide the USF program with a permanent exemption from ADA requirements, or it may choose to take no further action allowing the temporary exemption to expire, thereby requiring the FCC to ensure, through whatever steps it deems necessary, that the USF is in full compliance with ADA requirements.", "The FCC has resolved, at least temporarily, any compliance problems. Former FCC Chairman Martin, in response to questioning during his September 2006 Senate confirmation hearing, stated that the Commission has concluded that the ADA does apply to the USF.

The chairman and ranking members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Technology have requested, in a June 22, 2011, letter to the FCC, USF data focusing on the High Cost and Low Income programs to assist them to better understand the USF and its operations.", "Three stand-alone measures ( H.R. 2163 , H.R. 3118 , S. 297 ) relating to USF have been introduced to date. Representative Matsui introduced, on June 14, 2011, H.R. 2163 , the \"Broadband Affordability Act of 2011.\" This measure expands the USF's low-income Lifeline program to include subscribership to broadband services at reduced rates. Eligibility requirements are the same as those used for the current Lifeline telephone program. Provisions require the FCC to establish regulations to prevent eligible households from receiving more than a single subsidy per household. The FCC is tasked with establishing the amount of support and determining whether state matching funds will be required for participation as well as determining how broadband service is defined. Broadband service providers are required to obtain FCC authorization to participate in the program, but the program is neutral as to what type of technology is used and does not require a provider to be classified as eligible telecommunications carrier to participate.", "H.R. 3118 , introduced on October 6, 2011, by Representative Farenthold, contains provisions to freeze USF funding at 2011 levels and reform the Low Income program More specifically the bill will: rescind the forbearance authority which is used by eligible carriers to offer prepaid wireless Lifeline service; freeze USF funding at 2011 levels and transfer, on a yearly basis, $500 million of those funds to the General Fund of the Treasury; and implement reforms to the Low Income Program, including the establishment of a database, to help prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.", "S. 297 , introduced February 7, 2011, by Senator Rockefeller, amends Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for a permanent exemption for the USF from the Antideficiency Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["The House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet and the Senate Commerce Committee are among the committees that held hearings on USF reform and the FCC's national broadband plan. Former House Communications Subcommittee Chairman Boucher and Representative Terry released, on July 22, 2010, a bill ( H.R. 5828 ) which addressed comprehensive reform of the USF. H.R. 5828 , the \"Universal Service Reform Act of 2010,\" provided for a major restructuring of the USF. Included among its provisions were those that expanded the USF to include support for broadband services; widened the contribution base to support the USF; required the FCC to develop new cost models for calculating USF support; limited fund eligibility; prohibited the FCC from adopting a primary line restriction; and directed the FCC to establish performance goals and measures for each program to strengthen accountability. The House Communications Subcommittee held a hearing, September 16, 2010, on the measure, but no further action was taken.", "Then-House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Waxman and other committee members also expressed interest in examining USF reform and released USF data requested by committee and subcommittee members from the FCC, focusing on USF support, that is being used to better understand the USF and its operations. ", "Legislation ( H.R. 3646 , H.R. 4619 , S. 2879 ) to expand the role of the USF was introduced. In a move to address the issue of affordability of broadband for low-income households Representative Matsui introduced, on September 24, 2009, H.R. 3646 , the \"Broadband Affordability Act of 2009.\" This measure expanded the USF's low-income Lifeline program to include subscribership to broadband services at reduced rates. Eligibility requirements were the same as those used for the current Lifeline telephone program. The FCC was tasked with establishing the amount of support and determining whether state matching funds will be required for participation.

H.R. 4619 , the \"E-Rate 2.0 Act of 2010,\" introduced February 9, 2010, by Representative Markey, expanded the E-rate program to address access to broadband. This bill created three temporary pilot programs to expand access to broadband by: extending funding to qualifying low-income students for vouchers to be used for monthly service fees for broadband services at home; expanding the E-rate program to include discounts for community colleges and head start programs; and funding an electronic books project. H.R. 4619 also called for the FCC to take steps to \"streamline and simplify\" the E-rate program application process and adjusted the current $2.25 billion annual program cap to account for inflation. ", "S. 2879 , the \"Broadband Opportunity and Affordability Act,\" introduced on December 11, 2009, by Senator Rockefeller, directed the FCC to conduct a two-year pilot program by expanding the Lifeline program, to include broadband services. The FCC was tasked with establishing the amount of support, determining whether state matching funds would be required for participation, and ensuring that the program is technologically neutral in terms of providers. After 18 months of operation the FCC was required to submit a report to the Senate Commerce and the House Energy and Commerce committees on the status of the pilot program. S. 2879 also required the FCC to initiate a notice of inquiry to determine whether the Link Up program should be expanded to reduce the cost of initiating broadband service and report its findings to the Senate Commerce and House Energy and Commerce committees.", "Action to address the Antideficiency Act (ADA) exemption was also undertaken. In keeping with previous Congressional efforts legislation to extend the ADA exemption for one year periods was enacted. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, which was enacted into law ( P.L. 111-117 ), contained a provision to extend the USF ADA exemption until December 31, 2010; this exemption was extended once again, until December 31, 2011, as part of the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011 ( H.R. 3082 ; P.L. 111-322 ).

FCC oversight hearings held by the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, as well as hearings on broadband deployment held by the House Small Business Committee included examination of USF issues. Furthermore, the Senate Commerce Committee held a June 12, 2007, hearing to examine the federal-state Joint Board's recommendation that the FCC place an interim, emergency cap on the amount of high-cost support that competitive eligible telecommunications carriers receive for each state from the High Cost program. (For a further discussion of this proposal see the section on \" Capping ,\" above.)", "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee under the direction of then-Chairman Waxman requested information from industry recipients as part of an oversight investigation of the USF. The inquiry focused on the High Cost Fund portion of the program and requested information from 24 companies that, according to the FCC, are the top 10 recipients of federal high cost funds from 2006 through 2008 as well as the those that have received the 10 highest per-line subsidies, by location, for 2006 and 2007. According to a memorandum Chairman Waxman sent to the committee, he was not accusing any of these companies of wrongdoing, but felt that the gathering of additional information about and committee oversight of the USF program will \"benefit\" the program and \"may offer useful information to the state and federal policymakers as they formulate proposals for USF reform.\" This inquiry, he further stated, \"is consistent with the Committee's strong interest in ensuring accountability in both the government and private sector.\"", "A provision to extend for one year (until December 31, 2007) the USF exemption from the Antideficiency Act (ADA) was passed as part of the FY2007 continuing resolution ( H.J.Res. 20 ) and was signed into law ( P.L. 110-5 ).
