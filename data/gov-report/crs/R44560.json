After its civil war ended, Nicaragua began to establish a democratic government in the early 1990s. Its institutions remained weak, however, and they have become increasingly politicized since the late 1990s. Ortega was a Sandinista (Frente Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional, FSLN) leader when the Sandinistas overthrew the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in 1979. Ortega was elected president in 1984. An electorate weary of war between the government and U.S.-backed contras denied him reelection in 1990. After three failed attempts, he won reelection in 2006 and again in 2011. Ortega consolidated control over national institutions, which facilitated him winning a third consecutive term in the November 6, 2016, presidential elections. The Sandinista-controlled Supreme Court issued rulings that prevented any major opposition force from running against Ortega and the FSLN and allowed Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, to run as his vice president despite a constitutional prohibition against relatives of a sitting president running for office. As in previous elections at all levels in recent years, opposition figures and international analysts strongly questioned the legitimacy of this election.", "As a leader of the opposition in the legislature from 1990 to 2006 and as president since then, Ortega slowly consolidated Sandinista\u2014and personal\u2014control over Nicaraguan institutions. As Ortega has gained power, he reputedly has become one of the country's wealthiest men. His family's wealth and influence have grown as well, inviting comparisons to the Somoza family dictatorship. As president, Ortega has implemented social welfare programs that have benefited Nicaragua's poor\u2014reducing poverty and raising incomes\u2014and thereby buoyed his popularity.", "The United States and other countries have responded in critical but measured terms to Ortega becoming more authoritarian. For many in the international community, Ortega's cooperation on issues of importance to them, such as counternarcotics efforts and free trade, and the relative stability in Nicaragua seem to outweigh Ortega's perceived provocations and authoritarian proclivities. Similarly, in the minds of many Nicaraguans, Ortega's authoritarian tendencies appear to be outweighed by populist measures that have improved their standard of living.", "Although President Ortega's stated goal has been to implement socialism in Nicaragua, which he defines as a mixed economy, he has maintained many elements of a market-based economy. Nicaragua has maintained growth levels above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean in recent years. Over the past decade, poverty has declined significantly. Nevertheless, Nicaragua remains the poorest country in Central America and the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, ahead of Haiti. The Ortega administration is taking steps to prepare for a probable sharp contraction in funds from Venezuela, a major source of government revenues in recent years. Controversy and conflict have been growing over Ortega's decision to grant a 100-year concession for an inter-oceanic canal through Nicaragua to a Chinese company. The government maintains the project will stimulate the economy and provide jobs. Critics argue it will displace rural communities and harm the environment.", "The United States and Nicaragua cooperate on issues such as free trade and counternarcotics. U.S. aid has sometimes been reduced over concern for the narrowing democratic space in Nicaragua. Currently, Nicaragua is part of the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. Tensions rose recently when Nicaragua expelled three U.S. officials. Other U.S. concerns include violations of human rights, including restriction on citizens' rights to vote; government harassment of civil society groups; arbitrary arrests and killings by security forces; and corruption. The Administration and some Members of Congress have expressed concern about Nicaragua's relationship with Russia, especially recent military purchases."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nicaragua's Current Political Situation", "paragraphs": ["Nicaragua began to establish a new democracy in the early 1990s after eight years of civil war in which the United States supported the anti-Sandinista contra movement in the country. Institutions such as a demo cratically elected legislature, a partially independent judiciary (judges are elected by the National Assembly), and an independent electoral council remained weak, however. Since the late 1990s, these institutions have become increasingly politicized. In 1998, the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN, or Sandinistas) and the conservative Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC) made a pact intended to limit participation by other political parties.", "Current President and FSLN leader Daniel Ortega was a member of the junta that took power in 1979 after overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza and was elected president in 1984. As part of a regional peace plan, Ortega agreed to democratic elections in 1990, which he lost to Violeta Chamorro. After losing three successive bids to regain the presidency in 1990, 1996, and 2001 elections, Ortega was elected in 2006. Since then the government has grown increasingly authoritarian in nature. He was reelected in 2011 and 2016.", "As opposition leader in the National Assembly from 1990 to 2006 and during his two subsequent terms as president, Ortega slowly consolidated Sandinista\u2014and his own\u2014control over the country's institutions. The United States and other observers cite municipal and regional elections over this period, and the 2011 presidential elections, as having been flawed and used to strengthen Ortega's control of national institutions. Nonetheless, Ortega and the FSLN have raised the standard of living for much of Nicaragua's poor population, thereby increasing the Sandinistas' popularity and public support. Although numerous observers questioned the legitimacy of the 2011 national elections and the official tally giving Ortega almost 63% of the vote, many also conceded that Ortega most likely would have won even without carrying out fraud. By 2012, the FSLN had achieved \"near complete dominance over most of the country's institutions,\" according to Freedom House. ", "In summer 2016, the government removed some of the last checks on Ortega's power by removing members of the opposition from the legislature, easing Ortega's way to winning a third consecutive presidential term that November. Ortega's popularity may be diminishing, however. Although the official electoral authority reported voter turnout was almost 70%, opponents estimated a much lower turnout of only 30%.", "Ortega was inaugurated to his third consecutive, and fourth overall, five-year term as president on January 10, 2017.", "In early September 2016, Nicaragua granted asylum to former El Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes, who is being investigated for alleged corruption. Funes, of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), said he is fleeing political persecution from rightist elements and is afraid for his safety."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consolidation of Sandinista Dominance Under President Ortega", "paragraphs": ["President Ortega further consolidated not only his party's but also his own dominance with 97 constitutional amendments passed by the FSLN-dominated 92-member legislature in January 2014. The changes eliminated presidential term limits, removed the requirement for at least 35% of the vote to win the presidency in the first round of voting, and limited dissent by banning lawmakers from voting against their own party. Ortega also drafted a new military code and pushed it through the legislature the same month. The constitutional amendments and the revised military code gave the president new powers of patronage and expanded the role of the military in public administration. The armed forces had been the one institution that remained independent from the executive branch. The 2014 code, however, gave the president more influence over the appointment of the army's high command and afforded him the power to appoint active-duty officers to civilian government positions, which the previous code had prohibited. ", "The code also expanded the army's role, under a new \"national security\" framework, in internal security. The military is designated to provide security for the proposed inter-oceanic canal; share management of ports, airports, and telecommunications facilities with civilian agencies; and protect national data systems and ground-based satellite communications. Critics are concerned that these expanded duties could be used to increase surveillance of civilians for political purposes. ", "Ortega further expanded his legal control over state institutions in June 2014, when the legislature approved a reformed law regulating the national police. Although some observers believe Ortega has had de facto control of the police since 2007, the law shifted responsibility for the police from the interior ministry directly to the president. The law also established a vetting process for police recruits through community groups controlled by the ruling FSLN, raising concerns that the police will be used for increased political repression. ", "Opposition groups worry that a prohibition in the police law against \"private investigative activities\" may be used further to impede investigative reporting by the media. According to Freedom House, the Ortega administration \"engages in systematic efforts to obstruct and discredit media critics.\" Journalists are victims of death threats and violence, and complain that the police fail to protect them when they are attacked by pro-government groups at opposition demonstrations. The Nicaraguan constitution impedes freedom of the press by limiting the right of criticism to \"constructive\" criticism. ", "In summer 2016, the government removed some of the last checks on Ortega's power. In June 2016, the Sandinista-controlled Supreme Court issued rulings that prevent any major opposition force from running against Ortega and the FSLN. The court removed opposition leader Eduardo Montealegre as the head of the Liberal Independent Party (Partido Liberal Independiente, or PLI), ruling that Pedro Reyes, the head of a weaker faction, should be recognized as the party's leader instead; Montealegre and others say that Reyes is supportive of the FSLN. The PLI was the largest group within the opposition bloc. In July 2016, the Supreme Electoral Council ousted 16 legislators from the PLI and its ally, the Sandinista Renovation Movement (Movimiento Renovador Sandinista, or MRS) from congress for their refusal to recognize Reyes as their party's leader. The MRS called the decision \"a new blow to completely liquidate political pluralism and make disappear [stet] the opposition voices in parliament ... that have played an important role in denouncing Ortega's abuses of power.\"", "The Sandinista government has defended many of its actions as strengthening the legal system by codifying decrees into law. Opponents and other analysts see the measures as a means to perpetuate Ortega in power indefinitely. Since his long-sought return to the presidency in 2006, Ortega has implemented social welfare programs that have benefited Nicaragua's poor\u2014reducing poverty, raising incomes, and providing subsidies and services\u2014and thereby buoyed his popularity. ", "Today, despite criticism from some quarters within the country and some loss of popularity over the past few years, Ortega remains the most popular political figure in Nicaragua. As his popularity and power increased, so did Ortega's family wealth and influence. Ortega is reputed to be one of the wealthiest men in the country, and his children all own businesses, inviting comparisons to the Somoza family dictatorship the Sandinistas overthrew in 1979. Some press reports claim that President Ortega has lupus or another disease, but he has not disclosed the exact nature of his illness.", "His wife, Rosario Murillo, has considerable power in his administration and is regarded by many observers as a de facto co-ruler. She is the chief government spokesperson and appears almost daily on national television. Widespread speculation that the couple was positioning Murillo to succeed her husband appeared to be validated when Ortega named Murillo as his vice-presidential running mate in August 2016. Critics charge that the couple runs Nicaragua like a fiefdom \u2014charges that were leveled against the Somoza family dictatorship, which the Sandinistas overthrew.", "The opposition is weak and divided, and it is handicapped by FSLN control of the legislature, electoral council, and other aspects of Nicaraguan political life.

Several reasons may account for the lack of a stronger response. Perhaps the principal reason is that Ortega has been very pragmatic in international relations. Politically, he has fostered relations, but not joined in lockstep, with governments critical of the United States, such as Venezuela, Russia, and Iran. But he also carefully balances his antagonistic stance against the United States and parts of Europe with cooperation on issues of importance to these countries and to Nicaragua, such as counternarcotics efforts, free trade, and Central American integration. Economically, Ortega's government has pursued macroeconomic policies that enable it to maintain working relationships with multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. For instance, unlike some of his fellow members in the Venezuelan-led Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA), Ortega has maintained mostly mainstream macroeconomic policies and has not nationalized resources.", "Another reason some countries may not want to press Nicaragua on these issues is that Nicaragua is more stable and less violent than most of its Central American neighbors and there is no clear alternative to Ortega. Although opposition exists, it is divided and so far has been unable to present a coherent alternative to Ortega's governance plans and programs. Essentially, in the minds of many Nicaraguans, Ortega's authoritarian tendencies appear to be outweighed by populist measures that have improved their standard of living.

Ortega, currently 70 years of age, won reelection to a third consecutive term. The constitutional changes he pushed through the legislature mean that presidents have no limit on reelection and can now be elected with a simple plurality. Critics both at home and abroad question the legitimacy of the electoral process. The Consejo Supremo Electoral (CSE, Supreme Electoral Council) issued the electoral calendar without making any changes that the political parties had suggested for improving the process. The regulations did not allow for either domestic or international observation of the elections. In addition, opposition party participation has been eliminated or severely restricted. Ortega began another five-year term when he was inaugurated on January 10, 2017; by 2018, he will have been president for more than 16 years\u2014longer than Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda, founder of the dictatorial dynasty that Ortega helped to overthrow.", "In April 2016, two principal opposition candidates withdrew from the race. Fabio Gadea, who officially won 31% of the vote in the 2011 elections, announced that he would not run on the center-right Partido Liberal Independiente (PLI, Liberal Independent Party) ticket again, as had been expected. Gadea, aged 84, cited a lack of transparency in the electoral process as the basis for his decision. The PLC candidate, Noel Vidaurre, also unexpectedly withdrew from the race, reportedly saying that longtime PLC leader Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n's decision to name his wife and other close associates as candidates for deputy would undermine efforts to revive the party's image. Alem\u00e1n was president from 1997 to 2002 and was prosecuted by the subsequent Bola\u00f1os administration for embezzling about $100 million in public funds while in office. Without these candidates at the head of their ticket, the opposition parties' chances in legislative elections were hurt as well. After the 2011 elections, the PLI had 22 out of 91 seats in the National Assembly and the PLC had 2 seats. A June 2016 poll had each of these parties garnering just 5.6% of the intended votes, to the FSLN's 65%.", "Despite this sizeable lead, the Sandinista government continued to take steps that further crippled the opposition. The Sandinista-controlled Supreme Court issued rulings in June 2016 that prevent any major opposition force from running against Ortega and the FSLN. The court removed opposition leader Eduardo Montealegre as the head of the PLI, ruling that the head of a weaker faction\u2014but one Montealegre says is supportive of the FSLN\u2014should be recognized as the party's leader instead. The PLI had joined other parties in a Coalici\u00f3n Nacional por la Democracia (National Coalition for Democracy, or CND); Montealegre and the other party leaders denounced the Supreme Court's ruling as an effort to keep them out of the 2016 electoral race. The Supreme Court then invalidated both factions seeking control of the small Partido de Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana (Citizen Action Party), the only other party in the coalition with legal standing under which the coalition might have run candidates. In July 2016, as mentioned above, the government ousted 16 members of the PLI and MRS from the legislature.", "On September 6, 2016, having been prohibited by the court from participating in the elections, the election-oriented coalition disbanded. Some members of the CND launched a protest movement, Citizens for Liberty, which, along with the MRS and other groups, boycotted the November 6 presidential election, calling it an \"electoral farce.\" ", "Other organizations expressed concern about the Supreme Court's decisions, including the principal private-sector lobby, COSEP; human rights groups, such as the Nicaraguan Human Rights Center; and the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua.

International donors and institutions have raised concerns about the lack of transparency of funds from Venezuela and the use of those funds for political patronage by Ortega, sometimes suspending or reducing aid in response to those concerns. A sharp contraction in funds from Venezuela, a possibility due to the drop of oil prices to historic lows and to political troubles in Venezuela, could seriously harm Nicaragua's economy. The Ortega administration is preparing for that possibility, however. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the Ortega administration has \"curtailed some subsidies, removed others from off-budget expenditure and attracted new sources of external finance\" \u2014including international financial institutions.
