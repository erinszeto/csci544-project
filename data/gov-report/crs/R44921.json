Decentralized Nature of the Threat. Many domestic terrorists rely on the concept of leaderless resistance. This involves two levels of activity. On an operational level, militant, underground, ideologically motivated cells or individuals engage in illegal activity without any participation in or direction from an organization that maintains traditional leadership positions and membership rosters.

This report focuses especially on how domestic terrorism is conceptualized by the federal government and issues involved in assessing this threat's significance. Today (perhaps in part because of the government's focus on international terrorist ideologies), it is difficult to evaluate the scope of domestic terrorist activity. For example, federal agencies employ varying terminology and definitions to describe it. ", "Possibly contributing to domestic terrorism's secondary status as a threat at the federal level, a large number of those labeled as domestic terrorists do not necessarily use traditional terrorist tactics such as bombings or airplane hijackings. Additionally, many domestic terrorists do not intend to physically harm people but rather rely on alternative tactics such as theft, trespassing, destruction of property, and burdening U.S. courts with retaliatory legal filings.", "While plots and attacks by foreign-inspired homegrown violent jihadists have earned more media attention, domestic terrorists have been busy as well. It is worth noting that in terms of casualties on U.S. soil, an act of domestic terrorism is second only to the events of 9/11. Timothy McVeigh's bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, claimed 168 lives and injured more than 500 others. Some estimates suggest that domestic terrorists are responsible for carrying out dozens of incidents since 9/11. Much like their jihadist counterparts, domestic terrorists are often Internet savvy and use the medium as a resource for their operations. ", "Terrorists are typically driven by particular ideologies. In this respect, domestic terrorists are a widely divergent lot, drawing from a broad array of philosophies and worldviews. These individuals can be motivated to commit crimes in the name of ideas such as animal rights, white supremacy, and abortion, for example. However, the expression of these worldviews (minus the commission of crimes) involves constitutionally protected activity. ", "Aware of the lines between constitutionally protected speech and criminality, domestic terrorists often rope themselves off from ideological (above-ground) elements that openly and often legally espouse similar beliefs. In essence, the practitioners who commit violent acts are distinct from the propagandists who theorize and craft worldviews that could be interpreted to support these acts. Thus, in decentralized fashion, terrorist lone actors (lone wolves) or isolated small groups (cells) generally operate autonomously and in secret, all the while drawing ideological sustenance\u2014 not direction \u2014from propagandists operating in the free market of ideas.

For example, in 2011, Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Michael P. Downing included \"black separatists, white supremacist/sovereign citizen extremists, and animal rights terrorists\" among his chief counterterrorism concerns. A 2014 national survey of state and local law enforcement officers found that sovereign citizens were \"the top concern\" among terrorist threats.

According to this perspective, a bombing plot involving U.S. citizens motivated by a foreign terrorist group such as Al Qaeda or the Islamic State constitutes domestic terrorism. While this conceptualization may be true at some level, a practical definition of domestic terrorism distilled from federal sources is much narrower. It suggests that domestic terrorists are Americans who commit ideologically driven crimes in the United States but lack foreign direction or influence\u2014whether tactical or philosophical. This conceptualization excludes homegrown individuals directed or motivated by groups such as Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. Second, what particular groups are considered domestic terrorist organizations? The U.S. government does not provide a precise, comprehensive, and public answer to this question.

Section 2331(5) more narrowly defines \"domestic terrorism\" and differentiates it from international terrorism and other criminal activity. This definition comes from Section 802 of the USA PATRIOT Act ( P.L. 107-56 ). According to 18 U.S.C.

The ideologies supporting eco-extremism and animal rights extremism (discussed below) readily come to mind, and people have long committed crimes in their names outside the United States. At least in part, their origins lay in the United Kingdom. Nazism\u2014with its German origins and foreign believers\u2014is an element within domestic white supremacist extremism. Anarchism, the philosophy followed by anarchist extremists, also has long-standing European roots. The racist skinhead movement traces its origins abroad\u2014to the United Kingdom\u2014as well.

Third, the federal government appears to use the terms \"terrorist\" and \"extremist\" interchangeably when referring to domestic terrorism. It is unclear why this is the case.

A 2009 study (critiqued by DOJ) found that the U.S. federal district courts, DOJ's National Security Division, and federal prosecutors rely on different criteria to determine whether or not specific cases involve terrorism at all. ", "A bit more narrowly, in many instances, individuals considered to be domestic terrorists by federal law enforcement may be charged under non-terrorism statutes, making it difficult to grasp from the public record exactly how extensive this threat is. Regarding the prosecution of domestic terrorism cases, no separate federal crime of \"domestic terrorism\" exists. Also, DOJ has noted that, \"[a]lthough we do have at least one specialized [federal] statute aimed at animal enterprise terrorism, domestic terrorism cases often involve firearms, arson or explosive offenses; crimes relating to fraud; and threats and hoaxes.\" In some instances, the crimes committed by people the FBI describes as domestic terrorism suspects do not violate federal law. When this occurs, the Bureau, \"support[s] [its local] partners any way [it] can\u2014sharing intelligence, offering forensic assistance, conducting behavioral analysis, etc.\" Thus, individuals considered domestic terrorists by federal law enforcement may not necessarily be federally charged as terrorists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sifting Domestic Terrorism from Other Illegal Activity", "paragraphs": ["It may not be possible for investigators to describe the criminal activity involved early in an investigation as domestic terrorism. In these instances, investigators can work toward clarifying the motives of the suspects involved. Domestic terrorism cases differ from ordinary criminal activity in key ways. Most importantly, unlike ordinary criminals\u2014who are often driven by self-centered motives such as profit and tend to opportunistically seek easy prey\u2014domestic terrorists are driven by a cause or ideology. If the motives involved align with the definition laid out in 18 U.S.C. Section 2331(5), presumably the case becomes a domestic terrorist investigation. In some instances, ideologically motivated actors can also collaborate with profit-driven individuals to commit crimes.", "To further cloud matters, another category of criminal activity, hate crime, may appear to involve ideological issues. However, as described by one federal official, a \"hate crime\" \"generally involve[s] acts of personal malice directed at individuals\" and is missing the broader motivations driving acts of domestic terrorism. For investigators, distinguishing between \"personal malice\" and ideologically motivated actions may be difficult in specific cases. This suggests that sorting domestic terrorism from hate crimes depends on the degree of a suspect's intent. Did the suspect articulate an ideology belonging to an extremist movement? The grey area between domestic terrorism and hate crime hints that in some instances, suspects with links to domestic terrorist movements or ideologies supporting domestic terrorism may be charged with hate crimes. It is unclear to what extent this influences how the government understands the threat posed by extremist movements that hold racist beliefs. If some individuals of this ilk commit crimes against police or judges, for example, is the government more apt to label this activity as terrorism while individuals sharing these same racist motivations but targeting ordinary citizens based on race, religion, disability, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation are charged with hate crimes?

National security expert Jonathan Masters has suggested that many law enforcement officials likely view \"extremism\" as largely synonymous with \"terrorism.\" Masters has also found that there is a \"lack of uniformity in the way domestic terrorist activities are prosecuted\" in the United States. Presumably, using the term \"extremist\" allows prosecutors, policymakers, and investigators the flexibility to discuss terrorist-like activity without actually labeling it as \"terrorism\" and then having to prosecute it as such. This flexibility is certainly an asset to prosecutors. They can charge subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations under a wider array of statutes without having to convince a jury that the accused were terrorists. However, for policymakers this flexibility makes it hard to determine the scope of the domestic terrorist threat. One cannot get a clear sense of scope if some individuals are charged and publicly described as terrorists, others are discussed as extremists, and still others enter the public record only as criminals implicated in crimes not necessarily associated with terrorism, such as trespassing, arson, and tax fraud.

However, a lack of official lists or processes to designate groups or individuals as domestic terrorists makes it difficult to assess domestic terrorism trends and evaluate federal efforts to counter such threats. In 2011, an unnamed DHS official cited in a news report stated that \"unlike international terrorism, there are no designated domestic terrorist groups. Subsequently, all the legal actions of an identified extremist group leading up to an act of violence are constitutionally protected and not reported on by DHS.\" Constitutionality aside, the lack of a list may also contribute to a certain vagueness in the public realm about which groups the federal government considers domestic terrorist organizations.

Most animal rights extremists and ecoterrorists also eschew physical violence directly targeting people or animals. Regardless, crimes committed by ecoterrorists and animal rights extremists have caused millions of dollars in property damage, and some have involved the intimidation and harassment of victims.

The ALF and the ELF are too diffuse to be called groups. Neither the ALF nor the ELF maintains formal rosters or leadership structures, for example. However, each communicates a sense of shared identity and attracts people who commit crimes in its name. They achieve this via \"above-ground\" wings. Largely using websites, ALF and ELF supporters publish literature highlighting movement philosophies, tactics, and accounts (press releases) of recent movement-related criminal activity. Much of this involves protected speech and occurs in the public realm. Press releases allow \"underground\" extremists to publicly claim responsibility for criminal activity in the name of either movement while maintaining secrecy regarding the details of their operations.

The decision-making process is anarchist, that is to say, egalitarian, participatory, deliberative, and consensual.\" An affinity group often consists of a circle of friends. The friends coalesce around a specific objective and break apart when they achieve their desired ends. Individual groups can band together in \"clusters\" and clusters can coordinate their efforts, if need be. The efforts can be legal or illegal, violent or nonviolent, covert or open. These structures have a long history among anarchists, but other movements use them as well. Also, anarchists can engage in what they call \"black bloc\" tactics. These involve secretive planning for public\u2014often criminal\u2014activity in which participants, typically dressed in black, act en-masse.

This critic suggests that describing vandalism or arson as terrorism and not ordinary crime dampens constitutionally protected protest activity by people who support animal rights or radical environmentalism but do not engage in criminal activity. In essence, this position argues that the U.S. government is encouraging a \"green scare\" by labeling the activity of movements such as the ALF and the ELF as terrorism or extremism.

Additionally, these arguments assume that \"true terrorism\" is fundamentally different from animal rights terrorism. While it is true that animal rights terrorism, as a whole, does not engage in the same scale of violence as other extremist groups, those working in academia, research, agriculture, and food service industries are no less fearful when their homes and workplaces are firebombed; violent tactics can instill fear even when they are used infrequently."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Assessing Domestic Terrorism's Significance", "paragraphs": ["Domestic terrorist attacks have come nowhere near the devastation of 9/11.

", "However, independently acting domestic terrorism suspects are not necessarily isolated, adrift, and cut off from any outside contact or influence. Some take ideological cues from broader movements or groups espousing extremist ideas. These groups or movements publicly disavow violent criminal behavior and engage in constitutionally protected activities. This dynamic\u2014the interplay between above-ground groups or movements proffering extremist dogma or ideology (protected speech) that is then consumed and acted upon by independent underground groups or cells who commit crimes\u2014is a critical feature of domestic terrorism."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Leaderless Resistance", "paragraphs": ["Within the domestic terrorism realm, the notions of decentralized activity received attention in the 1980s and early 1990s when white supremacist Louis Beam circulated his theories of \"leaderless resistance.\" He saw leaderless resistance as a means to transform the white supremacy movement. Beam described it as a means of avoiding law enforcement infiltration of white supremacist groups, and he suggested two levels of leaderless movement activity. First, on an operational level, militant, underground, ideologically motivated cells or individuals (lone wolves) engage in movement-related illegal activity without any centralized direction or control from an organization that maintains traditional leadership positions and membership rosters. Second, on another level, the above-ground public face (the \"political wing\") of the movement propagandizes and disseminates ideology\u2014engaging in protected speech. In this system, underground cells or lone wolves would be responsible for their own actions, and the public face of the movement would not be held accountable.", "Online comments from the leadership of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement (NSM) offer a specific example of an above-ground movement avoiding violence and the terrorist label. The NSM's leader has posted the following statement on the group's website:", "I want it made perfectly clear to all of our members, supporters, prospective members, readers, etc. that the National Socialist Movement condemns illegal actions and in such we do not endorse any acts of violence or terrorism.

This book can be seen as an above-ground product that motivates underground cells or individuals to commit crimes. The book has partly inspired a number of violent acts by white supremacist extremists and anti-government extremists. ", "The Turner Diaries predates the widespread acceptance of the \"leaderless resistance\" concept. However, its lasting place in the neo-Nazi and anti-government extremist movements highlights how leaderless resistance works. Pierce's book has been described as \"the most widely read book among far-right extremists.\" The novel reflects the author's own racist religious philosophies. Perhaps 500,000 copies of the book have been sold. In it, Pierce emphasized that the current racial order of things had to be cataclysmically destroyed and reborn in accordance with white supremacist ideals. To convey this message, he devised his book as the edited diaries of neo-Nazi character Earl Turner. As such, Turner's story is annotated by a fictionalized editor, one Andrew Macdonald. The novel describes Turner leading a terrorist group whose actions trigger a race war that results in the overthrow of the government\u2014controlled by Jews in Pierce's construction. Turner also initiates a nuclear war that wipes out earth's non-white human inhabitants. The atomic apocalypse allows for the rebirth of a revitalized white race. ", "The book has informed the activities of domestic terrorists. In September 1983, white supremacist Robert Mathews formed a small underground group known as The Order. Its inspiration came from passages in The Turner Diaries. The group planned for and engaged in what it viewed as a revolution. Over the next 15 months, The Order went on a violent crime spree. Among other crimes, it robbed banks, armored cars, electronic stores, a truck stop, and a video store, and allegedly gave some of the spoils to Richard Butler, who was at the time the leader of the WSE group Aryan Nations. The Order also bombed a synagogue and murdered a Jewish talk show host, Alan Berg, before it was dismantled by federal law enforcement. ", "Anti-government extremist Timothy McVeigh, an avid reader of the book, had passages from the Turner Diaries with him when he was arrested. The 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City mimicked one described in the novel and involved a small cell of underground conspirators. Sales of the book allegedly rose after the bombing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The ALF, the ELF", "paragraphs": ["The concept of leaderless resistance has been mirrored by other extremist movements in the United States. Both the ALF and the ELF have rejected recognizable leadership structures or hierarchies and follow a leaderless resistance model instead, making their activities more difficult for law enforcement to investigate. According to the model, above-ground elements in the movements provide guidelines and an ideological platform that underground individuals (lone wolves) or independent cells can draw upon to motivate their own criminal actions. Exercising First-Amendment rights, the above-ground components of the ALF and the ELF lawfully communicate shared identities largely via websites. As one scholar has suggested for the ELF, this possibly creates a broad consensus focused on a very specific cause and avoids internecine conflicts over ideological fine points. Much like the NSM, the above-ground elements of the ALF take pains to distinguish themselves from criminal activity. For example, NAALPO states: ", "Disclaimer: The Animal Liberation Press Officers do not engage in illegal activities, nor do they know any individuals who do. Rather, the Press Office receives and posts communiqu\u00e9s from anonymous parties and provides comment to the media.", "Additionally, the above-ground literature of both the ALF and the ELF suggests that independent cells avoid communication with one another.

As one scholar has suggested, this parallels franchising in the business world."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lone Wolves", "paragraphs": ["Some domestic terrorists are \"lone wolves.\" This can be seen as a form of leaderless resistance. One scholar has offered a succinct conceptualization: ", "Lone wolf terrorism involves terrorist attacks carried out by persons who (a) operate individually, (b) do not belong to an organized terrorist group or network, and (c) whose modi operandi are conceived and directed by the individual without any direct outside command hierarchy.", "Lone wolves have committed crimes in the names of a number of domestic terrorism movements. For example, according to the FBI, when it comes to violence attributed to white supremacist extremism, lone wolves play a prominent role. Lone wolves filter in and out of WSE groups. They can either get dismissed from these groups because of their \"violent tendencies\" or voluntarily leave because they find the organizations too passive. There is little research on the lone wolf phenomenon and no universally accepted definition of the term. ", "The above definition stresses how lone wolves operate. Just as critical is what they believe. Lone wolves can hew to broader ideological causes and use them to justify their actions. This suggests that lone wolves potentially adopt the ideas of broader terrorist movements while not claiming formal membership in them. Divining exactly what \"formal membership\" constitutes leads to debate regarding whether or not some individuals acted as lone wolves or part of larger movements. For example: ", "On January 29, 2010, Scott Roeder (also discussed above) was convicted of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault for killing abortion provider George Tiller. Roeder allegedly had \"connections with militant abortion foes but few formal ties with known groups.\" Some supporters of abortion rights consider his contacts among anti-abortion adherents as evidence of possible conspiracy. Meanwhile, some anti-abortion activists have stressed that Roeder was a lone wolf. He remains the only person convicted in Tiller's murder. Described as a neo-Nazi and white supremacist, James von Brunn reportedly shot and killed a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, in June 2009. In January 2010, the 89-year-old von Brunn died in federal prison before he could be tried.", "Because lone wolves are not plugged into terrorist organizations, distinguishing them from individuals who commit hate crimes can also be difficult. In these cases, as mentioned above, the FBI likely attempts to determine whether the motives involved were personal (hate crime) and not focused on broader ideologies (domestic terrorism). "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Law Enforcement Challenges Posed by Lone Wolves", "paragraphs": ["Lone wolves present particular challenges to law enforcement. Because lone wolves, by definition, operate alone, it can be difficult for law enforcement to assess exactly which radicalized individuals intend to turn their beliefs into action and pursue terrorist activity. One former FBI counterterrorism official has said: ", "The lone wolf is arguably one of the biggest challenges to American law enforcement. How do you get into the mind of a terrorist? The FBI does not have the capability to know when a person gets up in middle America and decides: \"I'm taking my protest poster to Washington or I'm taking my gun.\"", "Aside from intent, it is also hard to assess the operational capability of potential lone wolf terrorists\u2014knowledge of explosives, familiarity with firearms, or experience in surveillance, for example. Lone wolves do not participate in terrorist networks or training camps that can be infiltrated or whose communications can be traced. They do not rehearse their schemes or practice their criminal skills with conspirators who can potentially act as cooperating witnesses. To attempt to overcome these issues, the FBI asserted in 2009 that it was \"beginning an extensive study on identified lone offenders to come up with indicators and behavior predictors that investigators can use to assess suspects.\"", "Not all of the news for law enforcement regarding lone wolves is necessarily dire. They have weaknesses. Their lack of tradecraft may make it harder for lone wolves to engage in large-scale attacks. Likewise, lone wolves do not necessarily experience the reinforcement of a closely knit terrorist social network. They cannot rely on others to assist them in any type of complicated plot. ", "Regardless, apparent lone wolf attacks can be lethal. For example, in March 2017, James Harris Jackson, allegedly acting alone, used a two-foot-long sword to stab to death Timothy Caughman, an African American individual who Jackson is said to have encountered while trolling New York City for victims. According to New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr., Jackson \"prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism....\" Jackson, who reportedly espoused white supremacist beliefs, faces state-level murder and terrorism charges. Aside from the 2016 shooting by Gavin Long, the 2010 actions of Scott Roeder, and the 2009 shooting involving James von Brunn (described above), other evidence suggests the lethality of lone wolf violence: ", "According to one scholarly examination, between 1990 and April 2009, \"far-rightists\" were responsible for the deaths of 42 law enforcement officers\u2014most from state and local agencies in the United States. Most of the incidents involved firearms, and most of the assailants acted alone . Richard Poplawski shot and killed three Pittsburgh police officers in April 2009. He has been described as a \"white supremacist\" lone wolf. He had posted anti-government messages on racist websites. On January 21, 2009, Keith Luke allegedly shot and killed two Cape Verdean immigrants and raped and shot a third. Police arrested him before he could attack a synagogue, as he planned. Luke purportedly informed police that he had decided to go on his spree after reading about \"the demise of the white race\" on a neo-Nazi website. He reputedly said that he was \"fighting for a dying race\" and that he had been planning the attack for six months.", "Lone wolves do not necessarily have to focus on gun-related crimes. Kevin Harpham's case illustrates as much. On March 9, 2011, law enforcement officers arrested Kevin Harpham (discussed elsewhere) and charged him in connection to a bomb concealed in a backpack and placed along the route of a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day March in Spokane, WA. In September 2011, Harpham pled guilty to committing a federal hate crime and attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. Media reports and watchdog groups have indicated that Harpham had ties to white supremacists. Allegedly, he was a member of the neo-Nazi National Alliance in 2004. The group denied that he was still a member. Harpham had also been in contact with Paul Mullet, leader of a white supremacist group active in Athol, ID. Mullet said that he and Harpham spoke many times but that the latter never joined Mullet's group. Harpham reportedly made postings on white supremacist websites and read The Turner Diaries .", "Also, lone wolf activity is not solely the domain of purported white supremacists. Another case illustrates the kind of attack a domestic lone wolf animal rights extremist can commit: ", "In November 2010, Walter Bond pled guilty to two felonies stemming from an April 2010 arson that destroyed a store known as the Sheepskin Factory in Glendale, CO. Speaking from jail, Bond condemned the business, which sold sheepskin products, as engaging in \"blood trade\" and drawing profits \"from the death and exploitation of suffering animals.\" Bond worked alone. A web posting claimed the arson \"in defense and retaliation for all the innocent animals that have died cruelly at the hands of human oppressors.\" Apparently, Bond strongly identified with the notion of being a lone wolf. The ATF, working with a confidential informant, recorded Bond discussing the fire and the fact that he actually used the nickname \"Lone Wolf.\" In a jailhouse letter, Bond stated, \"I used the name 'ALF Lone Wolf' in the media to convey to my ALF brothers and sisters worldwide (whoever they are) the power of acting alone.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Scoping the Threat Remains Difficult for Policymakers", "paragraphs": ["As this report suggests, at least three factors may make it hard for policymakers to form a baseline evaluation of the domestic terrorism threat from publicly available information.

Presumably, using the term \"extremist\" allows lawyers, policymakers, and investigators the flexibility to discuss terrorist-like activity without actually labeling it as \"terrorism\" and then having to prosecute it as such. However, this may lead to inconsistencies in the development and application of the law in the domestic terrorism arena.

Regardless, this stands in stark contrast to the world of international counterterrorism, where the United States maintains a well-established\u2014legally and procedurally proscribed\u2014regimen regarding the identification of foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs). ", "Official FTO designation benefits counterterrorism efforts in a number of ways. Most importantly, it facilitates the prosecution of those who provide material support to listed foreign terrorist groups. Arguably, because there is no domestic terrorism equivalent of FTO designation, it is more difficult to press material support charges against domestic terrorists. In 2010, one scholar was unable to identify any material support cases involving \"a domestic terrorist group or its supporters.\" According to the Department of State, FTO designation has other effects. It ", "1. Supports [U.S.] efforts to curb terrorism financing and to encourage other nations to do the same. 2. Stigmatizes and isolates designated terrorist organizations internationally. 3. Deters donations or contributions to and economic transactions with named organizations. 4. Heightens public awareness and knowledge of terrorist organizations. 5.

", "While there is no official designation process for domestic terrorist organizations , as it stands, DOJ and the FBI have publicly named and discussed domestic terrorism threats \u2014such as animal rights extremism or anarchist extremism\u2014without illuminating exactly how they arrive at these categories. Federal lawmakers may opt to consider the feasibility of officially formalizing this process and/or opening it up to greater oversight. An attempt to render this process less bureaucratically opaque might simultaneously (1) enhance federal efforts to combat domestic terrorism and (2) help protect civil rights and civil liberties. For example, such a list may potentially offer agencies outside of DOJ\u2014including relevant players at the state and local level\u2014formal opportunities to provide input into ranking domestic terrorism threats while enshrining mechanisms by which individuals who believe in the philosophies undergirding a designated threat could petition to have that threat \"de-listed.\" On the other hand, making this process more open may take away the FBI's flexibility to rapidly adapt its domestic terrorism priorities, especially if threats quickly mutate.
