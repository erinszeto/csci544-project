The more stringent AECA controls, administered by the StateDepartment,apply to encryption items classified as defense articles or services. Items not so classified are subject to regulationby theDepartment of Commerce (DOC) under the extended EAA authorities. DOC requires licenses for certaincommodities andsoftware, but allows other encryption items to be exported under license exceptions.", "The U.S. Government has traditionally maintained that controls over strong encryption are necessary for nationalsecurity, foreign policy, and law enforcement reasons. Industry has argued that federal regulatory policiesinsufficientlyaddress rapid technological developments, prevent manufacturers from marketing products available abroad, andharm U.S.national interests by making strong U.S. encryption unobtainable by legitimate users worldwide. While mostencryptionwas originally controlled under the AECA, in late 1996 the President transferred jurisdiction over nonmilitary itemstoDOC, which at the same time eased controls over commercial encryption that used a key recovery feature or wasdestinedfor financial institutions. In 1998 the Administration further relaxed controls over 56-bit technology generally andstrongerencryption destined for U.S. subsidiaries, insurance companies, and other end-users, retreating from earlier keyrecoveryrequirements. Further modifications were announced in September 1999, allowing license exceptions for the exportofencryption of any key length after a technical review to most end-users in all but terrorist countries; draft regulationswereissued in late 1999. Following criticism by companies, privacy groups and Internet proponents, DOC expandedaspects ofits original proposal and issued new regulations in January 2000. Regulations issued in October 2000 furtherstreamlinedcontrols over encryption exports to 23 countries including European Member states. Restrictive export licensingregulations have raised constitutional concerns, some arguing that they impose a prior restraint on speech inviolation of theFirst Amendment. Federal courts have both upheld and dismissed First Amendment challenges to export controls,theoutcome generally turning on whether the court viewed the encryption item and its export as essentially expressiveorfunctional. Courts in California and Ohio have allowed challenges to proceed, holding that encryption source codeisprotected speech for First Amendment purposes.", "Legislation introduced in the 106th Congress would have required increased liberalization of encryption export controls. H.R. 850 , the Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act, was reported fromthe HouseJudiciary Committee, House Commerce Committee (as amended), and House International Relations Committee(asamended); significantly more restrictive versions of the bill had been reported by the House Armed ServicesCommitteeand House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ( H.Rept. 106-117 , Pts 1-5). S. 798 , the PromoteReliable On-Line Transactions to Encourage Commerce and Trade (PROTECT) Act of 1999, was reported favorablyandwithout amendment by the Senate Commerce Committee ( S.Rept. 106-142 ). No further action was taken on thesebills.

(1) It may also be used forauthentication (confirming the identity of the sender) and data integrity (ensuring that a message has not beenchanged intransit). Contemporary encryption is generally based on an algorithm paired with a \"key\" -- usually a string of 40to 128bits -- which together protect messages from computer-based descrambling by outsiders.", "Keys may be secret or public. Under the former, both the sender and the recipient share an identical key. A public keysystem involves a related pair of keys, one of which is published in a public directory and the other remaining withthesender or recipient. Public key systems are useful for encrypting messages in large and open computer networkssuch asthe Internet, where individual users may not have previous knowledge of one another. Key escrow or recoverysystemsmake it possible for parties other than those who are party to an encrypted conversation or who encrypt data forstorage tohave access to the secure material. This capability is viewed favorably by law enforcement since key access enablesauthorities to decrypt so-called \"real time\" messages without the knowledge or consent of parties to acommunication or todecrypt stored data for investigatory purposes. Key escrow or recovery systems may also be of general commercialbenefitin the event a key is lost, stolen, or destroyed.", "The development and use of strong computerized encryption in the United States was originally limited to the federalgovernment for military and intelligence applications. (2) Eventually, the increasing use of computers for commercialpurposes led to a need for stronger commercial encryption as well. In 1971, IBM completed the development ofa ciphercode with a 128-bit key, turning it into a marketable product by 1974. At the same time, the federal governmentbegan tosolicit bids for an encryption algorithm that could be used as a federal standard for storing and transmittingunclassifieddata - known as a data encryption standard (DES). IBM reportedly responded with a 56-bit key and othermodificationsafter discussions with the National Security Agency (NSA), the federal entity responsible for communicationsintelligence,which had earlier taken considerable interest in its project. As stated in a Senate report, NSA \"certified that ... [therevisedIBM cipher] was, to the best of their knowledge, free of any statistical or mathematical weaknesses\" (3) and recommended itfor use as the new DES.", "Critics suggested possible vulnerabilities in the shortened key and pointed out the inherent (and continuing) dilemma in theconfrontation of governmental and business interests in the area. One author states that \"[s]ince the DES wouldeventuallybe manufactured commercially and installed on a wide assortment of equipment sold abroad, the NSA would notwant tocut its own throat by permitting the foreign proliferation of an unbreakable cipher. Yet weaknesses in the cipherwould stillallow the Agency to penetrate every communications link and data bank using the DES, American as well asforeign.\" (4)", "While the current DES is based on a 56-bit key, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1997 beganto develop an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a key length of from 128 to 256-bits. (5) In October 2000, NISTannounced its choice for this new AES algorithm - the Rijndael - which will be proposed for incorporation in a newDraftFederal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). Following a public comment period and any subsequent revisions,theSecretary of Commerce will decide whether to adopt the FIPS as an official government standard. (6)", "With the growth of the global economy, the business community has continued to express a need for strong encryption fordomestic use and cross-border communications and transactions. While there are no statutory restrictions on thedomesticuse of encryption, the computer industry argues that restrictive export controls have hampered U.S. technologicaldevelopment since it is impracticable to develop separate products for the domestic and foreign market; that exportrestrictions will hinder its long-term competitiveness, given the increasing availability of strong foreigncryptography andthe projected increase in demand for such products due to the increasing popularity of electronic commerce; andthat U.S.interests are harmed by making increasingly strong U.S. encryption unavailable to legitimate users worldwide. (7) At thesame time the federal government argues that because of its national security and law enforcement responsibilitiesit shouldnot facilitate the proliferation of encryption despite its foreign availability and the increasing capability of privatecomputerusers to invade encrypted systems. (8) TheAdministration has advocated the development of a key managementinfrastructure (KMI), in which third-parties would maintain an extra key to an encrypted system, as an indispensableelement of worldwide use of public key encryption. (9) In response to such proposals, business, consumer, and privacygroups have expressed numerous concerns over the governmental role in determining who may hold escrowed keysandover who may obtain access to encrypted transactions and data. The Administration has since deemphasized theuse ofexport controls to foster KMI development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Export Controls over Encryption", "paragraphs": ["Encryption had traditionally been treated as a munition subject to Cold War export restrictions imposed by theCoordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom). Encryption currently appears both as amunition and adual-use item on lists maintained by CoCom's successor, the 33-member Wassenaar Arrangement. (10) A Cryptography Noteto the dual-use list added in December 1998 requires Wassenaar members to review exports of mass markethardware andencryption with a key length greater than 64 bits in light of their respective export control regimes; this policyreplaces theearlier General Software Note, which did not restrict the export of mass market encryption software. (11)", "Encryption is subject to U.S. export controls under both the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA). Section 38 of the AECA, 22 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 2778, authorizes the President to controlthecommercial export of defense articles and services and to establish a United States Munitions List (USML)delineatingthese articles. The AECA is administered by the State Department through its Office of Defense Trade Controls(DTC), asub-unit of the Department's Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs. (12) The Department implements the Act through theInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITARS), set forth in 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 through 130. Arms exportersmustregister with the federal government and obtain licenses before items may be exported. The designation of itemsas defensearticles and defense services for regulation under the AECA is not judicially reviewable. (13) Unlike the EAA, the AECAdoes not require foreign availability to be taken into account in licensing decisions. Section 38 provides thePresident withstrong enforcement authorities and authorizes stringent criminal and civil penalties for those who violate the AECAand itsimplementing regulations. The NSA has played a role in the licensing process, advising as to the national securityimpactof an export and examining such factors as the sensitivity of a product and its end users; it has also providedtechnicaladvice in the determination of whether an item belongs on the USML. (14)", "In implementing the AECA, the State Department may decide that a product is not defense-related and transferjurisdiction over that item to the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) of the Department of Commerce(DOC). (15) TheExport Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), which was recently reauthorized until August 20, 2001, authorizes theCommerce Department to control exports for national security, foreign policy, and short supply reasons. (16) Items subject toEAA regulation are listed in the Commerce Control List (CCL), 15 C.F.R. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 799.1, Supp. No. 1.", "Originally, virtually all encryption was classified as a defense article and regulated under the AECA. (17) In the early 1990'sthe Department of State had exempted from AECA control nine types of encryption (including smart cards andencryptionfor use in financial transactions) and transferred authority over these items to the Commerce Department. (18) Jurisdictionover encryption exports could also be transferred to DOC for mass market software under an expedited commodityjurisdiction procedure (19) and as a result ofcase-by-case review. (20) As a general policy, theState Department allowedexports of commercial encryption with 40-bit keys, although some software with DES could be exported toU.S.-controlledsubsidiaries and financial institutions. (21)", "The Clinton Administration announced a new encryption policy in October 1996, giving DOC jurisdiction over allcommercial encryption, though subject to conditions many of which were similar to those imposed under the AECA( e.g. ,EAA foreign availability provisions were inapplicable). (22) The President's Executive Order made approvals subject to aninteragency review process and gave the Justice Department a vote in determining encryption export policy. Keyrecoveryencryption of unlimited key length could be exported as could 56-bit non-recovery encryption if the manufactureragreed todevelop a recovery system within 2 years. In May 1997, DOC eased controls over encryption for financial purposes,announcing that, after a one-time review, it would approve exports of unlimited key length \"specifically designedto supportfinancial transactions\" and, for 2 years, strong general purpose non-recovery encryption \"when used for interbankandsimilar financial transactions\" once producers agreed to develop a recoverable product. (23)", "In 1998, the Clinton Administration changed its key recovery policy, allowing the export of 56-bit encryption to alldestinations except embargoed/terrorist countries under a license exception after a one-time agency review andwithout acommitment to produce a key recovery product. While a license exception continued to be available for encryptionofunlimited key length that contained a key recovery feature, a requirement that the government pre-approve a keyrecoveryagent was eliminated. In addition, the favorable export treatment previously granted financial institutions wasextended toinsurance companies, health and medical end-users, and, with some end-use restrictions, on-line merchants. Following aone-time agency review, U.S. companies could also export encryption of any key length for internal companyproprietaryuse to their subsidiaries in all but embargoed destinations. Products of any key length for use by commercial entitiesinsome 45 countries and, for companies headquartered in 22 countries (including the United States), their worldwidesubsidiaries located anywhere but in embargoed destinations, were exportable after review. This policy also allowedtheexport of \"recoverable\" encryption, that is, encryption that allows access to plaintext by law enforcement and others,butdoes so without a key recovery feature. The Administration also announced plans to establish a technical supportcenterrun by the FBI to provide federal, state, and local law enforcement with the funds and expertise needed to deal withdevelopments in encryption technology. (24)", "Further relaxation of encryption export controls took place in September 1999, when the Clinton Administration announcedthat encryption items of any key length may now be exported under a license exception, after a technical review,toindividuals, firms, and other non-government end-users in any country except for seven state supporters ofterrorism. (25) After a technical review, retail encryption commodities and software of any key length will also be exportable underalicense exception to any recipient in any country except for the same seven destinations. Post-export reporting willberequired, however, for any export to a non-U.S. entity of any product over 64 bits. The Administration alsoannounced thatit would implement the updated Wassenaar controls, allowing 56-bit DES and equivalent products to be exportedwithout alicense to all users and destinations, except the seven terrorist countries, after a technical review. It would alsomakeencryption items of 64-bits or less that meet the mass market requirements of the Wassenaar cryptographic noteeligible forexport without a license after a technical review. The Clinton Administration further announced that foreignnationalsworking in the United States will no longer need to obtain an export license in order to work on encryption for U.S.firms. Following criticism by companies, privacy groups, and Internet proponents, the Administration postponedpublication ofthe implementing regulations and expanded certain aspects of the earlier proposal in new rules that were issuedJanuary 14,2000. (26) Among other things, DOC broadenedthe encryption license exception as it applies to source code; expanded themeaning of \"retail\" to include the provision of encryption through mail order, electronic, or telephone calltransactions;and made the encryption license exception available for exports to government entities that are telecommunicationscompanies and Internet service providers, so long as the export does not involve a non-retail product that will beused toprovide services specific to government end-users.", "Concurrent with the Clinton Administration's announcement was the President's proposal of the Cyberspace ElectronicSecurity Act of 1999, which would set forth limitations on the government's use and disclosure of encryption keysobtainedunder court order, address the disclosure and use of stored recovery information by recovery agents for governmentalpurposes, and authorize appropriations for the FBI's Technical Support Center. (27)", "On July 17, 2000, the Clinton Administration announced that it would further streamline controls for encryption exports to23 countries, including European Union member states, removing distinctions between government andnon-governmentend users and generally eliminating the 30-day waiting period following the exporter's submission of a classificationrequest.

(30) It has been argued that theseaspects of the AECA -- and now EAA -- regulatory regime constitute aprior restraint of protected speech in violation of the First Amendment. (31) Federal district courts addressing this issue overthe last three years have both upheld and dismissed First Amendment challenges to export licensing schemes forencryption. In the first circuit court opinion issued during this period, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,on May 8,1999, affirmed a lower court ruling striking Department of Commerce regulations as an unconstitutional priorrestraint. (32)", "Court challenges have generally involved restrictions on the export of software containing encryption source code -- thatis, computer programming language describing an encryption program or an algorithm. This original programminglanguage must be combined or translated into object code, which enables a computer to read the encryptionprogram. (33) Distinctions are generally raised between the expressive and functional nature of the software at issue, and betweenthe actof exporting software containing encryption source code and the use of source code to communicate. In his 1996ExecutiveOrder, the President expressly stated that \"the export of encryption software, like the export of other encryptiondescribedin ... [the order], must be controlled because of such software's functional capacity, rather than because of anypossibleinformation value of such software.\" (34) At the sametime, it is argued that, regardless of the functional capability ofsoftware, the source code it contains is a language by which cryptographers convey mathematical ideas to each otherand,as such, merits the strongest First Amendment protection."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bernstein Cases", "paragraphs": ["In Bernstein v. Dep't of State, a California federal district court, ruling on a government motion to dismiss, held that sourcecode constituted speech protected by the First Amendment. (35) The court later ruled that AECA licensing requirementswere an unconstitutional prior restraint on such speech. (36) The plaintiff subsequently challenged the 1996 DOC regulationson First Amendment grounds, the court holding these unconstitutional as well and enjoining their application to theplaintiff. (37) The injunction was stayed pendingappeal. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a 2-1 ruling,affirmed the district court's decision May 9, 1999, allowing a facial First Amendment challenge to the CommerceDepartment regulations and holding that the regulations were in fact an impermissible prior restraint. (38) On September 30,1999, the Ninth Circuit granted the United States its motion for a rehearing before the full court of appeals andwithdrewthe earlier opinion. (39) The case was later remandedto the original three-judge panel on January 26, 2000, forreconsideration in light of DOC's new encryption regulations. (40) Plaintiff since requested an advisory opinion from DOCand, in February 2000, the Department reportedly notified him in writing that, under the new regulations, he maypostsource code for his encryption software on his Internet Web site. (41)", "The Ninth Circuit three-judge panel had reviewed the district court Bernstein ruling de novo and held that the two-prongtest for facial challenges set forth by the Supreme Court in Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co .,486 U.S. 750 (1988),was met. As explained by the court, a licensing scheme is always subject to a facial challenge if, as describedin Lakewood ,it \"'gives a government official or agency substantial power to discriminate based on the content or viewpoint ofspeech bysuppressing disfavored speech or disliked speakers,' and has 'a close enough nexus to expression, or to conductcommonlyassociated with expression, to pose a real and substantial threat of ... censorship risks.'\" (42) The court held that the firstrequirement was satisfied because the constraint on official discretion contained in the standard used by theCommerceDepartment to deny export licenses under the Export Regulations (EAR) -- namely, inconsistency with \"U.S.nationalsecurity and foreign policy interests\" (43) -- was, inthe court's view, \"little better than no constraint at all.\" (44) The courtdiscounted government arguments that the scheme was content-neutral, finding that finding that the agency's\"boundlessdiscretion\" (as it was later described by the court) made DOC's assurances that it would not discriminate on the basisofcontent irrelevant (45)", "The second requirement for facial challenges was fulfilled because, in the court's view, the regulations evidenced a \"closeenough nexus to expression.\" The court determined at the outset that \"encryption software, in its source code formand asemployed by those in the field of cryptography, must be viewed as expressive for First Amendment purposes, andthus isentitled to the protections of the prior restraint doctrine.\" (46) The court dismissed the government's argument that, evenadmitting the expressive nature of source code, its functional aspect -- that is, by being compiled into \"object code,\"it canbe used to control the operations of a computer without conveying information to the user -- obviated FirstAmendmentproblems in this case. (47) It also dismissed thegovernment's argument that because the regulations were \"laws of generalapplication\" and did not narrowly and specifically target speech, prior restraint analysis did not apply. Again relyingon Lakewood , the court held that the Commerce Department regulations \"explicitly apply to expressionand place scientificexpression under the censor's eye on a regular basis,\" distinguishing them, for example, from a building permitrequirement, which would give officials \"only intermittent and unpredictable opportunities\" to regulate speech. (48)", "The court then held the regulations to be an impermissible prior restraint, finding none of the elements needed to uphold thevalidity of licensing schemes, as set forth by the Supreme Court in Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S.541 (1965), to bepresent in this case. As summarized by the court, a licensing scheme that imposed a prior restraint on speech wouldsurvive under Freedman if: (1) any restraint on speech were for a specified period of time; (2) there wasexpeditiousjudicial review; and (3) the censor bore the burden of going to court to suppress the speech and bore the burden ofproof inany such judicial proceeding. (49) The court foundthat the requisite procedural safeguards were lacking because neither theExecutive Branch process for resolving inter-agency disputes over export license applications, nor the internalappealsprocess for license denials contained firm deadlines, and further, the licensing process did not afford judicial reviewtothose whose export license applications were denied. (50)", "With respect to the scope of declaratory relief, the government argued that the lower court's order was invalid since itapplied not only to encryption source code, but also to encryption object code, commodities, and technology. Agreeingwith the government that the EAR could be \"conceptually severed into component parts covering commodities,softwareand technology,\" the court nonetheless decided that the \"integrated structure\"of the regulations did not permit it tosever thejudicially uncontested portions of the regulations and let the lower court relief stand. (51)", "The dissenting judge in Bernstein concluded that since the EAR was a law of general application directed at conduct, theplaintiff did not meet the requirements for a facial First Amendment challenge. The dissent emphasized that themajorityand the district court had paid insufficient attention to the functional aspects of encryption. (52) Even though source codecould be used expressively, the dissent argued that it was \"inherently a functional device\" and that, for purposes ofFirstAmendment analysis, it was nearer to conduct than to speech. (53) Referring to the Ninth Circuit's 1996 decision in Roulettev. City of Seattle , 97 F.3d 300, which had quoted Lakewood , the dissent stated that \"such anapproach ignores the basictenet that facial challenges are inappropriate 'unless at a minimum,'\" the challenged statute is, in Lakewood's words\"directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonly associated with expression.\" (54) The dissent foundthat the conduct at issue here was the export of encryption source code, noting that \"the overwhelming majority\"ofindividuals do not use source code as means of expression but rather as a means of protecting their computercommunications. (55) In such case, \"[e]xport ofencryption source code simply does not fall withing the bounds of conductcommonly associated with expression such as picketing or handbilling.\" (56) The dissent further maintained that the EARregulate encryption technology generally, whether in the form of hardware or software, and as such were directedatpreventing the functional capability of encryption to be exported without a license. (57) In the dissent's view, the fact that theregulations were not directed at expression was supported by the fact that the regulations did not prevent the printpublication of scholarly articles containing source code. (58) While the dissenting judge found that the plaintiff did not meetthe requirements for a facial challenge, he acknowledged that a First Amendment claim with regard to theregulations asapplied may nonetheless succeed in this case.

(60) Along with his FirstAmendment claim, the plaintiff sought judicial review of the State Department's initial designation of the disketteas a\"defense article\" for purposes of the AECA, and also challenged the regulation on Fifth Amendment due processgrounds. While the court rejected the plaintiff's request for judicial review of the agency's classification decisions, (61) it allowed himto pursue his constitutional claims, though it ultimately dismissed these as well. (62) With regard to First Amendmentarguments, the court held that the diskette was content-neutral and met the First Amendment test applicable togovernmental regulation of such items set forth by the Supreme Court in United States v. O'Brien . Thecourt also rejectedplaintiff's prior restraint argument against the Department's technical data regulations. (63)", "In the court's view, the content-neutrality of the AECA regulations was clearly evidenced by the fact that the governmentwas \"not regulating the exports of the diskette because of the expressive content of the comments [interspersedthrough thesource code] and or source code, but instead are regulating because of the belief that the combination of encryptionsourcecode on machine readable media will make it easier for foreign intelligence sources to encode theircommunications.\" (64) As summarized by the court, a challenged regulation will be upheld under O'Brien if \"it is within theconstitutional powerof the government, it 'furthers an important or substantial government interest,' and 'the incidental restriction onallegedFirst Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.'\" (65)", "While the plaintiff did not expressly or impliedly dispute that the first two O'Brien conditions were satisfied, he argued thatthe third element was lacking because, as summarized by the court, \"the cryptographic algorithms contained on theKarndiskette are 'already widely available in other countries [through the Internet and other sources] or are so \"weak\"that theycan be broken by the [National Security Agency].'\" (66) The court held that the regulation was in fact narrowly tailored tomeet its goal. Noting that this argument also implicated the second O'Brien requirement, the court heldthat plaintiff'sdisagreement with the government essentially involved a foreign policy dispute and thus \"not one into which thisCourt canor will delve.\" (67) In the court's view, classifyingencryption items as defense articles reflected the President's foreignpolicy judgment that proliferation of encryption products was harmful to the United States, a judgment that existeddespiteany argued availability or capability of the regulated items. (68) The court also rejected the plaintiff's request for judicialbalancing of First Amendment harms against national security interests and found that the plaintiff had not presentedanyarguments that the regulation was substantially broader than was necessary to prevent proliferation of encryptionproducts.
