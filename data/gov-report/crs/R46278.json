Proposed changes to federal mineral policy could impact these revenue streams, industries, and states in a variety of ways.", "The processes and requirements to mine on federal lands vary by mineral category, surface/subsurface management agencies, and estate ownership. Three main statutes create the three categories of minerals applicable to mining on federal lands. The General Mining Law of 1872 covers locatable (or hardrock) minerals, which are now defined as those minerals not defined by other statutes; typical examples include gold, silver, copper, and gemstones, when not found on acquired lands. Leasable minerals are defined by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, and include coal, phosphate, potassium, and sodium, among others (leasable minerals also include otherwise locatable minerals on acquired land, per the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947). Salable minerals are defined by the Materials Act of 1947, and include common minerals such as sand and gravel.", "Additional processes and requirements apply when the surface rights above the federal mineral estate are privately owned (i.e., split estate), commonly resulting from the Stock Raising Homestead Act of 1916. Similarly, coordination is required between the surface management agency and the agency managing the mineral estate. Two statutes generally apply to mining on federal lands, including the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (only applicable to coal) and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, while others may apply, including the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Clean Water Act of 1972; the Clean Air Act; the Endangered Species Act of 1973; and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, among others.", "Data regarding mineral production for locatable minerals on federal lands are not collected by the federal government. This lack of data can hinder the development and analysis of policies intending to affect mineral production on federal lands. The 116 th Congress is considering H.R. 2579 , the Hardrock Leasing and Reclamation Act of 2019, which would, among other provisions, require mining operations on federal lands to report production volumes and values, with these data made public.", "Locatable mineral production on federal lands is not subject to royalties. Some interested parties see not charging royalties as a means of encouraging mineral exploration and production, while others may argue the public is not recovering fair market value for the transfer of a public asset to a private entity. H.R. 2579 would also establish a federal royalty policy for all new hardrock mineral mining operations on federal lands, and use these and other fees for the reclamation of abandoned hardrock mines and other environmental conservation activities on lands and waters affected by past hardrock mining.", "Federal land withdrawals may close a given area to mining. Advocates for a specific land withdrawal generally see the proposed use (e.g., military base, national park, national monument, wilderness area) as superseding the potential use of the public land by other interests (e.g., for mining). Proponents of mining generally advocate for limited withdrawals from the mineral estate, as access to public lands for mining represents opportunities for ongoing and future operations. H.R. 1373 would permanently withdraw about one million acres surrounding the Grand Canyon National Park from new mineral entry; it passed the House, and a companion bill, S. 3127 , has been introduced in the Senate.

The text of S. 1317 was incorporated into a substitute amendment to S. 2657 .

Another example is the Twin Metals Minnesota mining project, which would mine copper, nickel, platinum group metals, and cobalt in the Superior National Forest.", "To provide more information on the likely locations of critical mineral resources, the USGS has begun the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI). This program has produced a map and dataset covering numerous focus areas for one group of critical minerals: the rare-earth elements. Many of these focus areas occur in the western region and presumably lie on federal lands. As the Earth MRI program continues, it plans to focus on other critical minerals. ", "Policy options to address concerns related to critical minerals typically intend to create or increase access to secure quantities of critical minerals. Expanding mineral production on federal and non-federal lands is one option to create increased access to secure quantities of critical minerals. Other policy options can include non-mining options; two such options are mentioned below. One option that could increase access to critical minerals on federal lands includes creating mapping and mineral exploration programs, such as Earth MRI. Such programs can facilitate and lower the private costs of locating critical mineral reserves. While general knowledge of the likelihood of a deposit can assist new mineral developments, policies supporting such programs may have limited impacts on production from known critical mineral deposits.", "A policy option not focused on increasing domestic mineral production would focus on reducing potential negative effects of supply shocks by stockpiling additional critical minerals at the National Defense Stockpile. Given the number of critical minerals and the higher number of manufacturing input materials made from critical minerals, the costs and complexity of maintaining substantial supplies could limit the effectiveness of this option. An additional complication is that \"the National Defense Stockpile is not to be used for economic or budgetary purposes,\" and much demand for critical minerals stems from private consumption, such as motors and batteries for electric vehicles.", "A third option, also not focused on increasing domestic mineral production, would be to secure more access to critical minerals by supporting a domestic supply chain based on critical minerals captured through recycling consumer products. Such support could include funding research to develop technology that would reduce the costs of recycling critical minerals to a competitive level. Other support could include tariffs or quotas on imported critical minerals, thus allowing recycled domestic sources to be more cost competitive.", "Congress is presently considering bills related to critical minerals and materials, with some containing provisions related to the federal mineral estate. These include", "An amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2657 was introduced on February 27, 2020 (including the new title \"American Energy Innovation Act of 2020\"), and incorporated language from several energy and mineral bills reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Cloture was invoked on March 2. This bill includes text from S. 1317 and S. 1052 (discussed below). S. 1317 , among other provisions, would instruct the USGS to publish information regarding known and unknown domestic critical mineral resources. The USGS may conduct geological surveys to increase this information. This bill would also establish a research and development program in the Department of Energy (DOE) to increase efficiencies in the critical mineral supply chain, to identify substitutes for critical minerals, and to promote the use of recycling as a source of critical minerals. This research also includes producing forecasts related to critical minerals for a 10-year period, including expected demand, market conditions, and possible substitutes for critical minerals. This bill would repeal the National Critical Materials Act of 1984 and authorize $50 million per year for 10 years to fund its activities. This bill also includes identical language to S. 1052 (discussed below). H.R. 4410 , among other provisions, would establish a federal cooperative and a federal corporation related to rare-earth minerals and thorium; both federal charters would be privately funded and operated. The cooperative would process domestic and international sources of rare-earth minerals and materials into products for sale. The corporation would accept all radioactive material (e.g., thorium) produced by the cooperative, sell any valuable materials, and could conduct research on new uses of such materials. S. 1052 , among other provisions, would direct the DOE to authorize an ongoing program to develop technologies for the extraction of rare-earth elements (REE) from coal and coal byproducts. The bill would authorize $23 million per year for eight years to fund this program. According the committee report accompanying this bill, \"Congress appropriated funding in 2014 for [the National Energy Technology Lab] to develop extraction technologies for REEs from coal byproducts. S. 1052 formally authorizes the program.\" H.R. 2531 , among other provisions, would treat mineral exploration and mining projects related to critical minerals as high-priority infrastructure projects, as defined by E.O. 13807, and would attempt to reduce the time to issue permits to 30 months by allowing the lead agency to determine that NEPA requirements have been met or do not apply to the project. H.R. 3405 , among other provisions, would instruct the Secretary of the Interior to remove uranium from the list of critical minerals, as prepared by the USGS pursuant to E.O. 13817. A previous version of this bill, introduced on June 21, 2019, finds that the United States has reserves of uranium, and that 52% of uranium is imported from stable trading partners. H.R. 3567 , among other provisions, would direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in consultation with others, to establish guidance for the acquisition of items containing rare-earth materials and the supply chain of rare-earth materials from countries that are not U.S. adversaries. The bill would also direct the National Defense Stockpile Manager to dispose of an additional three million pounds of tungsten and to use available funds to acquire approximately $37 million of critical materials over five years; tantalum would be added to the list of critical materials. S. 3356 , among other provisions, would require the DOE to award grants to encourage battery recycling research, development, and demonstration projects. Separately, grants would be awarded to state and local governments and battery retailers to enhance battery recycling collection programs. The bill would authorize $10 million for one year for the existing Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Prize competition at the DOE, and would authorize to be appropriated $30 million per year for five years."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
