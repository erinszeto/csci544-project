This response has led to the closure of many businesses, schools, government offices, and other institutions. Where possible, these institutions have continued to operate via telework and e-learning.

For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) decides the status of each of its centers separately, based on local conditions, according to a four-stage response framework. At the same time, some NASA centers may be at stage 3 (open to mission-essential personnel) while others are at stage 4 (closed except to protect life and critical infrastructure). During March 2020, NASA made the decision to move to stage 3 and subsequently from stage 3 to stage 4 at different times for different centers. Actions by state or local governments may be a factor in the decisions of some facilities. For example, shutdowns at Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories in California and Illinois followed statewide social distancing orders issued by the governors of those states. ", "In some cases, specific R&D activities may be allowed to continue, despite closures, if an institution determines that the work is sufficiently important, that suspending it would be too costly or disruptive, or that it can be conducted remotely. For example, most employees of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are on telework with limited access to the laboratories' physical facilities and only with supervisor approval. However, some NIST employees continue to work onsite to provide certain limited essential services, including the sale of Standard Reference Materials, calibration of precision instruments, distribution of time and frequency signals, and maintenance of the National Vulnerability Database.", "Many of these considerations for laboratories and other research facilities apply similarly to research conducted in the field."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Identification of Essential and Critical R&D Activities", "paragraphs": ["The policies guiding these decisions often use terms like essential or critical .

A memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment identifies development and testing by Department of Defense (DOD) contractors as an essential part of this critical infrastructure. Some state emergency orders have included exemptions for facilities and organizations that are considered critical infrastructure, suggesting that defense-related R&D may be allowed to continue even when other R&D is suspended.

For example, the relative positions of Earth and Mars in their respective orbits typically create a narrow launch window for NASA science missions to Mars. If a mission misses that window, it is likely to be delayed 26 months until the next launch window. While NASA has suspended a number of other major projects, it is continuing work on the Mars 2020 mission, scheduled for a launch window that opens in mid-July 2020. Other time-sensitive projects may include experiments that require continuity of data collection or that involve caring for live animals or maintaining cell cultures.", "University decisions about essential research functions may be informed by local conditions, federal funding agency directives, ethical considerations about the well-being of human subjects and animals in discontinued or scaled-back research, and each university's own risk management decisionmaking. Columbia University has defined essential functions to include, in addition to COVID-19 research and ongoing clinical trials, \"the maintenance of equipment, laboratory resources, critical animal resources, and cell lines.\" Johns Hopkins University has defined three tiers of its clinical research. The top, essential, tier includes trials of potential COVID-19 treatments and trials that address certain acute, life-threatening conditions such as Huntington's disease. Only trials in this tier can continue normally, including enrolling new patients. According to the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, research functions that some (but not necessarily all) universities have identified as essential include", "COVID-19 related research; activity that if discontinued would generate significant data and sample loss; activity that if discontinued would pose a safety hazard; activity that maintains critical equipment or core facilities; activity that maintains critical samples, reagents, and materials; activity that maintains animal populations; activity that maintains critically needed plant populations, tissue cultures, or other living organisms; activity in support of essential human subjects research; and clinical trial activity that if discontinued would adversely affect patient care.", "Not all time-sensitive research is necessarily considered essential, however.

In contrast, handling physical and biological samples, caring for laboratory animals, and building or operating specialized equipment likely require a researcher to be present in the laboratory. Research involving human subjects may be interrupted if those subjects are unavailable because of social distancing. In some cases, the extent to which research activities can continue may depend on the duration of the disruption; for example, analyzing data and preparing results for publication may no longer be an option once all existing data have been analyzed and written up.

Other mechanisms, such as scientific papers and electronic communications, also offer other important ways to exchange knowledge and share ideas, but they lack some of the interactive advantages of in-person conferences. Accordingly, the cancellation of scientific and technical conferences may have a detrimental impact on advances in knowledge and the benefits that emerge from such knowledge. These adverse effects apply both to federal scientists and engineers and to their counterparts in academia and the private sector who work on federally funded R&D.", "The impact of cancelling conferences may be particularly significant in certain fields. In computer science, for example, papers published in conference proceedings may be as influential as journal articles, to an extent that is rare in other fields.", "In some cases, conferences are continuing virtually with attempts to facilitate informal interactions that would normally take place in person. For example, the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, originally scheduled to be held in Boston in March 2020, was converted to a virtual conference, with prerecorded presentations, live webcasts, and electronic poster presentations. In April 2020, the annual International Conference on Learning Representations (devoted to machine learning) plans to present papers using prerecorded videos and offer online opportunities to ask questions of speakers, see questions and answers from other participants, take part in discussion groups, meet with sponsors, and join groups for networking.", "Scientific and technical conferences are often run by professional societies and other organizations that rely on them for revenue. Cancellations are likely to result in financial losses for these organizations as expected revenues are not realized and cancellation costs associated with the use of hotels, meeting facilities, and other services are incurred. Such losses can be considerable for the organizations involved. The cancellation of the March 2020 annual meeting of the American Physical Society cost the society about $7 million, about 12% of its typical annual revenues; other societies have reported cancellation losses that wiped out essentially all of their financial reserves. Federal agencies also run scientific and technical conferences. While these conferences are not generally a significant source of agency revenues, some agencies are likely to face one-time cancellation costs that may be considerable.", "Researchers planning to attend conferences that have been cancelled may have incurred nonrefundable travel or lodging expenses.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act ( P.L. 116-136 ), enacted on March 27, 2020, appropriated more than $1 billion in supplemental funding for R&D. Most of this total was for research on COVID-19 itself, including $945 million for NIH, $415 million for research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) in the DOD Defense Health Program, and smaller sums for several other agencies. The act also provided funding to several R&D agencies to offset unanticipated costs arising from the pandemic. For example, NASA received $60 million to cover the costs of mission delays caused by center closures, while the U.S. Forest Service received $3 million to reestablish experiments affected by travel restrictions. Section 18004 of the CARES Act established a $14 billion Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund for colleges and universities. At least half of this total must be allocated for emergency financial aid grants to students. It is not yet clear how much, if any, will be available to address issues directly related to R&D. Section 3610 of the CARES Act authorized federal agencies to reimburse contractors for \"any paid leave, including sick leave, a contractor provides to keep its employees or subcontractors in a ready state\" when they are unable to work on-site due to facility closures and telework is not an option. Although this provision is not specifically directed at R&D, it could be significant for agencies such as DOE and NASA whose R&D facilities are staffed with numerous contractor employees. Section 12004 of the CARES Act authorized the Patent and Trademark Office to temporarily suspend, modify, adjust, or waive timing deadlines under the Patent Act and the Trademark Act during the COVID-19 emergency period. Section 13006 of the CARES Act gave DOD additional flexibility in the use of its other transaction authority for the development of prototypes related to COVID-19.
