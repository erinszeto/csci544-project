A November 2017 report issued by the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis also observed that \"[t]he crisis in opioid overdose deaths has reached epidemic proportions in the United States ... and currently exceeds all other drug-related deaths or traffic fatalities.\" How the current opioid epidemic happened, and who may be responsible for fueling it, are complicated questions, though reports suggest that several parties likely played contributing roles, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, doctors, health insurance companies, rogue pharmacies, and drug dealers and addicts. Many federal departments and agencies are involved in efforts to combat opioid abuse and addiction, including a law enforcement agency within the U.S. Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which is the focus of this report.", "The primary federal law governing the manufacture, distribution, and use of prescription and illicit opioids is the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), a statute that the DEA is principally responsible for administering and enforcing. The CSA and DEA regulations promulgated thereunder establish a framework through which the federal government regulates the manufacture, distribution, importation, exportation, and use of certain substances which have the potential for abuse or psychological or physical dependence, including opioids. Congress enacted the CSA in 1970 to facilitate the availability of controlled substances for authorized medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes, while also preventing these substances from being diverted out of legitimate channels for illegal purposes such as drug abuse and drug trafficking activities. The CSA aims to protect the public's health and safety from dangers posed by highly addictive or dangerous controlled substances that are diverted into the illicit market, while also ensuring that patients have access to pharmaceutical controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes such as the treatment of pain.", "This report describes the current federal legal regime governing opioids and other controlled substances under the CSA and its implementing regulations, including (1) the classification of various plants, drugs, and chemicals into one of five schedules based on the substance's medical use, potential for abuse, and safety or dependence liability; (2) who must register with the DEA in order to receive authorization to handle the substances (such as drug manufacturers, wholesale distributors, doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and scientific researchers); (3) what obligations registrants must satisfy in order to maintain a valid registration (such as keeping records of drug inventories and transactions, submitting reports to the DEA, and providing security measures to safeguard controlled substances); and (4) the DEA's administrative, civil, and criminal authorities for enforcing regulatory compliance with the CSA (such as suspending or revoking a registrant's legal authority to handle controlled substances if the DEA Administrator finds that the registrant has \"committed such acts as would render his registration ... inconsistent with the public interest.\"). The report then examines DEA initiatives and actions taken, pursuant to its legal authorities under the CSA, which specifically target the abuse of opioids. The report concludes by describing the legislative response to the opioid epidemic, including a summary of the amendments to the CSA made by legislation enacted by the 115th Congress, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (P.L. 115-271)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T he alarming rise in drug overdose deaths involving opioids over the past two decades has prompted the federal government to examine the causes of the public health crisis, identify possible solutions to counteract the problem, and take actions to address the crisis. The primary federal law governing the manufacture, distribution, and use of prescription and illicit opioids is the Controlled Substances Act (CSA or the act), which is administered and enforced by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the U.S. Department of Justice. The CSA provides the legal regime through which the federal government (1) regulates and facilitates the lawful production, possession, and distribution of controlled substances, including opioids; (2) prevents diversion of these substances from legitimate purposes; and (3) penalizes unauthorized activities involving controlled substances. ", "The regulatory framework under the CSA relies primarily on a registration system: the act requires persons who handle controlled substances (such as drug manufacturers, wholesale distributors, exporters, importers, health care professionals, hospitals, pharmacies, and scientific researchers) to register with the DEA and comply with the terms and conditions of the registration. Through this registration mechanism, the CSA creates a \"closed system\" of distribution in which distribution may lawfully occur among registered handlers of controlled substances, referred to under the act as \"registrants.\" To monitor the amount of particularly dangerous drugs that enters this distribution system, the CSA requires the DEA to establish a quota system that restricts the total amount of certain controlled substances that may be annually produced or manufactured. ", "In order to minimize theft and diversion and to help the DEA monitor the flow of controlled substances in the United States, the CSA and its implementing regulations subject registrants to strict requirements regarding recordkeeping, maintaining the security of their controlled substance inventories, and reporting certain information to the DEA. The \"closed system\" of distribution, along with registrant compliance with the CSA's regulatory requirements, helps to ensure that a particular controlled substance is always accounted for by a DEA-registered entity, from its creation until it is dispensed to a patient or is destroyed. Note that patients are not required to register with the DEA because the controlled substances in their possession \"are no longer part of the closed system of distribution and are no longer subject to DEA's system of corresponding accountability.\"", "A registrant's failure to meet its obligations under the CSA can result in a controlled substance being diverted from legitimate channels. For example, \"[d]istributors that blindly sell pharmaceutical controlled substances to rogue pharmacies, and practitioners who issue prescriptions without a legitimate medical purpose are diverting.\" Such diversion can contribute to drug abuse and addiction, which, in turn, increase the number of overdose deaths and emergency room visits, two defining features of the current opioid epidemic. In addition, some users who abuse prescription opioids may also start using cheaper and potentially easier to obtain illicit opioids such as heroin, which provide similar euphoric effects. ", "The CSA provides civil and criminal penalties for any unlawful manufacture, distribution, importation, exportation, or possession of controlled substances. Such violations may include (1) \"regulatory\" offenses committed by registrants who do not adhere to their responsibilities under the CSA, thereby increasing the risk of diversion, and (2) illicit trafficking or possession crimes that occur outside the \"closed system\" of authorized controlled substance distribution that primarily involve nonregistrants.", "This report first provides a brief overview of the opioid epidemic and then describes in greater detail the current federal legal regime governing opioids and other controlled substances under the CSA and its implementing regulations. After that, the report examines DEA actions taken that are specifically targeted at addressing opioid abuse and describes recently enacted laws amending the CSA that impact the opioid regulatory system, including the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act ( P.L. 115-271 ), enacted by the 115 th Congress. The report concludes by discussing other legislative options that the 116 th Congress could consider to amend the CSA further to address the opioid epidemic."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Brief Background on the Opioid Epidemic29", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has declared that the nation \"is in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic,\" citing statistics that show the number of overdose deaths involving opioids (including prescription opioids and illegal opioids such as heroin and nonpharmaceutical fentanyl) has more than quadrupled since 1999, and on average 115 Americans now die each day from an opioid overdose. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions referred to the opioid epidemic as \"the deadliest drug crisis in American history,\" and President Trump in October 2017 directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to declare the crisis a national public health emergency.", "The CSA defines the term \"opioid\" to mean \"any drug or other substance having an addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability similar to morphine or being capable of conversion into a drug having such addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability.\" Opioids can include prescription pain relief drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, morphine, and fentanyl, as well as illegal drugs such as heroin and nonpharmaceutical (illicitly produced) fentanyl. While doctors may prescribe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved opioids to patients to alleviate their pain, particularly following surgery or injury or for serious health conditions such as cancer, some individuals may choose to abuse opioids for nonmedical reasons (such as to experience feelings of relaxation or to get \"high\") or by taking them in a higher dosage or through different means than prescribed by their doctor (such as by snorting or injecting the substance into a vein). The CDC has estimated that more than 40% of all opioid overdose deaths in the United States in 2016 involved an FDA-approved prescription opioid.", "How the opioid epidemic occurred, and who is responsible for fueling it, are complicated questions, though reports have suggested that many parties are likely involved to some extent, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, doctors, health insurance companies, rogue pharmacies, and drug dealers and addicts. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has described the origins of the opioid overdose crisis as follows:", "In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to prescription opioid pain relievers, and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates. This subsequently led to widespread diversion and misuse of these medications before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.", "The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis also cited excessive prescribing of opioids since 1999 as a significant contributor to the proliferation of opioids. The commission identified several other factors that have influenced the current opioid crisis, including large scale production and distribution of addictive opioids, widespread availability of illicit heroin and fentanyl, unethical physician prescribing practices and rogue pharmacies that fill those illegitimate prescriptions, and a lack of education for medical professionals and patients in prescribing and using opioids, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of the CSA", "paragraphs": ["This section provides a general overview of the CSA's closed system of distribution that regulates opioids and other types of controlled substances, including the schedules in which the substances are placed and the regulatory requirements and obligations that registrants must satisfy, such as (1) registering with the DEA, (2) keeping accurate and complete records of controlled substance inventories and transactions, (3) implementing security measures to safeguard controlled substances from theft or diversion, (4) reporting certain information to the DEA (including suspicious controlled substance orders), (5) meeting production quotas, and (6) prescribing controlled substances only for legitimate medical purposes. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scheduling of Controlled Substances", "paragraphs": ["The CSA places various plants, drugs, and chemicals (such as narcotics, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and anabolic steroids) into one of five schedules based on the substance's medical use, potential for abuse, and safety or dependence liability. Opioids are types of narcotic drugs. To restrict access to chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of certain controlled substances, the CSA also regulates specified \"listed chemicals.\" Furthermore, the CSA regulates controlled substance \"analogues,\" which are substances that are not controlled but have chemical structures substantially similar to those of controlled substances found in Schedule I or II.", "The order of the five schedules in which controlled substances are categorized reflects substances that are progressively less dangerous and addictive. Schedule I contains substances, such as the hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the illicit opioid heroin, that have \"a high potential for abuse\" with \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\" and that cannot safely be dispensed under a prescription. Schedule I substances may be used only for bona fide, federal government-approved research studies. In contrast, schedules II, III, IV, and V include substances that have recognized medical uses, such as prescription opioids like oxycodone, codeine, and morphine, and may be manufactured, distributed, prescribed, dispensed, and possessed in accordance with the CSA. ", "The CSA provides an administrative mechanism for substances to be controlled (added to a schedule); decontrolled (removed from the scheduling framework altogether); and rescheduled or transferred from one schedule to another. Federal rulemaking proceedings to add, delete, or change the schedule of a drug or substance may be initiated by the DEA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or by petition by any interested person. The DEA Administrator must request from HHS a scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation as to whether the drug or substance should be controlled or removed from control. The DEA Administrator then must evaluate all of the relevant data and make a final determination as to whether the drug or substance should be controlled or removed entirely from control. ", "In making such determination, the DEA Administrator is required to consider statutory factors such as the drug's actual or relative potential for abuse; scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect; the current state of scientific knowledge regarding the drug or substance; the risk to the public health from the drug; and whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under the act. After the DEA Administrator makes this determination, he must make specific findings concerning the drug or substance that dictate the schedule in which the drug or substance will be placed. ", "For example, in 2009, the DEA requested from HHS an evaluation and recommendation concerning whether to reschedule hydrocodone combination products (HCPs) such as Vicodin\u00ae from Schedule III to Schedule II. After evaluating the scientific and medical evidence showing, among other things, significant diversion of HCPs and the health and safety risks created by people who abuse HCPs, HHS then recommended to DEA that HCPs should be reclassified to the more restrictive Schedule II, In 2014, DEA published a final rule that administratively reschedules HCPs from Schedule III to Schedule II, thereby subjecting anyone who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses HCPs to the more stringent regulatory requirements (and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions) that are applicable to Schedule II controlled substances.", "Congress may also change the scheduling status of a drug or substance at any time through enactment of legislation. For example, Congress passed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 that permanently added two synthetic cathinones (central nervous system stimulants) to Schedule I of the CSA, along with cannabimimetic substances (commonly referred to as synthetic marijuana)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Emergency or Temporary Scheduling", "paragraphs": ["The CSA authorizes the DEA Administrator to place a drug or substance that is not currently controlled, on a temporary basis, into Schedule I when he finds such scheduling \"necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.\" The DEA Administrator may not issue a temporary scheduling order until 30 days after he notifies both the public and the HHS Secretary of his intent to issue the temporary scheduling order and of his justification for issuing the order. Furthermore, the DEA Administrator must consider the HHS Secretary's comments regarding the temporary order. A drug or substance may be temporarily scheduled for two years and possibly longer\u2014up to an additional year\u2014if formal scheduling procedures have been initiated. As discussed below in the report, DEA has exercised its emergency scheduling authority eight times to control seventeen substances structurally related to the opioid fentanyl by placing them temporarily in Schedule I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scheduling in Order to Satisfy International Treaty Obligations", "paragraphs": ["Treaty obligations may require the DEA Administrator to control or reschedule a substance if existing controls under federal law are less stringent than those required by a treaty.

The United States is also party to the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, which was designed to establish similar control over stimulants, depressants, and hallucinogens. Finally, the United States is a party to the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which requires parties, among other things, to control precursor chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of drugs and to take measures to combat money laundering crimes related to drug trafficking."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Who Must Register with the DEA?", "paragraphs": ["The CSA requires any person who seeks to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or conduct research involving any controlled substance (such as drug manufacturers, wholesale distributors, physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, and scientific researchers) to obtain a registration from the DEA, unless they are exempt.

The DEA currently regulates more than 1.73 million registrants. The CSA authorizes the DEA Administrator to charge reasonable fees relating to the registration and control of the manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances under the act.", "The CSA directs the DEA Administrator to register an applicant if the Administrator determines that, among other things, it would be consistent with the \"public interest\" to do so. The CSA provides several criteria that the DEA Administrator must consider in assessing whether registering an applicant is consistent with the \"public interest.\" The criteria differ depending on the substance involved and whether the applicant is a manufacturer, distributor, or practitioner, but include general factors such as those relating to public health and safety and compliance with state and local laws. Manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances must obtain a registration from the DEA annually, and those who dispense controlled substances must obtain registrations that may not be issued for less than one year or more than three years. The registration of an individual terminates when the person dies, ceases legal existence, or discontinues business or professional practice. A registration cannot be transferred to someone else unless the Administrator provides his express, written consent for such a transfer to occur.", "In some instances, applicants must apply for several separate registrations in order to comply with the CSA. For example, separate registrations are generally required for each principal place of business or professional practice where controlled substances are manufactured, distributed, imported, exported, or dispensed.

Such an order provides the basis for the proposed denial, revocation, or suspension (including an identification of the laws or regulations that the applicant or registrant is alleged to have violated) and also notifies the applicant or registrant of the opportunity to submit to the DEA a corrective action plan (CAP). The OTSC instructs the applicant or registrant to appear at a hearing before a DEA Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that must be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

The CSA specifies that the suspension \"shall continue in effect until the conclusion of [the] proceedings [to revoke or suspend the registration on a final basis], including judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Attorney General or dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.\" ", "Prior to the enactment into law of the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act (EPAEDEA) of 2016, the CSA did not expressly define the phrase \"imminent danger to the public health or safety,\" and, as a result, courts held that the DEA Administrator possessed \"significant discretion\" to determine when the continued registration of a registrant constituted such a threat. As an example of the latitude that courts afforded the DEA Administrator's imminent danger finding, a federal district court permitted the DEA to rely on pharmacy controlled substances sales data from 2008 to support an ISO issued in early 2012. ", "The EPAEDEA amended the CSA to provide, for the first time, a statutory definition of the phrase \"imminent danger to the public health or safety,\" which limits the DEA Administrator's discretion to issue an ISO and creates new evidentiary requirements that he must satisfy before issuing such an order. Under the EPAEDEA, the DEA's authority to issue an ISO depends on the agency's ability to prove two things: (1) \"an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur\" due to the failure of the registrant to comply with the CSA's requirements, including those obligating the registrant \"to maintain effective controls against diversion,\" and (2) the probability that such a threat will occur without an immediate suspension of a registration, which the statute requires to be a \"substantial likelihood.\" Some have suggested that the legislative changes made by the EPAEDEA considerably weaken the power of the DEA to issue an ISO against a distributor or manufacturer, although others have argued that the addition of a statutory definition of \"imminent danger to the public health or safety\" was necessary in order to prevent \"a completely subjective determination made solely by the DEA\" that \"summarily eliminate[s] the registrant's ability to handle controlled substances before any due process hearing.\"", "In response to the ISO, a registrant could seek immediate judicial review of the ISO in federal court, arguing that the DEA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA. However, a registrant faces a difficult burden in convincing a court to enjoin the DEA's enforcement of the ISO pending resolution of the revocation or suspension proceedings. In order to obtain such preliminary injunctive relief, a registrant \"must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\" The CSA provides that a reviewing court must use a \"substantial evidence\" standard in considering the DEA's findings of facts with respect to an ISO, though a court applies the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard of review when considering the DEA's reason for deciding to adopt, modify, or reject the ALJ's recommendation concerning an ISO. A federal appellate court has explained its review of the DEA's issuance of an ISO under the APA as follows: \"To uphold DEA's decision, ... we must satisfy ourselves that the agency examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"", "A registrant served with an ISO could also request \"an expedited administrative hearing\" before an ALJ on the merits of the revocation or suspension at a time before that indicated in the OTSC.

The DEA has used these authorities in connection with the opioid crisis. For example, in February and March 2018, the DEA \"surged its enforcement and administrative resources\" to target prescribers and pharmacies suspected of diverting large amounts of opioid drugs, resulting in 147 revoked registrations and 28 arrests. In addition, in July 2017, CVS Pharmacy Inc. agreed to a $5 million settlement payment as well as an administrative compliance plan with the DEA, to resolve the federal government's allegations that nine of its pharmacies in the Eastern District of California had failed to keep and maintain accurate records of its controlled substances, in violation of the CSA's recordkeeping requirements. In early 2016, CVS also paid $8 million to the United States to settle allegations that certain CVS pharmacies in Maryland had dispensed controlled substances, including the opioids oxycodone, fentanyl, and hydrocodone, in violation of the CSA by failing to comply with their duty to ensure that the prescriptions were issued for legitimate medical purposes. In 2013, Walgreens agreed to pay $80 million in civil penalties to resolve DEA administrative actions and civil penalty investigations concerning \"an unprecedented number of record-keeping and dispensing violations\" occurring at six Walgreens pharmacies and a Walgreens drug distribution center in Florida that allegedly resulted in oxycodone and other prescription opioids to be diverted. As part of this settlement, Walgreens agreed to several terms and conditions, including ending its practice of \"compensat[ing] its pharmacists based on the volume of prescriptions filled.\"", "The DEA has also focused its attention on wholesale distributors of prescription opioids, which ship the drugs from drug manufacturers to pharmacies, and their compliance with the CSA's recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Several DEA investigations into these wholesale distributers resulted in civil penalty settlements. In January 2017, one of the largest U.S. drug distributors, McKesson Corporation, agreed to pay a $150 million civil payment to resolve DEA allegations that it had, in violation of CSA regulatory requirements, \"failed to design and implement an effective system to detect and report 'suspicious orders' for controlled substances distributed to its independent and small chain pharmacy customers.\" The federal government alleged that \"[f]rom 2008 until 2013, McKesson supplied various U.S. pharmacies an increasing amount of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills, frequently misused products that are part of the current opioid epidemic.\" In addition to the monetary penalty, the settlement requires McKesson to (1) suspend for several years sales of controlled substances from a number of its distribution centers, (2) agree to certain \"enhanced compliance obligations\" that include periodic auditing and staffing and organization improvements; and (3) accept the oversight of an independent monitor to assess the company's adherence with the compliance terms. ", "Another major pharmaceutical drug distributor, Cardinal Health, Inc., agreed in December 2016 to pay $44 million to the federal government to settle allegations that it had failed to notify the DEA when it filled unusually large and frequent orders for controlled substances requested by pharmacies located in Maryland, Florida, and New York, and that it had failed to maintain effective controls against diversion. The settlement agreement between Cardinal Health and the federal government included an admission by the company that \"from January 1, 2009 to May 14, 2012, it failed to report suspicious orders to the DEA as required by the CSA.\"", "In 2014, the DEA took an administrative action to revoke the registration of Masters Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Masters), a bulk supplier of prescription medications to many U.S. pharmacies, after concluding that the company had not satisfied its legal obligation to monitor and report to the DEA suspicious orders for controlled substances. Masters had previously entered into a settlement agreement with the DEA in 2009 in which Masters agreed to pay $500,000 and implement a compliance system to detect suspicious orders of controlled substances and prevent the substances from being diverted into illegal channels. However, in the years following the settlement, the DEA grew to suspect that Masters's employees were not detecting and reporting to the DEA suspicious orders of oxycodone products. In 2013, the DEA issued an Order to Show Cause why Masters's registration should not be revoked, in light of allegations that Masters had ignored its duty to report suspicious orders after its computer system had flagged controlled substance orders that were unusual in size, frequency, or pattern. The DEA Administrator concluded that Masters's repeated violations of the suspicious orders reporting requirement warranted revocation of its registration to distribute controlled substances. Masters challenged the DEA's revocation decision in federal court, arguing among other things that the DEA's factual conclusions were not supported by the record. In June 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied Masters's petition for review, seeking to overturn the DEA's final order, after the court found \"no prejudicial error in DEA's decision.\"", "In addition to these actions against distributors, the DEA has also investigated opioid manufacturers for their failure to report suspicious orders of controlled substances that occurred downstream in the drug supply chain. In July 2017, the DEA confirmed it had reached a $35 million civil penalty settlement with Mallinckrodt LLC, a drug manufacturer that is one of the largest makers of the highly addictive generic pain reliever oxycodone. This settlement resolved allegations that the company committed several violations of the CSA from 2008 until 2011 by supplying to drug distributors that, in turn, supplied pharmacies and pain clinics, \"an increasingly excessive quantity of oxycodone pills without notifying DEA of these suspicious orders.\" The DEA described this settlement as \"groundbreaking\" in part because it is the first time the DEA has been able to hold a drug manufacturer responsible for detecting and reporting suspicious orders relating to downstream sales between its distributor customers and the distributors' customers (pharmacies). This settlement agreement also apparently contains the first public statement of the DEA's position that \"controlled substance manufacturers need to go beyond 'know your customer' to use otherwise available company data to 'know your customer's customer' to protect these potentially dangerous pharmaceuticals from getting into the wrong hands.\" Under the settlement, Mallinckrodt agreed to analyze data it collects involving \"chargebacks,\" which are reimbursements the company offers to their drug distributor customers based on the distributor's discounted sale of its drugs to pharmacies and pain clinics, in order to monitor and report to the DEA any suspicious orders of oxycodone placed by the distributor's customers. Commentators have argued that the legal basis of the DEA imposing an obligation on a drug manufacturer to \"know your customer's customer,\" and its ability to hold the company \"responsible for what happens to its drugs once the distributors send them to their customers,\" may be uncertain. Moreover, one observer has characterized the DEA's action as \"creat[ing] ... a new requirement by announcing it in a press release\" and has argued instead that such a change needs to be made in accordance with notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the APA.

In February 2018, the DEA issued a broader temporary scheduling order that attempts to schedule all fentanyl-related substances that are not otherwise controlled in any schedule, by creating a definition of a new class of substances that is structurally related to fentanyl by virtue of one or more specified modifications to the substance's formulation. It remains to be seen whether the DEA's attempt to schedule proactively an entire class of illicit fentanyl substances simultaneously, including substances that have not yet been introduced into the U.S. market by drug traffickers, will be subject to a legal challenge under the APA, claiming the DEA's action to be inconsistent with its emergency scheduling authority under the CSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aggregate Production Quotas for Certain Schedule II Opioids", "paragraphs": ["As discussed previously in this report, the DEA limits the quantity of Schedule I and II controlled substances (referred to as aggregate production quotas, or APQs) that may be produced in a given calendar year.

In November 2017, the DEA responded to the decreased demand for these drugs when it released the 2018 APQs, which reduce by nearly 20% (compared to the 2017 levels) the amount of prescription opioids that can be manufactured in 2018.

For example, patients may want to get rid of their expired or unused drugs by returning them to pharmacies or giving them to their prescribing physicians. Yet, when Congress originally drafted the CSA, \"it did not account for circumstances in which controlled substances were lawfully dispensed to and possessed by an ultimate user but not fully used.\" To make it easier and more convenient for patients to dispose of unwanted controlled substances, including opioid medications, Congress enacted the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (Disposal Act). The Disposal Act amended the CSA to allow a patient to deliver controlled substances to an entity that is authorized by federal law to dispose of them, provided that such disposal occurs in accordance with regulations issued by the Attorney General to prevent diversion of controlled substances. These implementing regulations, issued by the DEA in September 2014, substantially expand the options and opportunities available to patients for safe and secure disposal of their unwanted prescription opioid and other controlled substance medication. ", "The DEA regulations governing secure disposal of controlled substances allow three primary options for patient disposal of controlled substances. The first option is for federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agencies to conduct periodic drug \"take-back\" events to collect controlled substances from unwanted users; private entities or community groups may also partner with law enforcement to hold community take-back events. Second, DEA-registered manufacturers, distributors, narcotic treatment programs, hospitals/clinics with an on-site pharmacy, or retail pharmacies that wish to become collectors of unwanted controlled substances for disposal purposes must seek authorization from DEA to do so. Authorized collectors may then conduct \"mail-back\" programs that utilize the mail system for convenient transfer of the unwanted controlled substances, although the physical packages in which the drugs are shipped must comply with certain requirements (for example, tamper-resistance and tracking numbers) that DEA has specified. The third option permits law enforcement agencies or authorized collectors to manage, maintain, and empty secure collection receptacles at their DEA registered location. A long-term care facility may also dispose of controlled substances on behalf of its residents (or former residents) by using on-site collection receptacles that are installed, managed, and maintained by authorized retail pharmacies or hospitals/clinics with an on-site pharmacy. Finally, the regulations provide requirements that collectors must follow regarding methods of destroying controlled substances and destruction procedures, in order to render the collected controlled substances \"non-retrievable.\"", "Congress also enacted prescription drug disposal and take-back provisions as part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016.

The law defines \"covered entities\" to include state, local, or tribal law enforcement agencies, drug manufacturers and distributors, retail pharmacies, narcotic treatment programs, hospitals or clinics with an onsite pharmacy, and long-term care facilities.", "Congress included two chapters relating to drug disposal in the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act that was enacted in October 2018. The first chapter addresses the difficulties faced by home hospice employees regarding disposal of pharmaceutical controlled substances.

The SUPPORT Act amends the CSA by allowing a pharmacy, under specified conditions, to deliver a controlled substance to a practitioner, pursuant to a prescription, to be administered by the practitioner to the patient by injection or implantation for the purpose of maintenance or detoxification treatment. The physician must administer the controlled substance to the patient within 14 days after the physician has received the controlled substance. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may reduce the number of days within which the physician must administer the controlled substance if such reduction will reduce risk of diversion or protect public health; however, the Attorney General cannot make a modification that is less than seven days.

The DEA Administrator must share information regarding suspicious orders for prescription controlled substances in a state with an entity designated by the governor or chief executive officer of that state.", "The SUPPORT Act also establishes a maximum criminal fine of $500,000 for registered manufacturers or distributors of opioids who intentionally fail to report suspicious orders for opioids."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Legislative Proposals That the 116th Congress Could Consider to Amend the CSA", "paragraphs": ["The 116 th Congress may consider legislation to amend the CSA beyond the changes made by the SUPPORT Act. These potential additional amendments to the CSA may resemble opioid legislation introduced, but not enacted to date, in the 115 th Congress. Legislative proposals introduced in the 115 th Congress include the following: ", "Changes to the DEA's Authority to Deny, Revoke, or Suspend a Registration, and to Issue Immediate Suspension Order s . The DEA Opioid Enforcement Restoration Act of 2017 ( H.R. 4095 ) would repeal the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2016 (EPAEDEA) ( P.L. 114-145 ), discussed above in the section describing the DEA's authority to issue \"immediate suspension orders,\" and would restore the sections of the CSA amended by such act as if it had not been enacted into law. This bill would thus delete the definition of \"imminent danger to the public health or safety\" that the EPAEDEA had added to the CSA provision governing the DEA Administrator's power to suspend immediately an existing registration for a temporary period of time to avoid such a harm, thereby returning to the DEA significant discretion in interpreting this phrase that is a necessary finding to support an immediate suspension order. The bill would also remove the option afforded by the EPAEDEA for the registrant or applicant to submit a \"corrective action plan\" to the DEA prior to the agency's denial, revocation, or suspension of his registration. The Opioid Immediate Suspension Order Act of 2017 ( H.R. 4073 ) would also delete the statutory definition of \"imminent danger to the public health or safety\" for purposes of immediately suspending a registration but, unlike H.R. 4095 , the bill would not disturb the \"corrective action plan\" provision that P.L. 114-145 had added to the CSA. Establishing a n Opioid Prescription Limit . Current federal law does not restrict the particular quantity of opioids that may be prescribed by a practitioner. The Opioid Addiction Prevention Act of 2017 ( S. 892 ) would, among other things, amend the CSA to prohibit the DEA Administrator from registering, or renewing the registration of, a practitioner who is licensed under state law to prescribe controlled substances in schedule II, III, or IV, unless the practitioner certifies to the DEA that he will not prescribe any schedule II, III, or IV opioid for the initial treatment of \"acute pain\" (except opioids approved by the FDA for treating drug addiction) in an amount greater than a seven-day supply of the drug (with no refills allowed), or exceeding an opioid prescription limit established under state law, whichever is lesser. The bill would define \"acute pain\" to mean \"pain with abrupt onset and caused by an injury or other process that is not ongoing\" and excludes chronic pain, pain associated with cancer, hospice or other end-of-life care, or pain being treated as part of palliative care. The CARA 2.0 Act of 2018 ( S. 2456 ) would also impose a supply limitation on opioid prescriptions, requiring practitioners to certify, as a precondition for DEA registration or renewal of registration, that they will not prescribe any opioid (other than an addiction-treatment opioid) for the initial treatment of acute pain in an amount exceeding a three-day supply. Medical Education and Prescriber Education Initiatives . 358 The Safer Prescribing of Controlled Substances Act ( S. 1554 ) would, among other things, amend the CSA to require physicians, dentists, and scientific investigators who wish to dispense or conduct research with controlled substances to complete training that provides them with information concerning best practices for pain management (including alternatives to prescribing controlled substances), responsible prescribing of opioids, methods for diagnosing and treating substance use disorders, and tools to manage diversion of controlled substances such as prescription drug monitoring programs and the use of drugs to treat opioid overdoses. The bill would also make such required training a precondition to the DEA's granting or renewing the registration of these types of practitioners. The Opioid Preventing Abuse through Continuing Education (PACE) Act of 2017 ( H.R. 2063 ) would impose similar practitioner education requirements as a condition for registration to prescribe or dispense opioids, though the specifics of the training differ from S. 1554 . Increasing Penalties for Fentanyl Trafficking. Several bills, including the Stop Trafficking in Fentanyl Act of 2017 ( H.R. 1354 ), the Comprehensive Fentanyl Control Act ( H.R. 1781 ), the Stop Trafficking in Fentanyl Act of 2018 ( S. 2481 ), and the Ending the Fentanyl Crisis Act of 2018 ( H.R. 5459 , S. 2635 ), would reduce the quantity (in grams) of fentanyl that triggers mandatory minimum sentences for anyone who, in violation of the CSA, knowingly or intentionally manufactures, distributes, or dispenses fentanyl or fentanyl analogues (or possesses such substances with intent to engage in these prohibited activities). Under current law, a trafficking offense involving 400 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of fentanyl, or 100 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of a fentanyl analogue, is punishable by a te rm of imprisonment of at least 10 years and up to life in prison (or a minimum sentence of 20 years to life in prison, if death or serious bodily injury results from the use of the trafficked fentanyl). The bills would reduce these quantities to 20 grams and 5 grams, respectively. In addition, under current law, a drug trafficking offense involving 40 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of fentanyl, or 10 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of a fentanyl analogue, is punishable by a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years but not more than 40 years (or a minimum of 20 years to life in prison, if death or serious bodily injury results from the use of the trafficked fentanyl). The bills would reduce these quantities to 2 grams and 0.5 grams, respectively."], "subsections": []}]}}
