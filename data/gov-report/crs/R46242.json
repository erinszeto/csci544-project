Farm product exports, which totaled $136 billion in FY2019 (see chart), make up about 8% of total U.S. exports and contribute positively to the U.S. balance of trade. The economic benefits of agricultural exports also extend across rural communities, while overseas farm sales help to buoy a wide array of industries linked to agriculture, including transportation, processing, and farm input suppliers.", "A major area of interest for the 116 th Congress during its first session was the loss of export demand for agricultural products in the wake of tariff increases imposed by the Trump Administration on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum from certain countries and other imported products from China. Some of the affected countries levied retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, contributing to a 53% decline in value of U.S. agricultural exports to China in 2018 and a broader decline in exports across countries imposing retaliatory tariffs in 2019. To help mitigate the economic impact from export losses, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) authorized two short-term assistance (\"trade aid\") programs to producers of affected agricultural commodities, valued at up to $12 billion in 2019 and $16 billion in 2019.", "Other major agricultural trade developments in 2019 included efforts to ratify the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), trade negotiations with China, Japan, and the European Union, and continued review of U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO). The USMCA was ratified by Mexico and the U.S. Congress, and awaits ratification by Canada before it can enter into force. The United States and Japan signed an agreement increasing market access for many U.S. agricultural exports to Japan. This agreement, which does not require congressional approval, excludes provisions pertaining to non-tariff measures that could become future trade barriers for U.S. agricultural exporters. A second-stage negotiation toward a more comprehensive pact could commence in 2020.", "In January 2020, President Trump signed a \"Phase One\" executive agreement (that also does not require congressional approval) with the Chinese government on trade and investment issues, including agriculture.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019 of $136 billion (see Figure 1 ). The FY2019 export total represents an $8 billion decline from FY2018. The decline in the value of farm exports since FY2014 initially reflected lower market prices for bulk commodities, such as soybeans and corn. Agricultural prices and U.S. exports of certain commodities, such as soybeans, were further affected by retaliatory tariffs imposed on U.S. agricultural imports by China and some other countries since 2018 in response to the Trump Administration's imposition of tariffs on certain imports from China and on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum from selected countries.", "In FY2019, U.S. agricultural imports were $131 billion, up $3 billion from FY2018, resulting in an agricultural trade surplus of $5 billion.

China first retaliated in April 2018, by raising tariffs on certain U.S. imports, including agricultural products such as pork, fruit, and tree nuts. These retaliatory tariffs are in addition to existing Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariffs that China levies on imports from all countries including the United States.

For example, in 2016 and 2017, the United States supplied over one-third of China's total soybean imports, almost all of China's distillers' grain imports (primarily used as animal feed), and most of China's sorghum imports. With the retaliatory tariffs in effect, U.S. soybean exports to China in 2018 declined in value to $3 billion (8 billion metric tons [MT]) from $12 billion (32 billion MT) in 2017.

", "Elsewhere in the world, the adoption and cultivation of GE crops by both producers and consumers are mixed. Argentina and Brazil, for example, are major cultivators and exporters of GE corn and soybeans. India is a major cultivator of GE cotton. EU policy is more complicated. Through labeling requirements, strict traceability rules for imported food and commodities, and comparatively strong democratic pressures from the public at local levels, the EU has made cultivation and sale of GE foods and crops very difficult. Moreover, while the European Commission (EC) has approved varieties of GE commodities for import and marketing, individual member states may maintain bans. This opposition in the EU has also been a factor in opposition to GE crops in less developed countries. Many African countries have largely followed the EU in restricting or banning the commercial cultivation of GE crops, confining cultivation mostly to field trials and greenhouse containment. ", "In March 2018, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture stated that the United States will not regulate plants created through genomic editing as long as they are developed without using a plant pest as the donor or vector, and are not plant pests themselves. In contrast, the European Court of Justice ruled in July 2018 that organisms obtained by mutagenesis are genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and are, in principle, within the scope of the GMO Directive, which governs the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment. The European Court considers the risks posed by new mutagenic techniques such as gene editing (CRISPR-Cas9), to be similar to crops created from transgenesis, where GE crops have genetic material from other, unrelated organisms introduced into the host plant.

At the same time, the ministry amended regulations on safety assessment, import approval, and labeling of agricultural GMOs without notifying the changes to the WTO, nor soliciting comments from stakeholders. In the U.S.-China Phase One trade agreement, China agreed to establish a predictable and risk-based regulatory regime with respect to its safety evaluation of agricultural biotechnology.

In this manner, GIs can be commercially valuable. GIs may also be eligible for relief from acts of infringement or unfair competition. While the use of GIs may protect consumers from deceptive or misleading labels, they also have the potential to impair trade when the use of names that are considered common or generic in one market are protected in another.

However, the United States considers some EU GIs to be generic or semi-generic terms. For example, in the United States, feta is considered the generic name for a type of cheese; however, it is protected as a GI in Europe. As such, cheese produced in the United States may not be exported for sale as feta cheese in the EU, since only feta produced in countries or regions currently holding GI registrations may be sold there commercially.

More than 3,300 product names registered and protected in the EU for foods, wine, and spirits originating in both EU member states and other countries. In addition, registered products often fall under GI protections in certain third-country markets, and some EU GIs have been trademarked in some non-EU countries pursuant to those countries' trade agreements with the EU. For example, Canada has agreed to recognize a list of 143 EU GIs in Canada, and Japan has agreed to recognize more than 200 EU GIs in Japan.

Some U.S. industry groups, however, are trying to institute GI protections to promote distinctive American agricultural products. For example, the American Origin Products Association, which represents certain U.S. potato, maple syrup, ginseng, coffee, and chili pepper producers and certain U.S. winemakers, seeks to work with federal authorities to \"create of a list of qualified U.S. distinctive product names, which correspond to the GI definition.\" ", "Status: Statements by USDA officials in early 2020 have signaled that concerns about GIs could resurface as part of the U.S.-EU trade talks.

According to researchers, Mexican growers benefit from a combination of relatively lower labor costs and subsidies invested in the specialty crop sector under various government programs, including Mexico's Agriculture Promotion Program and its AgriFood Productivity and Competiveness Program. These programs are generally focused on increasing the infrastructure capacity of Mexico's agricultural sector. The Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association (FFVA) claims that Mexico's produce industry benefits from subsidies paid by the Mexican government and that it prices its products below fair market value, and therefore should be subject to both AD duties and CVD on U.S. imports of some fruits and vegetables.

Milk classified as Class 7 comprises skim milk components\u00e2\u0080\u0094primarily milk protein concentrates and skim milk powder (SMP)\u00e2\u0080\u0094used to process dairy products. Prices for Class 7 products were set at low levels. Once the Class 7 regime was implemented, Canadian skim milk products became cheaper. Canada expanded global exports of SMP with the consequence that U.S. producers lost exports of high-protein UF milk to Canadian cheese and yogurt processors.", "According to USDA, the value of U.S. UF milk exports to Canada peaked at nearly $107 million in 2015 but declined after the Class 7 regime was implemented in 2017 to $49 million in 2017 and $32 million in 2018. At the same time, Canada's exports of SMP more than tripled in 2017 to $133 million, compared with $42 million in 2016 before the Class 7 price regime was implemented. Eliminating Canada's Class 7 pricing regime became a priority for the U.S. dairy industry when NAFTA renegotiations commenced in 2017.", "Status : Under USMCA, Canada agreed to eliminate the Class 7 pricing regime six months after USMCA enters into force. Canada also agreed to reclassify Class 7 products according to their end use and base its selling price on a formula that takes into consideration the USDA reported nonfat dry milk price. Also under the agreement, Canada would be required to monitor its exports of milk protein concentrates, SMP, and infant formula and report at the harmonized tariff schedule level monthly.", "Although Canada would maintain its milk supply management system under USMCA, it would expand TRQs for U.S. milk, cheese, cream, skim milk powder, condensed milk, yogurt, and several other dairy products. U.S. dairy products within the USMCA TRQs would enter Canada duty free, while U.S. exports above the TRQ quantities would be subject to the existing over-quota tariffs. In return, the United States agreed to establish TRQs for imports of Canadian dairy products. ", "In total, under USMCA Canada would grant the United States duty-free access to nearly 17,000 MT of dairy products in the first year of the agreement, 100,000 MT in the sixth year, and 109,000 MT in year 19.

The Japanese dairy sector is protected by high import tariff rates and TRQ. In addition, competing exporters of dairy products to Japan (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the EU) have preferential tariffs through free trade agreements. The USJTA is expected to improve the competitive position of U.S. dairy producers through tariff reductions, and eventual tariff elimination in 15 years. Japan also established a country specific TRQ of 5,400 MT for U.S. whey products that is to increase to 9,000 MT in year 10. In-quota exports are to enter duty-free at the beginning of the agreement and tariffs on over-quota exports are to be eliminated in five years. Over-quota tariffs on other dairy products are to be phased out at various times through the agreement.", "Status: \"Stage One\" of USJTA became effective on January 1, 2020. Unlike the provisions the United States had negotiated with Japan under the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), USJTA does not include TRQs for certain dairy products such as butter and skim milk powder. The U.S. dairy industry has identified that the lack of provisions on non-tariff measures, such as GIs, could prove to be a market access barrier for certain U.S. cheese exports to the Japanese market.

", "After the suspension agreements took effect, a number of stakeholders in the U.S. sugar market asserted that the suspension agreements had not worked as intended and had not entirely eliminated the injury caused by the subsidization and dumping of Mexican sugar. One widely held criticism was that cane refiners who were dependent on imports of raw cane from Mexico had received an inadequate share of sugar from Mexico. Another criticism leveled at the agreements was that Mexican exporters were not always adhering to limits on the share of Mexican sugar imports that are refined sugar as compared with raw sugar, nor to the specified minimum reference prices.", "In November 2016, the American Sugar Coalition\u00e2\u0080\u0094representing sugar cane and sugar beet producers and sugar processors, refiners, and workers\u00e2\u0080\u0094called on DOC to withdraw from the agreements, an action that could have caused AD and CVD duties to be imposed on Mexican sugar. Imperial Sugar Company, a U.S. cane refiner, also advocated for withdrawal. The Sweetener Users Association, which represents sugar-using businesses, recommended renegotiating the agreements to address their shortcomings and warned that terminating them would virtually eliminate Mexican sugar from the U.S. market. In November 2016, DOC issued results of a preliminary administrative review, in which it concluded that the agreements may not have entirely redressed the injury, and that certain import transactions may not have adhered to the terms in the agreements.", "In June 2017, the United States and Mexico agreed to amendments to the suspension agreements. Under the amendments, effective October 1, 2017, the price of imported Mexican raw sugar was increased from $0.2225 per pound to $0.23 per pound. The price of imported refined sugar was increased from $0.26 per pound to $0.28 per pound. The maximum share of refined sugar imports was limited to 30%, with raw sugar imports constituting at least 70% of the total, compared with 53% and 47%, respectively, under the 2014 agreement.
