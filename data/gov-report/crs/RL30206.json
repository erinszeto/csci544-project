One of the most controversial issues in the FY2000 Interior appropriations (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd337) related to a November 7, 1997, legal opinion of the Solicitorof the Department of the Interior that each mining claim can use no more than 5 acres for activitiesassociated with mining (\"millsites\"). The decision affected modern mining operations, such asheap-leach mines for gold and other hardrock minerals, which typically require large tracts of landbeyond that of the mining claim for mining-related purposes, including disposal of waste rock. Critics of the decision charged that it constituted a new interpretation of the relevant provisions ofthe 1872 Mining Law (30 U.S.C. 42), was inconsistent with the practice of the Department of theInterior in granting operating plans for mining without regard to acreage limitations or the ratio ofmillsite locations to mining claims, and was an indirect way of reforming the 1872 Mining Law. TheDepartment of the Interior refuted these criticisms in Senate testimony, asserting that its opinion wasbased both in law and practice. ", "The millsite language in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided a two-year exemption from the Solicitor's opinion for: (1) patent applications grandfathered as part of the 1995mining patent moratorium; (2) any mining operation with an approved plan of operation; and (3) anyoperation with a plan of operation submitted to BLM or the Forest Service before November 7,1997--the date of the Solicitor's opinion. (The earlier conference report had excluded plans ofoperation submitted prior to May 21, 1999.) The explanatory language accompanying the conferenceagreement expressed the view that it would be \"inequitable\" to apply the opinion \"retrospectively\"in these instances. Specifically, the exemption is for FY2000 and FY2001. ", "The House- and Senate-passed measures contained opposing language on the subject, with the House agreeing to support , and the Senate to overturn , the opinion of the Solicitor. Duringinitialfloor consideration, the House had agreed to language barring funds \"appropriated by this act\" frombeing used to process applications for approvals of patents, plans of operations, or amendments toplans that conflict with the opinion of the Solicitor. By contrast, the Senate-passed language wouldhave prohibited the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture, in any fiscal year , from limiting thenumber or acreage of millsites based on the ratio between the number or acreage of millsites and thenumber or acreage of mining claims. The Senate-passed language apparently would reverse theSolicitor's opinion permanently and comprehensively as well as prospectively. On the floor, theSenate rejected an amendment to delete the millsite language from the bill, so as to allow theSolicitor's opinion to stand. A related amendment, essentially designed to protect on-going miningoperations from the Solicitor's opinion, was subsequently withdrawn. ", "The Senate-passed language had first been included by the Senate Appropriations Committee. In adopting this language, which appeared to apply to all mining claims and millsites, the SenateAppropriations Committee went further than its Interior Subcommittee. The Subcommittee earlierhad adopted an amendment making the Solicitor's opinion inapplicable to existing mines operatingunder approved operating plans. ", "The current millsite debate arises on the heels of a recent battle in the long war over the 1872Mining Law governing mining on federal lands, which has evolved into a stalemate between thelaw's critics and supporters. Earlier this year, the Interior Department's decision on millsite acreageled to the Administration's denial (March, 1999) of an operating plan for the Crown Jewel Mine inWashington on the grounds that the plan exceeded the lode-claim to millsite ratio. Opponents of themine also feared that the site would leach chemicals. Congress subsequently enacted a law (the 1999Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, P.L. 106-31 ) to direct that millsites and acreage forthe Crown Jewel mining operation not be limited, that its plan of operation be approved, and thatother patent applications and plans of operation for milling submitted prior to the law be givenpermits.

The languagecontinued the prohibition on accepting and processing applications for patents for mining or mill siteclaims on federal lands. However, applications meeting certain requirements that were filed on orbefore September 30, 1994, were grandfathered, and third-party contractors were authorized toprocess grandfathered applications. Identical language had been included in both the House-andSenate-passed bills.", "Grazing. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 contained language (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd123) to extend grazing permits and leases issued under 43 U.S.C.1752 that expire or are transferred, until the permit renewal process is completed under applicablelaws and regulations (including any necessary environmental analyses).

The first conference report and chamber passed measures alsoreferenced the Secretary of the Interior or the Bureau of Land Management. The FY2000 law soughtto address heavy agency workload in processing the relatively large number of grazing permits andleases which are up for renewal. Some Members, especially from the West, had argued that thedelay in processing renewals threatened ranchers' bank loans. The law preserved the authority ofthe Secretary, when the renewal process is complete, to cancel, suspend, or modify permits andleases. The explanatory language directed the Interior Department to develop and implement aschedule to alleviate the backlog of permits and leases up for renewal, and described the inclusionof $2.5 million to expedite the renewal process. Many environmental groups had opposed the permitextension language as allowing BLM to delay required environmental analyses, thereby continuingpermits with possibly detrimental conditions or terms. ", "The House and Senate initially had agreed to different provisions on this issue. The Senate-passed bill would have extended grazing permits and leases which expired or weretransferred in any fiscal year, whereas the House bill would have extended grazing permits expiringduring FY2000 for the balance of that fiscal year. The House bill specified that after the renewalprocess, the terms and conditions of permits could be modified and permits could be reissued for upto 10 years. The Senate Appropriations Committee report stated that the government's inability tocomplete permit renewals should not prevent or interrupt grazing. ", "On the floor during initial consideration, the Senate tabled an amendment (58-37) to require BLM to establish a schedule to complete the processing of expiring grazing permits and leases. Theamendment would have required all permits and leases expiring in FY1999, FY2000, and FY2001to be processed by BLM by September 30, 2001. It would have extended the permits and leases untilthat date or the date on which BLM completed the processing, whichever was earlier. Supportersof the amendment argued that a time certain for completing the renewal process was needed to assurethat they would be completed in a timely way, and that the existing Senate language was too broadin its application to expirations in \"any fiscal year.\" The amendment had substantial support fromenvironmental groups.", "Wildlife Population Surveys. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 did not contain language on BLM and Forest Service wildlifesurveys for activities on federal land. ", "The first conference report passed earlier by both chambers had included language to grant the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior authority to decide whether to gatheradditional information on wildlife populations with regard to inventorying, monitoring, or surveyingrequirements for activities on federal land. The language was a modification of a Senate-passedprovision, which had been opposed by many environmentalists and the Administration. TheAdministration had opposed the language as slowing down timber sales, increasing project costs,possibly increasing litigation, and, in the breadth of its application to activities on federal lands,potentially having far-reaching, negative consequences. The Senate Appropriations Committeeoriginally had granted the agencies related discretion on the grounds that requiring wildlife surveysin all cases would be costly and time consuming and that species knowledge and researchmethodologies are in some cases insufficient for conducting wildlife surveys. ", "During initial floor consideration, the Senate rejected an amendment (45-52) to delete language on this subject. Those advocating deletion charged that the bill would overturn recent courtdecisions requiring agencies to undertake certain species monitoring and data collection beforeconducting timber sales. They argued that agencies should be required to develop new data onspecies, through comprehensive wildlife surveys, before making decisions on ground breakingactivities. ", "Supporters of the Senate-passed language had asserted that recent court rulings deviated from earlier ones allowing challenged timber sales to proceed, and upholding agency practices ofsurveying populations essentially by inventorying habitat and analyzing existing population data. They contended that recent court decisions setting conditions for species monitoring and datacollection would be impossible to meet, costing between $5 billion and $9 billion. Further, theyargued that the secretaries had discretion , to use where warranted, and that in the past agencies haveused discretion in implementing regulations in this area. They claimed that the language onlymaintains the status quo for one year (FY2000).", "LWCF Funding.

(See Table 3.) TheFY2000 enacted level was $131.7 million. The decrease for recovery shown in the Table is moreapparent than real; in FY1999, recovery included an earmarked $20 million for salmon recovery inWashington state. The Administration proposal assumed that the earmark was for FY1999 only. For FY2000, the law included an earmark of $3.9 million of recovery funds for salmon inWashington state. ", "The Administration proposed to continue a strict limit on funding for the listing function (which includes designation of critical habitat) and included its specific cap at the proposed level of $7.5million in the bill itself. The language limits the discretion of the agency to transfer funds foradditional listings, e.g ., if lawsuits mandate agency action on listing certain species. De-listing anddown-listing are not covered by the cap. With the cap, a court order to carry forward a listingdecision on particular species makes listing into a zero sum game, at least at a fiscal level: the listingof some species or designation of their critical habitats would preclude the listing of others. FWSsupported this change as a protection of the budgets of other programs. The FY2000 law containedthis limitation, and set funding for listing at $6.2 million. ", "The Administration also proposed a new restriction within the listing function. Under the proposed restriction, at most $1 million of the requested $7.5 million could be spent on criticalhabitat designation. FWS has traditionally de-emphasized designation of critical habitat, feeling itan inefficient use of resources; supporters of designation praise either the required consideration ofeconomic impacts of designation or the additional measure of protection that may be provided undersome circumstances. The FY2000 law did not include this limitation.", " Table 3.

Of this increase, $43million would be spent to augment the program of grants to states, and $20 million for landacquisition associated with Habitat Conservation Plans. The FY2000 law provided for $23.0million.", "The Administration proposed $10.0 million (-7.2%) for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, which provides payments to local governments in recognition of reduction of the local tax base dueto the presence of federal land. Congress appropriated $10.779 million for FY1999. The FY2000law provided for $10.779 million. The payment levels have been controversial, since the smalladditions of land to the National Wildlife Refuge System over the last several years mean thatreduced dollars must be spread still further. The situation has produced calls for Congress toincrease the appropriation, especially since local governments often (incorrectly) view the paymentsas entitlements, even though they are actually subject to annual appropriations. Payments underPILT (see BLM, above) benefit some counties with land in the National Wildlife Refuge System. However, those lands that are acquired rather than reserved from the public domain are not eligiblefor PILT payments.

During this period, Congress restricted appropriations to operateand maintain the Park System while expanding management responsibilities and continuing to addnew units to the System. It was asserted that restricted funding, combined with increased visitation,stretched personnel, impaired operations, and generated a multibillion dollar backlog of deferredmaintenance. However, spending for the NPS now appears to have a higher priority. Temporaryclosure of NPS units (part of a federal government-wide shutdown during the budget debates of late1995 and early 1996) helped galvanize public support for expanding NPS funding, which hasincreased annually since FY1996. In May 1999 the White House warned that the stringent spendingcaps set by the House Appropriations panel would lead to cuts to the NPS that threatened to forcereduced services and hours of operation at all park units and probable closure of smaller units andback-country areas of larger parks.

", "On a separate issue, legislation was enacted ( P.L. 104-185 ) in the 104th Congress, which authorized interested states that demonstrate competence, to collect royalties from federal oil andgas leases. The MMS functions that could be delegated to the states include: reporting of productionand royalties, error correction and automated verification.", "OCS Moratoria. During FY1996, as the 104th Congress revisited many regulatory programs, the OCS moratorium on leasing activity was debatedin some depth but was extended in several areas. The extension was continued through FY1999. Itwas supported by the House and the Senate for FY2000, and was continued in the FY2000appropriations law. In previous appropriations since the early 1980s, the moratoria had beenapproved annually, without extensive discussion. Each year, Congress banned the expenditure ofappropriated funds for any leasing activity in environmentally sensitive areas of the OCS. In 1990,President Bush issued a directive which parallels the moratoria, essentially banning OCS leasingactivity in places other than the Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama offshore. The executive branch banremains in effect. The moratoria apply only to environmentally sensitive areas. With the exceptionof the California OCS, little hydrocarbon production has occurred in these regions.", "Lease Sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Leasing continues in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico, where recent lease sales (FY1996-FY97) have been quiterobust. During 1996, the spring (Central Gulf) sale resulted in 606 tracts leased for total bonuses of$352 million. The fall (Western Gulf) sale resulted in 902 tracts leased for $512 million. And theCentral Gulf auction held March 5, 1997 set an all time record, attracting 1790 bids for 1,032 tracts.High bids totaled $824 million. ", "This was the last sale under the 1992-1997 leasing plan. FY1996 and FY1997 included four record breaking sales which produced over $2.4 billion in bonuses. The OCS Leasing Plan for theFY1997 to FY2002 period included a Western Gulf auction that took place in August, 1997. Thisrecord breaking August sale ($680 million) was 33 percent larger than the Western Gulf sale helda year earlier. Two additional sales in the Gulf of Mexico were also record breakers. The new planembodies the congressional moratoria, but envisions continued annual lease sales in Gulf Coastplanning areas, where lease sales have attracted great interest during 1996 and 1997 as the nation'soil imports rise to half of total consumption. Plans for oil and gas exploration have increased overthe past 2 years but actual activity on current leases in the OCS has decreased in FY1998 becauseof lower oil and gas prices.

MMS is proposing to increase its effortin technological needs and potential environmental issues associated with deep water drilling. Currently the Gulf of Mexico accounts for over half of the worlds drilling rigs operating indeepwater.", "Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA, P.L. 95-87 ) established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) to ensurethat land mined for coal would be returned to a condition capable of supporting its pre-mining landuse. SMCRA also established an Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund, with fees levied on coalproduction, to reclaim abandoned sites that pose serious health or safety hazards. Congress'intention was that individual states and Indian tribes would develop their own regulatory programsto enforce uniform minimum standards established by law and regulations. OSM is required tomaintain oversight of state regulatory programs. ", "The Administration request for the Office of Surface Mining for FY2000 -- at $305.8 million -- was $27.1 million above the FY1999 appropriation. Most of the increase was targeted toaccelerating the pace of abandoned mine land reclamation by boosting the appropriation from theAML fund in 2000. The total request included funding for Regulation and Technology programs andappropriations from the Abandoned Mine Lands fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act forFY2000 provided a total of $292.4 million for the Office of Surface Mining. ", "Of the total presidential request, $94.7 million was for Regulation and Technology programs -- an increase of $1.3 million from adjusted FY1999 levels that would restore some of the reductionmade in FY1999 from FY1998 levels. Senate Appropriations added $1.3 million to cover fixed costincreases, and an additional $1.5 million for state regulatory program grants, bringing the levelrecommended to the full Senate to nearly $96.2 million. The House approved $96.0 million; theSenate agreed to $96.2 million, and this level was enacted.", "The Administration's AML request for FY2000 was $211.2 million, an increase of $25.7 million over adjusted FY1999 levels.

The minimum funding level for each of these states was increased to $2 million in1992. However, over the objection of these states, Congress appropriated $1.5 million to minimumprogram states in FY1996-FY1998. The Administration budget proposed to restore the minimumfunding level to $2 million in FY2000. This, and the significant boost in the proposed appropriationfrom the AML fund, were apparently to address the dissatisfactions expressed in recent years bystates and tribes that are recipients of reclamation grants.", "Senate Appropriations, however, rejected the boost, recommending a level of $185.7 million, $25 million less than the Administration. This level was adopted by the full Senate. The Senateversion also accepted Committee recommendations to fund minimum program states at $1.5million, but did agree with boosting the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative (ACSI) to $7 million. The House Committee on Appropriations nearly split the boost requested by the Administration,recommending $196.5 million, but increasing ACSI to $8 million. These levels were adopted by thefull House. The conferees on H.R. 2466 settled upon an appropriation of $191.2 millionfor AML, $8 million to ACSI, and $1.5 million to the minimum program states.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides a wide variety of services to federally recognized American Indian andAlaska Native tribes and their members, and has historically been the lead agency in federal dealingswith tribes. Programs provided or funded through the BIA include government operations, courts,law enforcement, fire protection, social programs, education, roads, natural resource and real estatemanagement, economic development, employment assistance, housing repair, dams, Indian rightsprotection, implementation of land and water settlements, and partial gaming oversight, amongothers.", "The key issues for the BIA are the equitable distribution of BIA funding among tribes, the movement toward greater tribal influence on BIA programs and expenditures, especially the role ofcontract support costs, and BIA reorganization and downsizing. Additional significant issues raisedby proposed provisions of previous Interior appropriations bills have included taxation of certainIndian businesses and tribal sovereign immunity from suit.", "Greater tribal control over federal Indian programs has been the goal of Indian policy since the 1970s. In the BIA this policy has taken three forms: tribal contracting to run individual BIAprograms under the Indian Self-Determination Act ( P.L. 93-638 , as amended); tribal compacting with the BIA to manage all or most of a tribe's BIA programs, under the Self-Governance program( P.L. 103-413 ); and shifting programs into a portion of the BIA budget called Tribal PriorityAllocations (TPA), in which tribes have more influence in BIA budget planning and within whicheach tribe has authority to reprogram all its TPA funds. In FY1998 TPA accounts for 49.5% of theBIA's operation of Indian programs (including most of the BIA funding for tribal governments'operations, human services, courts and law enforcement, natural resources, and communitydevelopment) and for 44.5% of total BIA direct appropriations.", "The BIA has been under pressure from tribes, the administration, and Congress to reorganize, but proposals from the three sources have not always been in agreement. Under the ClintonAdministration's National Performance Review Reinventing Government initiative, the BIA hadplanned to pursue restructuring and downsizing through the \"tribal shares\" process (in which tribesand the BIA determine, first, which BIA functions are inherently federal and which are available fortribal management, and, second, what each tribe's share of funds is for the latter functions), but theBIA has indicated that the Interior solicitor has advised against such a procedure. AppropriationsCommittee reports for FY1997 and FY1998 directed the BIA to develop a reorganization plan andconsolidate central, area, and agency offices. Consequently, the BIA indicated it is developingreorganization plans and consolidation options. With the appropriations committees' approval, theBIA commissioned the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) to study BIA'sadministration and management. NAPA published its report in September 1999 ( A Study ofManagement and Administration: The Bureau of Indian Affairs ). ", "The conference committee on the FY2000 Interior appropriations bill ( H.R. 2466 )noted NAPA's conclusion that the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs lacks \"the staff supportnecessary to lead BIA, particularly in the areas of planning, budgeting, human resourcesmanagement, and information resource management\"; recommended that BIA implement the NAPAreport; and provided $250,000 for an office of policy analysis and planning at BIA's Washingtoncentral office. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 directed the Secretary of theInterior to reorganize the BIA based on the NAPA recommendations and provided $5 million for thispurpose.", "The issue of the equitable distribution of BIA funding--often referred to as \"means-testing\"--has two aspects, one relating to how funds are distributed, the other relating towhether a tribe's other financial resources are taken into account. First, much if not most BIAfunding, even while serving tribal needs, is not required to be distributed on a national per capita orother formula basis. Second, tribes' own non-BIA resources, especially business revenues, are notalways required to be taken into account. For both the FY1998 and FY1999 Interior appropriationsbills, the Senate Appropriations Committee proposed (1) requiring the BIA to develop severalalternate formulas for distributing TPA funds on the basis of need, taking into account tribal businessrevenues including gaming, and (2) requiring tribes to submit tribal business revenue informationto BIA, and in the FY1999 bill proposed implementing the new distribution formula in FY2000. Inaddition, the Senate Committee's FY1999 bill proposed reallocating half of TPA funds from tribes(outside Alaska) in the top 10% of per-capita tribal business revenues to tribes in the bottom 20%of per-capita tribal business revenues. The House Appropriations Committee provided $250,000 inFY1999 to continue the FY1998 TPA-allocation workgroup (see below) to developneeds-measurement methods, directed the BIA to develop TPA allocation criteria that address equityin TPA funding, and included an administrative provision assuring tribes who return funds to theBIA that the federal trust responsibility to them, and the federal government-to-governmentrelationship with the tribes, will not be diminished.", "Supporters of the Senate Committee's proposals claim that BIA funding is inequitably distributed, that poorer tribes do not receive adequate funding, that tribal TPA funds received percapita do not correspond with indicators of tribal need, that only 30 percent of TPA funding is basedon formulas, and that a GAO study shows some rich tribes got more TPA funds in FY1998 thantribes with no outside revenues. Opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty, that BIAfunding is insufficient to meet tribal needs, and that means-testing TPA funding would penalizetribes who still have severe needs, would violate the federal trust responsibility to tribes, has notbeen fully analyzed, and would be unfair since it is not required of state or local governmentsreceiving federal assistance.", "In considering similar proposals in the FY1998 appropriations bill, Congress had dropped the requirements for a formula and tribal income data, and instead had distributed some FY1998 TPAfunds so that each tribe might receive the minimum funding recommended by the 1994 report of theJoint Tribal/BIA/DOI Task Force on BIA Reorganization ($160,000 per tribe, except $200,000 pertribe in Alaska), with allocation of any remaining TPA funds based on recommendation of atribal/federal task force. In addition, several Senators had requested the GAO to report on TPAdistribution issues. The tribal/federal TPA task force made its distribution recommendations onJanuary 29, 1998, and also recommended creating a long-term workgroup on TPA fundingallocation, a recommendation the BIA supported. The GAO presented its TPA distribution studyin April and July, 1998. Among the GAO findings were that two-thirds of FY1998 TPA funds weredistributed based on historical levels and one-third was distributed based on formulas, that TPAdistribution per capita varied widely across BIA areas, and that tribal governments' reporting ofrevenues were inconsistent in including or excluding non-federal revenues. The GAO results wereused by the Senate Appropriations Committee in developing the FY1999 proposals described above.", "Congress, in the Interior appropriations portion of the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act, dropped the Senate Appropriations Committee's proposed reallocation scheme and dropped therequirement that tribes submit revenue data, but retained the requirement that the BIA developproposals for alternative TPA funding methods. Congress also retained the House provision of$250,000 for the TPA workgroup and the language concerning tribes returning funds to the BIA. The BIA/Tribal Workgroup on Tribal Needs Assessment, formed in January 1998, delivered itsreport in July 1999. Among the reports conclusions were that variation in tribes' circumstancesmakes formula distribution problematic; TPA funding results from history, geography, and policies;current funding does not meet needs identified; measures of tribal need and revenue are not fullyavailable; and base TPA funding should not be redistributed.", "For FY2000, the Senate proposed authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to redistribute TPA funds--without reducing any tribe's TPA share more than 10%--to alleviate tribal fundinginequities to meet identified unmet needs. The House had no similar proposal. The conferencereport on H.R. 2466 included the Senate's proposal but allowed the Secretary to go overthe 10% limit in situations of dual enrollment, overlapping service areas, or inaccurate distributionmethodologies. The Senate bill also directed the BIA to distribute funds for its post-secondaryinstitutions by formula. The conference report on H.R. 2466 included this provision. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 retained both the TPA and post-secondary fundingprovisions as approved in the conference report.", "During congressional debates over FY1997 and FY1998 Interior appropriations, Congress considered but did not approve several additional controversial provisions. One proposal, consideredin the House, would have prohibited the Interior Secretary from using his general authority to takeland into trust for a tribe unless the tribe had agreed with state and local governments on thecollection of state and local retail sales taxes from non-members of the tribe. (This proposal wasalso introduced in the 105th Congress in H.R. 1168 , on which hearings were held June24, 1998.) The other provision, proposed by the Senate Appropriations Committee, would havewaived tribal governments' sovereign immunity to civil suit in federal court if a tribe accepted TPAfunding. The tribal immunity waiver provision was withdrawn on the Senate floor. The SenateIndian Affairs Committee held several hearings in 1998 on a bill ( S. 1691 , introducedFebruary 27, 1998) restricting tribal sovereign immunity. One of the issues raised at the hearingswas the degree to which tribes are insured against torts and other liability claims. At theCommittee's mark-up of S. 1691 , consideration was postponed on the motion of thebill's sponsor, who later introduced five new, more specific bills. ", "Neither of these proposals was offered during consideration of FY1999 Interior appropriations. In the Interior portion of the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act, however, Congress required theInterior Secretary to study tribal liability insurance coverage and make a report with legislativerecommendations by April 1, 1999. The Joint BIA/Tribal Workgroup on Tribal Needs Assessmentwas charged with preparing the insurance coverage report.", "In considering the FY1999 and FY2000 bills, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees took note of several further issues. In the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act,Congress placed BIA-funded law enforcement under centralized line authority and made BIAlaw-enforcement funds unavailable for reprogramming; no changes were suggested for FY2000. Concerning support costs for self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts, Congressfor FY1999 forbade use of FY1999 funds to pay for unpaid contract support costs from earlier years,in spite of court decisions confirming federal responsibility for such costs. The House and theSenate recommended the same provision for FY2000, and it was included in the conference reportand the FY2000 appropriations law. For FY1999 Congress also approved a one-year moratoriumon self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts, so that the BIA and tribes couldaddress the contract support costs problem and the GAO could conduct a study of the issue. TheGAO's report, published in June 1999 ( Indian Self-Determination Act: Shortfalls in Indian ContractSupport Costs Need to be Addressed , GAO/RCED-99-150), offered four alternative methods forfunding contract support costs and recommended that BIA and IHS be directed to develop a standardpolicy on funding contract support costs. For FY2000, the Senate recommended an extension of themoratorium on self-determination contracts and compacts, while the House bill contained noprovision for a moratorium. The conference committee bill included the moratorium provision, butthe Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 dropped the moratorium provision.", "In addition, Congress for FY1999 included bill language restricting the \"Huron Cemetery\" in Kansas to use as a cemetery (an Oklahoma tribe has at times proposed using it for gaming). TheSenate recommended the same provision for FY2000, and it was included in the conference reportand in the FY2000 appropriations law. For FY2000, the Senate also would prohibit taking lands intotrust in Clark County, Washington, for the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe pending tribal-countyagreement on development issues. The conference committee retained this provision, as did theenacted measure.", "The Senate during debate on the FY1999 Interior appropriations bill approved an amendment prohibiting the Interior Secretary from approving class III Indian gaming compacts without stateapproval and from promulgating during FY1999 proposed regulations for approving gamingcompacts in situations where a state invokes its immunity from suit over compact negotiations. Congress chose only to prohibit promulgation of the regulations, and that only for the first half ofFY1999. The regulations were promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior on April 12, 1999 (64FR 17535) and immediately challenged in federal court by Florida and Alabama, who argue theSecretary has no authority for such regulations under IGRA. The Secretary has stated that he wouldnot approve any compacts under the regulations until the courts decided whether he had suchauthority. For FY2000, neither appropriations committee reported any gaming-compact provisions;the House did not accept a proposed amendment to prohibit funding for any gaming compacts notagreed to by both a state and a tribe, but the Senate did approve a provision prohibiting funds toimplement the Secretary's April 1999 regulations. The conference committee on H.R. 2466 dropped the Senate provision, based on the Interior Secretary's assurances that he would notimplement these regulations until federal courts ruled on their legality. The ConsolidatedAppropriations Act for FY2000 followed the conference recommendation.", "BIA's FY1999 direct appropriations enacted to date were $1.746 billion.

Indian trust funds were formerly managed by the BIA,but numerous federal, tribal, and congressional reports had shown severely inadequate management,with probable losses to Indian tribal and individual beneficiaries. Indian trust funds comprise twosets of funds: (1) tribal funds owned by about 315 tribes in approximately 1,600 accounts, with atotal asset value of about $2.5 billion; and (2) individual Indians' funds, known as Individual IndianMoney (IIM) accounts, in 341,645 accounts with a total asset value of $433.3 million. (Figures arefrom the OST FY2000 budget justifications.) The funds include monies received both from claimsawards, land or water rights settlements, and other one-time payments, and from income fromphysical trust assets (e.g., land, timber, minerals), as well as investment income. In 1996, atCongress' direction, the Secretary of the Interior transferred trust fund management from the BIAto the OST.", "While a congressionally-required outside audit has been made of non-investment transactions--deposits and withdrawals--in tribal trust fund accounts (for the 20-year period1973-1992), Congress did not require that the outside auditors examine transactions in the IIM accounts, so their reconciliation status has been in doubt. On June 11, 1996, a class-action suit wasfiled in federal court against the federal government on behalf of all IIM account owners. The suitsought an accounting of the IIM funds, establishment of adequate management systems, and fullrestitution of any money lost from the IIM accounts. The case was certified as a class action inFebruary 1997. Because the BIA and the departments of the Interior and Treasury were unable toproduce the trust records for five named plaintiffs in the case, as had been ordered by the federalcourt as part of trial preparation, the secretaries of the Interior and Treasury and the assistantsecretary--Indian affairs were held in contempt of court on Feb. 22, 1999.

The plan recommended creation of a new federally chartered agency,to which trust funds and assets would be transferred, and management and investment of the fundsand assets to assist Indian economic growth. While considering FY1998 Interior appropriations,Congress noted departmental and some tribal opposition to the Strategic Plan, especially to theproposed new agency. Congress directed the OST not to implement the proposed new agency butto pursue trust funds systems improvements and OST responsibilities relating to the settlement offinancial claims made by tribal and individual beneficiaries, before Congress and in court, becauseof BIA trust-funds mismanagement. In August 1997 the Secretary of the Interior agreed toimplement aspects of the Strategic Plan dealing with trust management systems, data cleanup, andtrust asset processing backlogs, and in July 1998 he issued a \"High-Level Implementation Plan\" forthis Trust Management Improvement Project. On Jan. 5, 1999, the Secretary ordered areorganization of the OST, creating a principal deputy special trustee who would carry out policy andbudget execution, budget formulation, and day-to-day operations, and to whom would report the trustfunds management office and the new office for trust litigation support and trust recordsmanagement created by the same order.

Contract support costs are the costs awarded to a tribe for the administration of aprogram under a contract or compact authorized by the Indian Self-Determination Act. Theoperation costs for these contracts and compacts are allocated separately. Congress has tried toensure that contract support funds are distributed fairly. Under a proposed pro-rata distributionscheme, the support for current tribal organizations and individual tribes would decline as new tribesentered into contracts and compacts.

The Act's conference report strongly encourages the Service to continueits work with the tribes and with the legislative committees of jurisdiction in an effort to resolve thelegislative discrepancies that exist currently and to ensure that these costs can be funded fairly. Infact, the Act's conference report noted a recent court decision that decided that the law unequivocallymakes contracts providing such costs subject to the availability of appropriations and that any agencycan only spend as much money as has been appropriated for contract support costs. ", "The Act's conference report agreed with House language on the distribution of funding increases among IHS programs. The Act's conference report stated that fixed cost increases shouldbe distributed equitably across all Service-operated and tribally-operated programs. Other programincreases should not automatically be distributed on a pro-rata basis. For example, a $1,000,000program increase distributed across all health programs would give each program an insignificantamount of additional funding. In such a case, the Act's conference report wanted the IHS to selecta very limited number of projects so that demonstrable results can be achieved.

ONHIR classifies families as relocated when they occupy their replacement home. Most relocateesare Navajo. A large majority of the estimated 3,497 Navajo families formerly on the land partitionedto the Hopi have already relocated under the Act, but the House Appropriations Committee in 1999estimated that 455 families (almost all Navajo) had yet to complete relocation, including about 72Navajo families still on Hopi partitioned land (some of whom refuse to relocate).

Like the FY1997-FY1999 Interior appropriations acts, the FY2000 Interior appropriations billproposed by the President contains a proviso forbidding ONHIR from evicting any Navajo familyfrom Hopi partitioned lands unless a replacement home is provided. This language appears toprevent ONHIR from forcibly relocating Navajo families, since ONHIR has a large backlog of otherfamilies that need homes. The settlement agreement approved by P.L. 104-301 , however, allows theHopi Tribe under certain circumstances to begin quiet-possession actions against the United Statesin the year 2000 if Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land have not entered into leases with theHopi Tribe.", "Congress has in the past been concerned by the slow pace of relocation and by relocatees' apparent low level of interest in moving to the \"new lands\" acquired for the Navajo reservation forrelocatee use. Appropriations Committee reports in 1995, 1996, and 1997 called on ONHIR toexplore termination of the relocation program, and the Senate in the 104th Congress considered a billphasing out ONHIR. Similar language is not included by the House, Senate, or conferencecommittees for FY2000.", "For FY1999, ONHIR received appropriations of $13 million. For FY2000, the administration proposed $14 million, while the House recommended $13.4 million. The Senate, citing an ONHIRunobligated balance carryover of $12 million, recommended a reduction to $8 million for FY2000and directed ONHIR to reduce the unobligated balance. The conference report on H.R. 2466 included the amount recommended by the Senate and the Consolidated Appropriations Act forFY2000 did the same.", "Other Related Agencies. One of the pervasive issues for the programs and agencies delineated below is whether federal government support for thearts and culture is an appropriate federal role, and if it is, what should be the shape of that support. If the continued federal role is not appropriate, might the federal commitment be scaled back suchthat greater private support or state support would be encouraged? Each program has its own uniquerelationship to this overarching issue.", "Smithsonian. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum, education and research complex of 16 museums and galleries and the National Zoo. Nineof its museums and galleries are located on the Mall between the U.S. Capitol and the Washingtonmonument, and SI counted over 30 million visitors in 1998 (The National Air and Space Museumalone had 8.8 million visitors in 1998). The Smithsonian is estimated to be 70+ percent federallyfunded. A federal commitment was established by initial legislation in 1846. In addition to receivingfederal appropriations, the Smithsonian has private trust funds, which include endowments,donations, and other revenues from its memberships for Smithsonian National and ResidentAssociates, sales stores, and magazine, as well as comparable membership programs for individualfacilities (which are relatively autonomous in their operations, e.g., the National Air and SpaceMuseum and the National Zoo, etc.)", "The FY2000 Clinton Administration budget would have provided $447.4 million to the Smithsonian, (an increase of $35.147 million above the FY1999 appropriation) and $380.5 millionof that amount was for salaries and expenses. Of the total for the Smithsonian, $19 million wasrequested for completion of construction of the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI)on the Mall. Initially, the NMAI was controversial; opponents of the new museum argued that thecurrent Smithsonian museums needed renovation, repair, and maintenance of the collection with anestimated 141 million items, more than the public needed another museum on the Mall. Proponentsargued that there had been too long a delay in providing a museum \"in Washington\" to house theIndian collection. Private donations to the Smithsonian and a fund-raising campaign focusing onindividuals, foundations, and corporations totaled $36.7 million, representing one-third of the totalcost, and the amount required to meet the non-appropriated portion of project funding. Of thisamount, an estimated $15 million came from the Indian community directly. Congress asked thatthere be an attempt to \"scale down\" the plans and cost of the museum. However, the total projectedcost of the American Indian museum still remained at an estimated $110 million. The final FY1999Interior appropriations provided $16 million for the construction of the American Indian Museum.The groundbreaking ceremony for the NMAI took place September 28, 1999. ", "The FY2000 budget request included $47.9 million for repair, restoration and alteration forSmithsonian buildings. Four of the Smithsonian's buildings account for approximately 30% of theSI's public space: the National Museum of Natural History (built in 1910), the American Art andPortrait Gallery (built between 1836 and 1860), the Castle building (built 1846), and the Arts andIndustries building (1849). The Smithsonian contends that funding for repair and renewal of SI'sfacilities has not kept pace with need, resulting in increased deterioration of the physical plant. Infact, the report of the Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian concluded that a total of $50million each year for the next decade would be necessary to \"assure that present facilities are restoredto the point of being safe for people and collections;\" and considering the national zoo separately,it would need $10 million a year for the next 5 years. The FY2000 budget request included $17million to become available October 1, 2000, to complete the renovation of the American Art andPortrait Gallery, and $6 million for the National Zoo repair and restoration. ", "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the FY2000 Interior appropriations bill providing $423 million for the Smithsonian, including $364.6 million for salaries and expenses, $35million for repair and restoration of buildings, and $4.4 million for zoo improvements. The HouseAppropriations Committee's reported FY2000 Interior appropriations bill ( H.Rept. 106-222 )provided $438.4 million for the Smithsonian, including $371.5 million for salaries and expenses, and$47.9 million for restoration of buildings. Both the House and Senate reported bills concurred with$19 million to complete construction of the National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall.The House-passed bill, H.R. 2466 maintained the same appropriation level for theSmithsonian as reported by the House. The Senate-passed bill provided $425.5 million for theSmithsonian, including $367.1 million for salaries and expenses, $35 million for repair, $4.4 for zooimprovements and $19 million for the American Indian Museum. (The Senate funding level wasaltered by an amendment (no.1593) that increased funding for \"certain programs\" of theSmithsonian.) The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000, ( H.Rept.106-479 / H.R. 3194 ) provided $439.8 million for the Smithsonian, including $372.9million for salaries and expenses, $47.9 million for repair and restoration, and $19 million forconstruction of the National Museum of the American Indian. ", "The Smithsonian indicated that it has a 5-year strategic plan in accordance with provisions ofthe Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and in keeping with the Smithsonian'smission. A report published in October 1997, Toward a Shared Vision: U.S. Latinos and theSmithsonian Institution, questioned the Smithsonian's mission with regard to Latinos. The reportindicated that although there is a significant change in commitment by top management at theSmithsonian toward including Latinos in all aspects of the Smithsonian, some of the implementationof the plan has lagged. In a positive response to these findings, a new Latino studies fellowshipprogram grant was established in 1998 for pre- and postdoctoral research in Latino history, art, andculture using Smithsonian resources.", "The Smithsonian marked its 150th anniversary in 1996 and generated public programs including \"America's Smithsonian,\" a traveling exhibit. The Smithsonian indicated that to offset the high costof the traveling exhibit, the SI might require admission charges for other special exhibits in theSmithsonian buildings on the Mall. Although the Smithsonian did not implement a policy ofadmission charges, the fact that the Smithsonian was considering admission fees may be a signal forthe future. In view of the trend toward diminished federal support, the Smithsonian has used bondissues for some construction projects including the renovation of the Dulles National Air and SpaceMuseum extension and of the National Museum of Natural History. In contrast, the largest singlecontribution to the Smithsonian from a private donor --$60 million--was pledged to NASM'sDulles Center in October 1999. In addition, a cash gift of $20 million was given by another donorfor the renovation of the Natural History Museum.", "For further information on the Smithsonian , see its World Wide Web site at http://www.si.edu/newstart.htm", "National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Institute of Museum Services. One of the primary vehicles for federalsupport for arts, humanities and museums is the National Foundation on the Arts and theHumanities, composed of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the National Endowmentfor the Humanities (NEH), and the Institute of Museum Services (IMS, now a newly constitutedInstitute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) with an Office of Museum Services (OMS)). Theauthorizing act, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, has expired but hasbeen operating on temporary authority through appropriations law. The last reauthorization for theNational Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities occurred in 1990 and expired in FY1993.Authority has been carried through appropriations language since that time. The 104th Congressestablished the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) under P.L. 104-208 .", "Among the questions Congress is considering is whether funding for the arts, humanities, and museums is an appropriate federal role and responsibility. Some opponents to arts support argue thatNEA and NEH should be abolished altogether, contending that the federal government should notbe in the business of supporting arts and humanities. Other opponents argue that culture can anddoes flourish on its own through private support. Proponents of federal support for arts andhumanities argue that the federal government has a long tradition of such support, beginning as earlyas 1817, with congressional appropriations for works of art to adorn the U.S. Capitol. Spokesmenfor the private sector say that they are unable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss offederal funds for the arts. Some argue that abolishing NEA and NEH will curtail or eliminate theprograms that have national purposes (such as touring theater and dance companies, radio andtelevision shows, traveling museum exhibitions, etc.)", "The Administration's FY2000 budget would have provided $150 million each for NEA and NEH and $34 million for OMS within the Institute of Museum and Library Services. For the NEAthis would have included $50 million for a new program Challenge America including \"artseducation, youth-at-risk programs, cultural heritage preservation, community arts partnerships, andaccess to the arts.\" State arts agencies would have received 40 percent of the funds, and at least 1,000communities nationwide, particularly those from under-represented areas, would benefit. For theNEH, $150 million would have provided a 40 percent increase in number of humanities seminars,a funding increase for the 56 state humanities councils ($110.8 million for grant programs), a specialgrant competition, American Legacy Editions, in support of editions of the writings of U.S.presidents and major historical figures, and a special grant competition to expand the number ofregional humanities centers. For the IMLS, OMS would have received $15.6 million for GeneralOperating Support (GOS) to help museums improve the quality of their services to the public--theyare already popular, serving over 600 million visitors annually. OMS is helping to develop MuseumsOnline , an Internet package that will bring the educational and cultural significance of museums tocommunities and schools, with the potential to reach an estimated 22 million people. OMS supportof Museum/school partnerships last year helped to reach 228 schools, 82 museums, and 82,000students. ", "In the 105th Congress, elimination of the NEA was once again on a list of priorities for some House members. Among the House Republican leadership, a small group was formed called the\"values action team,\" to coordinate legislative action with conservative groups (e.g., ChristianCoalition, Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council). In contrast, the CongressionalMember Organization for the Arts (CMO) testified in favor of full support for the arts. ThePresident's Committee on the Arts released a publication, Creative America that recommends thatfederal funding be restored for NEA, NEH and IMLS to levels \"adequate to fulfill their nationalroles.\" The goal expressed was for appropriations to equal $2.00 per person by the year 2000 for allthree agencies.", "The controversy involving charges of obscenity concerning a small number of NEA individual grants still lingers in spite of attempts to resolve these problems through statutory provisions. Todate, no NEA projects have been judged obscene by the courts. On November 5, 1996, a federalappeals court upheld an earlier decision, NEA v. Finley , ruling that applying the \"general standardsof decency\" clause to NEA grants was \"unconstitutional.\" However, in anticipation of congressionalreaction to NEA's individual grants, NEA eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline, exceptto maintain Literature fellowships, Jazz masters and National Heritage fellowships in the Folk andTraditional Arts. On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court reversed the federal appeals court decisionfor NEA v. Finley (CA9,100F.3d 671) by a vote of 8 to 1, stating that the NEA can consider \"generalstandards of decency\" when judging grants for artistic merit, and that the decency provision does not\"inherently interfere with First amendment rights nor violate constitutional vagueness principles.\"", "In the 105th Congress, the FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-83 ) included NEA reform measures; among them was an increase in the funding allocation from 35% to 40% to statesfor basic state arts grants and for grants to underserved populations. In addition, languageemphasizing arts education was included. The legislation placed a 15% cap on NEA funds allocatedto each state, exempting only those grants with a national impact. Three members of the House andthree members of the Senate were added to the National Council on the Arts, but the size of theNational Council was reduced from 26 to 20. Both NEA and NEH were given specific authority tosolicit funding and to invest those funds.", "Also in the 105th Congress, in June, 1998 the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee marked up the FY1999 Interior Appropriations bill recommending \"termination of $98 million forthe National Endowment for the Arts.\" NEA funding was tossed back and forth. The HouseAppropriations Committee restored $98 million for NEA (an amendment to restore funding wasadopted by a vote of 31-27). The full House, on a point of order, removed $98 million for NEA,stating that there was no program authorization. However, on July 21, 1998, the House voted(253-173) to approve an amendment to restore $98 million for the NEA in FY1999. The FY1999Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $98 million for the NEA, $110.7 million for NEH, and$23.405 million for the OMS.", "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill ( S. 1292 , S.Rept. 106-99 ), providing $99 million for NEA and $111.7 million for NEH,an additional $1 million above the FY1999 appropriations level for each of the Endowments. ACommittee amendment introduced by Senator Cochran to increase NEH by an additional $10 millionwas withdrawn. The Institute of Museum and Library Services' Office of Museum Services wouldhave received $23.9 million, a slight increase ($500,000) from the FY1999 appropriation. The HouseAppropriations Committee's reported bill ( H.Rept. 106-222 ) would have provided $98 million forNEA and $110.7 million for NEH, the same as the FY1999 enacted appropriation, and $24.4 millionfor the Office of Museum Services, an increase of $995,000 over the FY1999 appropriation. ", "On July 15, 1999, the House passed the FY2000 Interior appropriations bill ( H.R. 2466 ) allowing the same appropriation for NEA, NEH, and OMS as reported by the House. Anamendment by Representative Slaughter to increase funding for NEA and NEH by $10 million eachand to decrease Strategic Petroleum Reserve funding by $20 million was rejected (207-217). Anamendment by Representative Stearns to reduce funding for NEA by $2 million was rejected(300-124). An additional amendment by Representative Stearns, that was withdrawn, would haveplaced in a block grant to states 95% of NEA funds, with allocations based on population. OnSeptember 14th, 1999 during consideration of H.R. 2466 , the Senate adoptedamendments (1493, 1597) to increase the NEA appropriation to $103 million and the NEH to $115.7million. Final Senate passage on September 23, 1999 retained those amounts. As enacted, theConsolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000, provided $98 million for the NEA, $115.7 millionfor NEH, and $24.4 million for OMS.", "For further information on the National Endowment for the Arts , see its site at http://arts.endow.gov/", "For further information on the National Endowment for the Humanities , see its site at http://ns1.neh.fed.us:80/", "For further information on the Institute of Museum Services , see its site at http://www.imls.fed.us/"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cross-cutting Issue", "paragraphs": ["The Lands Legacy Initiative. On January 12, 1999, the Clinton Administration announced an initiative that addressed many resource protectionissues. This initiative was included in the FY2000 budget proposal, and many of its componentshave been incorporated in legislation introduced by Senator Boxer ( S. 446 ) andRepresentative Miller ( H.R. 798 ). Other broad legislative proposals that are relatedhave been introduced by Representative Young ( H.R. 701 ) and Senator Landrieu( S. 25 ). H.R. 701 was reported by the House Resources Committee,amended, on November 10, 1999. One component of the Administration's proposal addressedentirely in Interior Appropriations is increasing federal land acquisition funding using the Land andWater Conservation Fund (LWCF). Other components, portions of which would fall under thejurisdiction of Interior Appropriations, include: (1) providing grants to states and localities toacquire land and plan for open space; (2) expanding funding for other resource protection effortsincluding protection of farm land, forest land and range land, and land and resource restoration; (3)funding smart growth partnerships; and (4) expanding funding for ocean and coastal protection.", "The Administration estimated that these proposals would require just over $1 billion to fully implement, and projected that most of the funding, $900 million, would come from fully funding theLWCF at its currently authorized maximum level of $900 million.

The House Appropriations Committee listed several \"troubling\" aspects of the proposalin the committee report, including that most of the funds would not go to federal agencies, there isa large maintenance backlog that would not be addressed, and some funds would be spent onpurposes that have little to do with the activities of the federal agencies. This should not be asurprise, as earlier, on February 8, 1999, Representative Ralph Regula, Chairman of the InteriorAppropriations Subcommittee, expressed concern about the President's Lands Legacy Initiative. Henoted that it conflicted with the Subcommittee's number one priority of addressing the criticalbacklog maintenance problems and operational shortfalls in national parks, wildlife refuges, nationalforests, and other public lands totaling more than $15 billion. The House provided $159.5 millionand earmarked most funds to specified acquisitions.

", "The Senate Appropriations Committee also rejected the Administration proposal and in its report commented that the proposals would change the purposes of the LWCF in many ways iffunded. The Committee stated that a minority of the $900 million would be spent for purposescurrently funded through the LWCF and called for authorizing these changes before funds areappropriated. The report did state that the Committee supports many existing programs that theAdministration proposed increased funding for, but not at the proposed levels. The Senate provided$197.9 million for the LWCF, $215 million less than the Administration's request.

Of this total, $81 million will go to the Forest Service and $116.5 million to the threeland acquisition agencies at the Department of the Interior.
