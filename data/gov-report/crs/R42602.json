Areas behind and below Corps dams and around Corps locks, levees, and waterways are popular recreation sites, attracting 370 million visits annually. Corps projects are some of the most densely used federal recreation sites. Title 36, Section 327, of the Code of Federal Regulations sets out the regulations for public use of Corps projects. Section 327.13 generally prohibits possession of loaded firearms by private (i.e., non-law enforcement) individuals at Corps-administered projects unless the firearms are being used for hunting at designated areas (with devices required to be unloaded while transported to and from the hunting areas) or for shooting at authorized shooting ranges. The regulation applies at projects regardless of their location in states allowing open or concealed carry of loaded firearms.", "Corps lands with public access are open for hunting unless designated as closed for hunting (36 C.F.R. \u00a7327.8). Roughly half (4.4 million acres) of Corps fee-owned land is closed to hunting but open to the public; on these lands, Corps regulations allow unloaded firearms and prohibit loaded firearms. The other half of Corps fee-owned land is open to hunting or shooting in designated shooting areas; Corps regulations allow loaded firearms for hunting in areas open to hunting or shooting in designated shooting areas.", "Legislation proposed in the 113th Congress (e.g., H.R. 2046, the Recreational Lands Self-Defense Act; Section 103 of S. 1335, the Sportsmen's Act) would have banned the Secretary of the Army from promulgating or enforcing regulations that prohibit individuals from possessing firearms, including assembled or functional firearms, at Corps projects. The proposed language would have required firearms possession to comply with state law. Supporters saw the proposed legislation as addressing a patchwork of regulations restricting firearms on federal lands, providing consistency for open and concealed firearms possession within a state, and facilitating recreational shooting and self-defense. They argued that enactment would result in Corps policies consistent with legislation that made it legal for individuals to possess firearms at National Park Service (NPS) and National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) units of the Department of the Interior (DOI). Other stakeholders were concerned that the proposed legislation could have produced unintended safety and security issues. No armed federal law enforcement officers are commissioned for public safety and security purposes at Corps projects. Corps rangers issue citations for regulatory violations and are not allowed to carry firearms. Most law enforcement at Corps projects is provided by local and state personnel.", "The issue for the 113th Congress was not only whether to alter the Corps firearms regulations but also how to maintain public safety and infrastructure security at Corps projects. The proposed language would have eliminated the Secretary of the Army's ability to enforce or promulgate regulations on firearms restrictions in areas of Corps projects that are open to the public if possession were in compliance with state law. However, individuals still would have had to comply with Title 18, Section 930, of the United States Code, which restricts possession of firearms at a \"federal facility,\" and the agency still would have been able to restrict public access to project areas under its authority in Title 16, Section 460d, of the United States Code. Therefore, which Corps facilities qualify as a \"federal facility\" under Title 18, Section 930, of the United States Code becomes a topic of interest. Under the proposed legislation, consistent with state law and firearms restrictions in Title 18, Section 930, of the United States Code, loaded firearms would have been allowed at all Corps project areas open to the public."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current and Proposed Corps Firearms Policy", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages numerous water resource projects, such as dams and locks, across the United States.

Current Corps regulations prohibit possession of loaded firearms by private individuals at areas of Corps projects that are open to the public unless they are used for hunting in areas that are open to hunting or for shooting at authorized shooting ranges. The regulation applies at Corps projects regardless of their location in states allowing open or concealed carry of loaded firearms.

During the five years FY2008 through FY2012, warnings for firearms, explosives, other weapons, and fireworks averaged 33 annually from an average annual total of 22,207 warnings; similar citations averaged 21 annually from an annual average of 2,195."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Use and Access at Corps Projects", "paragraphs": ["Most Corps water resources projects are constructed primarily to produce economic and public safety benefits through promoting navigation and reducing exposure to flood waters. Congress, in multiple laws, also has provided the Corps with authorities to support other activities at its projects. Consequently, Corps projects such as dams are often multipurpose. That is, they produce hydroelectric power and store water for municipal, industrial, and agricultural use as well as provide navigation and flood damage reduction. Congress also gave the Corps authority to support some recreation at its projects. ", "In carrying out its water resources mission, the Corps is responsible for 8.8 million acres of Corps fee-owned land; the agency manages 422 lake and river projects with recreation, 92,844 campsites, 7,700 miles of trails, and 3,544 boat launches. Corps projects provide 33% of U.S. freshwater available for lake fishing. Roughly half of Corps fee-owned lands are open for hunting, and there are a small number of authorized shooting ranges. Corps projects receive 370 million recreational visits annually, making its projects the most visited of any single federal agency's sites; that is, the Corps hosts 20% of the visits to federal recreation areas on 2% of the federal lands. One reason for the high visitation is close proximity to population centers: 90% of Corps recreation areas are within 50 miles of a metropolitan area. Examples of Corps projects with significant public use are reservoirs at multipurpose dams (e.g., Lake Lanier in Georgia, Lake Texoma in Oklahoma and Texas, and Missouri River mainstem dams) and navigation locks.

Other stakeholders raised concerns that the proposed legislation ignored implementation challenges at Corps projects that are not generally faced at NPS and NWRS units (e.g., presence of critical facilities, limited law enforcement authority) and that enactment could have produced unintended public safety and infrastructure security issues.

At issue is whether enactment of legislation similar to the proposals in the 113 th Congress may complicate or hamper the Corps' ability to maintain the security of these facilities given the Corps' limited law enforcement authority.", "Legislation considered in the 113 th Congress would not have explicitly provided the Corps with authority to restrict firearms at Corps facilities that are open to the public. While not explicitly providing the Corps with authority to restrict firearms at its facilities, the proposed prohibition against enforcement of Title 36, Section 327.0, of the Code of Federal Regulations would not have altered the more general existing federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7930) that prohibits possession of firearms at a \"federal facility.\" A \"federal facility\" is defined as \"a building or part thereof owned or leased by the federal government, where Federal employees are regularly present for the purpose of performing their official duties.\" Which Corps facilities that are open to the public, such as recreation and improved campground facilities, locks, exposed hydropower elements, and levees on Corps fee-owned land, may qualify under this \"federal facility\" definition remains an open question.", "The Corps' authority to restrict public access (16 U.S.C. \u00a7460d) also would appear to have remained unchanged under the proposed legislation. Existing Corps regulations (36 C.F.R. \u00a7327.12) authorize the District Commander to \"close or restrict the use of a project or portion of a project when necessitated,\" including for reasons of public safety.

DOI has the authority to designate officers with the full range of law enforcement functions. Thus, when P.L. 111-24 made it legal for individuals to possess firearms at NPS and NWRS units, public safety and security at those sites could be enforced by personnel with the full range of law enforcement functions, including the authority to carry arms, make arrests without warrants, execute warrants, and conduct investigations. ", "In contrast, Congress has limited enforcement by Corps rangers to issuing citations for violations of regulations. Corps rangers principally have land management functions with duties related to recreation and natural resources management (e.g., fisheries and wildlife biologist and forester). ", "Full police power at Corps projects, including the power to enforce state and local laws and place persons under arrest, is exercised solely by state and local authorities. Consequently, the Corps relies on the assistance and cooperation of local and state law enforcement through cooperative agreement or contracts during peak visitation periods for maintaining public safety. The Corps' authority for these law enforcement contracts (42 U.S.C \u00a71962d-5d) is limited to $10 million per year nationally. Current Corps authority does not allow the agency to authorize state or local authorities to enforce federal law or regulations at Corps projects.", "The legislative proposals from the 113 th Congress, if enacted, would have made no change to law enforcement authorities for the Corps. That is, no armed federal law enforcement authorities responsible for maintaining public safety and security would have been at Corps projects, a continuation of the status quo. Corps rangers would have remained unarmed; volunteers and those working as concessionaire contractors at Corps projects also would not have been allowed to carry firearms.

At Reclamation facilities (e.g., buildings, dams, electric power facilities, switchyards, recreation facilities, fish and wildlife facilities), firearms are prohibited. At Reclamation lands and waterbodies, firearms are allowed to the extent provided by applicable federal, state, and local law. Therefore, the possession of loaded firearms by private individuals is allowed at most of a Reclamation project's land and water footprint, whereas current Corps regulations allow such possession only in areas designated for hunting and shooting at Corps projects.", "Reclamation regulations (43 C.F.R. \u00a7423.30(b)) restrict discharge of a weapon unless for hunting or at an authorized shooting or archery range; discharge must also be in compliance with federal, state, and local law. As previously noted, Corps regulations do not explicitly address the discharge of weapons. Reclamation regulations (43 C.F.R. \u00a7423.32) permit hunting on Reclamation lands and waterbodies in accordance with federal, state, and local laws unless the area has been closed for public use or has been designated as a special-use area. In November 2001, in Section 1 of the Reclamation Recreation Management Act of 1992 ( P.L. 107-69 ), Congress provided criminal penalties for violation of regulations to maintain law and order and protect persons and property at Reclamation projects and lands. ", "Law enforcement at Reclamation projects can be provided by DOI armed law enforcement officers or by other law enforcement personnel through cooperative agreement or contract. Reclamation and DOI utilize a variety of personnel for security and public safety at Reclamation projects: federal special agents provided through DOI's law enforcement authority and uniformed guards acting as special policemen with law enforcement authority, an armed security response task force that does not have law enforcement authority, armed state and local law enforcement personnel, and personnel from private security companies for both armed and unarmed functions. The vast majority of criminal offenses occurring on Reclamation property, nonetheless, are handled by state police, sheriff's offices, or local law enforcement. Most law enforcement functions at Corps projects also are provided by state and local law enforcement authorities, but the Corps does not have the option of its own department's or agency's armed federal law enforcement personnel. At Reclamation projects (in some contrast to NPS and NWRS units, which have federal personnel with more law enforcement functions), Reclamation rangers function much like Corps rangers; both do not have significant law enforcement authority or carry firearms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Many Corps projects function as popular recreation sites in addition to providing navigation, flood damage reduction, hydropower, and other benefits. Current Corps regulations prohibit possession of loaded firearms by private individuals at Corps projects unless for hunting or at designated shooting ranges. The 113 th Congress considered legislation that would have eliminated the Secretary of the Army's ability to enforce or promulgate regulations restricting the possession of loaded firearms in areas of its projects that are open to the public, as long as an individual is lawfully permitted to possess a firearm and such possession is in compliance with state law. Possession of firearms, however, would have remained prohibited at a \"federal facility\" consistent with Title 18, Section 930, of the United States Code . That is, if the proposed language had been enacted, the Corps would have been prohibited from promulgating or enforcing restrictions on loaded firearms on roughly 4.4 million acres of Corps fee-owned lands that are open to the public but currently closed for hunting. For the roughly 4.4 million acres that are open to hunting or designated as shooting ranges, the proposed legislation, if enacted, apparently would have essentially lifted the restriction that possession of a loaded firearms be limited for use in hunting or for shooting at designated shooting ranges. That is, under the proposed legislation, consistent with state law and firearms restrictions in Title 18, Section 930, of the United States Code , loaded firearms would have been allowed at all Corps project areas open to the public."], "subsections": []}]}}
