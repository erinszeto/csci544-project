Published estimates of the scope and scale of sexual violence at IHEs vary considerably across studies and data sources. Efforts to improve these data are an ongoing focus of federal policy.", "Currently, there are two federal laws that address sexual violence on college campuses: the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, as amended (Clery Act), and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). These two statutes differ in significant respects, including in their purpose, coverage, enforcement, and remedies.", "The Clery Act requires all public and private IHEs that participate in the student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), to track crimes in and around their campuses and to report these data to their campus community and to ED. The Clery Act also requires IHEs to publish information about certain campus safety policies, including policies related to reports of sexual violence. Under the Clery Act, such policies must address campus disciplinary proceedings, crime reporting, victim support, and related topics. ED's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) oversees compliance with Title IV, including the requirements related to the Clery Act. In this role, FSA conducts program reviews of IHEs' compliance with student aid and Clery provisions, and may levy fines against IHEs that are in violation.", "In contrast, Title IX is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex under any education program or activity that receives federal funding. Under Title IX, sexual harassment, which includes sexual violence, is a form of unlawful sex discrimination. Unlike the Clery Act, whose coverage is limited to IHEs that receive student financial aid funds under the HEA, Title IX is applicable to education programs or activities that receive any type of federal funding, including any public or private elementary, secondary, and postsecondary school that receives such funds. Although each federal agency enforces Title IX compliance among its own recipients, ED, which administers the vast majority of federal education programs, is the primary agency conducting administrative enforcement of Title IX. Such enforcement by ED's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) may occur as part of a routine compliance audit or in response to a complaint filed by an individual.", "Federal policymakers have been actively involved in seeking ways to improve how IHEs respond to, investigate, and adjudicate incidents of campus sexual violence.

", "Notably, suspension or termination of federal funding is currently the only enforcement mechanism available to ED or other federal agencies when an agency cannot reach a voluntary resolution agreement with an institution that it has found to be noncompliant. This penalty has rarely, if ever, occurred in the Title IX context, but the threat of losing federal funding appears to motivate institutions to reach compliance agreements with ED.", "A suspension or termination of funding must be limited to the particular program, or part thereof, that is out of compliance with Title IX. A school may challenge such an enforcement action by seeking a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in ED's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). ALJ decisions may be appealed to OHA's Civil Rights Reviewing Authority and, in some cases, to the Secretary. A school may also opt to challenge the agency's action in federal court, but may do so only after exhausting its administrative appeals. ", "In addition to ED, the Civil Rights Division (CRD) at DOJ plays a significant role in enforcing laws that prohibit sex discrimination in education. CRD has two primary duties: coordination and litigation. With respect to coordination, the division's Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is responsible for coordinating the efforts of federal agencies to consistently and effectively implement and enforce Title IX. In this role, the section \"operates a comprehensive, government-wide program of technical and legal assistance, training, interagency coordination, and regulatory, policy, and program review.\"", "With respect to litigation, CRD is responsible for representing federal agencies such as ED when an agency has referred a determination of Title IX noncompliance to DOJ for judicial enforcement of any sanctions an agency has imposed. Thus, the division's Educational Opportunities Section is authorized to sue in federal court on behalf of an agency for violations of the statute. Such suits may seek injunctive relief, specific performance, or other remedies. The Educational Opportunities Section is also responsible for enforcing Title IV of the Civil Rights Act (P.L. 88-352), which prohibits public schools and colleges from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion. ", "Despite DOJ's role in Title IX enforcement, ED remains the lead agency that administers Title IX with respect to traditional educational institutions. As a result, this report primarily focuses on ED's part in combating campus sexual violence. ED pursues this goal by performing periodic compliance reviews of grant recipients, as well as by conducting investigations in response to Title IX complaints filed with the agency.

Specifically, the guidance notes that a single instance of sexual violence may be sufficiently severe such that it creates a hostile environment that limits or denies a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the educational program. Any school that knows or should have known about possible harassment must \"take immediate action to eliminate the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects.\"", "The 2011 and 2014 guidance extensively detail the types of action a school is expected to take in order to comply with Title IX.

Other proactive steps may include providing preventive education programs and materials, as well as victim services.", "ED's guidance provides additional information regarding the role of the Title IX coordinator. According to ED, the coordinator's responsibilities \"include overseeing the school's response to Title IX reports and complaints and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems revealed by such reports and complaints.\" Coordinators should be adequately trained, available to meet with students, and informed about relevant complaints. A school may assign its Title IX coordinator or coordinators with additional responsibilities, such as providing training to students, faculty, and staff; conducting Title IX investigations; determining sanctions and remedies; and coordinating with victims' service providers. Finally, the guidance stipulates that coordinators should not have other job duties, such as general counsel or athletics director, that may create a conflict of interest. In 2015, ED issued a guidance package that provides additional detail regarding requirements related to Title IX coordinators.", "With respect to grievance procedures, the guidance sets forth several parameters. For example, grievance procedures should specify investigative measures and identify the time frames for various stages of the proceedings, as well as provide both parties with an opportunity to present witnesses and other relevant evidence. Moreover, although such procedures may include informal mechanisms such as mediation, \"it is improper for a student who complains of harassment to be required to work out the problem directly with the alleged perpetrator, and certainly not without appropriate involvement by the school.\" In addition, the guidance requires that all individuals responsible for implementing a school's grievance procedures, including Title IX coordinators, investigators, and adjudicators, must have training or experience regarding how to apply the school's grievance procedures and handle sexual violence complaints. The guidance provides a more detailed list of the elements that should be included in a school's Title IX grievance procedures.", "The guidance also describes who is a responsible employee that is required to report allegations of sexual violence. Responsible employees are defined to include any employee who: \"has been given the duty of reporting incidents of sexual violence or any other misconduct by students to the Title IX coordinator or other appropriate school designee, or whom a student could reasonably believe has this authority or duty.\" Such employees must report incidents to the Title IX coordinator and/or other designated school officials, although school counselors are exempt from these reporting requirements, and schools may designate additional individuals, such as volunteers in sexual assault centers, as confidential sources. Schools must also provide training to all responsible employees regarding how to report, respond to, and prevent sexual violence. Detailed training requirements are set forth in the guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responsive Measures", "paragraphs": ["As part of their Title IX responsibility to respond to complaints regarding sexual violence, schools must conduct investigations and take steps to resolve complaints. According to ED,", "the term \"investigation\" refers to the process the school uses to resolve sexual violence complaints. This includes the fact-finding investigation and any hearing and decision-making process the school uses to determine: (1) whether or not the conduct occurred; and (2) if the conduct occurred, what actions the school will take to end the sexual violence, eliminate the hostile environment, and prevent its recurrence, which may include imposing sanctions on the perpetrator and providing remedies for the complainant and broader student population.", "Under Title IX, an investigation must be \"prompt, thorough, and impartial.\" A school's obligation to investigate sexual violence complaints applies regardless of whether or not the alleged incident occurred on school campus or off-campus. In addition, a school must conduct an investigation into allegations of sexual violence regardless of whether local law enforcement launches its own criminal investigation. The guidance specifies that schools should notify complainants of their right to file a criminal complaint, but should not wait for a criminal investigation to conclude before starting their own Title IX investigation. It is important to note that the victim of the sexual violence is generally the one who decides whether to file a complaint with the police, the educational institution, or both, although some states may have mandatory reporting laws that require school officials to notify law enforcement regarding certain types of crimes.", "The guidance also sets forth several requirements related to confidentiality. In general, if a complainant wishes to preserve his or her confidentiality or to avoid the formal complaint resolution process, the school must take reasonable steps to accommodate the student's request. Nevertheless, because an educational institution that knows or reasonably should be aware of sexual harassment is obligated to take steps to prevent discrimination from reoccurring, there may be cases in which a school is unable to comply with the complainant's request. The guidance discusses the factors that a school should consider when determining whether to fulfill a student's request for privacy. It is also important to note that a complainant's confidentiality request may conflict with an alleged perpetrator's right to access his or her educational records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA, P.L. 93-380 ). The intersection between FERPA and Title IX is discussed in a separate section below.", "The Disciplinary Hearing", "Once the initial fact-finding stage of the investigation is complete, an educational institution will generally hold a hearing to determine whether a Title IX violation has occurred and, if so, what sanctions should be imposed on the perpetrator. Often, such hearings are conducted as part of the regular disciplinary process that most schools have established to evaluate violations of an institution's code of conduct. An institution may use its traditional disciplinary process to resolve Title IX complaints as long as its grievance procedures conform to the requirements of Title IX. ", "One such Title IX requirement pertains to the standard of proof that should apply when resolving Title IX complaints. In the past, some schools have used a \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard, which requires a finding that it is highly probable or reasonably certain that a violation occurred, while other schools relied on the less stringent \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard that requires a school to determine whether it is more likely than not that sexual harassment occurred. The preponderance of the evidence standard is the standard of proof that generally applies in civil rights cases, as well as many other types of civil litigation and administrative adjudication. As a result, the guidance specifies that schools must adopt this standard when resolving Title IX complaints. As discussed in more detail below, adoption of this preponderance of the evidence standard has proved controversial.", "Final Stages of Investigation", "After the disciplinary process has concluded, a school must provide both parties with written notice of the outcome, consistent with FERPA requirements relating to the privacy of educational records. OCR has indicated that a typical investigation should take approximately 60 days to complete, although the agency has acknowledged that this time frame may vary depending on the circumstances involved.", "If a school determines that a hostile environment exists, it must take corrective action \"to eliminate the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects.\" In addition to disciplinary action taken against the perpetrator, corrective action may include remedies for the complainant. Such remedies may include interim measures that may be taken before the complaint is resolved, such as accommodations regarding living arrangements, class schedules, course work, or extracurricular activities. Schools should also notify complainants of their rights under Title IX and refer them to available counseling resources. The guidance provides a detailed list of the types of remedies an educational institution may wish to consider.", "If OCR finds that an educational institution has not complied with its Title IX obligation to prevent and respond to sexual violence, then the agency has broad discretion to negotiate a wide range of remedies and corrective action with that institution. If OCR and the institution cannot reach a voluntary agreement, then OCR may seek to suspend or terminate federal funding. The guidance provides a series of examples of the various types of remedies that OCR might seek if it finds that an institution is not in compliance with Title IX's prohibition against sexual harassment.", "Educational institutions should also be aware that Title IX prohibits retaliation. Thus, a school violates Title IX if it retaliates against a student, parent, teacher, or other employee who complains about sexual violence or participates in an investigation related to such a complaint. According to ED, an educational institution must take steps to prevent retaliation against a complainant by an alleged perpetrator.", "Finally, it is important to note that ED has clarified that Title IX's prohibition against sex discrimination encompasses gender stereotyping that results in discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Thus, sexual violence against individuals who fail to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity is subject to the requirements outlined in ED's guidance.

An alleged perpetrator, however, has the right to review the complaint if it is an educational record within the meaning of FERPA. Under such circumstances, an educational institution must provide the alleged harasser with access to the information contained in the complaint but should, to the extent possible, avoid revealing the complainant's name or other identifying information.", "FERPA also prohibits educational institutions that receive federal funds from releasing students' educational records without prior written consent. On its face, this prohibition would appear to prevent a school from disclosing the results of a disciplinary hearing that are part of a perpetrator's educational record. However, FERPA contains a number of exceptions. For example, a postsecondary institution may disclose to an alleged victim of any crime of violence or nonforcible sex offense the final results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the institution against the alleged perpetrator. Likewise, an institution may disclose to anyone the final results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted against a student who is an alleged perpetrator of any crime of violence or nonforcible sex offense if the institution determines as a result of the proceeding that the student committed a violation of the institution's rules or policies with respect to such crime or offense.

In addition, the lack of consistency in the way crimes are reported across IHEs has raised questions about the usefulness of these statistics in assessing the extent of sexual violence and how it is being handled across IHEs. The American Association of University Professors has stated that \"[w]hile a small number of institutions have put in place rigorous procedures for obtaining, collating, tracking, processing, and reporting Clery statistics, a standardized model for the overall process does not yet exist.\" IHEs that are the most rigorous in monitoring and collecting statistics on campus sexual violence may report more complaints of sexual violence than IHEs that are not as diligent in monitoring and reporting such complaints. Thus, in press accounts and in their ASRs, IHEs that may be in compliance with Clery reporting requirements may appear to have a more serious sexual violence problem than IHEs that may not be in compliance (and may actually have a more serious sexual violence problem). These potential discrepancies are important for IHEs because press accounts and ASR data on campus sexual violence may be viewed by current and prospective students and their families to evaluate the safety of IHEs.

This requirement has proved controversial. Indeed, some critics contend that use of this standard is unfair, arguing that alleged perpetrators who are subject to this standard are being deprived of their due process rights. From a legal perspective, however, it is well established that different rights and corresponding procedures attach in the administrative versus judicial setting, and that it is common for an individual to be subject to both criminal and civil proceedings based on the same incident. In general, the standard of proof is higher in the criminal context because more is at stake, while a lesser standard of proof is permitted in civil proceedings because the potential loss of rights is less significant.", "The concept of procedural due process has its origins in the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits government action that would deprive any person of \"life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The premise behind due process is that the government, for reasons of basic fairness, must provide certain procedures before taking any of these important interests away from protected parties. The Supreme Court has stated that due process \"is a flexible concept that varies with the particular situation,\" and has made it clear that \"something less than a full evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.\" Ultimately, the degree of procedural protection that is due depends on the nature of the individual and governmental interests at stake and varies significantly in the civil and criminal context.", "It is also important to note that the due process clause applies only to governmental actors, not private entities. Thus, public IHEs must provide due process protections to students who are subject to disciplinary proceedings, but private IHEs are not subject to the same requirement. Although it is possible that state statutory or common law due process protections may apply in the private setting, the relationship between private IHEs and their students is generally governed by contract law. Under this arrangement, a student who accepts an offer of admission to an IHE agrees to abide by a school's rules and policies regarding attendance. Such rules and policies, which are generally established at the institution's discretion, may or may not include certain procedural protections for students who violate the school's code of conduct. Thus, a private IHE is under no obligation to provide due process rights when sanctioning students unless it has specified that it will do so. However, ED's Title IX guidance does clarify that if an educational institution provides procedural rights to one party, such as the right to present witnesses or have an attorney present, then these rights must be available to both parties.

According to this critique, because an educational institution may simply enter into a new compliance agreement with ED if it fails to comply with an existing resolution, these informal agreements are ineffective deterrents that effectively allow schools to violate Title IX without incurring significant penalties.

Specifically, Senator Lankford alleged in a letter to ED that, among other things, the agency's sexual violence guidance does not merely offer an interpretation of Title IX, but rather functions as a legally binding regulation would and therefore should have been promulgated in accordance with the procedures established under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). ", "Federal agencies are generally responsible for implementing, interpreting, and enforcing the statutes that they administer. Thus, ED has the initial duty to determine how to apply the statutes under its jurisdiction. Typically, an agency communicates its interpretation regarding a statute's implementation via regulations and informal agency guidance. Although regulations are legally binding, informal guidance is not. Rather, such guidance aids agencies in establishing consistent policies and enforcement priorities, as well as in informing affected parties of the agency's current thinking about how such parties can comply with the law in question. Although agency use of guidance documents is common practice, some critics argue that agencies use guidance documents to effectively change the law or expand the scope of their delegated regulatory authority.", "In general, the APA imposes various procedural requirements when agencies issue rules, subject to several exceptions. While \"legislative\" or \"substantive\" rules that bind the public or an agency must comply with these procedural requirements, \"interpretive rules\" and \"general statements of policy,\" often known as guidance documents or \"nonlegislative rules\" are exempt from these strictures. If, however, there is disagreement with an agency's interpretation or enforcement of the statute, an affected party can challenge the agency's action in court.", "In the event of a legal challenge, the amount of deference that an agency interpretation of its own statute will receive from a reviewing court \"has been understood to vary with the circumstances.\" Although courts will generally defer to an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute, such deference is warranted only in instances where that interpretation was formally established via notice-and-comment rulemaking, agency adjudications, or other agency actions that have the force of law. Where an interpretation is presented informally, a lesser form of deference will generally apply. Indeed, in Skidmore v. Swift & Co ., the Supreme Court held that the deference granted to an agency's informal interpretation \"will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" ", "Absent a definitive judicial ruling on the subject, it is currently unclear whether ED's sexual violence guidance constitutes informal agency guidance that would be exempt from the APA's procedural requirements and subject to a lesser degree of judicial deference in the event of a legal challenge. However, in response to Senator Lankford's letter, OCR asserted that, although ED \"does not view such guidance to have the force and effect of law,\" the guidance reflects the agency's interpretation of the Title IX statute and regulations. Indeed, under Title IX, federal funding recipients have a duty to prevent and remedy all aspects of sex discrimination. Many of the detailed requirements in ED's guidance appear to have evolved from this basic obligation. It is also important to note that in many instances, ED's guidance appears to be informed by case law. In other words, rather than being derived from statute, many of the Title IX requirements contained in ED's sexual violence guidance are derived instead from judicial decisions involving challenges under these laws, and federal funding recipients who wish to avoid liability under these statutes would be well advised to take these rulings into account. Thus, ED typically incorporates this case law into its guidance documents at least in part to inform affected parties about these non-statutory legal obligations. Ultimately, ED's guidance, which reminds federal funding recipients of their obligation to comply with these civil rights statutes, generally appears to be based on current law, but a final decision regarding any enforcement action that ED might take pursuant to this guidance\u2014or whether the guidance itself complies with the APA\u2014would be up to a reviewing court.", "Appendix A.
