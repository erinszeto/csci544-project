For some in the United States, the term \"warfare\" implies armed conflict or other military activity; yet political warfare is commonly understood as the use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will. According to Cold War diplomat George Kennan's definition, political warfare is the", "employment of all the means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives. Such operations are both overt and covert. They range from such overt actions as political alliances, economic measures, and \"white\" propaganda to such covert operations as clandestine support of 'friendly' foreign elements, \"black\" psychological warfare and even encouragement of underground resistance in hostile states.", "In this sense, IW is a form of political warfare, where targets include a nation state's government, military, private sector, and general population.", "Taking place below the level of armed conflict, IW is the range of military and government operations to protect and exploit the information environment. It consists of both offensive and defensive operations: the protection and assurance of one's own information (information security), and information operations to advance interests. It is conducted not only in crisis, conflict, and warfare in the operational sense, but is ongoing in peacetime as well. Whether attacking government agencies, political leadership, or news media in order to influence public opinion or to compel decisionmakers to take certain actions, ultimately the target of information warfare activities is human cognition. For this reason, information warfare is sometimes referred to as persuasion or influence operations, or even psychological operations. ", "Yet information warfare may not always involve compelling or coercing decisions; rather, it may be part of a \"divide and conquer\" strategy targeting civil society, sowing confusion in a target population in order to create decision paralysis. Decisionmakers in this case are constantly bombarded by contradictory reports, with no readily available means of discerning the truth. In the absence of reliable information and facing heightened opposition from factions on both sides of an issue, decisionmakers may be unable to act. This is the informational equivalent of what Carl von Clausewitz coined as the \"fog and friction\" of war. The fog of war refers to the uncertainty in situational awareness experienced by participants in military operations, while friction is a by-product of this fog. ", "IW is a whole-of-society endeavor, in which civilians may be knowingly or unknowingly functioning as proxies on behalf of a government. For example, the Russian concept of IW describes preemptive operations to achieve political goals and to control the information space, deploying all elements of society to include patriotic hacker groups and private citizens. The Chinese theory of IW is integrated into \"The People's War\" concept and involves the use of information technologies by hundreds of millions of people in order to influence an adversary's policymakers, and to gain an advantage against an asymmetric threat. Authoritarian regimes and their control over information infrastructure facilitate the use of a wide range of actors and techniques. These regimes may compel ordinary citizens to act as agents of information warfare with financial rewards, by appealing to a sense of patriotism, or through threats and coercion.", "Information warfare may be a prelude to an armed conflict, a preparation of the battlefield preceding the deployment of forces. Information operations set the conditions in theater to gain support of locals, \"winning the hearts and minds\" to increase the odds of a successful campaign. Alternatively, IW may be an end in and of itself, the process through which nations gain competitive advantages over one another without the use of force.", "There may be many terms that describe the use of information as a weapon.

Strategy can be defined as the process of planning to achieve objective and goals in the national interest. For the military, this typically involves identification of the ends, ways, and means of achievement of stated goals. The Department of Defense (DOD) Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms defines the strategic level of warfare as the level at which a nation, often as a member of a group of nations, determines national or multinational (alliance or coalition) strategic security objectives and guidance, then develops and uses national resources to achieve those objectives. Information warfare takes place at the strategic level, while information operations (IO) involve using various information-related capabilities to implement the strategy. The operational level is that at which campaigns and major operations are planned, conducted, and sustained to achieve strategic objectives within theaters or other operational areas. Operations link these strategic objectives with specific tactics, techniques, and procedures in order to achieve them. The tactical level of warfare concerns the ordered arrangement and maneuver of combat elements in relation to each other and the enemy to achieve combat objectives. IO happens at the operational level, linking information-related capabilities and tactics to a broader strategy.

At the strategic level, PSYOPs are the delivery of information to influence foreign target audiences in support of U.S. goals and objectives. PSYOPs at the operational level are conducted in support of the combatant commander's mission accomplishment, either independently or as an integral part of other operations. Previous definitions of psychological operations resemble what some term as information operations or information warfare. In later doctrine, PSYOP was changed to military information support operations (MISO).

JP3-13 defines information-related capability as a tool, technique, or activity employed within a dimension of the information environment that can be used to create effects and operationally desirable conditions. Strategic communication, public diplomacy, public and civil affairs, and cyberspace operations may be considered supporting capabilities. They may take place outside of cyberspace, such as dropping pamphlets, cultural exchanges, civil affairs, and foreign aid programs to gain favor with a target population.", "Under the current definition, a primary component of IO is MISO (formerly PSYOP), which are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence the emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.

It can be misleading but true, and may include stolen information.

Cyberspace operations can be used to achieve strategic information warfare goals; an offensive cyberattack, for example, may be used to create psychological effects in a target population. A foreign country may use cyberattacks to influence decisionmaking and change behaviors, for example the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)-attributed cyberattacks on Sony in late 2014.

Its actions were particularly influential during South Korea's period of military dictatorship, which ended in 1988, but they have continued since then in an attempt to influence South Korean politics as well as the North Korea policies of outside powers, including the United States. More recently, North Korea has been complementing these traditional information warfare activities with an increasingly capable cyber program.", "In 2014, the run-up to the scheduled Christmas Day release of The Interview , a film depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea's Foreign Ministry called the film \"the most blatant act of terrorism and war\" and threatened a \"merciless countermeasure.\" On November 24, 2014, Sony experienced a cyberattack that disabled its information technology systems, destroyed data, damaged computer workstations, and released internal emails. North Korea denied involvement in the attack but praised hackers, called the \"Guardians of Peace,\" for having done a \"righteous deed.\" Emails followed, threatening \"9/11-style\" terrorist attacks on theaters scheduled to show the film, leading some theaters to cancel screenings and for Sony to cancel its widespread release, although U.S. officials claimed to have \"no specific, credible intelligence of such a plot.\" The FBI attributed the attacks to the North Korean government.", "Independent of the level of economic and physical damage that Sony suffered as a result of these cyberattacks, one could argue that the incident represents a successful use of IW to achieve political ends. Some questioned whether North Korea had developed a sophisticated cyberattack force, using these attacks to demonstrate its increasing ability to pursue political goals and thereby raise its profile on the international stage. Others pointed to the common use of proxies or mercenary hackers to conduct relatively simple cyber operations as a form of political protest or \"cyber riot.\" Whether or not the North Korean government conducted the attacks or outsourced to a proxy organization, the cyberattacks, in concert with threats of physical destruction, affected the decisionmaking process of a private company, exploited the human element of fear in a civilian population, imposed extra-territorial censorship, and triggered a response from the U.S. government. ", "North Korea appears to be engaging in increasingly hostile cyber activities, including theft, website vandalism, and denial of service attacks. Some cybersecurity analysts, however, question whether the country has developed the technical capability to conduct large-scale destructive attacks on critical infrastructure. Some observers suggest that, because there is little visibility into North Korea's activities, the possible threats from North Korean cyber activities are often inflated. An assessment released by the Korea Economic Institute found that the international community's \"fears of the unknown increase the risk of threat inflation dramatically.\" These analysts contend that while North Korea may have the capability to undertake global cyber nuisance or theft-motivated activities, the nation lacks the ability to undertake operations that are \"complex or as devastating as the Stuxnet attack, a computer virus that disrupted Iran's nuclear program.\" The ambiguous threat of North Korean cyberattack ability, or fear of the unknown, creates a psychological effect that could perhaps deter some countries from conducting cyberspace operations on North Korean networks.", "Outside of cyberspace, North Korean use of the information environment include its presence at the 2018 Winter Olympics, propaganda photos, videos, and claims in the media that place North Korea and its leadership in a favorable light, contrasting it with other countries such as South Korea and the United States. Some argue that U.S. journalists' coverage of North Korea and the Olympics suggest that the event was a propaganda win for North Korean leaders. Likewise, recent propaganda posters and stamps for the 70 th anniversary of the founding of North Korea declare \"Victory in all fronts.\" The North Korean government has also tried to use information campaigns to set the agendas of international negotiations such as inter-Korean dialogue and nuclear talks with the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Iran", "paragraphs": ["Similar to China, Iranian information operations target and discredit dissenters and adversaries, both domestic and foreign\u2014to include journalists, online media activists, and human rights defenders\u2014and limiting or prohibiting attempts by protesters to coordinate and organize.

In cyberspace, the Iranian government shut down social media platforms and disrupted internet access during nationwide protests in January 2018. Iran may also be seeking a capability to disable or destroy critical infrastructure through cyber means. ", "Beginning in 2011, a wave of cyberattacks on U.S. financial institutions disrupted banking operation and denied some customers from online access to their accounts. Roughly four dozen banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Capital One and PNC Bank, were besieged by crippling denial of service attacks that lasted for over a year. Some have speculated that these were conducted in retaliation for the Stuxnet worm, which disabled the computer systems that controlled nuclear centrifuges at Iran's main nuclear enrichment plant in 2010. ", "A cyber intrusion into the computer program controlling the sluice gate to the Bowman Dam in Rye, NY, appeared be an effort to take over the computer controls to the dam itself. Any attempt to do so failed, however, because the dam was under repair and offline.", "According to an indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice, the perpetrators for both the bank and dam incidents are associated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a unit of which is the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA), which runs military cyber operations. Iran openly encourages hacker groups to conduct offensive cyberspace operations. Hackers deface websites, steal and leak content, and may be involved in cyber espionage operations. The Iranian Cyber Army (ICA) has been implicated in several website attacks, including one against Twitter in 2009 that proclaimed support for Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Other attack targets were the Voice of America in 2011 after the United States rhetorically supported Iran's opposition Green movement, and regime opposition websites in 2013 just before the presidential election.

A similar question is whether a cyberattack that falls below the threshold of damage and destruction resulting from a kinetic event could be considered an armed attack or use of force under international law, or whether data breaches of military networks or theft of sensitive defense information constitute an act of aggression rather than espionage. ", "Other questions Congress may consider include whether the United States has a strategy in place to match the robust IW strategies of its competitors, and whether the U.S. government has institutions, organization, and programs to wage and win an information war or to deter foreign information operations. ", "With respect to cyberspace and information operations, the structures supporting each set of capabilities are currently bifurcated within the Department of Defense. In addition, cyberspace operations tend to focus on computer network attacks rather than the cognitive and strategic effects of information. As such, Congress may explore whether current organizational and doctrinal constructs support the full integration of these capabilities to maximize their effects, and whether ongoing conceptual confusion has inhibited DOD's ability to respond to IW challenges. ", "When responding to foreign IW activities on the United States, Congress may consider whether authorities are in place for DOD to conduct counter-IO, and if other interagency entities are authorized and resourced to conduct coordinated efforts. Another consideration may be the efficacy of IW as a military function or a whole-of-government responsibility."], "subsections": []}]}}
