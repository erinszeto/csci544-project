However, Congress, based upon its determination that allowing debtors to freely discharge student loans in bankruptcy could threaten the student loan program, has limited the circumstances in which a debtor may discharge a student loan. Under current law, a debtor may not discharge a student loan unless repaying the student loan would impose an \"undue hardship\" upon the debtor and his dependents.", "The Bankruptcy Code does not define \"undue hardship,\" and the legislative history of Section 523 does not precisely specify how courts should determine whether a debtor qualifies for an undue hardship discharge.

The debtor must prove each of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence. This standard is commonly called the \"Brunner\" test, after the case in which the standard originated.

Indeed, each factor has resulted in various subsidiary splits in the courts with respect to a host of issues.", "Whereas the vast majority of courts apply the Brunner test to determine whether excepting a student loan from discharge would impose an undue hardship upon the debtor, two courts have explicitly declined to adopt the Brunner standard. Instead, these courts apply an alternative standard known as \"the totality-of-the-circumstances test,\" weighing numerous, nonexclusive factors when considering whether student loan debt should be discharged.", "In response to this split of authority, some Members of Congress and commentators have advanced numerous proposals to alter the way that student loans are treated in bankruptcy.

Like the current version of Section 523(a)(8), the 1978 version rendered student loans presumptively nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Section 523(a)(8)'s sponsors offered several policy justifications discussed in the sections that follow for making student loans presumptively nondischargeable in bankruptcy.", "First, several Members cited the country's interest in \"keep[ing] our student loan programs intact\" as a justification for making student loans presumptively nondischargeable. When a debtor defaults on a federal student loan, the taxpayers are the ones who must generally foot the bill. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 therefore reflected the view that allowing debtors to easily discharge student loans would adversely impact the public fisc and thereby prevent future students from obtaining federal student loans of their own. Section 523(a)(8)'s supporters in Congress therefore argued that, \"if the student loan program is to remain viable,\" it was necessary to make student loans presumptively nondischargeable so that, in the words of one Member, \"we insure our youngsters in the future that loan money will be available to them as it was to past generations.\"", "Second, Section 523(a)(8)'s sponsors sought to address the concern \"that student borrowers will abuse student loan programs by filing bankruptcy\" immediately \"after graduation, getting a discharge, and then enjoying a lifetime of income that education provides, but without the expense of paying back the loans.\" \"When a student borrower graduates, the accumulated student debt almost always dwarfs the student's tangible assets\" that could be distributed to creditors in bankruptcy. However, the debtor \"will presumably use her loan-funded education to substantially increase her income in the near future.\" Put another way, although a recent graduate will likely be unable to immediately repay his student loans right after completing his degree, he will hopefully reap economic benefits from his education that will allow him to repay the debt over the long term. If, however, a student could freely discharge her loans immediately after graduation, a recent graduate could thereby obtain \"debt relief at the point in time when her realizable assets and present income are at their lowest and her debt and future income are at their highest.\" At least one of the Members who supported Section 523(a)(8) therefore believed that declaring bankruptcy immediately after graduation\u2014and thereby \"making the taxpayers pick up the tab\" for the debtor's student loans\u2014would be \"tantamount to fraud.\" Congress therefore intended Section 523(a)(8) to \"prevent[] debtors from easily discharging their debts at the expense of the taxpayers who made possible their education.\"", "Third, several Members who supported Section 523(a)(8) also emphasized that, in contrast to many other forms of consumer debt, a creditor cannot \"repossess\" what the debtor used the loan to obtain if the debtor defaults. Whereas a debt collector may repossess and resell a house if a homeowner fails to pay his mortgage, a creditor cannot remove a college education from a graduate's brain, nor can an auctioneer sell a defaulting debtor's degree on the open market.

Some courts have categorically held that \"tithing may not be done at the expense of student loan creditors.\" These courts reason that \"if Congress intended to allow tithing . . . when determining undue hardship under \u00a7\u00a0523(a)(8) . . .

Other courts, by contrast, have held that \"a bankruptcy judge should not override a debtor's commitment to tithing\" when evaluating the reasonableness of a debtor's expenditures for the purposes of the Brunner test. The predominant approach, however, is to neither treat religious tithing as per se allowable nor per se prohibited, but instead to examine \"bona fide tithing or charitable contributions . . . under the same reasonableness standard as other reasonable and necessary expenses under a \u00a7 523(a)(8) undue hardship analysis.\"", "Courts have likewise \"split on whether cigarette expenses may be counted toward a minimal standard of living\" for the purposes of the Brunner test.

Most courts have held that \"401(k) contributions\" and other retirement contributions \"generally are not regarded as reasonably necessary for the support or maintenance of a debtor and thus may be considered as available income from which a debtor seeking a \u00a7 523(a)(8) undue hardship discharge could use to repay an educational loan.\" A few other courts have nonetheless held that expenses \"for retirement contributions\" are \"allowable within the context of an 'undue hardship' analysis under \u00a7 523(a)(8),\" at least \"where a debtor is fairly close to retirement, has not thus far saved anything for retirement, and is not likely to improve his or her earnings ability such that he or she could otherwise save for retirement.\"", "Nor have courts agreed regarding who may receive money that might otherwise go toward repaying the student loan. For instance, most courts have held that \"a debtor seeking to discharge her educational loans under \u00a7 523(a)(8) is . . . not permitted to support emancipated children or other independent family members at the expense of her creditors.\" These courts reason that it is \"unreasonable to expect creditors holding legitimate claims to remain unpaid to any extent while the Debtor is supporting any adult children\" or other nondependent adults \"in her home.\" A few other courts, however, have held that there is no \"hard and fast rule\" prohibiting a debtor seeking an undue hardship discharge from making \"voluntary payments on behalf of adult children.\" These courts reason that \"one's 'standard of living' may sometimes be affected more by the safety of one's children\u2014grown or not\u2014than by such things as the quality of one's residence.\" Importantly, however, the rule forbidding debtors from prioritizing their children over their creditors applies only to nondependent adult children; a debtor's obligation \"to support his minor children certainly must be considered\" as a necessary expense \"when determining the [debtor's] ability to repay his debts.\"", "Courts have likewise split on whether a debtor may argue that his monthly expenses prevent him from maintaining a minimal standard of living when the debtor expends a share of his income caring for a disabled parent.

Where no significant improvement is anticipated, however, such programs may be detrimental to the borrower's long-term financial health.", "\"Such potential for disastrous tax consequences\" may be \"particularly acute with respect to student loan debtors who are at or near retirement age when they commence a payment plan\" under the IDR program because \"such debtors have relatively little time left to substantially pay down their debt, which means that such debtors will likely have a substantial amount of debt that will then be discharged, with a consequentially large, nondischargeable tax obligation.\" Thus, if participation in an IDR plan would cause the debtor to incur a large tax bill at the end of the repayment period, many courts have concluded that the debtor's refusal or failure to participate in the plan does not evince a lack of good faith that would prevent the debtor from obtaining an undue hardship discharge.", "Other courts, however, dispute the premise that participating in an IDR plan will frequently result in a substantial taxable event. Many of these courts cite exceptions in the Internal Revenue Code that exclude canceled debt from taxable income if the debt is canceled while the debtor is insolvent, which may prevent some debtors from incurring a large tax liability at the end of the IDR repayment period. Some courts, emphasizing that the repayment period under an IDR plan may extend for decades, reason that it would be too \"speculative\" to consider any potential tax liability a debtor might incur once the student loan is forgiven at the conclusion of the repayment period. Some courts have also disputed the notion that a debtor who participates in an IDR plan is merely exchanging one nondischargeable debt for another, as the debtor \"would clearly not have to pay a tax equal to the entire amount cancelled\u2014at most, it would be the amount cancelled multiplied by her applicable tax rate.\" Courts that are skeptical that participation in an IDR plan will frequently result in an adverse taxable event tend to place greater weight on a debtor's failure or refusal to participate in the IDR plan when evaluating whether a debtor is entitled to an undue hardship discharge.", "Nor have courts agreed on whether a debtor may obtain an undue hardship discharge if his monthly payment under an IDR plan would be zero. In such a situation, an IDR plan would effectively relieve the debtor from the obligation to make any monthly student loan payments at all, thereby raising the question of whether the debtor can still plausibly claim that the debt nonetheless imposes an undue hardship. A few courts have held that \"excluding the student loans from discharge\" in such circumstances would not \"impose any hardship\" on the debtor \"since, by virtue of the\" IDR plan, the debtor is \"not required to make any payments at all.\" The prevailing approach, however, is that a $0.00 monthly payment under an IDR plan does not necessarily preclude the debtor from receiving a discharge. These courts emphasize that, because the discharge of a student loan at the end of the IDR plan's repayment period may result in a significant taxable event, and because a debtor who makes zero loan payments over a series of many years will necessarily \"be burdened by a huge and growing obligation that remains on her credit record,\" a student loan may impose an undue hardship even if the debtor is eligible to participate in a repayment option that would not require her to make monthly payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Discharge", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Department of Education regulations also allow a debtor, under certain circumstances, to administratively discharge some types of student loans outside of the bankruptcy process, such as when the debtor suffers from a total and permanent disability, or when the debtor's school closes before the debtor could complete the program of study that the loan financed.

Others, by contrast, believe it is currently too difficult for debtors experiencing severe financial stress to discharge their student loans in bankruptcy, and that Congress should therefore amend Section 523(a)(8) to make the standard for discharging a student loan less demanding.", "If Congress decides to make the undue hardship standard more lenient, it could do so in several ways. For instance, some have advocated eliminating the second prong of the Brunner test, so that a debtor seeking an undue hardship discharge would not need to prove that his inability to repay his loans will likely persist into the future. Alternatively, Congress could eliminate the requirement imposed by most courts that the debtor demonstrate a \"certainty of hopelessness\" and \"exceptional circumstances\" in order to discharge a student loan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Updating the Undue Hardship Standard in Response to Changed Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Congress may also consider whether the Brunner test\u2014which first originated in 1987 \u2014is now outdated or obsolete in light of legislative, economic, and regulatory developments that have occurred in the past thirty years. The Bankruptcy Code and the student loan market have undergone several significant changes since 1987, including", "the development of loan repayment and forgiveness programs, including IDR plans; Congress's aforementioned elimination of the temporal discharge option, pursuant to which a debtor could discharge certain student loans without demonstrating an undue hardship simply by waiting a sufficient number of years before filing bankruptcy; Congress's 2005 amendment to the Bankruptcy Code that made private education loans presumptively nondischargeable like their federal counterparts; the precipitous increase in the magnitude of debt carried by individual student loan borrowers, as well as total outstanding student loan debt in the United States overall; and the increase in aggregate borrowing limits for certain types of federal loans.", "Some courts and commentators have therefore advocated updating the undue hardship standard to better reflect the current state of the bankruptcy system and the student loan market. For instance, Congress could amend Section 523(a)(8) to explicitly specify how a debtor's eligibility for and participation in an IDR plan affect the debtor's ability to obtain bankruptcy relief."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Repealing Section 523(a)(8)", "paragraphs": ["Some commentators, instead of proposing modifications to Section 523(a)(8), have advocated repealing Section 523(a)(8) entirely and thereby making student loans freely dischargeable in bankruptcy. To that end, several Members of the 115 th Congress have introduced bills that would completely repeal Section 523(a)(8), including the Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy Act of 2017 and the Student Loan Borrowers' Bill of Rights Act of 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amending the Bankruptcy Code to Make Private Education Loans Freely Dischargeable", "paragraphs": ["Rather than making all student loans freely dischargeable in bankruptcy, Congress could also consider making private education loans freely dischargeable, while leaving federal student loans unaffected. As noted above, whereas discharging a federal student loan will shift the cost of the debtor's default to American taxpayers, taxpayers generally do not directly \"foot[] the bill for private loan defaults.\" Nevertheless, Congress amended Section 523(a)(8) in 2005 to make most private education loans presumptively nondischargeable like their federal counterparts.", "A number of commentators have therefore advocated reverting to the pre-2005 version of Section 523(a)(8) and thereby making private nonfederal student loans presumptively dischargeable without requiring the debtor to demonstrate an undue hardship. Several Members of the 115 th Congress have introduced bills that would make private education loans presumptively dischargeable in bankruptcy by repealing the 2005 amendments to Section 523(a)(8), including the Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act of 2017 and the Fairness for Struggling Students Act of 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reinstating the Temporal Discharge Option", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, the pre-1998 versions of Section 523(a)(8) allowed a debtor to discharge a student loan\u2014even in the absence of an undue hardship\u2014if the loan first became due a certain number of years before the debtor filed bankruptcy. Congress eliminated this \"temporal discharge\" option in 1998, with the consequence that demonstrating an undue hardship is presently the only way a debtor may discharge a student loan in bankruptcy.", "Some commentators have advocated reinstating the temporal discharge option to allow debtors to discharge older student loans without proving an undue hardship. These commentators argue that a student who waits several years after graduation to file for bankruptcy is less likely to be abusing the student loan program than a recent graduate who strategically declares bankruptcy immediately after obtaining his degree."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedural Changes to Obtaining an Undue Hardship Discharge", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, a debtor may generally not obtain a discharge of student loan debt without filing a separate full-fledged \"lawsuit within the umbrella of the bankruptcy case.\" Some commentators have described this procedure as \"an expensive venture, dependent as it is on elaborate factual proof that many debtors, particularly some of the worst off, have no hope of funding.\" Undue hardship litigation may be especially expensive in jurisdictions that require debtors to introduce corroborating medical evidence to demonstrate that they suffer from a medical condition that prevents them from paying their student loans.", "If Congress seeks to alter the procedures for obtaining an undue hardship discharge, it could consider \"shift[ing] the burden of bringing\" a suit to determine the dischargeability of a student loan \"from the debtor to the creditor.\" For instance, one scholar has suggested that Congress amend the Bankruptcy Code \"to treat student loan debt obligations as presumptively dischargeable in bankruptcy unless the creditor can show a lack of good faith on the part of the debtor with respect to the obligation.\" The burden would then rest upon the creditor, rather than the debtor, to initiate a lawsuit to declare a student loan debt nondischargeable. Shifting the burden in this way would not be unprecedented, as creditors generally bear the burden to prove that debts other than student loans are nondischargeable pursuant to other subsections of Section 523(a).", "Another potential procedural change that could reduce the financial burden of obtaining an undue hardship discharge would be to \"provide for the payment of a debtor's attorney's fees where a creditor unsuccessfully challenges dischargeability without substantial justification.\" According to proponents of this approach, this amendment could potentially (1) \"make representation by counsel more accessible to debtors in dischargeability actions by shifting the fee burden off debtors and onto the lender in actions where the challenge is not substantially justified\" and (2)\u00a0\"protect debtors from overreaching or overaggressive litigation tactics by student loan lenders.\" Authorizing fee-shifting in such circumstances would not be unprecedented either, as the Bankruptcy Code already provides for fee-shifting in some proceedings to determine the dischargeability of certain types of nonstudent loan debt.", "Some Members of the 115 th Congress have introduced legislation that would implement some of these proposed reforms. The Stopping Abusive Student Loan Collection Practices in Bankruptcy Act of 2017 would allow a debtor who receives an undue hardship discharge to recover court costs and attorney's fees from the creditor if the creditor's opposition to the discharge was not substantially justified. However, \"because the federal government . . . holds the vast majority of student loan debt,\" in many cases the creditor potentially subject to penalties under this bill would be the federal government."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
