When some conferees are appointed only for limited purposes, the two chambers have different ways of counting to determine whether the conferees' report carries sufficient signatures. The Senate asks whether the report is signed by a majority of all the conferees from each house, without regard to whether those conferees were appointed for all or for limited purposes. The House asks whether the report is signed by a majority of all the conferees from each house who were appointed to consider each of the matters that were submitted to the conference committee.", "This report will be updated if procedural changes warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General and Limited Purpose Conferees", "paragraphs": ["A valid conference report must carry the signatures of a majority of the conferees appointed by each chamber.

Under certain circumstances, however, questions may arise about whether a conference report carries sufficient signatures. These questions may arise especially in the House, and when one or both chambers appoint some of their conferees only for limited purposes. Usually, each house authorizes at least some of its conferees to negotiate on all the matters in disagreement between the two houses. Conferees with this blanket authority may be called \"general conferees.\" Either house or both, however, also may authorize some of its conferees to negotiate only on certain of the matters committed to conference. For example, one chamber might appoint certain of its conferees only to consider title II of the Senate substitute and the corresponding provisions of the House bill. Conferees with this form of authority may be called \"limited purpose conferees.\"", "Many limited purpose conferees are named as \"additional\" conferees, to negotiate along with the general conferees on the specified matters. Some, however, may be named as the \"sole\" conferees on the matters specified (in which case the authority of all other conferees also must be limited, so that they are not to negotiate on these matters). When limited purpose conferees are present, the matters before the conference may be thought of as divided into several portions, on each of which a different group of conferees is authorized to negotiate.

Eleven other Democrats from the committee were appointed in five overlapping groups, each consisting of four limited purpose conferees authorized to consider one or more titles of the House and Senate versions of the bill.

The way in which the separate panels of limited purpose Democratic conferees from the Committee on Banking and Financial Services were made up, however, meant that the total number of House Members appointed as conferees included 20 Republicans and 22 Democrats. Some Senate conferees objected that this configuration opened up the possibility of a conference report that could be held valid for consideration in the Senate, under the Senate standard, even though no House Republicans had signed it.", "Subsequently, the Speaker appointed four additional Republican members as limited purpose conferees, and correspondingly restricted the role of four Republicans initially appointed as general conferees. The four new conferees were authorized to negotiate only on certain narrowly specified provisions of the bill. The authority of the four initial appointees was restricted to the remaining portions of the bill, so that they became limited purpose conferees as well.
