According to the World Bank, the proportion of people livingbelow poverty declined from 60% in 1970 toan estimated 11% by mid-1997.

(6) In 1998, real GDP plunged by 13.2%; exports andimports fell by 8.6% and 34.5%, respectively, and living standards (per capita GDP on a purchasing power parity basis) droppedby nearly 13% (see Table 1 ).

The collapse of the Suharto regime helped usher in a new era of democratic political reforms inIndonesia, although the transition to democracy hasnot been easy and political instability remains a problem.

On the positive side, real GDPfrom 2000-2003 grew at a relatively healthy pace, averaging 4.0% (although it was half the average level of realGDP growth during the early 1990s). Inaddition, Indonesia's living standards (measured according to per capita GDP in purchasing power parity) finallyreached and exceeded pre-crisis levels in 2002($3,320 in 2002 versus $3,201 in 1997).

On the negative side, Indonesian imports in 2003 were 21.1% lower than pre-crisis levels,reflecting the effects of the sharp devaluation of therupiah. In addition, the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia dropped each year from 1997-2002. While the stock of FDI is estimated to haverisen slightly in 2003, it is $14.8 billion (or 20.3%) lower than what it was in 1997.

These include widespread government corruption and a weak legal system, (10) large public debt, extensive government controlof keyeconomic sectors (such as oil and gas), a high level of corporate non-performing loans, a weak banking system,uncertainties surrounding the centralgovernment's efforts to decentralize fiscal and political authority to local governments, and failure by thegovernment to provide adequate protection ofintellectual property rights (IPR). In addition, the existence and activities of several separatist movements andterrorist groups in Indonesia constitute majorthreats to political and economic stability.
