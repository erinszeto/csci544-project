When converted to a milk-equivalent basis, the maximum quantity of subsidized U.S. exports allowed under WTO limits is between 0.5% and 1.0% of total U.S. production.

On the other hand, long-standing U.S. opposition to export subsidies, especially to EU export subsidies, the opposition of trading partners like New Zealand and the Cairns Group, and the contingent agreement in the Doha Round to eliminate export subsidies could all be factors in a U.S. decision of whether to reactivate DEIP."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["U.S. dairy farmers are facing low returns in 2009 following a sharp decline in milk prices since late 2008 and continuation of relatively high feed costs that have adversely affected their businesses.

The funding level is lower in 2010 because USDA assumes that most of the allowable quantity of subsidized exports under the U.S. commitments to the World Trade Organization (WTO) would occur in FY2009.

Moreover, they have argued that reactivation of DEIP is a way for U.S. dairy products to compete against recently restarted European Union (EU) dairy export subsidies. Weak milk prices worldwide led the EU to restart its dairy export subsidies in early 2009. Both the EU and United States are allowed to subsidize dairy exports under WTO limits.

In the second half of 2008, these factors began to reverse, and economies worldwide started to slip. Demand fell for dairy products overseas and for domestic restaurant-based sales of dairy products. ", "The sudden drop-off in demand has created a mismatch with U.S. milk production, driving down U.S. farm prices for milk. The all-milk price received by farmers averaged $12.23 per hundredweight (cwt.) during January-March 2009, down 36% from the record quarterly average of $19.23 per cwt. set a year earlier. USDA forecasts the 2009 average annual farm price at roughly $12.10 per cwt., down 18% from the 10-year average of $14.83 per cwt. ", "The decline in milk prices has been especially painful for dairy producers because feed costs remain relatively high. For example, the farm price of alfalfa, a primary feedstuff for many dairy farms, averaged $143 per ton during January-March 2009, up 3% from a year earlier and up 31% from the 10-year annual average of $109 per ton.

The program indirectly supports the farm price of milk. ", "The second program, the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, was activated when declining milk prices in February 2009 triggered direct payments to producers. Payments have continued this spring because milk prices remain below the target price established in the 2008 farm bill.", "The Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) system is another major federal program, which operates regardless of the market situation. FMMOs mandate minimum prices that processors pay producers for milk. These minimums, however, are derived from dairy product prices established in the marketplace rather than by law.

During periods of large supplies, such as the late 1990s, when almost all U.S. milk powder exports were DEIP-assisted, the program essentially served as a de facto surplus removal program.

DEIP was active throughout the 1990s, peaking in 1993 with $162 million in bonuses ( Figure 1 ). The primary product receiving a subsidy was nonfat dry milk, reflecting its relative abundance. DEIP has not been used since FY2004 due to increased market strength and less perceived need to subsidize exports.", "On a volume basis, DEIP has helped move more than 1 million metric tons of dairy products. Annual volume peaked at nearly 250,000 tons in FY1995, with annual amounts mostly between 50,000 and 100,000 tons in subsequent years when the program was operational.

The awards, usually paid per metric ton of product exported, reimburse the exporter for the difference between the cost of purchasing the domestic product and the selling price in the importing country. Participating exporters must provide information on their company, including business structure and previous activity with federally administered programs. ", "Once an invitation for bids is issued, companies negotiate selling prices (and other terms) with buyers, often contingent on USDA's approval of a DEIP bonus. Prospective exporters then submit bids to USDA requesting a cash bonus that would allow the sale to take place. USDA reviews all bids and decides to accept or reject them based on the competitiveness of the bonus value. If a bid is accepted, the exporter receives the cash bonus once it provides evidence that the specified commodity was shipped to the target destination.

Maximum WTO allowable export subsidies for dairy products in the European Union (EU) dwarf those of the United States ( Table 1 ).

(The intervention price is the price at which public or private \"intervention agencies\" in each member state of the EU are obliged to accept butter and skim milk powder offered to them at the pre-determined intervention price.) The EU resumed intervention buying of butter and SMP in March 2009 and will continue buying until the end of August 2009.

Products eligible to receive refunds are butter and SMP and also whole milk powder and cheese. Dairy export refunds had been suspended since June 2007, a period when high prices prevailed on world dairy markets. Market conditions have reversed, according to the Commission, and EU exporters are unable to compete. The situation is made worse, the Commission statement said, because of the difficulty exporters face as a result of the global financial/credit crisis.

Exporters then make bids for specific volumes at specific refunds. Export licenses are awarded to exporters by a management committee. Traders who bid for refunds at or below the maximum level set by the committee are granted licenses. Those who bid higher than the maximum refund level are not awarded licenses.

As an indication of the positive impact on consumers, the price of Class I milk (used for fluid consumption) would decline $0.16 per cwt., on average, or about 1% relative to the baseline price. Most of the price impact occurs during the first year of the baseline period as the market absorbs larger supplies. ", "Similar results were implied in a study by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute in 2003. Eliminating DEIP during a 2003-2007 base period would have reduced the all-milk price by $0.14 per cwt., on average, or about 1% of the baseline price.

For example, in 2008, the United States enjoyed a 90% market share of Mexican imports of nonfat dry milk. DEIP was probably not the only factor and perhaps not the major factor in establishing the United States as the dominant foreign supplier of dairy products to the Mexican market.
