The authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.", "Though initially passed in response to the Korean War, the DPA is historically based on the War Powers Acts of World War II. Gradually, Congress has expanded the term national defense, as defined in the DPA. Based on this definition, the scope of DPA authorities now extends beyond shaping U.S. military preparedness and capabilities, as the authorities may also be used to enhance and support domestic preparedness, response, and recovery from natural hazards, terrorist attacks, and other national emergencies.", "Some current DPA authorities include, but are not limited to", "Title I: Priorities and Allocations, which allows the President to require persons (including businesses and corporations) to prioritize and accept contracts for materials and services as necessary to promote the national defense. Title III: Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply, which allows the President to incentivize the domestic industrial base to expand the production and supply of critical materials and goods. Authorized incentives include loans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities. Title VII: General Provisions, which includes key definitions for the DPA and several distinct authorities, including the authority to establish voluntary agreements with private industry; the authority to block proposed or pending foreign corporate mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that threaten national security; and the authority to employ persons of outstanding experience and ability and to establish a volunteer pool of industry executives who could be called to government service in the interest of the national defense.", "These are not the exclusive authorities of the DPA, but rather some of the most pertinent because of their historical or current use.", "The authorities of the DPA are generally afforded to the President in the statute. The President, in turn, has delegated these authorities to department and agency heads in Executive Order 13603, National Defense Resource Preparedness, issued in 2012.

A few authorities of the DPA, such as the Exon-Florio Amendment (which established government review of the acquisition of U.S. companies by foreigners) and anti-trust protections for certain voluntary industry agreements, have been made permanent by Congress. The DPA lies within the legislative jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.", "Congress may consider enhancing its oversight of executive branch activities related to the DPA in a number of ways. To enhance oversight, Congress could expand executive branch reporting requirements, track and enforce rulemaking requirements, review the activities of the Defense Production Act Committee, and broaden the committee oversight jurisdiction of the DPA in Congress. Congress may also consider amending the DPA, either by creating new authorities or repealing existing ones. In addition, Congress may consider amending the definitions of the DPA to expand or restrict the DPA's scope, amending the statute to supersede the President's delegation of DPA authorities made in E.O. 13603, or consider adjusting future appropriations to the DPA Fund in order to manage the scope of Title III projects initiated by the President."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (DPA), provides the President a broad set of authorities to ensure that domestic industry can meet national defense requirements.

", "The original DPA, enacted on September 8, 1950, granted broad authority to the President to control national economic policy. Containing seven separate titles, the DPA allowed the President, among other powers, to demand that manufacturers give priority to defense production, to requisition materials and property, to expand government and private defense production capacity, ration consumer goods, fix wage and price ceilings, force settlement of some labor disputes, control consumer credit and regulate real estate construction credit and loans, provide certain antitrust protections to industry, and establish a voluntary reserve of private sector executives who would be available for emergency federal employment.", "Four of the seven titles (Titles II, IV, V, and VI), those which related to requisitioning, rationing, wage and price fixing, labor disputes, and credit controls and regulation, terminated in 1953 when Congress allowed them to lapse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Committee Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["Though commonly associated with industrial production for the DOD, the DPA currently lies within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Prior to 1975, House rules did not permit simultaneous referral of bills to two or more committees. Precedents in both chambers did not allow divided or joint referrals, regardless of bill content. Instead, bills were assigned to committees based on the preponderance of their subject matter. Because much of the President's proposal dealt with economic policy, what became the Defense Production Act was assigned in 1950 to the House and Senate Committees on Banking and Currency (their successors are the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs). Although the parts of the act dealing with the requisitioning of materials, wages and prices, labor, and credit are no longer in force, these committees have retained jurisdiction.", "In addition to the standing committees of jurisdiction, the original statute created a Joint Committee on Defense Production. This committee was composed of selected members from the standing Committees on Banking and Currency of the Senate and House. This committee was intended to review the programs established by the DPA and advise the standing committees whenever they drafted legislation on the subject. Although the provision in the DPA establishing the Joint Committee on Defense Production was officially repealed in 1992, in effect, the Joint Committee has not existed since 1977, when salaries and expenses for the committee were last funded.

Most notably, with the passage and enactment of P.L. 85-95, Congress reauthorized Titles I, III, and VII while allowing Titles II, IV, V, and VI of the DPA to expire in 1953. The Defense Production Act, like the War Power Acts that preceded it, included a sunset provision that has required periodic reauthorization and offered the opportunity for amendment. Congress passed the DPA in 1950 and has thus far reauthorized it 53 times, including many short-term \"stop-gap\" extensions. From time to time, the DPA has expired without Congress passing a law reauthorizing and extending its termination date. In such circumstances, Congress has often ultimately passed a law retroactively setting the effective date for the law to the previous expiration date. Most notably, for example, the DPA expired on October 20, 1990, and was not reauthorized until August 17, 1991. However, upon passage of P.L. 102-99 , the effective date of the law was set to October 20, 1990. The DPA was most recently reauthorized by the 115 th Congress, in Section 1791 of the John S.

National defense is currently defined in the statute as", "programs for military and energy production or construction, military or critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation, homeland security, stockpiling, space, and any directly related activity. Such term includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to title VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a75195 et seq.] and critical infrastructure protection and restoration.", "Further reference can be made to Title VI of the Stafford Act for a definition of \"emergency preparedness\" activities. It states that emergency preparedness:", "means all those activities and measures designed or undertaken to prepare for or minimize the effects of a hazard upon the civilian population, to deal with the immediate emergency conditions which would be created by the hazard, and to effectuate emergency repairs to, or the emergency restoration of, vital utilities and facilities destroyed or damaged by the hazard.", "Therefore, the use of DPA authorities extends beyond shaping U.S. military preparedness and capabilities, as the authorities may also be used to enhance and support domestic preparedness, response, and recovery from hazards, terrorist attacks, and other national emergencies, among other purposes.", "In its original 1950 form, the DPA defined national defense as \"the operations and activities of the armed forces, the Atomic Energy Commission, or any other department or agency directly or indirectly and substantially concerned with the national defense... \" Over the many reauthorizations and amendments to the DPA, Congress has gradually expanded the scope of the definition of national defense, as recently as 2009. At that time, Congress included critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation and added homeland security to the definition. ", "The DPA statute also includes both a full Congressional \"Findings\" and \"Statement of Policy,\" as set forth in the \"Declaration of Policy\" section of the DPA. This section of the law gives additional guidance\u2014though not explicit legal requirements\u2014to the executive branch on why and how the DPA authorities should be used in order to provide for the national security. For example, in the \"Findings\" section, with regards to national defense and energy security, Congress stated that ", "to further assure the adequate maintenance of the domestic industrial base, to the maximum extent possible, domestic energy supplies should be augmented through reliance on renewable energy sources (including solar, geothermal, wind, and biomass sources), more efficient energy storage and distribution technologies, and energy conservation measures. ", "As another example, as guidance to the executive branch on how the defense industrial base should be encouraged to develop, in the \"Statement of Policy,\" Congress stated that ", "it is the policy of the United States that... in order to ensure productive capacity in the event of an attack on the United States, the United States Government should encourage the geographic dispersal of industrial facilities in the United States to discourage the concentration of such productive facilities within limited geographic areas that are vulnerable to attack by an enemy of the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authorities under Title I of the DPA", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Priorities and Allocations Authority", "paragraphs": ["Section 101(a) of Title I of the DPA states", "The President is authorized (1) to require that performance under contracts or orders (other than contracts of employment) which he deems necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense shall take priority over performance under any other contract or order, and, for the purpose of assuring such priority, to require acceptance and performance of such contracts or orders in preference to other contracts or orders by any person he finds to be capable of their performance, and (2) to allocate materials, services, and facilities in such manner, upon such conditions, and to such extent as he shall deem necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense.", "The priority performance authority allows the federal government to ensure the timely availability of critical materials, equipment, and services produced in the private market in the interest of national defense, and to receive those materials, equipment, and services through contracts before any other competing interest. Under the language of the DPA, a person (including corporations, as defined in statute) is required to accept prioritized contracts/orders, though regulations implementing Title I authorities provide practical exemptions to this mandate. The limited allowances for when a person is required to or may optionally reject a prioritized order can be superseded by the direction of the implementing federal department. In executing a contract under the DPA, a contractor is not liable for actions taken to comply with governing rules, regulations, and orders (e.g., prioritization requirements), including any rules, regulations, or orders later declared legally invalid. The government can also prioritize the performance of contracts between two private parties, such as a contract between a prime contractor and a subcontractor, if needed to fulfill a priority contract and promote the national defense.", "Title I also allows the President to allocate or control the general distribution of materials, services, and facilities. Allocation authority relates historically to the controlled materials programs of World War II, when the distribution of critical materials and resources had to be managed to maximize the production of goods needed in the war effort. No allocation action has been taken by the President since the end of the Cold War. ", "There are several notable restrictions to the priorities and allocation authority. For example, it cannot be used for contracts of employment. Additionally, unless authorized by a joint resolution of Congress, the authority cannot be used for wage or price controls. Private persons are also not required to assist in the production or development of chemical or biological weapons unless directly authorized by the President or a Cabinet secretary.", "Title I also contains several provisions related to domestic energy. Section 101(c) specifically authorizes the President to allocate and prioritize contracts relating to materials, equipment, and services to maximize domestic energy supplies in certain circumstances. However, Section 101(c) also restricts this use unless the President makes certain findings. Further, Section 105 of the DPA restricts the authorities from being used to ration the end-use of gasoline without the approval of Congress. Section 106 of Title I, as amended, also designates energy as a strategic and critical material. This designation enables other authorities in the DPA, especially Title III authorities discussed below, to be used for policy purposes related to energy.

The Secretary of Defense makes determinations related to military production and construction, military assistance to foreign nations, military use of civil transportation, stockpiles managed by DOD, space, and directly related activities; the Secretary of Energy makes determinations related to energy production and construction, distribution and use, and directly related activities; and the Secretary of Homeland Security makes determinations related to all other national defense programs, including civil defense and continuity of government. ", "Once a program is determined to promote the national defense, other Secretaries who have been delegated the priorities and allocation authority can use their authority for those pre-designated program purposes. E.O. 13603 provides for the delegation of the President's priorities and allocation authority to six different Cabinet Secretaries based upon their areas of expertise in different resource and material sectors. These resource areas are further defined in Section 801 of E.O. 13603. In practice, the priorities authority held by one Cabinet Secretary is frequently allowed to be used by other federal agencies, thereby allowing one agency to use another agency's authorities (e.g., DHS was allowed to use the Department of Agriculture's priorities authority related to food resources). Table A-3 in the Appendix summarizes this delegation of priorities and allocation authority.", "Each of the six federal agencies to which the President delegated priorities and allocations authority are required by law to issue and annually review regulations that \"establish standards and procedures by which the priorities and allocations authority under this section is used to promote the national defense, under both emergency and nonemergency conditions.\" Five of the six delegated the authority\u2014the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Transportation\u2014have issued those regulations. DOD has not issued its regulation as it relates to using the priorities and allocation authority for water resources, as of November 20, 2018. However, DOD has indicated that its regulation is in preliminary draft. Historically, the Department of Commerce's rule establishing the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) has been the most frequently used by the executive branch. As encouraged by statute, the DPAS regulation was used as a model to create a \"consistent and unified Federal priorities and allocations system.\" This system is referred to as the \"Federal Priorities and Allocations System\" (FPAS). Each of the regulations that make up the FPAS establish two levels of priority for issued orders notated as \"DO\" and \"DX.\" In the DPAS regulations, a \"DO\" rating is lower than a \"DX\" rating. A \"DO\" rating order for a product means that it must be prioritized over all other nonrated orders. However, if a product that has a \"DO\" rated order is needed for a different \"DX\" rated order, the \"DX\" rated order takes precedence. As a matter of practice, few select programs may receive a \"DX\" rating."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples of Use of Title I Authorities", "paragraphs": ["The authority to prioritize contracts is routinely employed by DOD. These prioritized contracts are typically issued under the Department of Commerce's (DOC's) delegated authority with respect to materials, services, and facilities, including construction materials, and under its Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulations guiding the use of this authority. DOD has reported that it \"includes a priority rating as a standard clause in virtually all eligible contracts and orders for items under DOC's resource jurisdiction. Some past examples of DOD's use of Title I priorities authority include supporting the Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System, the B-2 Bomber, the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft (i.e., Air Force One), and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles. While the priorities authority is used far less frequently by other departments and agencies, it has been used for both the prevention of terrorism and natural disaster preparedness. For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has prioritized contracts in support of the Terrorist Screening Center program and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prioritized contracts in support of the Greater New Orleans Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System program. The Federal Emergency Management Agency used the authority extensively during the 2017 disaster season, including prioritizing contracts for manufactured housing units, food and bottled water, and the restoration of electrical transmission and distribution systems in Puerto Rico. Further, U.S. allies have used the authority to assist with defense-related procurement issues. The specific Title I prioritization and allocation authorities related to domestic energy (Section 101(c) of the DPA) was used by the Department of Energy to ensure that emergency supplies of natural gas continued to flow to California utilities, helping to avoid threatened electrical blackouts in early 2001.", "Unlike the prioritization authority, the allocation authority has not been used since the Cold War. The authority does support the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, which was created initially in 1951, and is now managed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Under the CRAF program, civilian aircraft are \"allocated\" for the potential use, if required, by the DOD so that it may augment its airlift capability with civilian aircraft during a national defense related crisis. In return for their participation in the CRAF program, civilian carriers are given preference in carrying commercial peacetime cargo and passenger traffic for the DOD.

Loan guarantees and direct loans can be issued to private businesses to help them create, maintain, expedite, expand, protect, or restore production and deliveries or services essential to the national defense. A direct loan is a loan from the federal government to another government or private sector borrower that requires repayment, with or without interest. A loan guarantee allows the federal government to guarantee a loan made by a nonfederal lender to a nonfederal borrower, either by pledging to pay back all or part of the loan in cases when the borrower is unable to do so. These authorities, for instance, could be used to provide a loan, or to guarantee a loan, to a defense contractor that is responsible for the provision of critical services essential to the national defense when credit is otherwise unavailable in the private market.", "There are a number of restrictions placed on the executive branch before these loan authorities may be used in the interest of national defense. First, the budget authority for guarantees and direct loans must be specifically included in appropriations passed by Congress and enacted by the President before such loan mechanisms can be issued. Except during periods of national emergency declared by Congress or the President, the DPA statute also requires the President to determine that loan guarantees or direct loans meet a number of conditions before issuance. One of the conditions in using the loan authority is that the loan or loan guarantee is the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need. There are also a number of determination requirements for loan guarantees and direct loans that may help ensure that the loan is repaid by the recipient.

Following the consultation process, the President or presidential delegate may approve and implement the agreement or plan of action. Parties entering into such voluntary agreements are afforded a special legal defense if their actions within that agreement would otherwise violate antitrust or contract laws. Historically, the National Infrastructure Advisory Council noted that the voluntary agreement authority has been used to \"enable companies to cooperate in weapons manufacture, solving production problems and standardizing designs, specifications and processes,\" among other examples.

Use of these voluntary agreements is tracked by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who is tasked under E.O. 13603 with issuing regulations that are required by law on the \"standards and procedures by which voluntary agreements and plans of action may be developed and carried out.\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which at the time was an independent agency and tasked with these responsibilities under the DPA, issued regulations in 1981 to fulfill this requirement.

In 1988, Congress passed the \"Exon-Florio\" amendment to the DPA, granting the President authority to review certain corporate mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers, and to investigate the potential impact on national security of such actions. This amendment codified the CFIUS review process due in large part to concerns over acquisitions of U.S. defense-related firms by Japanese investors. In 2007, amid growing concerns over the proposed foreign purchase of commercial operations of six U.S. ports, Congress passed the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-49 ) to create CFIUS in statute. The CFIUS review process is a voluntary system of notification by investors. Firms largely comply with the provision, because foreign acquisitions that do not notify CFIUS remain subject indefinitely to divestment or other actions by the President. Upon receiving written notification of a proposed acquisition, merger, or takeover of a U.S. firm by a foreign investor, the CFIUS process can proceed potentially through 3 steps: (1) a 30-day maximum national security review; (2) a 45-day maximum national security investigation; and (3) a 15-day maximum presidential determination.
