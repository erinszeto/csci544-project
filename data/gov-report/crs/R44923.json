Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress substantially increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Congress began reversing those increases in light of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011, the drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan beginning in 2012, and budgetary constraints. In FY2017, Congress halted further reductions in Army and Marine Corps end-strength and provided a slight end-strength increase. End-strength for the Air Force generally declined from 2004-2015, but increased in 2016 and 2017. End-strength for the Navy declined from 2002-2012, increased in 2013, and has remained essentially stable since then.

The statutory formula stipulates that the increase in basic pay for 2018 will be 2.4% unless either (1) Congress passes a law to provide otherwise; or (2) the President specifies an alternative pay adjustment under subsection (e) of 37 U.S.C. Section 1009.

During the mid-1990s, Congress granted DOD a number of special authorities to enable the department to provide incentives for private firms to partner with DOD to improve the quality of housing available to servicemembers living on military installations. Since then, the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) has enabled DOD to rely on private sector financing, expertise, and innovation for the construction and operation of housing for both families and individual servicemembers. ", "The FY2015 NDAA allowed the Secretary of Defense to reduce BAH payments by 1% of the national average monthly housing cost. The FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act extended this authority, authorizing an additional 1% reduction per year through 2019, for a maximum reduction of 5% of the national monthly average housing cost. ", "Discussion: The amount of money paid to the companies that operate privatized housing is tied to the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rates for the individual occupying the housing. As these payments may constitute a significant source of revenue for firms owning and operating privatized military housing, reductions in BAH could lower those firms' revenues. The final bill requires the Secretary of Defense to pay an amount equal to the 2018 BAH reduction throughout 2018 to the lessors of MHPI housing, effectively offsetting the reduction for that year.

DOD concurred with the first two recommendations and partially concurred with the third, stating that \"authorizing legislation is required.\"", "In the FY2017 NDAA, Congress authorized $1.2 billion in commissary funding.", "Discussion : Section 632 of the House bill would have required DOD to submit a report regarding management practices of military commissaries and exchanges no later than 180 days after enactment of the NDAA. The report would require a cost/benefit analysis with the joint goals of reducing operating costs of military commissaries and exchanges by $2 billion over FY2018-FY2022 and not raising patron costs. Section 5602 of the Senate-passed version would have required a similar report. Neither of these provisions was adopted.

When an active duty servicemember dies, his or her survivor's payment through the SBP is usually 55% of the retired base pay that the member would otherwise have been eligible to receive. By law, surviving spouses who receive both an annuity from DOD as a beneficiary of the SBP and from the Department of Veterans Affairs' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) must have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC. Congress first authorized a payment to such surviving spouses to offset that reduction in the FY2008 NDAA. This benefit is called the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA). Monthly SSIA payments are currently $310 and are taxable. Section 646 of the FY2017 NDAA extended the payment of SSIA until May 31, 2018.", "Discussion: Section 621 of the House-passed bill would have expressed the sense of Congress that the SSIA was created as a \"stop gap\" measure to assist widowed spouses by reducing the SBP/DIC offset required by law. This section also stated that the dollar-for-dollar reduction in payment to surviving spouses should be fully repealed at the first opportunity. Section 638 of the Senate-passed version was adopted by the conferees. This provision amends 10 U.S.C.

Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 ( P.L. 108-375 ). In the same year, the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) was established as a permanent office serving as DOD's primary oversight body for all service-level programs. Sexual harassment policy and oversight is handled by DOD's Office of Diversity and Military Equal Opportunity. Between 2012 and 2017, DOD took a number of steps to implement its own strategic initiatives as well as dozens of congressionally mandated actions related to sexual assault prevention and response, victim services, reporting and accountability, and military justice. In FY2016, estimated sexual assault prevalence rates across the DOD's active-duty population were 4.3% for women and 0.6% for men. These estimated prevalence rates were slightly lower than reported prevalence rates in 2014 (4.9% and 0.9%, respectively).

The final version of the bill adds additional reporting requirements including incidents of nonconsensual distribution of private sexual images (\u00a7537) and family-member sexual assault (\u00a7538). A House provision that would have defined \"sexual coercion\" for the purpose of annual reporting was not adopted. Also not adopted was House Section 532 requiring additional reviews of SAPR programs for the Army National Guard and Reserve components, with a focus on monitoring timeliness of line-of-duty determinations and investigation processing.

Psychological trauma following a sexual assault incident has been associated with negative behavioral changes in the victim such as increased drug or alcohol use, poor work performance, or other disciplinary issues. These behaviors may affect the nature of a victim's discharge from the Armed Forces. Discharges that are not under \"honorable\" conditions may prevent servicemembers from being eligible for certain veterans' benefits. Under certain circumstances, servicemembers may appeal these decisions through Discharge Review Boards or Boards of Correction for Military Records. Section 521 of the final bill requires DOD to provide publicly available statistics on applications to these boards from those who have alleged a relationship between sex-related offenses and the nature of their discharge. In addition, Section 522 of the final bill codifies and expands existing requirements that the services establish processes through which alleged sexual assault survivors may challenge the terms of characterization of discharge or separation.", "Sexual assault prevention and response training is required by law for all new accessions within 14 duty days after initial entrance on active duty or into a duty status with a reserve component.

In a 2015 report, the GAO noted a number of areas where actions were needed to specifically address support for male victims of sexual assault. In response to this report, DOD has initiated gender-specific treatment: for example, male-only therapy groups and enhanced medical staff training on responding to and treating male victims.
